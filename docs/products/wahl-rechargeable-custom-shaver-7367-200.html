            <li>I bought the Wahl brand because I&#x27;ve had great luck with their hair clippers, plus I like that it&#x27;s made in the US.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wahl makes great products, but not this one.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Close Comfort&amp;#34; was installed and does a great job on my face.  </li>

            <li>Great product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that when the battery gives out you can just plug it in and keep on shaving.  </li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>Happy to buy a quality product made in the USA</li>
            <li>Works great, feels sturdy and no pulling.</li>
            <li>Purchased this shaver for my hubby, he loves it and it gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>it great</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a touch-up in the evening when a</li>
            <li>I guess they do make them that great anymore.</li>
            <li>Great product recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li>The shave closeness isn&#x27;t too bad....not great</li>
            <li>Im soo happy with item</li>
            <li>The Wahl company makes great products,this shaver is no exception.</li>
            <li>Great shaver.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Also spray the inside of the mesh with a silicone lube spray after cleaning to greatly extend the life of both blades and mesh.</li>
            <li>Wahl is a well known company with a great reputation.  </li>
            <li>Great shave for the money</li>
            <li>But with this shaver I was TOTALLY pleased!!</li>
            <li>This one provides the best shave of any on the market and at a better price.</li>
            <li>Great shaver at a good price.</li>
            <li>sometimes a remarkably close shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having heard good reviews of Wahl support from a friend, I called customer service and explained my issue.&lt;br /&gt;Before the phone could ring once Suzie answered the phone and pleasantly listened patiently and sympathetically.&lt;br /&gt;She took my information and arranged to send a mailer for me to return the razor for repair or replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the 3 interchangeable heads they all work as described, and the battery life is very good</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reasonable price for good shave with foil models.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>It works really good.</li>
            <li>Good thing we were planning a trip there</li>
            <li>The Panasonic is vastly superior.</li>
            <li>Although this is a good machine, the battery on it isn&#x27;t good at all, because it&#x27;s running on a cord (charger)</li>
            <li>The Shaver has a good charging life of a week.</li>
            <li>After about six shaves this shaver now gives as good a shave as my Braun.</li>
            <li>Has power and gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li>Does not give a good shave and the motor blade</li>
            <li>All in all good deal, I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li>The hand feel of the Wahl is not as good as the remington.</li>
            <li>It is as good of a screen razor as I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>without all the fuss and the mess...have a good day everyone.</li>
            <li>Braun razors and this razor is every bit as good.</li>
            <li>word in every good review is correct.</li>
            <li>Wahl has a good reputation for quality products.  </li>
            <li>It gives a nice close shave and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>used to be a good name.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Purchased the Wahl because someone wrote that it was good for head shaving.</li>
            <li>Decided that this was a good use for the Christmas gift card from the grandsons.</li>
            <li>Wahl was good about shipping the warranty replacement foils.  </li>
            <li>The shaver is generally good</li>
            <li>It isnt as good as some say.</li>
            <li>Good product, very pleased.</li>
            <li>The reviews sounded great: made in USA, inexpensive compared to competition, and results as good or better than said competition.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased at the price performance.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the machine.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with the shaver&#x27;s powerful motor and the closeness it provided.  </li>
            <li>Out the box buzz saw close shave very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li>Anyway, I decided to go electric for awhile, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>but because this shaver gives me the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver I just ordered another one without hesitation (used mostly points so..practically free).</li>
            <li>so glad I discovered it and its amazing that its made in the U.S.A. !</li>
            <li>This electric shaver is better than any of thehigh end ones you can find, you will be amazed by what all it can do!</li>
            <li>good buy, good delivery, good price, wish it had a charge light and when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. Works amazingly on the face also.</li>
            <li>GREAT RAZOR, SMOOTH SHAVE, BATTERY</li>
            <li>I have liked the performance for the price.</li>
            <li>included three foils are a nice touch and lets me try the one that works</li>
            <li>Also would be nice to allow battery replacement without disassembling the razor.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t shave as closely as he would have liked, but he looked good and felt better after using it.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>own a Norelco shaver that cost $120 five years ago and can&#x27;t hold a candle to this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a slide out trimmer at the side of the machine that is activated by pushing it upwards with your tumb, the problem is the trimmer keep closing on its own while I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li>The Wahl 7367-200 firs nicely in my hand</li>
            <li>im barber and i think this is the best machine for shave is realy strong and your face look clean like a baby</li>
            <li>Nice close shaves.</li>
            <li>lol, I immediately used the ultra clean foil though.</li>
            <li>As with the older model this shaver gives me the best shave I have every gotten from an electric shaver</li>
            <li>The package made it to me exactly when it was supposed to, I had the best experience doing business with you and plan on doing much more moving forward...</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, this is a great option for you!</li>
            <li>This shaver is very strong, but for some reason it is pulling the hear from my face, even when I used the finest screen that came with the machine.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s not the best shape to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Very fine electric razor.  </li>
            <li>use is very light to get the closeness I want.  </li>
            <li>But luckily I was delighted to noticed the Custom Shaver in the box.</li>
            <li>I can do better with my Swiss Army knife.</li>
            <li>So, if you do not shave on weekends, the rotary head is better on Monday morning.  </li>
            <li>but it sure shaves better.</li>
            <li>OK, I have been a fan of Wahl for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery was mostly charged and I tried with AC power to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Most impress with additional guards that cam with it.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>That did the job much better.</li>
            <li>and it vibrates more than I am used</li>
            <li>I have been a Wahl shaver user for many years.</li>
            <li>Better that either of my Braun shavers.</li>
            <li>This lovely beast reminds me of the time my grandfather and father used to take me to the barber as a kid.  </li>
            <li>Love this..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve owned most brands over the years.</li>
            <li>for the money that I paid ($58) Wahl can do better.</li>
            <li>and I love that you can use it while plugged in.  </li>
            <li>I get yanked hairs more often</li>
            <li>does not cut all the hairs,  leaves many whiskers untouched,</li>
            <li>no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li>The one feature I truly LOVE about this shaver is the fact that it can be used while it charges.  </li>
            <li>We select razors,based on:looks,the company and the assumption that $$$ is better.</li>
            <li>Thought the saver would be better.</li>
            <li>Excellent shave, &amp; comes with a range of foils to provide different degrees of closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li>What is it that this shaver isn&#x27;t available to buyers in California?!  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase, and would make it again.   </li>
            <li>It is a real trimmer and great product - no negatives, lasts forever</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did</li>
            <li>But this cordless shaver does a better job than most shavers I have had over the years.  </li>
            <li>maybe whal should invest some more money into the product.</li>
            <li>I took of the foil and looked, everything appears ok.</li>
            <li>OK....been thru too many electric razors to talk about in this forum.  </li>
            <li>and the Braun is better in every way.  </li>
            <li>Love the variable foil heads.  </li>
            <li>My second Wahl shaver and the best I have hade to date</li>
            <li>I am over satisfied with the item</li>
            <li>And I have a smooth shave for when I go to visit Mom in the nursing home this afternoon!</li>
            <li>Everyone has different sensitivity when it comes  to shaving,I have found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It is made in the U.S.A. and feels like top of the chart quality.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I was watching the movie, Taxi Driver.</li>
            <li>Did not want to 150 on the top end.  </li>
            <li>but they cost more.</li>
            <li>Still , If I had to do it all over again I would spend more money and get the Braun or the Norelco</li>
            <li>now hopefully it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use a straight razor as I just can&#x27;t afford the cost of transfusions!!!!  </li>
            <li>it cuts the hair that is too long for the foil screen: and that allows for a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a very satisfactory razor and a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used for many years a Remington brand, by the time it was with a cord and strong electric motors</li>
            <li>Have used a Remington for years, The Wahl has more power and lighter and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Almost 2 years old now, still in great shape.  </li>
            <li>It is light weight which is why many say it feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It is plenty solid and the battery life is incredible.</li>
            <li>This clipper is lightweight and easy to use versus the heavier senior clippers, but I do use both when grooming.</li>
            <li>(I can easily shave by using the cord).</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>You can get replacement parts easily on Amazon which is an added feature.</li>
            <li>Strong motor.  </li>
            <li>This product is pure genius!!!</li>
            <li>It is working fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>He is very pleased with this shaver and likes it much better than his old rotary one.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer, as with all non-dedicated beard trimmers, can be a bit touchy for the drive to catch but works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>and I can trim my bread and mustache with this just fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>I use the close which is more than adequate.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice to learn the best manner or pattern and shaver direction to shave ..also to disassemble as well as assemble requires a practiced touch..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, the good news is that it gives a very good shave and does it in short order thanks to the large foil dual heads.</li>
            <li>charge status light, not even an LED for on/</li>
            <li>This shaver has the loudest (read, most powerful) motor of any that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Also, despite having 3 different shave screens, it still doesn&#x27;t do a great job around my jawline and chin.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s built cheaply, IMHO.  </li>
            <li>frankly, looks cheap..</li>
            <li>Lightly gliding over the skin gives longevity and close shave.  </li>
            <li>The most powerful electric shaver I owned.</li>
            <li>Light weight and provides a comfortable, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Travel pouch also has a cheap appearance.</li>
            <li>when he shave my light beard.  </li>
            <li>It is noisy---AND noise means one of the most powerful shavers I have used for the money.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and care for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, it is important that you prepare your skin before any electric shave.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean and with multi heads you can get the shave you want</li>
            <li>I liked the product, it is fast to shave and not cut myself.</li>
            <li>A nice close shave and fast recharging...</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to charge up and clean.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to amazon for having it in stock and at an amazing price...</li>
            <li>and the customer service has been good, so far.</li>
            <li>Good enough shave, but bought the Wahl because I have the hair clippers and completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>For me, the Norelco, with somewhat better handling of longer hairs, is good enough.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Pre-charged right out of the package and was able to shave faster than my Andis foil shaver.</li>
            <li>this gives a very smooth shave,  at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li>The motor is very powerful for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Works great and the clean up is simple.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get as smooth without significant effort.  </li>
            <li>He gets a very nice clean shave and uses it daily.</li>
            <li>This shaver is very easy to use, and my shave this morning was much closer and cleaner than I was getting from my Schick disposable razors and Edge shaving cream.</li>
            <li>it works good, but the foils on the outside break way to easy.</li>
            <li>The advantage in foil razors is generally a closer shave, and this one does a good job.  </li>
            <li>The Pop-Up Trimmer makes this worth buying!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use the foils and you still get a close enough cut :o)</li>
            <li>I broke my original Wahl shaver purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li>shaves pretty close, I use it in the car mostly.  </li>
            <li>At first I was alil skeptic but after reading some of the reviews and also seeing my barber who recommended that I try Wahl, I felt alil better.</li>
            <li>I wish the charging light would turn off when it has a full charge.  </li>
            <li>I miss the original Remington Shaver which was built like a tank.</li>
            <li>Neither shaver caused any significant irritation&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives a clean shave no matter what head you use.</li>
            <li>LEAVES A SMOOTH FEEL AND QUICK, NO SHAVING CREAM</li>
            <li>price is right and its made in America!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Gives fastest good shave of any of my electrics since the Wahl 5 star that died last year.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>it is powerful and gives a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic was far superior (ergonomics, better shave, sturdier materials) and cheaper.</li>
            <li>True, true and true!&lt;br /&gt;Putting</li>
            <li>It is powerful and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li>I prefer the super close myself.  </li>
            <li>works but not so good will not shave soft hairs on neck  am very dissappointed</li>
            <li>the razor has tremendous power.</li>
            <li>The shave is super close.</li>
            <li>Modify the shaver and cover for a positive fit, a charging indicator led that shows it is charging and turns off when complete would be nice too.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty good shaver, almost the same as the one originally endorsed by a Radio Talk Show Personality, forgot his name, is it Paul Wallace?</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li>Fast and clean with two week battery life from each charge!</li>
            <li>But the Wahl shaver cut through that growth like the proverbial hot knife through butter and produced a smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li>Neither is all that good with long hairs on my neck; but the Norelco is somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This unit while incased in a plastic shell contains a powerful motor that gives a quick and close shave.</li>
            <li>The Wahl razor is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li>spare foils for more sensitive skin (I use the close shave</li>
            <li>Price was great and product seal was broken but nothing was missing and worked excellent.  </li>
            <li>Had these sent to a deployed environment after old set broke,  these work great and have had them over a year and currently going through another deployment with them!</li>
            <li>only pro I found is that it does have a nice side burn</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>The plastic screen guard rarely will stay on, so</li>
            <li>Its got a powerful motor</li>
            <li>Even better than the old Wahl razor that I had before.</li>
            <li>it was not cutting my beard at all</li>
            <li>Powerful</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Well worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>One charge provides well over a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li>Second, it doesn&#x27;t shave well with more than a light stubble.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s powerful.  </li>
            <li>and I get a weeks worth of</li>
            <li>At the age of 74, with a pretty full head of hair, I did it.</li>
            <li>The shaving head is somewhat noisy but powerful and the trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>They are right.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even charged it yet, used it 10 times right out of the box since Xmas.</li>
            <li>one that was pretty highly rated and this one came up, even included three foil heads!!!  </li>
            <li>Being able to use the razor with zero battery charge by plugging it in is a great feature, especially when you forget to plug it in for a few days.</li>
            <li>I contacted Wahl, and they are going to send me a new cord free of charge, no questions asked.  </li>
            <li>We have a teenage son needing his own setup, so this is still in use, but hubby is much happier using a Braun again.</li>
            <li>However, compared to my previous electric razor it does not do as good of a job shaving.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, it does shave well, but not as good as my previous Braun.</li>
            <li>The Wahl does give a slightly closer shave, though the Norelco is also pretty good.</li>
            <li>(that is because the hair on my face grows very fast...</li>
            <li>I noticed several others gave this only a moderately good rating for things like being rather loud or not handling more than a day&#x27;s growth.</li>
            <li>Being made in the USA and the good reviews is what initially attracted me to the razor and induced me to order it vs. just buying another Braun at the local super store.  </li>
            <li>Shaves good but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li>am not a big fan of foil type razors but the reviews were good and Wahl makes excellent hair clippers and it is also much less expensive than most Norelcos</li>
            <li>This model is larger than my previous one but much quieter and fits much more comfortably in the hand with a nice carbon-fiber look (although it&#x27;s plastic).</li>
            <li>Its a good solid device one can hold on to, it is not a a&#x27;wimpy&amp;#34; little shaver like so many of the named brand shavers sold today.</li>
            <li>i love it because it&#x27;s so small and packs a huge punch!</li>
            <li>/&gt;NICADs hold a charge pretty well compared to NIMH and lithium razors</li>
            <li>I see how the first one got returned and sold for new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>got the package yesterday, plugged it in overnight, and tried it out this morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li>After charging it for 18 hrs per the instruction manual before using it for the first time, the damned power button on the Shaver could not be switched off.</li>
            <li>This razor will simply not cut whiskers that are more than a days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have discontinued use after first use</li>
            <li>This was the first Wahl I ever used.</li>
            <li>With the Braun, I would have to use a trimmer afterwards to get many missed hairs on my neck and by the back of my jaw bone.</li>
            <li>charge lasts forever, I don&#x27;t have an exact time frame</li>
            <li>It probably would be ok if I used it for a daily shave</li>
            <li>So I came back home to Wahl and love it.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is not the the best a difficult to use.  </li>
            <li>My most recent, the Remington gave out.</li>
            <li>First of all.</li>
            <li>This one came with a extra 2 foils and I was able to use one of them.  </li>
            <li>First impressions after using it for a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As smooth as my old Braun 3 series, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first day after it arrived there was a good 3-4 days of harsh bramble to shave through.</li>
            <li>Loud feels cheap</li>
            <li>Not the most state of the art shaver out there, but it definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately never worked...</li>
            <li>We could find none at any of our local stores, so we went to Amazon-- our favorite internet shopping site.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer does the job on the first try.  </li>
            <li>My shaver just came yesterday, and I had it plugged in all night, and I just had my first shave with it this morning.</li>
            <li>This may  be more the result of my well-known lack of digital dexterity</li>
            <li>(I think the scientific term is &amp;#34;butterfingers&amp;#34;) than the packaging.</li>
            <li>My first one, the 4000, is still working, but the battery is fading away</li>
            <li>The first one he had for 4-5 years</li>
            <li>I had a Wahl moustache and sideburn trimmer that lasted for nearly 20 years, so I look forward to having this shaver for a good long time.  </li>
            <li>In fact it shaves so close that it will easily burn you if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>comparison is thus between the Norelco and the Wahl, using new Norelco and Wahl heads, well prepared skin, and the super close Wahl screen.  </li>
            <li>i cannot stress this enough: get a Wahl shaver - it&#x27;s Made in USA, its shaves very well, and the $50 price tag makes this an outstanding value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off it&#x27;s rather large and,</li>
            <li>For the price its worth it and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>many times just to get a shave equal to the one I get from my cheap personal trimmer.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much like everything about this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy a new Wahl 7367-200 and find it powerful and shaves as close as a blade razor.</li>
            <li>Powerful, easy to operate, and a very close shave - even those pesky long hairs!  </li>
            <li>It comes with three foils, sensitive, close, and super close.  </li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;The foils need to be modified to be useable for certain beard types.</li>
            <li>(My brothers would certainly suspect that to be the case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has three foil heads that really makes the difference from the other wahl rechargeable shaver that only have one foil head and performs better!!</li>
            <li>nothing fancy, no pivoting head (why I bought it), no battery meter... just a very basic foil shaver that does a fine job.</li>
            <li>but when you bring this kind of power to the sink, what&#x27;s a little noise.</li>
            <li>When my $50 Remington shaver can&#x27;t find any more hairs, I usually pull this out to help clean up.  </li>
            <li>It is messy and not as easy to clean as the Norleco.</li>
            <li>I suspect it does have a minor issue, but I think what threw me at first was that the charging light turns off when the shaver is being used while plugged in.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing, Amazon.</li>
            <li>Shaves well and fast delivery of the product</li>
            <li>so much for her sleeping in, it sounds like an electric weed</li>
            <li>The shave from this razor is very close to that of a blade.  </li>
            <li>This shaver gives me a very close shave with the medium foil.</li>
            <li>Much closer than my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 straight days.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li>cant really say much about it.</li>
            <li>This shaver will give a very close shave, almost as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li>Really zips through the whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s dependent upon how straight your beard grows.  </li>
            <li>At least for the short time I have had this razor it is clearly the best razor I have had.</li>
            <li>Really like it and the attachments.</li>
            <li>This shaver has a real close shave.</li>
            <li>the shave: very close to my skin on its &#x27;out-of-box&#x27; setting.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li>Have had reasonable luck</li>
            <li>that the shaver itself is really good,cant complain about the shave.</li>
            <li>I used the medium foil that it comes installed with, and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very Close Shave.</li>
            <li>It cuts stubble very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used straight razors, the old double edge razors, the more modern blade razors and a multitude of electric razors.  </li>
            <li>It has the ability to shave real close.  </li>
            <li>Amazon once again was very prompt on the delivery of the item.</li>
            <li>Gives a very smoothe feel.</li>
            <li>Very close shave with much gentler feeling, especially after several days growth - trimmer not as effective for me as my Norelco</li>
            <li>so far.very fast delivery</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so much quieter, lighter, and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>noticed they now have no &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; light on newer models and that the &amp;#34;flip up&amp;#34; blade on back now does NOT stay up</li>
            <li>So as long as you don&#x27;t wait too long to use it, it&#x27;s as good as it gets aside from a blade.</li>
            <li>We went back to the old Remington even used it worked better than this one.  </li>
            <li>This one is built light, cheap, flimsy, cheap light weight plastic, a little thinner than expected, and is a little slippery to hold on to, and only has rubber grip coating on the sides, which is aqueduct, nothing special about its appearance, no chrome or elegant detail, but it does serve its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Decided to pick this up due to the number of service guys using it and figured if it was good enough for those standards this might be the one to grab.</li>
            <li>Luckily all my foils and cutters that I bought for the previous shaver fit this shaver.</li>
            <li>Shaving of the pate is on the table due to too many bald spots and comb overs are out of the question.</li>
            <li>I have used other elctric razors and they work better</li>
            <li>It gives a clean close shave in short order.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the blades have dulled way too fast (makes me wonder how many more hairs I could</li>
            <li>just make sure you wash your face, dry, trim, then use lectric shave which is a pre shave for electric shavers and use the sensitive foil.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m past the 30 day return window I have to figure this out on my own.</li>
            <li>I just got this one 35 days ago after my first one developed a defective on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The shaver is pretty loud, but it works well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s performed infinitely better than my previous shavers where I used the shaver addon.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and wanting a shaver that did a better job than my previous shavers I had to give the Wahl a shot.</li>
            <li>As an old-time barber once taught me, you need to lightly wash your face with water and then dry by toweling against the grain of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I have owned and used Sunbeam, Ronson, Norelco, as well as Remington shavers, none can compare to the to this particular Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace my older Wahl shaver.  </li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of using this shaver: the skin on my face has completely changed from a rough texture: to more of a smoother texture.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s got a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li>No matter since I wanted to use only the super close</li>
            <li>Wahl runs at a high rpm.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I thought highly</li>
            <li>This electric has more &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; by far than any other</li>
            <li>but it certainly makes shaving a breeze as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li>New razor are not as relieable as older ones.</li>
            <li>Just got it in time for my next shave thanks to Amazon Prime, shaves smooth left my face like baby skin</li>
            <li>one minor problem... the clear plastic foil guard doesn&#x27;t fit and falls off.  </li>
            <li>I recently did something rare for me..</li>
            <li>Have used this similar model for over 30 years with success.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my better half because his shaver was old and just not doing what it should anymore.</li>
            <li>It was priced right and comes with different gards and the edger</li>
            <li>As always he loved the Wahl from the moment he got it, but unlike  all of our past experiences with Wahl shavers, after  just a couple of months, it appears to have developed some sort of short.  </li>
            <li>I am already shopping for a new Norelco and soon as I have one this will be given to a charity.</li>
            <li>I would invite anyone thinking of purchasing a new shaver to give this one a try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Cox</li>
            <li>I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li>I have since replaced the new Wahl with a Panasonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li>I thought it time to get a new shave.  </li>
            <li>I realized that the Norelco probably just needed new shaving blades, so I order those too.  </li>
            <li>gave me the chance to compare a new Wahl to a Norelco with new blades.  </li>
            <li>My husband LOVES Wahl products, so when it came time to buy a new shaver, it had to be Wahl.  </li>
            <li>We are hoping it&#x27;s the battery and that we can take it to get a new rechargeable batter installed.  </li>
            <li>I just then  decided, that I wanted a new look.</li>
            <li>I still like my new Wahl but not some of changes.  </li>
            <li>That may be important if you are really fussy or have very dark whiskers.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is a real trimmer that can really trim (unlike my recent Remington).</li>
            <li>Has a cheap feel when compared to the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, so the jury&#x27;s still out on the battery life, but it gives a reasonable shave for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>it is very loud.</li>
            <li>I stand corrected: It is VERY loud.  </li>
            <li>Good, recharge lasts at least a week, using it everyday for under 10 minutes, smooth with super close head, the old 4000 was only lasting about 4-5 days</li>
            <li>I will caution any new users with an average growth of whiskers to start with the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; foil and guide the shaver fairly lightly over your face.</li>
            <li>first one I got this time only lasted week and then wouldn&#x27;t charge so returned to Amazon for new one which I now have.  </li>
            <li>i have asian hair (very strong and straight), and this shaver, while it does require a razor for my usual spots for touch-up, puts the Panasonic to shame in terms of closeness.  </li>
            <li>Also, this thing&#x27;s loud!  </li>
            <li>However, if you buy this just be aware of that potential issue.  </li>
            <li>I like this Wahl better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li>The multiple heads will give you the exact shave you want.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been satisfied with them in the past, this one will do just as well.</li>
            <li>(The Norelco 7810 uses the HQ8 blades as do many other Norelco models; I cannot tell if the key factor with Norelco is the blades or the varied head</li>
            <li>The first week my face turned red after use</li>
            <li>and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever felt this way since I&#x27;ve been using Amazon exclusively for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>I recomend to all who are interested in a daily shaver or someone who is a professional barber or salon artist!</li>
            <li>My husband has used Wahl shavers for many years but no more.</li>
            <li>This one will most likely last well after I take my last breath.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lawn mower, normal, sensitive.  </li>
            <li>shaver &#x27;repaired&#x27;, but when it was &#x27;fixed&#x27; and returned, the new foil broke in one month.  </li>
            <li>So, he gave in and got a new one, wow...</li>
            <li>they are very light like foil paper, they are not a solid metal foil like my previous Braun&#x27;s, I almost broke mine when taking it out.</li>
            <li>I have a medium beard and it held a charge for nearly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I have had no issues with razor bumps so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a five because its loud and not as well constructed as a Braun or remington</li>
            <li>So far I just used it for my face n neck but will be trying it for a bald fade on the sides soon.</li>
            <li>The same could be accomplished with nail polish -</li>
            <li>Comes complete with 3 heads.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t use a regular blade, and the foils on this get really close when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They always had that loud set of clippers they used for 30 years</li>
            <li>bought this and a panasonic since I always shaved with a razor and didn&#x27;t know what I would wind up liking since some times my beard would be 4-5 or 6 days old</li>
            <li>Revision of old 4000 that I have worn out two.  </li>
            <li>Now I have sensitive skin and any nick or pull or tug of my hair or skin, then it hurts or even bleeds.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you start with sensitive and work your way up, as that will give your skin some \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for years because they were the only ones that really worked for me.  </li>
            <li>It is excessively loud .</li>
            <li>It is a replacement for a 10? year old Remington 3 screen razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comparing it to my old corded Remington from the &#x27;80s (which still works by the way).&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shaver includes a side burn trimmer and 2 additional screens, it is missing the Charging Light</li>
            <li>I could not determine if either shave was faster to get a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now getting &#x27;pinched&#x27; because the foils, each of them, are compromised near an edge where they adjoin the cap unit.  </li>
            <li>The multiple foils are a real plus.</li>
            <li>Bought for my dad to replace an old Remington.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 81 years old and have been shaving since I was 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>Although it shaves and trims very well, I rate this as only one star because of the inherent switch defect.</li>
            <li>and I kept telling him it was getting so loud.  </li>
            <li>So, if you run the battery completely dead, you better have a back up razor to finish your shave.  </li>
            <li>I have thick facial hair that grows quickly with sensitive skin not a good combination but this shaver is Great</li>
            <li>Recommend a full charge then use until battery is fully down.</li>
            <li>a little noisy but well worth it!</li>
            <li>Was a bit uneasy when I first opened the packaging as it feels like a toy in your hand (not real solid or heavy), but as used it actually does a fine job.  </li>
            <li>release is clunky, not sure and easy.</li>
            <li>Yes it is a little loud but not bad.</li>
            <li>It is light and feels a little cheaply made, but works fine, can pull out and catch a hair in a painful way if you move it too fast and press too hard so easy does it until you get used to it.</li>
            <li>Wahl in General is a great brand for all hair cutting tools.</li>
            <li>similar to the older 5 star models.</li>
            <li>It would not open the trimmer and retract it properly from the first day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a Black male, bald headed and like a smooth up close shave.</li>
            <li>Previously used an electric shaver, I expected more from the wahl.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I find that the German razors are far superior.</li>
            <li>In fact, if I had the new Norelco blades initially, I would not have thought of replacing the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Wahl also comes with three different foils - regular, close, and very close shaves.</li>
            <li>There was supposed to be a standard, a super close and a less close (for sensitive skin) screen.  </li>
            <li>First the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long and second the trimmer won&#x27;t stay extended.</li>
            <li>However, there is one major flaw to this shaver.</li>
            <li>Electric razors hardly ever lasted over one year, I finally got tired if paying more and more for blade razors and buying electric razors that didn&#x27;t lat.  </li>
            <li>The pop up trimmer doesn&#x27;t pop up easily, and it has trouble staying in place once it&#x27;s up, but it does work, just a minor</li>
            <li>I have a very heavy beard and a very angular face and neck and this razor clears it right off in short order.  </li>
            <li>But my package had only the less close and the super close screens.  </li>
            <li>little effort, but it is pretty loud in the morning.  </li>
            <li>The separate levels are nice but the first thing I noticed was the volume because my Braun/Panasonic/Norelco never had this volume and first I hated it.  </li>
            <li>The three different heads it comes with are a complete joke---none worked.</li>
            <li>I frequently use a regular razor blade to pick off straggler whiskers.  </li>
            <li>I noted earlier that the shaver is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to know when it&#x27;s actually charged.  </li>
            <li>No cleaning cartridges to buy, no counter cluttering charging/cleaning station, a choice of three included shave foils, and a travel pouch included - I&#x27;m embarrassed I spent so much on the Braun...</li>
            <li>When my old Norelco 7810 stopped giving me a close enough shave</li>
            <li>My old Braun&#x27;s foils last eighteen months.  </li>
            <li>the pop-up trimmer is super-powered so shaving &amp; trimming is fast and takes minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Pushing it into the skin causes much more wear and a poor shave.  </li>
            <li>For some reason shavers that can be used while charging are becoming very hard to find, and I don&#x27;t know why anyone would prefer not having this option.  </li>
            <li>In fact, at least once a week I found a hair on my neck that somehow escaped the holes of the Ultra Clean foil of the Wahl razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a meeting or social occasion to attend.  </li>
            <li>I bought this razor in July  because it had a trimmer on the back - however the trimmer never closed correctly -</li>
            <li>(I have owned 2 in 20 years and shave my head and goatee once a week), is small and powerful, etc.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves very close and fast - less than half the time it used to take with the Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works</li>
            <li>It does require s steady hand to do the trimming, but I got that down</li>
            <li>It feels very clumsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li>after a close look I noticed that there is a narrow band of &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34; holes in the foil below the cutter that happened to be just large enough for the whiskers to poke through.</li>

            <li> This is a great shaver.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Close Comfort&amp;#34; was installed and does a great job on my face.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that when the battery gives out you can just plug it in and keep on shaving.  </li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Happy to buy a quality product made in the USA</li>
            <li> Works great, feels sturdy and no pulling.</li>

            <li> it great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a touch-up in the evening when a</li>
            <li> I guess they do make them that great anymore.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by a friend.</li>
            <li> The shave closeness isn&#x27;t too bad....not great</li>
            <li> Im soo happy with item</li>
            <li> The Wahl company makes great products,this shaver is no exception.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Also spray the inside of the mesh with a silicone lube spray after cleaning to greatly extend the life of both blades and mesh.</li>
            <li> Wahl is a well known company with a great reputation.  </li>
            <li> Great shave for the money</li>
            <li> But with this shaver I was TOTALLY pleased!!</li>
            <li> This one provides the best shave of any on the market and at a better price.</li>
            <li> Great shaver at a good price.</li>
            <li> sometimes a remarkably close shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having heard good reviews of Wahl support from a friend, I called customer service and explained my issue.&lt;br /&gt;Before the phone could ring once Suzie answered the phone and pleasantly listened patiently and sympathetically.&lt;br /&gt;She took my information and arranged to send a mailer for me to return the razor for repair or replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the 3 interchangeable heads they all work as described, and the battery life is very good</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reasonable price for good shave with foil models.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> It works really good.</li>
            <li> Good thing we were planning a trip there</li>
            <li> The Panasonic is vastly superior.</li>
            <li> Although this is a good machine, the battery on it isn&#x27;t good at all, because it&#x27;s running on a cord (charger)</li>
            <li> The Shaver has a good charging life of a week.</li>
            <li> After about six shaves this shaver now gives as good a shave as my Braun.</li>
            <li> Has power and gives a good close shave.</li>
            <li> Does not give a good shave and the motor blade</li>
            <li> All in all good deal, I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> The hand feel of the Wahl is not as good as the remington.</li>
            <li> It is as good of a screen razor as I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> without all the fuss and the mess...have a good day everyone.</li>
            <li> Braun razors and this razor is every bit as good.</li>
            <li> word in every good review is correct.</li>
            <li> Wahl has a good reputation for quality products.  </li>
            <li> It gives a nice close shave and I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> used to be a good name.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased the Wahl because someone wrote that it was good for head shaving.</li>
            <li> Decided that this was a good use for the Christmas gift card from the grandsons.</li>
            <li> Wahl was good about shipping the warranty replacement foils.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is generally good</li>
            <li> It isnt as good as some say.</li>
            <li> Good product, very pleased.</li>
            <li> The reviews sounded great: made in USA, inexpensive compared to competition, and results as good or better than said competition.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased at the price performance.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the machine.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the shaver&#x27;s powerful motor and the closeness it provided.  </li>
            <li> Out the box buzz saw close shave very satisfied with my order</li>
            <li> Anyway, I decided to go electric for awhile, and I&#x27;m very glad I did.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> but because this shaver gives me the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver I just ordered another one without hesitation (used mostly points so..practically free).</li>
            <li> so glad I discovered it and its amazing that its made in the U.S.A. !</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is better than any of thehigh end ones you can find, you will be amazed by what all it can do!</li>
            <li> good buy, good delivery, good price, wish it had a charge light and when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. Works amazingly on the face also.</li>
            <li> GREAT RAZOR, SMOOTH SHAVE, BATTERY</li>
            <li> I have liked the performance for the price.</li>
            <li> included three foils are a nice touch and lets me try the one that works</li>
            <li> Also would be nice to allow battery replacement without disassembling the razor.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t shave as closely as he would have liked, but he looked good and felt better after using it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.</li>
            <li> own a Norelco shaver that cost $120 five years ago and can&#x27;t hold a candle to this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a slide out trimmer at the side of the machine that is activated by pushing it upwards with your tumb, the problem is the trimmer keep closing on its own while I&#x27;m using it</li>
            <li> The Wahl 7367-200 firs nicely in my hand</li>
            <li> im barber and i think this is the best machine for shave is realy strong and your face look clean like a baby</li>
            <li> Nice close shaves.</li>
            <li> lol, I immediately used the ultra clean foil though.</li>
            <li> As with the older model this shaver gives me the best shave I have every gotten from an electric shaver</li>
            <li> The package made it to me exactly when it was supposed to, I had the best experience doing business with you and plan on doing much more moving forward...</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, this is a great option for you!</li>
            <li> This shaver is very strong, but for some reason it is pulling the hear from my face, even when I used the finest screen that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s not the best shape to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Very fine electric razor.  </li>
            <li> use is very light to get the closeness I want.  </li>
            <li> But luckily I was delighted to noticed the Custom Shaver in the box.</li>
            <li> I can do better with my Swiss Army knife.</li>
            <li> So, if you do not shave on weekends, the rotary head is better on Monday morning.  </li>
            <li> but it sure shaves better.</li>
            <li> OK, I have been a fan of Wahl for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery was mostly charged and I tried with AC power to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Most impress with additional guards that cam with it.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> That did the job much better.</li>
            <li> and it vibrates more than I am used</li>
            <li> I have been a Wahl shaver user for many years.</li>
            <li> Better that either of my Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> This lovely beast reminds me of the time my grandfather and father used to take me to the barber as a kid.  </li>
            <li> Love this..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve owned most brands over the years.</li>
            <li> for the money that I paid ($58) Wahl can do better.</li>
            <li> and I love that you can use it while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> I get yanked hairs more often</li>
            <li> does not cut all the hairs,  leaves many whiskers untouched,</li>
            <li> no matter how many times you go over it.</li>
            <li> The one feature I truly LOVE about this shaver is the fact that it can be used while it charges.  </li>
            <li> We select razors,based on:looks,the company and the assumption that $$$ is better.</li>
            <li> Thought the saver would be better.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, &amp; comes with a range of foils to provide different degrees of closeness and comfort.</li>
            <li> What is it that this shaver isn&#x27;t available to buyers in California?!  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase, and would make it again.   </li>
            <li> It is a real trimmer and great product - no negatives, lasts forever</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did</li>
            <li> But this cordless shaver does a better job than most shavers I have had over the years.  </li>
            <li> maybe whal should invest some more money into the product.</li>
            <li> I took of the foil and looked, everything appears ok.</li>
            <li> OK....been thru too many electric razors to talk about in this forum.  </li>
            <li> and the Braun is better in every way.  </li>
            <li> Love the variable foil heads.  </li>
            <li> My second Wahl shaver and the best I have hade to date</li>
            <li> I am over satisfied with the item</li>
            <li> And I have a smooth shave for when I go to visit Mom in the nursing home this afternoon!</li>
            <li> Everyone has different sensitivity when it comes  to shaving,I have found it to be excellent.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It is made in the U.S.A. and feels like top of the chart quality.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I was watching the movie, Taxi Driver.</li>
            <li> Did not want to 150 on the top end.  </li>
            <li> but they cost more.</li>
            <li> Still , If I had to do it all over again I would spend more money and get the Braun or the Norelco</li>
            <li> now hopefully it&#x27;s better.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use a straight razor as I just can&#x27;t afford the cost of transfusions!!!!  </li>
            <li> it cuts the hair that is too long for the foil screen: and that allows for a perfect shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a very satisfactory razor and a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used for many years a Remington brand, by the time it was with a cord and strong electric motors</li>
            <li> Have used a Remington for years, The Wahl has more power and lighter and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Almost 2 years old now, still in great shape.  </li>
            <li> It is light weight which is why many say it feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It is plenty solid and the battery life is incredible.</li>
            <li> This clipper is lightweight and easy to use versus the heavier senior clippers, but I do use both when grooming.</li>
            <li> (I can easily shave by using the cord).</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> You can get replacement parts easily on Amazon which is an added feature.</li>
            <li> Strong motor.  </li>
            <li> This product is pure genius!!!</li>
            <li> It is working fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> He is very pleased with this shaver and likes it much better than his old rotary one.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer, as with all non-dedicated beard trimmers, can be a bit touchy for the drive to catch but works fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> and I can trim my bread and mustache with this just fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> I use the close which is more than adequate.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to learn the best manner or pattern and shaver direction to shave ..also to disassemble as well as assemble requires a practiced touch..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, the good news is that it gives a very good shave and does it in short order thanks to the large foil dual heads.</li>
            <li> charge status light, not even an LED for on/</li>
            <li> This shaver has the loudest (read, most powerful) motor of any that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also, despite having 3 different shave screens, it still doesn&#x27;t do a great job around my jawline and chin.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s built cheaply, IMHO.  </li>
            <li> frankly, looks cheap..</li>
            <li> Lightly gliding over the skin gives longevity and close shave.  </li>
            <li> The most powerful electric shaver I owned.</li>
            <li> Light weight and provides a comfortable, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Travel pouch also has a cheap appearance.</li>
            <li> when he shave my light beard.  </li>
            <li> It is noisy---AND noise means one of the most powerful shavers I have used for the money.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and care for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is important that you prepare your skin before any electric shave.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a comfortable shave</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and with multi heads you can get the shave you want</li>
            <li> I liked the product, it is fast to shave and not cut myself.</li>
            <li> A nice close shave and fast recharging...</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s easy to charge up and clean.  </li>
            <li> Thanks to amazon for having it in stock and at an amazing price...</li>
            <li> and the customer service has been good, so far.</li>
            <li> Good enough shave, but bought the Wahl because I have the hair clippers and completely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> For me, the Norelco, with somewhat better handling of longer hairs, is good enough.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Pre-charged right out of the package and was able to shave faster than my Andis foil shaver.</li>
            <li> this gives a very smooth shave,  at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> The motor is very powerful for an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Works great and the clean up is simple.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get as smooth without significant effort.  </li>
            <li> He gets a very nice clean shave and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very easy to use, and my shave this morning was much closer and cleaner than I was getting from my Schick disposable razors and Edge shaving cream.</li>
            <li> it works good, but the foils on the outside break way to easy.</li>
            <li> The advantage in foil razors is generally a closer shave, and this one does a good job.  </li>
            <li> The Pop-Up Trimmer makes this worth buying!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use the foils and you still get a close enough cut :o)</li>
            <li> I broke my original Wahl shaver purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> shaves pretty close, I use it in the car mostly.  </li>
            <li> At first I was alil skeptic but after reading some of the reviews and also seeing my barber who recommended that I try Wahl, I felt alil better.</li>
            <li> I wish the charging light would turn off when it has a full charge.  </li>
            <li> I miss the original Remington Shaver which was built like a tank.</li>
            <li> Neither shaver caused any significant irritation&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives a clean shave no matter what head you use.</li>
            <li> LEAVES A SMOOTH FEEL AND QUICK, NO SHAVING CREAM</li>
            <li> price is right and its made in America!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Gives fastest good shave of any of my electrics since the Wahl 5 star that died last year.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> it is powerful and gives a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic was far superior (ergonomics, better shave, sturdier materials) and cheaper.</li>
            <li> True, true and true!&lt;br /&gt;Putting</li>
            <li> It is powerful and shaves smoothly.</li>
            <li> I prefer the super close myself.  </li>
            <li> works but not so good will not shave soft hairs on neck  am very dissappointed</li>
            <li> the razor has tremendous power.</li>
            <li> The shave is super close.</li>
            <li> Modify the shaver and cover for a positive fit, a charging indicator led that shows it is charging and turns off when complete would be nice too.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty good shaver, almost the same as the one originally endorsed by a Radio Talk Show Personality, forgot his name, is it Paul Wallace?</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Fast and clean with two week battery life from each charge!</li>
            <li> But the Wahl shaver cut through that growth like the proverbial hot knife through butter and produced a smooth, close shave.  </li>
            <li> Neither is all that good with long hairs on my neck; but the Norelco is somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This unit while incased in a plastic shell contains a powerful motor that gives a quick and close shave.</li>
            <li> The Wahl razor is lightweight and powerful.  </li>
            <li> spare foils for more sensitive skin (I use the close shave</li>
            <li> Price was great and product seal was broken but nothing was missing and worked excellent.  </li>
            <li> Had these sent to a deployed environment after old set broke,  these work great and have had them over a year and currently going through another deployment with them!</li>
            <li> only pro I found is that it does have a nice side burn</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> The plastic screen guard rarely will stay on, so</li>
            <li> Its got a powerful motor</li>
            <li> Even better than the old Wahl razor that I had before.</li>
            <li> it was not cutting my beard at all</li>
            <li> Powerful</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Well worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> One charge provides well over a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  </li>
            <li> Second, it doesn&#x27;t shave well with more than a light stubble.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful.  </li>
            <li> and I get a weeks worth of</li>
            <li> At the age of 74, with a pretty full head of hair, I did it.</li>
            <li> The shaving head is somewhat noisy but powerful and the trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> They are right.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even charged it yet, used it 10 times right out of the box since Xmas.</li>
            <li> one that was pretty highly rated and this one came up, even included three foil heads!!!  </li>
            <li> Being able to use the razor with zero battery charge by plugging it in is a great feature, especially when you forget to plug it in for a few days.</li>
            <li> I contacted Wahl, and they are going to send me a new cord free of charge, no questions asked.  </li>
            <li> We have a teenage son needing his own setup, so this is still in use, but hubby is much happier using a Braun again.</li>
            <li> However, compared to my previous electric razor it does not do as good of a job shaving.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, it does shave well, but not as good as my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> The Wahl does give a slightly closer shave, though the Norelco is also pretty good.</li>
            <li> (that is because the hair on my face grows very fast...</li>
            <li> I noticed several others gave this only a moderately good rating for things like being rather loud or not handling more than a day&#x27;s growth.</li>
            <li> Being made in the USA and the good reviews is what initially attracted me to the razor and induced me to order it vs. just buying another Braun at the local super store.  </li>
            <li> Shaves good but is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> am not a big fan of foil type razors but the reviews were good and Wahl makes excellent hair clippers and it is also much less expensive than most Norelcos</li>
            <li> This model is larger than my previous one but much quieter and fits much more comfortably in the hand with a nice carbon-fiber look (although it&#x27;s plastic).</li>
            <li> Its a good solid device one can hold on to, it is not a a&#x27;wimpy&amp;#34; little shaver like so many of the named brand shavers sold today.</li>
            <li> i love it because it&#x27;s so small and packs a huge punch!</li>
            <li> /&gt;NICADs hold a charge pretty well compared to NIMH and lithium razors</li>
            <li> I see how the first one got returned and sold for new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> got the package yesterday, plugged it in overnight, and tried it out this morning for the first time.  </li>
            <li> After charging it for 18 hrs per the instruction manual before using it for the first time, the damned power button on the Shaver could not be switched off.</li>
            <li> This razor will simply not cut whiskers that are more than a days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have discontinued use after first use</li>
            <li> This was the first Wahl I ever used.</li>
            <li> With the Braun, I would have to use a trimmer afterwards to get many missed hairs on my neck and by the back of my jaw bone.</li>
            <li> charge lasts forever, I don&#x27;t have an exact time frame</li>
            <li> It probably would be ok if I used it for a daily shave</li>
            <li> So I came back home to Wahl and love it.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is not the the best a difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> My most recent, the Remington gave out.</li>
            <li> First of all.</li>
            <li> This one came with a extra 2 foils and I was able to use one of them.  </li>
            <li> First impressions after using it for a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As smooth as my old Braun 3 series, anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first day after it arrived there was a good 3-4 days of harsh bramble to shave through.</li>
            <li> Loud feels cheap</li>
            <li> Not the most state of the art shaver out there, but it definitely gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately never worked...</li>
            <li> We could find none at any of our local stores, so we went to Amazon-- our favorite internet shopping site.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer does the job on the first try.  </li>
            <li> My shaver just came yesterday, and I had it plugged in all night, and I just had my first shave with it this morning.</li>
            <li> This may  be more the result of my well-known lack of digital dexterity</li>
            <li> (I think the scientific term is &amp;#34;butterfingers&amp;#34;) than the packaging.</li>
            <li> My first one, the 4000, is still working, but the battery is fading away</li>
            <li> The first one he had for 4-5 years</li>
            <li> I had a Wahl moustache and sideburn trimmer that lasted for nearly 20 years, so I look forward to having this shaver for a good long time.  </li>
            <li> In fact it shaves so close that it will easily burn you if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> comparison is thus between the Norelco and the Wahl, using new Norelco and Wahl heads, well prepared skin, and the super close Wahl screen.  </li>
            <li> i cannot stress this enough: get a Wahl shaver - it&#x27;s Made in USA, its shaves very well, and the $50 price tag makes this an outstanding value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off it&#x27;s rather large and,</li>
            <li> For the price its worth it and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> many times just to get a shave equal to the one I get from my cheap personal trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much like everything about this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy a new Wahl 7367-200 and find it powerful and shaves as close as a blade razor.</li>
            <li> Powerful, easy to operate, and a very close shave - even those pesky long hairs!  </li>
            <li> It comes with three foils, sensitive, close, and super close.  </li>
            <li> to.&lt;br /&gt;The foils need to be modified to be useable for certain beard types.</li>
            <li> (My brothers would certainly suspect that to be the case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has three foil heads that really makes the difference from the other wahl rechargeable shaver that only have one foil head and performs better!!</li>
            <li> nothing fancy, no pivoting head (why I bought it), no battery meter... just a very basic foil shaver that does a fine job.</li>
            <li> but when you bring this kind of power to the sink, what&#x27;s a little noise.</li>
            <li> When my $50 Remington shaver can&#x27;t find any more hairs, I usually pull this out to help clean up.  </li>
            <li> It is messy and not as easy to clean as the Norleco.</li>
            <li> I suspect it does have a minor issue, but I think what threw me at first was that the charging light turns off when the shaver is being used while plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Shaves well and fast delivery of the product</li>
            <li> so much for her sleeping in, it sounds like an electric weed</li>
            <li> The shave from this razor is very close to that of a blade.  </li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a very close shave with the medium foil.</li>
            <li> Much closer than my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 straight days.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well.</li>
            <li> cant really say much about it.</li>
            <li> This shaver will give a very close shave, almost as close as a blade.  </li>
            <li> Really zips through the whiskers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s dependent upon how straight your beard grows.  </li>
            <li> At least for the short time I have had this razor it is clearly the best razor I have had.</li>
            <li> Really like it and the attachments.</li>
            <li> This shaver has a real close shave.</li>
            <li> the shave: very close to my skin on its &#x27;out-of-box&#x27; setting.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li> Have had reasonable luck</li>
            <li> that the shaver itself is really good,cant complain about the shave.</li>
            <li> I used the medium foil that it comes installed with, and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very Close Shave.</li>
            <li> It cuts stubble very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used straight razors, the old double edge razors, the more modern blade razors and a multitude of electric razors.  </li>
            <li> It has the ability to shave real close.  </li>
            <li> Amazon once again was very prompt on the delivery of the item.</li>
            <li> Gives a very smoothe feel.</li>
            <li> Very close shave with much gentler feeling, especially after several days growth - trimmer not as effective for me as my Norelco</li>
            <li> so far.very fast delivery</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so much quieter, lighter, and a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> noticed they now have no &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; light on newer models and that the &amp;#34;flip up&amp;#34; blade on back now does NOT stay up</li>
            <li> So as long as you don&#x27;t wait too long to use it, it&#x27;s as good as it gets aside from a blade.</li>
            <li> We went back to the old Remington even used it worked better than this one.  </li>
            <li> This one is built light, cheap, flimsy, cheap light weight plastic, a little thinner than expected, and is a little slippery to hold on to, and only has rubber grip coating on the sides, which is aqueduct, nothing special about its appearance, no chrome or elegant detail, but it does serve its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Decided to pick this up due to the number of service guys using it and figured if it was good enough for those standards this might be the one to grab.</li>
            <li> Luckily all my foils and cutters that I bought for the previous shaver fit this shaver.</li>
            <li> Shaving of the pate is on the table due to too many bald spots and comb overs are out of the question.</li>
            <li> I have used other elctric razors and they work better</li>
            <li> It gives a clean close shave in short order.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the blades have dulled way too fast (makes me wonder how many more hairs I could</li>
            <li> just make sure you wash your face, dry, trim, then use lectric shave which is a pre shave for electric shavers and use the sensitive foil.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m past the 30 day return window I have to figure this out on my own.</li>
            <li> I just got this one 35 days ago after my first one developed a defective on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty loud, but it works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s performed infinitely better than my previous shavers where I used the shaver addon.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and wanting a shaver that did a better job than my previous shavers I had to give the Wahl a shot.</li>
            <li> As an old-time barber once taught me, you need to lightly wash your face with water and then dry by toweling against the grain of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I have owned and used Sunbeam, Ronson, Norelco, as well as Remington shavers, none can compare to the to this particular Wahl shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my older Wahl shaver.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this shaver: the skin on my face has completely changed from a rough texture: to more of a smoother texture.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s got a decent trimmer.  </li>
            <li> No matter since I wanted to use only the super close</li>
            <li> Wahl runs at a high rpm.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I thought highly</li>
            <li> This electric has more &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; by far than any other</li>
            <li> but it certainly makes shaving a breeze as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> New razor are not as relieable as older ones.</li>
            <li> Just got it in time for my next shave thanks to Amazon Prime, shaves smooth left my face like baby skin</li>
            <li> one minor problem... the clear plastic foil guard doesn&#x27;t fit and falls off.  </li>
            <li> I recently did something rare for me..</li>
            <li> Have used this similar model for over 30 years with success.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my better half because his shaver was old and just not doing what it should anymore.</li>
            <li> It was priced right and comes with different gards and the edger</li>
            <li> As always he loved the Wahl from the moment he got it, but unlike  all of our past experiences with Wahl shavers, after  just a couple of months, it appears to have developed some sort of short.  </li>
            <li> I am already shopping for a new Norelco and soon as I have one this will be given to a charity.</li>
            <li> I would invite anyone thinking of purchasing a new shaver to give this one a try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Cox</li>
            <li> I purchased a new one.</li>
            <li> I have since replaced the new Wahl with a Panasonic ES8103S.</li>
            <li> I thought it time to get a new shave.  </li>
            <li> I realized that the Norelco probably just needed new shaving blades, so I order those too.  </li>
            <li> gave me the chance to compare a new Wahl to a Norelco with new blades.  </li>
            <li> My husband LOVES Wahl products, so when it came time to buy a new shaver, it had to be Wahl.  </li>
            <li> We are hoping it&#x27;s the battery and that we can take it to get a new rechargeable batter installed.  </li>
            <li> I just then  decided, that I wanted a new look.</li>
            <li> I still like my new Wahl but not some of changes.  </li>
            <li> That may be important if you are really fussy or have very dark whiskers.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a real trimmer that can really trim (unlike my recent Remington).</li>
            <li> Has a cheap feel when compared to the more expensive models.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, so the jury&#x27;s still out on the battery life, but it gives a reasonable shave for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> it is very loud.</li>
            <li> I stand corrected: It is VERY loud.  </li>
            <li> Good, recharge lasts at least a week, using it everyday for under 10 minutes, smooth with super close head, the old 4000 was only lasting about 4-5 days</li>
            <li> I will caution any new users with an average growth of whiskers to start with the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; foil and guide the shaver fairly lightly over your face.</li>
            <li> first one I got this time only lasted week and then wouldn&#x27;t charge so returned to Amazon for new one which I now have.  </li>
            <li> i have asian hair (very strong and straight), and this shaver, while it does require a razor for my usual spots for touch-up, puts the Panasonic to shame in terms of closeness.  </li>
            <li> Also, this thing&#x27;s loud!  </li>
            <li> However, if you buy this just be aware of that potential issue.  </li>
            <li> I like this Wahl better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> The multiple heads will give you the exact shave you want.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been satisfied with them in the past, this one will do just as well.</li>
            <li> (The Norelco 7810 uses the HQ8 blades as do many other Norelco models; I cannot tell if the key factor with Norelco is the blades or the varied head</li>
            <li> The first week my face turned red after use</li>
            <li> and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever felt this way since I&#x27;ve been using Amazon exclusively for the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> I recomend to all who are interested in a daily shaver or someone who is a professional barber or salon artist!</li>
            <li> My husband has used Wahl shavers for many years but no more.</li>
            <li> This one will most likely last well after I take my last breath.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lawn mower, normal, sensitive.  </li>
            <li> shaver &#x27;repaired&#x27;, but when it was &#x27;fixed&#x27; and returned, the new foil broke in one month.  </li>
            <li> So, he gave in and got a new one, wow...</li>
            <li> they are very light like foil paper, they are not a solid metal foil like my previous Braun&#x27;s, I almost broke mine when taking it out.</li>
            <li> I have a medium beard and it held a charge for nearly 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I have had no issues with razor bumps so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a five because its loud and not as well constructed as a Braun or remington</li>
            <li> So far I just used it for my face n neck but will be trying it for a bald fade on the sides soon.</li>
            <li> The same could be accomplished with nail polish -</li>
            <li> Comes complete with 3 heads.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t use a regular blade, and the foils on this get really close when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They always had that loud set of clippers they used for 30 years</li>
            <li> bought this and a panasonic since I always shaved with a razor and didn&#x27;t know what I would wind up liking since some times my beard would be 4-5 or 6 days old</li>
            <li> Revision of old 4000 that I have worn out two.  </li>
            <li> Now I have sensitive skin and any nick or pull or tug of my hair or skin, then it hurts or even bleeds.</li>
            <li> I recommend that you start with sensitive and work your way up, as that will give your skin some \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for years because they were the only ones that really worked for me.  </li>
            <li> It is excessively loud .</li>
            <li> It is a replacement for a 10? year old Remington 3 screen razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m comparing it to my old corded Remington from the &#x27;80s (which still works by the way).&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shaver includes a side burn trimmer and 2 additional screens, it is missing the Charging Light</li>
            <li> I could not determine if either shave was faster to get a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> now getting &#x27;pinched&#x27; because the foils, each of them, are compromised near an edge where they adjoin the cap unit.  </li>
            <li> The multiple foils are a real plus.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad to replace an old Remington.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 81 years old and have been shaving since I was 12 years old.  </li>
            <li> Although it shaves and trims very well, I rate this as only one star because of the inherent switch defect.</li>
            <li> and I kept telling him it was getting so loud.  </li>
            <li> So, if you run the battery completely dead, you better have a back up razor to finish your shave.  </li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair that grows quickly with sensitive skin not a good combination but this shaver is Great</li>
            <li> Recommend a full charge then use until battery is fully down.</li>
            <li> a little noisy but well worth it!</li>
            <li> Was a bit uneasy when I first opened the packaging as it feels like a toy in your hand (not real solid or heavy), but as used it actually does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> release is clunky, not sure and easy.</li>
            <li> Yes it is a little loud but not bad.</li>
            <li> It is light and feels a little cheaply made, but works fine, can pull out and catch a hair in a painful way if you move it too fast and press too hard so easy does it until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Wahl in General is a great brand for all hair cutting tools.</li>
            <li> similar to the older 5 star models.</li>
            <li> It would not open the trimmer and retract it properly from the first day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Black male, bald headed and like a smooth up close shave.</li>
            <li> Previously used an electric shaver, I expected more from the wahl.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I find that the German razors are far superior.</li>
            <li> In fact, if I had the new Norelco blades initially, I would not have thought of replacing the shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Wahl also comes with three different foils - regular, close, and very close shaves.</li>
            <li> There was supposed to be a standard, a super close and a less close (for sensitive skin) screen.  </li>
            <li> First the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long and second the trimmer won&#x27;t stay extended.</li>
            <li> However, there is one major flaw to this shaver.</li>
            <li> Electric razors hardly ever lasted over one year, I finally got tired if paying more and more for blade razors and buying electric razors that didn&#x27;t lat.  </li>
            <li> The pop up trimmer doesn&#x27;t pop up easily, and it has trouble staying in place once it&#x27;s up, but it does work, just a minor</li>
            <li> I have a very heavy beard and a very angular face and neck and this razor clears it right off in short order.  </li>
            <li> But my package had only the less close and the super close screens.  </li>
            <li> little effort, but it is pretty loud in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The separate levels are nice but the first thing I noticed was the volume because my Braun/Panasonic/Norelco never had this volume and first I hated it.  </li>
            <li> The three different heads it comes with are a complete joke---none worked.</li>
            <li> I frequently use a regular razor blade to pick off straggler whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I noted earlier that the shaver is a bit loud.  </li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to know when it&#x27;s actually charged.  </li>
            <li> No cleaning cartridges to buy, no counter cluttering charging/cleaning station, a choice of three included shave foils, and a travel pouch included - I&#x27;m embarrassed I spent so much on the Braun...</li>
            <li> When my old Norelco 7810 stopped giving me a close enough shave</li>
            <li> My old Braun&#x27;s foils last eighteen months.  </li>
            <li> the pop-up trimmer is super-powered so shaving &amp; trimming is fast and takes minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Pushing it into the skin causes much more wear and a poor shave.  </li>
            <li> For some reason shavers that can be used while charging are becoming very hard to find, and I don&#x27;t know why anyone would prefer not having this option.  </li>
            <li> In fact, at least once a week I found a hair on my neck that somehow escaped the holes of the Ultra Clean foil of the Wahl razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a meeting or social occasion to attend.  </li>
            <li> I bought this razor in July  because it had a trimmer on the back - however the trimmer never closed correctly -</li>
            <li> (I have owned 2 in 20 years and shave my head and goatee once a week), is small and powerful, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves very close and fast - less than half the time it used to take with the Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works</li>
            <li> It does require s steady hand to do the trimming, but I got that down</li>
            <li> It feels very clumsy and cheap.  </li>
            <li> after a close look I noticed that there is a narrow band of &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34; holes in the foil below the cutter that happened to be just large enough for the whiskers to poke through.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive shaver that shaves as well as my Braun shaver at half the price for a new foil.</li>
            <li> My issue is that they just don&#x27;t last that long.  </li>
            <li> It has a two year guarantee, but even if it doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> LAST LONG TIME,  </li>
            <li> --I&#x27;ve even had them replaced and the replacement battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> the charge seems to last a very long time</li>
            <li> I was forced to use an electric shaver because of a medical problem and being a great fan of a razor shave, I was very skeptical of an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda loose and slips back halfway.  </li>
            <li> The battery will only hold a charge for a few days and now wears down fast.</li>
            <li> a little loud.</li>
            <li> Everything fits so tightly in the packaging that I had difficulty getting the extra foils out of the plastic they were wedged into, and somehow in the process of removing them from the plastic liner, I punctured my left index finger on the edge of the left foil.</li>
            <li> the cord may still have a minor issue.  </li>
            <li> Said he should have bought this product long ago.</li>
            <li> I hope they don&#x27;t keep me on the phone for too long.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge quite long.</li>
            <li> I think my Braun is going for a long deserved rest.</li>
            <li> The sensitive setting was not strong to help style my stubble</li>
            <li> It is extremely well constructed, has plenty of power, and is built to last.</li>
            <li> Then I realized how well it doing as the other shavers usually left a need to grab a disposable and take care of &#x27;what was missed&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Finally has replaceable battery which is what stopped the other two.  </li>
            <li> All in all i would buy it again, but hope it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> but I go very long periods of time before charging again.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> about 6 shaves on a single charge.</li>
            <li> The zipper on the carrying case spoiled in no time flat, but other than</li>
            <li> This item clearly had some kind of defect, and this is a terrible policy for an item that is supposed to last YEARS, not months.  </li>
            <li> You push up the trimmer and then put it to your face and it automatically is pushed back down.</li>
            <li> Quality of Wahl shavers has gone down in recent years.</li>
            <li> just kept sliding back down.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer on the Wahl doesn&#x27;t quite close all the way; however it also isn&#x27;t designed to pop up like the Remington, which had to ultimately be superglued down.</li>
            <li> I think shaving time may be slightly faster than with my Norelcos, but maybe that is psychological because the Wahl is louder.  </li>
            <li> After shaving for several years with razors, I decided to start looking for something else that would be less of a headache in terms of shaving.</li>
            <li> Had to return 2 of them for different reasons after less than a week each.  </li>
            <li> did receive the new charger cord, but now I&#x27;m questioning if there is anything wrong with the old one.  </li>
            <li> I shave every day and I will notice after a couple of days whiskers that got missed, and, since they have become a little longer the only way to shave them with this thing is to use the side burn trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not much missed with this Wahl trimmer.</li>
            <li> Trimmer will not stay closed.</li>
            <li> I have to hold the trimmer closed to use the shaver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe it would survive a drop to a tile floor (who here hasn&#x27;t dropped their shaver), but I&#x27;ll be careful.  </li>
            <li> My suggestion to Wahl is to remove this feature to save a few bucks on total price of the unit.</li>
            <li> Very close shave but incredibly poorly built.  </li>
            <li> I just have to be careful when storing the unit so the foil wont get damaged.</li>
            <li> Came back and it was still dead.</li>
            <li> Have spent the bucks....</li>
            <li> Well after only a few months I&#x27;ve already gone thru all of those foils...</li>
            <li> I like this product and it works as expected......</li>
            <li> His neck was too sensitive to shave with a regular razor and a beard was irritating to his wound.  </li>
            <li> i used the close shave head, on 3 or 4 day growth, it took it down like a lawn mower, only had to use the trimmer on a few spots.</li>
            <li> Maybe it might be a bit loud, but with the power this thing has it is not surprising.</li>
            <li> The Shaver does offer a close shave, I agree with other reviews in that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small enough to travel with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Oh, there is one other thing  </li>
            <li> One other note,  </li>
            <li> It took a 20 min shave using one of the other brands to about 5 min.</li>
            <li> reading all the recommendations on this one and weighing them against other shavers, I chose this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would advise anyone looking at this shaver to  not buy if there&#x27;s even a small chance of this type of defect happening in the future.</li>
            <li> It shaves smoother than other shavers I have owned.</li>
            <li> I was dubious when I received this shaver due to its unrefined appearance.  </li>
            <li> Tip: be very careful when pulling out the foils from the packaging</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t contacted Wahl yet on this razor or on my last real Wahl disappointment, a 6 in one with the rotary attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> one positively fails as a razor for me where this one is actually suiting me well so far</li>
            <li> My other N-rotary was weak and seemed to take a long time to get a basic shave.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic foil protector is very poorly designed and won&#x27;t clip on properly, so it keeps popping off.  </li>
            <li> next day July 30th, my new Wahl Custom Shaver is unable to performed, its completely DEAD and switch off/on all in vain.</li>
            <li> My hand is a little numb after holding it while shaving but not bad.</li>
            <li> I had bought him one at a local store, and it hardly did a thing.  </li>
            <li> Burnt my face up pretty bad coming from a razor, so I switched back instead of retraining my face to that burn.</li>
            <li> which of course is not fun.</li>
            <li> I love Wahl shavers and I hate Wahl shavers.  </li>
            <li> After 5 months of regular use, I am forced to change my view on this.</li>
            <li> That might not sound like a big thing, but there&#x27;s nothing worse than forgetting to plug in a shaver and have it run down on you mid shave.  </li>
            <li> then it was slowing down...</li>
            <li> I decided to get this shaver when my Remington broke down.</li>
            <li> Otherwise delivered to my home for less than $60 is a deal on a razor that competes against others twice the price.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as previous models.</li>
            <li> stopped working in less than six months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Wahl shaver&#x27;s foils break in less than one month over and over.  </li>
            <li> I am out half the purchase price because of paying for shipping twice.</li>
            <li> It cut my shaving time in half.  </li>
            <li> Cut whiskers never fell out of the Norelco and made a mess on the sink or counter like they do with</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t shaved in several days because I&#x27;d been developing a rash on my neck, and I thought the shaving cream and blade might have something to do with the rash or, at least, was irritating it further.</li>
            <li> But otherwise, it is pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> To replace the Buaun cutting head would be at least 3 to 4 times as much, as replacing the same part on the Wahl.</li>
            <li> these are not a good product total waste of money</li>
            <li> Irritated the skin not a clean shave. ..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than blood loss caused by the packaging, I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about this razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit out of alignment, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the way it shaves.  </li>
            <li> little on the noisy side</li>
            <li> It is a little noisy but he recommends this shaver.</li>
            <li> and it did take a little getting used to, but once again here I am dealing w/replacement foils/cutters soon I&#x27;d imagine and thus continuing my &#x27;indebtedness&#x27; to the manufacturer of whatever shaver I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> Razor a little flimsy and inexpensive feeling, but works well.</li>
            <li> Not very good , a little rough , not a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Cannot be used plugged in with dead battery, it needs to recharge.</li>
            <li> Speaking of charging--there is no light indicating if it is charging or is fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Just remember to oil the blades every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I had not realized that until a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few Wahl shavers over the years and this one is no louder than the rest.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to any man who has a heavy beard like me.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I woke up and it was dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a razor before and ended up w/ quite a few nicks.</li>
            <li> this last time I basically was just tired of replacing the #</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend and not cheap.</li>
            <li> A dead tie.</li>
            <li> Was not a comfortable or close shave.  </li>
            <li> The screen cover doesn&#x27;t latch properly and comes loose from one end and gets stuck or caught in the side burn trimmer, no big deal, just a little annoying each morning.</li>
            <li> I covered this area on both the front and back foil with a thin strip of scotch tape and no more snagging.</li>
            <li> tight shave --made in USA!</li>
            <li> He has black hair with a thick beard that goes every direction.  </li>
            <li> My only gripe with this shaver is that the trimmer is totally worthless and still will not close completely.</li>
            <li> Why should anyone waste their hard earned money on this non-working shaver?.</li>
            <li> Rotaries usually have slots that accommodate longer whiskers.  </li>
            <li> He usually uses a lower-end Braun, but I wanted to try this.  </li>
            <li> just cover the small holes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> When they started  making it with the batteries and small electric motors</li>
            <li> This one is not stylish and is not  $$$</li>
            <li> For the past 2 days the shaver will not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I tried with 3 different ways to charge it (always using a multimeter before connecting to the Shaver) and it never got changed, so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> They have become difficult to find in local department/drug stores.  </li>
            <li> You can hear the shaver cutting the whiskers when no more cutting sound your done.</li>
            <li> The trimmer engages with a very stiff slider that takes two hands to operate.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s the new bad news.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> He says it can be hard to get the whiskers in the foil to be cut.  </li>
            <li> When fully charged, - it can handle at least two weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li> Run at least two cycles like this</li>
            <li> It shaved my head so close, that I tried it on my thick beard.</li>
            <li> I have a mean 5-O-Clock shadow)</li>
            <li> If you press too hard you may get some serious razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my other one fails.</li>
            <li> I was fooled by all these reviews, and spent alot of money to get this total garbage thin plastic crap.</li>
            <li> I tapped it a little with the foil off, and it started running very weakly.</li>
            <li> My whiskers are thick and tough.  </li>
            <li> I tried all three of the included foils and they all did the same thing and shaving was painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mediocre shaver with POOR ergonomics - it does NOT fit well with my hands.</li>
            <li> I waited forever for this thing and when I finally got it, was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I mean it bled and bled until my blood was all over the place!</li>
            <li> But he was never happy with the shave.  </li>
            <li> is annoying and should not be necessary</li>
            <li> Not happy with this item.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how close this shaver can cut: without irritating the skin on my face and neck area.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say my beard is especially heavy, but it is . . .</li>
            <li> The new version is terrible in every way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While very disappointed in quality control, Wahl customer service looks to be tops so far.</li>
            <li> If a machine doesn&#x27;t make noise then that means the electric motor is very weak and will not work up to expectation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First one of these I got was broken in the box!</li>
            <li> /&gt;FOLLOWUP:&lt;br /&gt;After a couple months my replacement failed mid-shave this morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t skip a day, because it will pull a bit and the shave becomes uncomfortable</li>
            <li> Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as my &amp;#34;away&amp;#34; shaver as I have an expensive self-cleaning Braun shaver at home.</li>
            <li> Sorry Wahl</li>
            <li> I am one of those unfortunate men who has a five o&#x27;clock shadow at 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning.  </li>
            <li> this weird happen before.</li>
            <li> (Sorry Norelco, you&#x27;re on the bench)</li>
            <li> The on/off is a difficult to operate slide switch.  </li>
            <li> What is really disappointing is that they do not recommend shaving while charging.  </li>
            <li> even changing the heads, etc, just wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cutting it&#x27;</li>
            <li> Man it bled like when Dan Ackroyd imitated Julie Child cutting up a chicken.</li>
            <li> one u won&#x27;t be mad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;only con: it vibrates like mad in the hand.</li>
            <li> The head is nearly impossible to remove for cleaning and it is just a bad product all around.</li>
            <li> bad we had to order it in another state and pick it up there over Christmas.</li>
            <li> I hope it was just a bad batch or my misfortune</li>
            <li> Buy it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a Wahl product and make in USA, but i&#x27;ve been disappointed in it&#x27;s performance.</li>
            <li> does not stay up and this is very awkward to operate.</li>
            <li> The popup trimmer is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING.</li>
            <li> This razor is crap.</li>
            <li> Worthless ...</li>
            <li> Really hate ordering things like this online...</li>
            <li> Hence, I am very disappointed and again disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> He tried the 3 floating head electric razors and he hated them, but that was years ago, don&#x27;t know how they are now.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer very badly</li>
            <li> He was very disappointed</li>
            <li> Very unhappy!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Used it once and started looking for something else---pure garbage from China. I was fooled by all these reviews, and spent alot of money to get this total garbage thin plastic crap. Yes, it vibrates. As for shaving, forget about it! P.S. The three different heads it comes with are a complete joke---none worked. I can do better with my Swiss Army knife. Back to Norelco,and this ain&#x27;t put here by a phony customer. Shame on Wahl.....</li>
            <li> Great Performance at a Bargain Price! I have had Braun, Norelco, Remington etc. This shaver with 3 foils is great it gives you options the others don&#x27;t. I am very pleased at the price performance. Areas to  improve include the plastic snap on cover to protect the foil is like an afterthought. Modify the shaver and cover for a positive fit, a charging indicator led that shows it is charging and turns off when complete would be nice too. Otherwise delivered to my home for less than $60 is a deal on a razor that competes against others twice the price. Buy it you wont be disappointed. 2 year update I have liked the performance for the price. The battery will only hold a charge for a few days and now wears down fast. Cannot be used plugged in with dead battery, it needs to recharge. I have followed the battery rules to avoid memory issues etc. I may dismantle and try to replace I bet it has AA rechargables.</li>
            <li> I used only 2 Norelco razors in 35 years before purchasing this Wahl.  The Wahl quit in the middle of a shave after only 11 months.  I ordered another Norelco.  Norelco&#x27;s rotary heads are more durable if you are considering a gift for a careless teenager or if you travel a lot, because a foil razor will not work if you dent the foil.  The challenge with electric razors is getting your whiskers in the slots or holes.  Rotaries usually have slots that accommodate longer whiskers.  So, if you do not shave on weekends, the rotary head is better on Monday morning.  In fact, at least once a week I found a hair on my neck that somehow escaped the holes of the Ultra Clean foil of the Wahl razor.  Not a big deal--just trim it off with the pop-up trimmer and shave over it again, but this never happened with my Norelcos.  The advantage in foil razors is generally a closer shave, and this one does a good job.  I think shaving time may be slightly faster than with my Norelcos, but maybe that is psychological because the Wahl is louder.  The Wahl razor is lightweight and powerful.  I have a medium beard and it held a charge for nearly 2 weeks.  Speaking of charging--there is no light indicating if it is charging or is fully charged.  What is really disappointing is that they do not recommend shaving while charging.  So, if you run the battery completely dead, you better have a back up razor to finish your shave.  I like buying American made, but not if I have to sacrifice quality.</li>
            <li> This shaver is very strong, but for some reason it is pulling the hear from my face, even when I used the finest screen that came with the machine.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides the type of shave I was looking for. I&#x27;m able to get a close and smooth shave. I just with the added clipper on the back was separate, because it sometimes folds back in when in use.</li>
            <li> I love Wahl shavers and I hate Wahl shavers.  Nothing shaves as close--I&#x27;ve tried Remington, Panasonic, Norelco--I alway come back to Wahl.  My issue is that they just don&#x27;t last that long.  Eventually the battery dies--I&#x27;ve even had them replaced and the replacement battery doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I think this is my 4th..maybe 5th over the years.  Eventually they just quit working...but the quality of the shave can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of shaver for thirty years</li>
            <li> I have used Wahl razors for years and this is one of the best ones ever!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband October 2013.  He usually uses a lower-end Braun, but I wanted to try this.  He has black hair with a thick beard that goes every direction.  The Wahl holds a charge well, so it didn&#x27;t matter that he travels overseas.  But he was never happy with the shave.  It took him a lot longer to shave, and he still had rogue whiskers.  He says it can be hard to get the whiskers in the foil to be cut.  Also, this thing&#x27;s loud!  He always had to shut the bathroom door as to not wake up the kids in the morning.  We have a teenage son needing his own setup, so this is still in use, but hubby is much happier using a Braun again.</li>
            <li> FOR A ELECTRIC  SHAVER, IT GIVES A EXCELLENCE CLOSE SHAVE.</li>
            <li> This shaver stopped working 5 weeks after receiving it.  5 WEEKS!!  Of course, Amazon&#x27;s return policy on the item is 30 days, so now I&#x27;m stuck with a $50 paper weight.  This item clearly had some kind of defect, and this is a terrible policy for an item that is supposed to last YEARS, not months.  Thanks for nothing, Amazon.</li>
            <li> The Pop-Up Trimmer makes this worth buying! I use this feature alone to maintain my bald haircut. I have had no issues with razor bumps so far. I use a product called Tend Skin (www.tendskin.com) that I have been using for years if I see any razor bumps or should I develop an ingrown hair. This clipper is lightweight and easy to use versus the heavier senior clippers, but I do use both when grooming. Great buy that I would recommend to anyone who has to cut their hair every two-days! You don&#x27;t have to use the foils and you still get a close enough cut :o)</li>
            <li> I get a closer shave with this razor than with a disposable. It does not save time.</li>
            <li> Great product! I would reccomensd it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Increased my ingrown hairs, I am sticking to detailer clippers.</li>
            <li> best shave I ever got from an electric razor and I&#x27;ve had them all. I didn&#x27;t give it a five because its loud and not as well constructed as a Braun or remington but it sure shaves better. Also it comes with extra foils unlike the others.</li>
            <li> OK, I have been a fan of Wahl for two reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price for good shave with foil models.&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First one of these I got was broken in the box! foil release button was mashed in and wouldn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did an exchange, which was rightfully no charge, but took damn long.&lt;br /&gt;This one leaves me with mixed feelings:&lt;br /&gt;Plusses:&lt;br /&gt;Nice ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;NICADs hold a charge pretty well compared to NIMH and lithium razors I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;Gives fastest good shave of any of my electrics since the Wahl 5 star that died last year.&lt;br /&gt;Two spare foils for more sensitive skin (I use the close shave one).&lt;br /&gt;3 year warranty&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;No charge status light, not even an LED for on/off.&lt;br /&gt;foil release is clunky, not sure and easy. I see how the first one got returned and sold for new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t contacted Wahl yet on this razor or on my last real Wahl disappointment, a 6 in one with the rotary attachment.&lt;br /&gt;That one positively fails as a razor for me where this one is actually suiting me well so far and I&#x27;m counting on the 3 year warranty getting me satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOWUP:&lt;br /&gt;After a couple months my replacement failed mid-shave this morning. Battery was mostly charged and I tried with AC power to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;It actually sounded like my bump-free model did after 3 years of use came to an end, then died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the new bad news.&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Having heard good reviews of Wahl support from a friend, I called customer service and explained my issue.&lt;br /&gt;Before the phone could ring once Suzie answered the phone and pleasantly listened patiently and sympathetically.&lt;br /&gt;She took my information and arranged to send a mailer for me to return the razor for repair or replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I will weigh in later with results.&lt;br /&gt;While very disappointed in quality control, Wahl customer service looks to be tops so far.</li>
            <li> Just a great shaver!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric razors on &amp; off for over 30 years (ouch - time flies!).  Remington, Braun, Norelco, Panasonic - have tried them all at one time or another.  I bought the Wahl brand because I&#x27;ve had great luck with their hair clippers, plus I like that it&#x27;s made in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the package yesterday, plugged it in overnight, and tried it out this morning for the first time.  It&#x27;s the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor - feels like I used a blade razor.  And that was with the default medium foil, not the close foil!</li>
            <li> Brought these for my husband in may and in june they broke of couse the return policy is 30 day these are not a good product total waste of money</li>
            <li> Inexpensive shaver that shaves as well as my Braun shaver at half the price for a new foil.</li>
            <li> The Shaver does offer a close shave, I agree with other reviews in that. However, there is one major flaw to this shaver. The popup trimmer is INCREDIBLY ANNOYING. You push up the trimmer and then put it to your face and it automatically is pushed back down. In order to actually use this popup trimmer you have to hold the popup trimmer continuously in order to keep it popped out.</li>
            <li> Price was great and product seal was broken but nothing was missing and worked excellent.  Most impress with additional guards that cam with it.</li>
            <li> It works really good. But the charger is Made In China.</li>
            <li> Today the 29th of July 2015, The UPS delivery Man left my parcel on my door step, which could have been stolen by anyone. But luckily I was delighted to noticed the Custom Shaver in the box. After charging it for 18 hrs per the instruction manual before using it for the first time, the damned power button on the Shaver could not be switched off. Hence, I am very disappointed and again disappointed in this product. What a shame!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day July 30th, my new Wahl Custom Shaver is unable to performed, its completely DEAD and switch off/on all in vain. Why should anyone waste their hard earned money on this non-working shaver?. Please I need my $88.93 back or send me a shaver that works.</li>
            <li> Shaves well and fast delivery of the product</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as previous models. Quality of Wahl shavers has gone down in recent years.</li>
            <li> Had these sent to a deployed environment after old set broke,  these work great and have had them over a year and currently going through another deployment with them!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a Norelco that died after about 5 or 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a big fan of foil type razors but the reviews were good and Wahl makes excellent hair clippers and it is also much less expensive than most Norelcos so I thought I would give it a try to see if perhaps it was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake! This razor does not come close (no pun intended) to the Norelco shave. I have had this razor for well over a month now and here is my take on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. it is very loud. When I am in our master bathroom with the door closed early in the morning before my wife is awake and hit the switch...so much for her sleeping in, it sounds like an electric weed whacker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not do give a very good shave. it misses a lot of whiskers. I shave every day and I will notice after a couple of days whiskers that got missed, and, since they have become a little longer the only way to shave them with this thing is to use the side burn trimmer. This razor will simply not cut whiskers that are more than a days growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It is messy and not as easy to clean as the Norleco. Cut whiskers never fell out of the Norelco and made a mess on the sink or counter like they do with this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. If the battery dies and you need to plug it in to finish shaving, the cord does not stay in place on the razor, it keeps falling out while you&#x27;re trying to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only pro I found is that it does have a nice side burn trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will chalk this up to experience. I am already shopping for a new Norelco and soon as I have one this will be given to a charity.</li>
            <li> It was okay. I needed a trimmer very badly so I got one of brauns more expensive brands. That did the job much better.</li>
            <li> It is working fine so far.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad we had to order it in another state and pick it up there over Christmas. Good thing we were planning a trip there anyway.&lt;br /&gt;Stupid California law would not let it be delivered here.</li>
            <li> Very fine electric razor.  Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Irritated the skin not a clean shave. ..have discontinued use after first use</li>
            <li> Junk, save your money. Wahl makes great products, but not this one.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  it is powerful and gives a close and smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Just got it in time for my next shave thanks to Amazon Prime, shaves smooth left my face like baby skin lol, I immediately used the ultra clean foil though. Tip: be very careful when pulling out the foils from the packaging they are very light like foil paper, they are not a solid metal foil like my previous Braun&#x27;s, I almost broke mine when taking it out. So far I just used it for my face n neck but will be trying it for a bald fade on the sides soon.</li>
            <li> I was forced to use an electric shaver because of a medical problem and being a great fan of a razor shave, I was very skeptical of an electric shaver.  The shave from this razor is very close to that of a blade.  Be patient as it take about 1.5 weeks for your beard to adjust to an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver has the loudest (read, most powerful) motor of any that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It gives me a close shave&lt;br /&gt;with little effort, but it is pretty loud in the morning.  There are 3 different screens to choose from, but I&#x27;ve only&lt;br /&gt;used one.  It took a couple of weeks for the shaver to get &amp;#34;broken in&amp;#34; to my face and now the pressure I need&lt;br /&gt;to use is very light to get the closeness I want.  The plastic screen guard rarely will stay on, so I don&#x27;t know if&lt;br /&gt;there will be any problem traveling with it.  Also the head, that holds the screen, doesn&#x27;t sit squarely on the&lt;br /&gt;shaver.  It&#x27;s a little bit out of alignment, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the way it shaves.  I like that it&#x27;s American&lt;br /&gt;made and the customer service has been good, so far.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington shavers for almost 40 years. This was the first Wahl I ever used. I almost returned it because it snagged some whiskers and pulled them out rather than cut them. I tried all three of the included foils and they all did the same thing and shaving was painful. after a close look I noticed that there is a narrow band of &amp;#34;decorative&amp;#34; holes in the foil below the cutter that happened to be just large enough for the whiskers to poke through. I covered this area on both the front and back foil with a thin strip of scotch tape and no more snagging. The same could be accomplished with nail polish - just cover the small holes.&lt;br /&gt;This is annoying and should not be necessary but it turned this shaver into a keeper for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It can be used while plugged in if needed.&lt;br /&gt;It is small enough to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;The slide-action button will not turn on accidentally in a suitcase.&lt;br /&gt;It shaves very close and fast - less than half the time it used to take with the Remingtons.&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;The included three foils are a nice touch and lets me try the one that works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A little on the noisy side and it vibrates more than I am used to.&lt;br /&gt;The foils need to be modified to be useable for certain beard types.</li>
            <li> From the reviews, I was lead to believe this was the greatest shaver ever created.  It&#x27;s a mediocre shaver with POOR ergonomics - it does NOT fit well with my hands. Also, despite having 3 different shave screens, it still doesn&#x27;t do a great job around my jawline and chin.  I frequently use a regular razor blade to pick off straggler whiskers.  Also, it&#x27;s built cheaply, IMHO.  I feel that if I accidentally drop it, it will break.  My old Panasonic was far superior (ergonomics, better shave, sturdier materials) and cheaper.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a very close shave with the medium foil. Much closer than my rotary shaver. Only downside is it does vibrate quite a bit. My hand is a little numb after holding it while shaving but not bad. I recently took it on vacation so I charged it up the day before and left the charger at home. It got bumped around in my suitcase and the the switch got turned on. The shaver was totally discharged when I got to my destination. Moral of the story, always take the charger with you.</li>
            <li> The razor works perfectly.  Comes complete with 3 heads.  The &amp;#34;Close Comfort&amp;#34; was installed and does a great job on my face.  Chargede the battery according to the instructions (18 hours) and got 10 days of shaves.</li>
            <li> Love the 3 interchangeable heads they all work as described, and the battery life is very good I get about 6 shaves on a single charge.</li>
            <li> this gives a very smooth shave,  at a very reasonable price</li>
            <li> I bought this razor in July  because it had a trimmer on the back - however the trimmer never closed correctly - it stuck out in the back and when I used it it never stayed in place just kept sliding back down.  The shaver seems to catch my husband&#x27;s beard a lot.  Not happy with this item. I would return it if I could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun brand foil razor for years and this Wahl razor is terrific in comparison...so glad I discovered it and its amazing that its made in the U.S.A. ! It takes a little practice to learn the best manner or pattern and shaver direction to shave ..also to disassemble as well as assemble requires a practiced touch.. but it certainly makes shaving a breeze as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Its a 4 1/2 Star rating in my vote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A. Alger</li>
            <li> It used to take over 10 minutes to shave with a Braun foil shaver. Now I can get a close shave in about 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This Wahl runs at a high rpm. Fully charged, it took over 5 days of shaving daily, to hear a change in the rpms. Then, when plugged in, it instantly regains it rpms, unlike some shavers, where you have to wait for it to charge, even if you want to use it while it is plugged in. With the Braun, I would have to use a trimmer afterwards to get many missed hairs on my neck and by the back of my jaw bone. Not much missed with this Wahl trimmer. I have been using it for 2 months now. I don&#x27;t skip a day, because it will pull a bit and the shave becomes uncomfortable (that is because the hair on my face grows very fast...I have a mean 5-O-Clock shadow)</li>
            <li> The best custom shaver I have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> it works find so for.</li>
            <li> tight shave --made in USA!</li>
            <li> I have been a Wahl shaver user for many years. This style shaver is truly a &amp;#34;man&amp;#34;s&amp;#34; shaver. I have owned and used Sunbeam, Ronson, Norelco, as well as Remington shavers, none can compare to the to this particular Wahl shaver. Its a good solid device one can hold on to, it is not a a&#x27;wimpy&amp;#34; little shaver like so many of the named brand shavers sold today. It gives a clean shave no matter what head you use. It is extremely well constructed, has plenty of power, and is built to last. I would invite anyone thinking of purchasing a new shaver to give this one a try first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Cox</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use a regular blade, and the foils on this get really close when you need to.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the flip out trimmer on a daily basis!&lt;br /&gt;The charge lasts forever, I don&#x27;t have an exact time frame but I go very long periods of time before charging again.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new shaver, this is a great option for you!</li>
            <li> Made in the US, has three &amp;#34;screens&amp;#34; for different closeness of shaves, has a trimmer, fits in your hand well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Braun user for a number of years.  I have 2 and one of them is about to quit on me so I decided to shop around and see if there was another brand I might try just for the sake of change. I had never heard of the Wahl but after reading the reviews I decide to try it. First off it&#x27;s rather large and, frankly, looks cheap..The trimmer is not the best I&#x27;ve seen and it&#x27;s a bit loud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the good news is that it gives a very good shave and does it in short order thanks to the large foil dual heads. I will caution any new users with an average growth of whiskers to start with the \\&quot;standard\\&quot; foil and guide the shaver fairly lightly over your face. If you press too hard you may get some serious razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a very satisfactory razor and a pleasant surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11/27/2013: I noted earlier that the shaver is a bit loud.  I stand corrected: It is VERY loud.  Nevertheless, it gives an excellent shave.  I recently did something rare for me.. I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 straight days.  But the Wahl shaver cut through that growth like the proverbial hot knife through butter and produced a smooth, close shave.  Better that either of my Braun shavers.</li>
            <li> This lovely beast reminds me of the time my grandfather and father used to take me to the barber as a kid.  They always had that loud set of clippers they used for 30 years and now I know why...because they don&#x27;t die.  The separate levels are nice but the first thing I noticed was the volume because my Braun/Panasonic/Norelco never had this volume and first I hated it.  Then I realized how well it doing as the other shavers usually left a need to grab a disposable and take care of &#x27;what was missed&#x27;.  Will definitely be buying again if this puppy ever runs off to Mr Greenfield ...</li>
            <li> Best shaver out there!! Love this.. Gets close blends well</li>
            <li> I broke my original Wahl shaver purchased from Amazon. Entirely my fault. It worked well. I purchased a new one. Big mistake. The new version is terrible in every way. Pulls whiskers non-stop. Trimmer will not stay closed. Foil protective cover will not stay on. I have to hold the trimmer closed to use the shaver. I have since replaced the new Wahl with a Panasonic ES8103S. The Panasonic is vastly superior.</li>
            <li> This machine gives the smoothest head shave.</li>
            <li> I waited forever for this thing and when I finally got it, was disappointed. It actually yanked at my whiskers and hurt. Its got a powerful motor but I had to go back and forth many times just to get a shave equal to the one I get from my cheap personal trimmer. Darn!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl shavers for years.  Yes, they do eventually wear out and need replacement.  Great shaver.</li>
            <li> Defiantly the best razor I&#x27;ve used. Even better than the old Wahl razor that I had before.</li>
            <li> shaves perfect every time</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace my older Wahl shaver.  I would have just upgraded to the newer version of my previous model but that model does not have the side trimmer like the older model and this one does. This model is larger than my previous one but much quieter and fits much more comfortably in the hand with a nice carbon-fiber look (although it&#x27;s plastic). As with the older model this shaver gives me the best shave I have every gotten from an electric shaver and I&#x27;ve owned most brands over the years. Luckily all my foils and cutters that I bought for the previous shaver fit this shaver. A great buy.  UPDATE: Almost one year later to the day and this shaver has begun to lose its charge - but because this shaver gives me the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric shaver I just ordered another one without hesitation (used mostly points so..practically free).</li>
            <li> The trimmer won&#x27;t stay locked in place. It vibrates and closes.</li>
            <li> bought this and a panasonic since I always shaved with a razor and didn&#x27;t know what I would wind up liking since some times my beard would be 4-5 or 6 days old and that is a lot of pain using a razor..My vote is not for the wahl shaver..it does take care of a 5 day beard but pulls some hair and is noisy so it winds up just sitting around in case my other one fails.It probably would be ok if I used it for a daily shave</li>
            <li> I have owned a Wahl before but tried another shaver and after awhile I realize that it did match the Wahl shaver.  So I came back home to Wahl and love it.  I&#x27;ll never leave again.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it was made in America. Unfortunately, I find that the German razors are far superior.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item Wahl 7367-200 Custom Shave System Multi-head and I am very pleased with this electric shaver. I want to tell you from the beginning that I have been using these machines for 47 years. This machine is not that fancy but it does it&#x27;s job very well. Some people said that it&#x27;s a noisy machine but this is what makes the machine the best. If a machine doesn&#x27;t make noise then that means the electric motor is very weak and will not work up to expectation. I used for many years a Remington brand, by the time it was with a cord and strong electric motors I was very pleased with the machine. When they started  making it with the batteries and small electric motors it was not cutting my beard at all and it would rip my hair.  That&#x27;s why I would advise my friends to not buy Remington anymore. I did a lot of research and when I read the reviews and the guys said Wahl was a noisy machine I said that I would give it a try. for the money that I paid ($58) Wahl can do better. I do not like that the screen and the blades are off set. I prefer like the Remington one that has them on the same line. Although this is a good machine, the battery on it isn&#x27;t good at all, because it&#x27;s running on a cord (charger) I would recommend this machine to my friends.</li>
            <li> Powerful and I love that you can use it while plugged in.  However, compared to my previous electric razor it does not do as good of a job shaving.  I get yanked hairs more often and it doesn&#x27;t get as smooth without significant effort.  Unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 4 months now. It&#x27;s performed infinitely better than my previous shavers where I used the shaver addon. highly recommend this to anyone. No complaints. Just remember to oil the blades every few weeks.</li>
            <li> Revision of old 4000 that I have worn out two.  Quieter and smoother running.  Finally has replaceable battery which is what stopped the other two.  Shaves comparable to a blade if you do not push on it.  Pushing it into the skin causes much more wear and a poor shave.  Lightly gliding over the skin gives longevity and close shave.  The charger does not turn off when fully charged and that is a sore point that Wahl should fix.  Also would be nice to allow battery replacement without disassembling the razor.  All this applies to all electrics.  This one provides the best shave of any on the market and at a better price.</li>
            <li> Good, recharge lasts at least a week, using it everyday for under 10 minutes, smooth with super close head, the old 4000 was only lasting about 4-5 days then it was slowing down...good buy, good delivery, good price, wish it had a charge light and when it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> The Shaver has a good charging life of a week. shaves pretty close, I use it in the car mostly.  The trimmer is not the the best a difficult to use.  All in all i would buy it again, but hope it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> does not cut all the hairs,  leaves many whiskers untouched, no matter how many times you go over it. save your money.</li>
            <li> this works great. similar to the older 5 star models. cant really say much about it. it does its job. a little loud. no big deal, if you want quiet you should probably grab a razor</li>
            <li> Been using it for two weeks now.  Was a bit uneasy when I first opened the packaging as it feels like a toy in your hand (not real solid or heavy), but as used it actually does a fine job.  I especially like the shape of the head (two foils stacked at an angle) and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  I don&#x27;t believe it would survive a drop to a tile floor (who here hasn&#x27;t dropped their shaver), but I&#x27;ll be careful.  A bit &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34;... nothing fancy, no pivoting head (why I bought it), no battery meter... just a very basic foil shaver that does a fine job.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaver that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The pop out trimmer makes this shaver perfect.  it cuts the hair that is too long for the foil screen: and that allows for a perfect shave.  After 2 weeks of using this shaver: the skin on my face has completely changed from a rough texture: to more of a smoother texture.  I can&#x27;t believe how close this shaver can cut: without irritating the skin on my face and neck area.</li>
            <li> After shaving for several years with razors, I decided to start looking for something else that would be less of a headache in terms of shaving. I&#x27;m a Black male, bald headed and like a smooth up close shave. At first I was alil skeptic but after reading some of the reviews and also seeing my barber who recommended that I try Wahl, I felt alil better. Now once I got the shaver I let it charge overnight. I got up the next morning and started shaving. Now I have sensitive skin and any nick or pull or tug of my hair or skin, then it hurts or even bleeds. But with this shaver I was TOTALLY pleased!! No nick, no tug, no pull, no skin irritation!! Great product that I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver.  One of the best I&#x27;ve ever owned.  This shaver will give a very close shave, almost as close as a blade.  In fact it shaves so close that it will easily burn you if you&#x27;re not careful.  It comes with three foils, sensitive, close, and super close.  I prefer the super close myself.  I recommend that you start with sensitive and work your way up, as that will give your skin some \\&quot;break-in\\&quot; time. The one feature I truly LOVE about this shaver is the fact that it can be used while it charges.  That might not sound like a big thing, but there&#x27;s nothing worse than forgetting to plug in a shaver and have it run down on you mid shave.  For some reason shavers that can be used while charging are becoming very hard to find, and I don&#x27;t know why anyone would prefer not having this option.  That brings me to the one problem.  I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for about 2 months, and the charging cord already has a short in it where it plugs into the shaver.  I contacted Wahl, and they are going to send me a new cord free of charge, no questions asked.  However, if you buy this just be aware of that potential issue.  Other than that it&#x27;s great.  Oh, there is one other thing  The pop up trimmer doesn&#x27;t pop up easily, and it has trouble staying in place once it&#x27;s up, but it does work, just a minor annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2-6-14:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the new charger cord, but now I&#x27;m questioning if there is anything wrong with the old one.  I suspect it does have a minor issue, but I think what threw me at first was that the charging light turns off when the shaver is being used while plugged in.  I had not realized that until a few days ago.  It does still flicker occasionally, which makes me thing the cord may still have a minor issue.  One other note,  I wish the charging light would turn off when it has a full charge.  As far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to know when it&#x27;s actually charged.  I just leave it over night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver as my &amp;#34;away&amp;#34; shaver as I have an expensive self-cleaning Braun shaver at home. After about six shaves this shaver now gives as good a shave as my Braun. No cleaning cartridges to buy, no counter cluttering charging/cleaning station, a choice of three included shave foils, and a travel pouch included - I&#x27;m embarrassed I spent so much on the Braun...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save a bundle of cash and try the Wahl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Remington electric shavers for years because they were the only ones that really worked for me.  I like this Wahl better than any shaver I&#x27;ve had in the past.  It&#x27;s great that when the battery gives out you can just plug it in and keep on shaving.  The multiple heads will give you the exact shave you want.</li>
            <li> My husband needed an electric shaver after he had carotid artery surgery.  His neck was too sensitive to shave with a regular razor and a beard was irritating to his wound.  I had bought him one at a local store, and it hardly did a thing.  But this electric shaver took care of the beard.  It didn&#x27;t shave as closely as he would have liked, but he looked good and felt better after using it.</li>
            <li> Has power and gives a good close shave. I would recommend this product. Also comes with three different shaving heads.</li>
            <li> Shaves good but is a little noisy. Great value for the price. Happy to buy a quality product made in the USA</li>
            <li> i love it because it&#x27;s so small and packs a huge punch! a little noisy but well worth it! buy it!</li>
            <li> We select razors,based on:looks,the company and the assumption that $$$ is better.This one is not stylish and is not  $$$ but it is the one to buy,strongest motor &amp; cuts close buy it</li>
            <li> Great shaver at a good price.</li>
            <li> This razor is crap. Does not give a good shave and the motor blade stopped working in less than six months.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!</li>
            <li> Previously used an electric shaver, I expected more from the wahl. It is excessively loud . Good enough shave, but bought the Wahl because I have the hair clippers and completely satisfied with it. Thought the saver would be better.</li>
            <li> Excellent shave, &amp; comes with a range of foils to provide different degrees of closeness and comfort. When fully charged, - it can handle at least two weeks of shaving.</li>
            <li> The most powerful electric shaver I owned. Pre-charged right out of the package and was able to shave faster than my Andis foil shaver. Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Burnt my face up pretty bad coming from a razor, so I switched back instead of retraining my face to that burn.</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor for the price</li>
            <li> Over the last 42 years I have owned Braun, Norelco, Phillips, and Remington electric shavers. My most recent, the Remington gave out. After reading the reviews and wanting a shaver that did a better job than my previous shavers I had to give the Wahl a shot. First of all. What is it that this shaver isn&#x27;t available to buyers in California?!  Well, that didn&#x27;t deter me. I had it ship to my daughter out-of-state and she sent it to me. Well worth the hassle. This is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. Powerful, easy to operate, and a very close shave - even those pesky long hairs!  The trimmer is a real trimmer that can really trim (unlike my recent Remington). This Wahl also comes with three different foils - regular, close, and very close shaves. I use the close which is more than adequate. So I highly recommend this shaver to anyone looking for a better shave.</li>
            <li> Works great, feels sturdy and no pulling.</li>
            <li> works but not so good will not shave soft hairs on neck  am very dissappointed</li>
            <li> Light weight and provides a comfortable, close shave.  One charge provides well over a week&#x27;s worth of shaves.  Has a cheap feel when compared to the more expensive models.  Travel pouch also has a cheap appearance.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shaver at my last haircut in February when the haircutter did one of his bonuses (shoulder massage, etc.) when he shave my light beard.  I was impressed with the shaver&#x27;s powerful motor and the closeness it provided.  I asked him to show me the shaver and I bought it here .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver has a couple of shortcomings which are the reasons I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  First, it&#x27;s not the best shape to hold comfortably.  It needs a thumb-size depression on the front for steadier holding.  Second, it doesn&#x27;t shave well with more than a light stubble.  A longer beard will cause you pain as it snags and pulls.  So as long as you don&#x27;t wait too long to use it, it&#x27;s as good as it gets aside from a blade.</li>
            <li> I already had the smaller wahl maroon one,  but the foil on it broke.  This one came with a extra 2 foils and I was able to use one of them.  All in all good deal, I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  Didn&#x27;t cut whiskers without going over and over.  A pain to use.  We went back to the old Remington even used it worked better than this one.  Sorry Wahl but this just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. It is a replacement for a 10? year old Remington 3 screen razor. The hand feel of the Wahl is not as good as the remington. The trimmer on the Wahl doesn&#x27;t quite close all the way; however it also isn&#x27;t designed to pop up like the Remington, which had to ultimately be superglued down. Shaving with the Wahl is efficient. I am pleased with the purchase, and would make it again.   I&#x27;ve been using this shave for several months now. It is as good of a screen razor as I&#x27;ve ever used. Being able to use the razor with zero battery charge by plugging it in is a great feature, especially when you forget to plug it in for a few days. My only gripe with this shaver is that the trimmer is totally worthless and still will not close completely. My suggestion to Wahl is to remove this feature to save a few bucks on total price of the unit. If you want a trimmer, buy the Wahl Peanut. It is a real trimmer and great product - no negatives, lasts forever (I have owned 2 in 20 years and shave my head and goatee once a week), is small and powerful, etc.</li>
            <li> Would be 5 stars--but there is one crucial (doubled edged) flaw.  It is noisy---AND noise means one of the most powerful shavers I have used for the money.  When my $50 Remington shaver can&#x27;t find any more hairs, I usually pull this out to help clean up.  My only complaint is the blades have dulled way too fast (makes me wonder how many more hairs I could get)--and also one of the blade guards has formed a hole.  So I imagine I have to order the 3 pack now?  The 3 blades and guards it comes with.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend after reading all the reviews. He is very pleased with this shaver and likes it much better than his old rotary one. He gets a very nice clean shave and uses it daily. It is a little noisy but he recommends this shaver.</li>
            <li> 50 years of shaving the best electric shaver I have owned !</li>
            <li> First impressions after using it for a month:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight.  Looks like it should be heavier.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s powerful.  Really zips through the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too loud.  I&#x27;m comparing it to my old corded Remington from the &#x27;80s (which still works by the way).&lt;br /&gt;It shaves well.  As smooth as my old Braun 3 series, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got a decent trimmer.  But it pops out of the back side, which takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3/1/16:  Almost 2 years old now, still in great shape.  I&#x27;ll probably buy another once my son&#x27;s beard comes in.&lt;br /&gt;Edit 5/13/16:  I wish the pop-out trimmer was sturdier.  It doesn&#x27;t snap into place anymore.  It&#x27;s kinda loose and slips back halfway.  But I can&#x27;t bring myself to knock off a star.  For its price I still think it&#x27;s a 5-star shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it ! Said he should have bought this product long ago. He tried the 3 floating head electric razors and he hated them, but that was years ago, don&#x27;t know how they are now. But, he says this thing has the power and comfort to compete with the double edge blade razor he uses....without all the fuss and the mess...have a good day everyone.</li>
            <li> I noticed several others gave this only a moderately good rating for things like being rather loud or not handling more than a day&#x27;s growth. I&#x27;ve owned a few Wahl shavers over the years and this one is no louder than the rest.  I find I can also shave if I&#x27;ve skipped a day.  Perhaps it&#x27;s dependent upon how straight your beard grows.  If you&#x27;ve been satisfied with them in the past, this one will do just as well.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty good shaver, almost the same as the one originally endorsed by a Radio Talk Show Personality, forgot his name, is it Paul Wallace? This shaver includes a side burn trimmer and 2 additional screens, it is missing the Charging Light so you cannot tell when it is charging. It is light and feels a little cheaply made, but works fine, can pull out and catch a hair in a painful way if you move it too fast and press too hard so easy does it until you get used to it. I miss the original Remington Shaver which was built like a tank. This one is built light, cheap, flimsy, cheap light weight plastic, a little thinner than expected, and is a little slippery to hold on to, and only has rubber grip coating on the sides, which is aqueduct, nothing special about its appearance, no chrome or elegant detail, but it does serve its intended purpose. The screen cover doesn&#x27;t latch properly and comes loose from one end and gets stuck or caught in the side burn trimmer, no big deal, just a little annoying each morning. For the price its worth it and is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Besy electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Out the box buzz saw close shave very satisfied with my order buy one u won&#x27;t be mad.</li>
            <li> Decided to pick this up due to the number of service guys using it and figured if it was good enough for those standards this might be the one to grab. They are right. The first day after it arrived there was a good 3-4 days of harsh bramble to shave through. WITHOUT even using the trimmer this thing ran through it like nothing. Very, very impressive. Maybe it might be a bit loud, but with the power this thing has it is not surprising. It took a 20 min shave using one of the other brands to about 5 min. The beard trimmer, as with all non-dedicated beard trimmers, can be a bit touchy for the drive to catch but works fine otherwise. With the course beard I have to cope with I will never buy anything but a Wahl ever again. BTW...MADE IN USA</li>
            <li> i received my razor today. i used the close shave head, on 3 or 4 day growth, it took it down like a lawn mower, only had to use the trimmer on a few spots. the razor has tremendous power. i have used wahl products for 29 years and never had a problem with any of them. i will never pay 200.00 bucks for a razor again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful razor.  I have owned the very best &amp;#34;Made in Germany&amp;#34; Braun razors and this razor is every bit as good. It is light weight which is why many say it feels &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  It is plenty solid and the battery life is incredible. The shave is super close. I have a very heavy beard and a very angular face and neck and this razor clears it right off in short order.  Being made in the USA and the good reviews is what initially attracted me to the razor and induced me to order it vs. just buying another Braun at the local super store.  I am so glad I did and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> At least for the short time I have had this razor it is clearly the best razor I have had. It gives a clean close shave in short order.  It is easy to clean and care for. It has a two year guarantee, but even if it doesn&#x27;t last that long I would be inclined to buy another one.</li>
            <li> Really like it and the attachments.</li>
            <li> LEAVES A SMOOTH FEEL AND QUICK, NO SHAVING CREAM</li>
            <li> When my old Norelco 7810 stopped giving me a close enough shave I thought it time to get a new shave.  As soon as I ordered the Wahl I realized that the Norelco probably just needed new shaving blades, so I order those too.  Both arrived quite promptly.&lt;br /&gt;This gave me the chance to compare a new Wahl to a Norelco with new blades.  (The Norelco 7810 uses the HQ8 blades as do many other Norelco models; I cannot tell if the key factor with Norelco is the blades or the varied head geometry.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is important that you prepare your skin before any electric shave.  As an old-time barber once taught me, you need to lightly wash your face with water and then dry by toweling against the grain of the whiskers.  This sets up the whiskers to enter the shaving head.  If I don&#x27;t do this, then the biggest factor in the closeness of the shave is my skin condition, and this can vary widely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Wahl came with three screens.  There was supposed to be a standard, a super close and a less close (for sensitive skin) screen.  But my package had only the less close and the super close screens.  No matter since I wanted to use only the super close screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comparison is thus between the Norelco and the Wahl, using new Norelco and Wahl heads, well prepared skin, and the super close Wahl screen.  I made several  observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The Wahl does give a slightly closer shave, though the Norelco is also pretty good. In fact, if I had the new Norelco blades initially, I would not have thought of replacing the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Neither is all that good with long hairs on my neck; but the Norelco is somewhat better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I could not determine if either shave was faster to get a complete shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Neither shaver caused any significant irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is the Wahl gives a closer shave. That may be important if you are really fussy or have very dark whiskers.  For me, the Norelco, with somewhat better handling of longer hairs, is good enough.</li>
            <li> Worthless ...Loud feels cheap I thought highly o Whal  but I don&#x27;t know now..</li>
            <li> takes a while to shave</li>
            <li> Worst product ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does not cut my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaver with three heads. This shaver has a real close shave.</li>
            <li> Works great and the clean up is simple.</li>
            <li> I got this for my legs but it didn&#x27;t do a very good job.  I&#x27;m going back to a blade even though you need a second mortgage to pay for them.</li>
            <li> Good product, very pleased. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend and he loves it. He says it doesn&#x27;t pull and makes for a close shave!</li>
            <li> Awesome Electric shaver! Great for Barbering!</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver for my hubby, he loves it and it gives a great shave. It was priced right and comes with different gards and the edger it great he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I&#x27;m impressed with this electric razor.... It has three foil heads that really makes the difference from the other wahl rechargeable shaver that only have one foil head and performs better!!</li>
            <li> this replaced a 10 year-old Panasonic wet/dry shaver.  the shave: very close to my skin on its &#x27;out-of-box&#x27; setting.  i have asian hair (very strong and straight), and this shaver, while it does require a razor for my usual spots for touch-up, puts the Panasonic to shame in terms of closeness.  i received mine on sept 5  AND I HAVE YET TO CHARGE IT AFTER TAKING IT OUT OF THE BOX.  i want to drain its battery, and the thing refuses to drain.  i cannot stress this enough: get a Wahl shaver - it&#x27;s Made in USA, its shaves very well, and the $50 price tag makes this an outstanding value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only con: it vibrates like mad in the hand.</li>
            <li> This shaver gives me a comfortable shave and I like that I can use it either with batteries or plugged to the outlet at home.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my better half because his shaver was old and just not doing what it should anymore. even changing the heads, etc, just wasn&#x27;t &#x27;cutting it&#x27; any more.&lt;br /&gt;after reading all the recommendations on this one and weighing them against other shavers, I chose this one.&lt;br /&gt;every word in every good review is correct. it has a close shave, the charge does last weeks on end and still shaves close as ever~~</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and with multi heads you can get the shave you want</li>
            <li> This razor does not work well at all.  The head is nearly impossible to remove for cleaning and it is just a bad product all around.</li>
            <li> Very close shave but incredibly poorly built.  Had to return 2 of them for different reasons after less than a week each.  I hope it was just a bad batch or my misfortune but I suspect not.</li>
            <li> the shaver does not cut close and makes a lot of noise</li>
            <li> The first week my face turned red after use but after I got used. I have to shave every 2 days. I liked the product, it is fast to shave and not cut myself. The beard is not like shaving with blade but is really short. I liked this product.</li>
            <li> A nice close shave and fast recharging...one minor problem... the clear plastic foil guard doesn&#x27;t fit and falls off.  I just have to be careful when storing the unit so the foil wont get damaged.</li>
            <li> No electric shaver has ever shaved me as close as a blade.  I am one of those unfortunate men who has a five o&#x27;clock shadow at 10 o&#x27;clock in the morning.  But this cordless shaver does a better job than most shavers I have had over the years.  It&#x27;s great for a touch-up in the evening when a I have a meeting or social occasion to attend.  And it&#x27;s easy to charge up and clean.  Wahl has a good reputation for quality products.  I had a Wahl moustache and sideburn trimmer that lasted for nearly 20 years, so I look forward to having this shaver for a good long time.  I recommend it to any man who has a heavy beard like me.</li>
            <li> Not the most state of the art shaver out there, but it definitely gets the job done.  My husband really likes this shaver.</li>
            <li> I decided to get this shaver when my Remington broke down. It gives a nice close shave and I&#x27;m happy. I also brought extra foils since they only last about a month or so.  UPDATE 8/4/2015: I feel ripped off by Amazon and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve ever felt this way since I&#x27;ve been using Amazon exclusively for the last couple of years. For the past 2 days the shaver will not hold a charge. It will not even turn on unless I squeeze the back and front together. If I hold the shaver horizontally to my face it works perfectly but if I turn It vertically it instantly goes off. I&#x27;ve never had something this weird happen before. Since I&#x27;m past the 30 day return window I have to figure this out on my own. I would advise anyone looking at this shaver to  not buy if there&#x27;s even a small chance of this type of defect happening in the future.</li>
            <li> New razor are not as relieable as older ones. I guess they do make them that great anymore.</li>
            <li> it works good, but the foils on the outside break way to easy. maybe whal should invest some more money into the product.</li>
            <li> After 5 months of regular use, I am forced to change my view on this. Yesterday I woke up and it was dead. I thought that maybe the charge had run out, so I put it on the charger and went to work. Came back and it was still dead. I took of the foil and looked, everything appears ok. I tapped it a little with the foil off, and it started running very weakly. When I put the foil back on and tap it again, nothing happens. I now have to contact Wahl about warranty to see if it is still covered. I hope they don&#x27;t keep me on the phone for too long.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended by a friend. Product delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> After 4 months use, it quit working, and they won&#x27;t take it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl used to be a good name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review about anything. This shaver is the exception.&lt;br /&gt;I own a Norelco shaver that cost $120 five years ago and can&#x27;t hold a candle to this one.&lt;br /&gt;Purchased the Wahl because someone wrote that it was good for head shaving. Shaving of the pate is on the table due to too many bald spots and comb overs are out of the question. I&#x27;ve used a razor before and ended up w/ quite a few nicks. A weekly buzz w/ the clippers has been the standard for several years now. Decided that this was a good use for the Christmas gift card from the grandsons. The reviews sounded great: made in USA, inexpensive compared to competition, and results as good or better than said competition. True, true and true!&lt;br /&gt;Putting my head to the Wahl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Works amazingly on the face also. (Sorry Norelco, you&#x27;re on the bench)</li>
            <li> OK....been thru too many electric razors to talk about in this forum.  Can&#x27;t use a straight razor as I just can&#x27;t afford the cost of transfusions!!!!  Have had reasonable luck w/most of the electric shavers in getting a close shave...sometimes a remarkably close shave.  Have spent the bucks....$200 etc...this last time I basically was just tired of replacing the #**^ cutters and foils....a continuous monetary drain.  So....I looked at purchasing a less-costly razor....one that was pretty highly rated and this one came up, even included three foil heads!!!  Well after only a few months I&#x27;ve already gone thru all of those foils...now getting &#x27;pinched&#x27; because the foils, each of them, are compromised near an edge where they adjoin the cap unit.  The shave closeness isn&#x27;t too bad....not great and it did take a little getting used to, but once again here I am dealing w/replacement foils/cutters soon I&#x27;d imagine and thus continuing my &#x27;indebtedness&#x27; to the manufacturer of whatever shaver I&#x27;m using.  Back to the drawing board I guess!!!</li>
            <li> Stopped working after three weeks.</li>
            <li> The Wahl shaver&#x27;s foils break in less than one month over and over.  My old Braun&#x27;s foils last eighteen months.  Wahl was good about shipping the warranty replacement foils.  I had to pay for shipping to get the defective? shaver &#x27;repaired&#x27;, but when it was &#x27;fixed&#x27; and returned, the new foil broke in one month.  I suspect an engineering design mistake -- this substandard shaver should never have been offered to the public.  I shipped it back for a refund and bought a Braun 3Series 340S-4 and the Braun is better in every way.  I am out half the purchase price because of paying for shipping twice.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately never worked...&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s not the 110Volt (USA) to 220Volt (Europe) fault. I tried with 3 different ways to charge it (always using a multimeter before connecting to the Shaver) and it never got changed, so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Have used a Remington for years, The Wahl has more power and lighter and easy to use.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES Wahl products, so when it came time to buy a new shaver, it had to be Wahl.  We could find none at any of our local stores, so we went to Amazon-- our favorite internet shopping site.  As always he loved the Wahl from the moment he got it, but unlike  all of our past experiences with Wahl shavers, after  just a couple of months, it appears to have developed some sort of short.  We are hoping it&#x27;s the battery and that we can take it to get a new rechargeable batter installed.  If not, we&#x27;ll go bu another Wahl because in my husbands eyes, they are the best.</li>
            <li> The shaver is generally good but there are a couple of thing I was&#x27;nt to please about. 1. There is a slide out trimmer at the side of the machine that is activated by pushing it upwards with your tumb, the problem is the trimmer keep closing on its own while I&#x27;m using it so I have to keep my tumb there continuously. 2 The zipper on the carrying case spoiled in no time flat, but other than that the shaver itself is really good,cant complain about the shave.</li>
            <li> I have used electric shavers for over 50 years.  This is the closest shave I have had.  The skin is shaved as close as when I have used a blade.  The trimmer does the job on the first try.  Best shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> It cut my shaving time in half.  There was no irritation and I get a weeks worth of shaves on one charge.</li>
            <li> Best and closest shave I ever had. Yes it is a little loud but not bad.You can hear the shaver cutting the whiskers when no more cutting sound your done. With this shaver I can go everyother day . Been shaving for 45 years ,double edge, 2,3,4 blade razors ,foil &amp;rotary this is definitly the BEST!</li>
            <li> Strong motor.  Love the variable foil heads.  Solid shaver.  Like that it can be used with or without the cord.  Not fancy, it just works.</li>
            <li> Awesome, shaver as described.</li>
            <li> I like that this is a Wahl product and make in USA, but i&#x27;ve been disappointed in it&#x27;s performance. First the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge long and second the trimmer won&#x27;t stay extended. On the plus side, it does shave well, but not as good as my previous Braun.</li>
            <li> perfect shave happy husband</li>
            <li> I like this product and it works as expected......You can go for it.</li>
            <li> GREAT RAZOR, SMOOTH SHAVE, BATTERY LAST LONG TIME,  THIS IS MY 4TH ONE, CAN&#x27;T BY LOCALLY.  WOULD BUY THIS RAZOR AGAING. NOT NOISY.</li>
            <li> My second Wahl shaver and the best I have hade to date</li>
            <li> This electric shaver is better than any of thehigh end ones you can find, you will be amazed by what all it can do! I recomend to all who are interested in a daily shaver or someone who is a professional barber or salon artist!</li>
            <li> This product is pure genius!!! The perfect upgrade to the 5 star balding close shaver... I am over satisfied with the item in fact I plan on purchasing another one asap... Thanks to amazon for having it in stock and at an amazing price... The package made it to me exactly when it was supposed to, I had the best experience doing business with you and plan on doing much more moving forward...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Ian</li>
            <li> I hav no complaints. The Wahl 7367-200 firs nicely in my hand and I get a close shave with it. I have a bread and I can trim my bread and mustache with this just fine. It does require s steady hand to do the trimming, but I got that down now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is right and its made in America! Buy it!</li>
            <li> My husband has used Wahl shavers for many years but no more. This one was definitely a lemon. It would not open the trimmer and retract it properly from the first day. After about one months use, it locked up and would not run at all. He was very disappointed so he went and bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> My shaver just came yesterday, and I had it plugged in all night, and I just had my first shave with it this morning. I used the medium foil that it comes installed with, and it worked very well. I hadn&#x27;t shaved in several days because I&#x27;d been developing a rash on my neck, and I thought the shaving cream and blade might have something to do with the rash or, at least, was irritating it further. Anyway, I decided to go electric for awhile, and I&#x27;m very glad I did. This shaver is very easy to use, and my shave this morning was much closer and cleaner than I was getting from my Schick disposable razors and Edge shaving cream. I wouldn&#x27;t say my beard is especially heavy, but it is . . . irascible. It seems to think it can grow in any direction it damn well pleases. But the Wahl proved to be its equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, only one thing to caution you about. Everything fits so tightly in the packaging that I had difficulty getting the extra foils out of the plastic they were wedged into, and somehow in the process of removing them from the plastic liner, I punctured my left index finger on the edge of the left foil. Man it bled like when Dan Ackroyd imitated Julie Child cutting up a chicken. I mean it bled and bled until my blood was all over the place! But I finally got it bandaged and stopped, and I didn&#x27;t have to call the paramedics. This may  be more the result of my well-known lack of digital dexterity (I think the scientific term is &amp;#34;butterfingers&amp;#34;) than the packaging. (My brothers would certainly suspect that to be the case.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than blood loss caused by the packaging, I don&#x27;t have a single complaint about this razor. And I have a smooth shave for when I go to visit Mom in the nursing home this afternoon! (Mothers&#x27; Day)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> It shaves smoother than other shavers I have owned. I like the extra heads it comes with and the fact that it&#x27;s made in the USA.</li>
            <li> Very Close Shave. Razor a little flimsy and inexpensive feeling, but works well. The multiple foils are a real plus.</li>
            <li> Im soo happy with item</li>
            <li> im barber and i think this is the best machine for shave is realy strong and your face look clean like a baby</li>
            <li> Wahl&#x27;s rechargeable custom shavers are the best on the market and at an excellent price!!!</li>
            <li> The Wahl company makes great products,this shaver is no exception.It is powerful and shaves smoothly.Everyone has different sensitivity when it comes  to shaving,I have found it to be excellent.It holds a charge quite long.It comes with three heads and a charger.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy! The shaver stopped working I&#x27;ve only had it 30 days or so. I&#x27;ve tried everything and it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. It was a gift for my boyfriend and not cheap. I guess there is no such thing as a refund either, so pissed. Really hate ordering things like this online...I tried to be hopeful.</li>
            <li> Fast and clean with two week battery life from each charge! Excellent shaver!</li>
            <li> This electric has more &amp;#34;horsepower&amp;#34; by far than any other I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;Even the pop-up trimmer is super-powered so shaving &amp; trimming is fast and takes minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;And with a choice of 3 different shaving heads it should work for every type of beard.&lt;br /&gt;Also the charge seems to last a very long time so I pretty much like everything about this product.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the same shaver that my barber uses for my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad to replace an old Remington. He reported that the wahls razor is the best he has ever owned. Great razor for the $$ and a US product too!</li>
            <li> Yes this machine is a bit noisy when using it but when you bring this kind of power to the sink, what&#x27;s a little noise. It cuts stubble very well (use the close shave mesh). Also spray the inside of the mesh with a silicone lube spray after cleaning to greatly extend the life of both blades and mesh. I have had this razor for about four months and have only charged it four times (I use it every morning). Recommend a full charge then use until battery is fully down. Run at least two cycles like this and you battery has the capability of max charge. Excellent product - Will buy another when this one wears out in probably six or eight years. . .</li>
            <li> Wahl is a well known company with a great reputation.  I&#x27;m 81 years old and have been shaving since I was 12 years old.  My whiskers are thick and tough.  I&#x27;ve used straight razors, the old double edge razors, the more modern blade razors and a multitude of electric razors.  Electric razors hardly ever lasted over one year, I finally got tired if paying more and more for blade razors and buying electric razors that didn&#x27;t lat.  I decided to try a Wahl electric shaver.  My first one, the 4000, is still working, but the battery is fading away (I can easily shave by using the cord). I have been using this razor for 3 years. I decided to buy a new Wahl 7367-200 and find it powerful and shaves as close as a blade razor.The motor is very powerful for an electric razor.  It is made in the U.S.A. and feels like top of the chart quality.  This one will most likely last well after I take my last breath.&lt;br /&gt;BV, Oregon</li>
            <li> I would call this a no frills electric shaver.  It feels very clumsy and cheap.  The clear plastic foil protector is very poorly designed and won&#x27;t clip on properly, so it keeps popping off.  The cord is not coiled, so gets tangled and catches on things on the bathroom vanity.  The on/off is a difficult to operate slide switch.  The trimmer engages with a very stiff slider that takes two hands to operate.  BUT!  It does shave like a demon!  For that reason alone, I will keep this shaver.  But otherwise, it is pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I searched to find a shaver Made in USA and this was it! My other N-rotary was weak and seemed to take a long time to get a basic shave. This unit while incased in a plastic shell contains a powerful motor that gives a quick and close shave. I haven&#x27;t even charged it yet, used it 10 times right out of the box since Xmas.</li>
            <li> Great shave for the money</li>
            <li> great works with it !</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair that grows quickly with sensitive skin not a good combination but this shaver is Great just make sure you wash your face, dry, trim, then use lectric shave which is a pre shave for electric shavers and use the sensitive foil. Had it for about a month and cant complain. This device is awesome. Wahl in General is a great brand for all hair cutting tools. Definitely Recommended</li>
            <li> It the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this purchase.  The product does what it says it do!!  It has the ability to shave real close.  I use it when I don&#x27;t feel like lathering up with shaving cream to shave with the razor.  Amazon once again was very prompt on the delivery of the item.</li>
            <li> This is my second Wahl shaver in a year. I just got this one 35 days ago after my first one developed a defective on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s switch became defective after 34-35 days so Amazon will not let me return it. Although it shaves and trims very well, I rate this as only one star because of the inherent switch defect. It seems like management should start earning their million dollar bonuses by doing their jobs to make decisions to correct the switch defect.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I was watching the movie, Taxi Driver. I just then  decided, that I wanted a new look. At the age of 74, with a pretty full head of hair, I did it. This shaver is totally awesome. It shaved my head so close, that I tried it on my thick beard. I have been using the big Buaun shaver for years. . I just wanted to see how close a shave I could get with the Wahl compared to my Braun. Results...A dead tie. To replace the Buaun cutting head would be at least 3 to 4 times as much, as replacing the same part on the Wahl. I think my Braun is going for a long deserved rest.By the way, my wife said at my age, I should be bald anyway. But she thinks I look younger. She is 37.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on reviews here. I&#x27;ve used a couple of different electric shavers. I used this on a couple of trips and at home.  Ended up tossing it.  Was not a comfortable or close shave.  Would not recommend.  Went back to razor.</li>
            <li> I like it, however after using this shaver the on and off switch doesn&#x27;t always turn off this devise, but requires 2 or 3 or 4 attempts.</li>
            <li> My husband has always used a Wahl shaver.  They have become difficult to find in local department/drug stores.  I saw it on Amazon and purchased it for him.  He was ecstatic to finally have another Wahl.  It makes shaving for him almost pleasant!</li>
            <li> Did not want to 150 on the top end.  The sensitive setting was not strong to help style my stubble</li>
            <li> Works fine.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a month, so the jury&#x27;s still out on the battery life, but it gives a reasonable shave for a reasonable price.  Comes with three screens for different closeness/sensitivity tradeoffs: Lawn mower, normal, sensitive.  Given that the razor blade folks have jacked up their prices to two bucks a blade, this is a comparative bargain.</li>
            <li> Not very good , a little rough , not a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Gives a very smoothe feel.</li>
            <li> It isnt as good as some say. I tried different screens ( it gives you 3 ) and still the shave is not that close and it does pull hairs out often which of course is not fun. I have used other elctric razors and they work better but they cost more. Still , If I had to do it all over again I would spend more money and get the Braun or the Norelco</li>
            <li> Very close shave with much gentler feeling, especially after several days growth - trimmer not as effective for me as my Norelco</li>
            <li> I was dubious when I received this shaver due to its unrefined appearance.  I couldn&#x27;t, however, be happier with its performance.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to use on occasional visits to our lake house where it may not be charged when we arrived.  The shaving head is somewhat noisy but powerful and the trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver looks like a Yugo but runs like a Toyota.  I would choose this over my Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shaver day by day and I have to say that the shave is not close enough. it always seems to miss a hair or two on the neck area. I&#x27;ve both the five star now hopefully it&#x27;s better.  Pro: 60minute charge Con: the buzzer on the revise side keeps falling in, you have to constantly apply pressure to hold it out.</li>
            <li> Have used this similar model for over 30 years with success. The cutter and screen are the same and that is why I reordered this shaver.</li>
            <li> have shave for aa short time like it so far.very fast delivery</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly. very happy with my Wahl shaver</li>
            <li> This is my husbands second Wahl electric shaver and he loves it.  The first one he had for 4-5 years and I kept telling him it was getting so loud.  So, he gave in and got a new one, wow...it&#x27;s so much quieter, lighter, and a smoother shave. He even talked his dad into getting one and he loves it too.  You can get replacement parts easily on Amazon which is an added feature.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable, for the price</li>
            <li> This is the only shaver my husband trust . So far so good.</li>
            <li> I still like my new Wahl but not some of changes.  first one I got this time only lasted week and then wouldn&#x27;t charge so returned to Amazon for new one which I now have.  noticed they now have no &amp;#34;charge&amp;#34; light on newer models and that the &amp;#34;flip up&amp;#34; blade on back now does NOT stay up so you have to hold it while using otherwise does not stay up and this is very awkward to operate.</li>
            <li> Works great! Nice close shaves.</li>
            <li> The shaver is pretty loud, but it works well.</li>
