            <li>I highly suggest you see your skin care professional for instructions on how to use this wonderful line.</li>
            <li>(Rx only) for 2 years under the supervision of a Skin Care Professional.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and appears to be genuinely Obagi.</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting the original Obagi Nu-Derm Blender with Hydroquionone USP 4%, but the product I rec&#x27;d is Obagi Blend Fx  and does not contain that ingredient.  </li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate melasma and have used many forms of treatment including laser and topicals over the years.  </li>
            <li>This products is amazing, I can&#x27;t believe how fast all the sun spots that I have on my face are basically gone in only four weeks that have been use it.</li>
            <li>Obagi products are the first I have found</li>
            <li>The real Obagi works wonders!  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li>I have been using Obagi for years and will continue for several more years.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I epected</li>
            <li>item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
            <li>Used Obagi products for a long time and love the results.</li>
            <li>He is the one to give you the first scripts and tell you how much of what you should use.</li>
            <li>Fresh and new.....</li>
            <li>to gentle take care of the brown spots.</li>
            <li>wife was very pleased,recommended by her surgeon</li>
            <li>Expected to eliminate more the spots on the face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have used this product several years ago and stopped for few years, and sure could tell the difference with my skin and the more appearance of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>The real Obaji #5 can not be bought  online because you need a doctor&#x27;s RX to buy it.</li>
            <li>So far she loves it !!!</li>
            <li>Furthermore, 2 of the other products that were able to be sold without a prescription are now prescription</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t clear to see and order exact product at that time</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to diminish dark spots on my face..</li>
            <li>This particular product is used with RetinA.</li>
            <li>This was either very old or not the real thing.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and use as directed.</li>
            <li>After you use the Foaming Gel Cleaner, Toner and Clear, you put a bit of the BLEND in the palm of your hand then add a pea size amount of pure RetinA, which is a prescription product.</li>
            <li>I use this product as directed with Retinol every night and my skin looks so fresh and relaxed the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I use Obagy every single day, and I love it but for some reason this lot was different</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>, the seller clearly states this in the description).</li>
            <li>Is not a substitute for clear.  </li>
            <li>I paid double for it because I need to have the peace of mind that I am using the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and my 70 year old skin still gets compliments.</li>
            <li>per ALL insurance carriers, so it completely &amp;#34;out of pocket&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I am using it, nonetheless, by alternating it with the original Obagi Blender so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li>It works as long as you use the other products and follow the instructions, your face can get very dry, but works, specially made for mild age spots</li>
            <li>I love this it will get rid of dark marks!!!!</li>
            <li>I spent a few thousand dollars on laser and only $200 on Obagi and love the results.  </li>
            <li>Completely mislead here -- this is not the same item I actually have been using from dr.&#x27;s office that generally provides this product.  </li>
            <li>Right now have to get past the smell.</li>

            <li> Expected &amp;#34;Obagi Nu Derm Blender&amp;#34; not the same product.</li>
            <li> So, the two stars are essentially because I got something I was not interested in trying....</li>
            <li> My dark spots are gone and my face looks younger than ever at my 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> Disciplined is needed to get the expected results&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My sister told me about Obagi 5 and how it has helped get rid of her dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have found this to keep the blotchy down to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other products to reduce the appearance of my age spots on hands, forearms and face and this one (the NON Rx &amp;#34;blend</li>
            <li> I am black and this works.</li>
            <li> not original packiging and no expiration date.</li>
            <li> Obagi made a difference in the way my skin looks in as little as 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> It slowly diminishing dark spots on my face and even some spots on my stomach.</li>
            <li> If you are struggling with melasma, give this a try but don&#x27;t sell yourself short by buying a fake product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and really don&#x27;t see any difference. :-(</li>
            <li> but it is not, which is really confusing since it is still #5.</li>
            <li> The worst issue was that I actually had to pay to return it to &amp;#34;Beyond Essential Beauty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy or oily.</li>
            <li> They ARE expensive however, and from time to time I can not always afford them.  </li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> No more painful laser treatments for me!</li>
            <li> and it burned my face badly.  </li>
            <li> Smells bad.</li>
            <li> but this one smells bad.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a bad batch it&#x27;s not working like it did before I want a replacement.</li>
            <li> so,I got wrong one it&#x27;ll rerun !!</li>
            <li> Terrible !</li>

            <li> expensive but worth it</li>
            <li> This was either very old or not the real thing.  I had ordered the Blend but received something called &amp;#34;Blender) which was a bronze color rather than a white color.

            <li> This product works but you have to be diligent in applying twice a day.  Started fading my sunspots in about two months.  It is not a miracle worker but it does make a difference in the darkness of the sun spots. Worth the purchase.</li>

            <li> not original packiging and no expiration date.</li>
            <li> Perfect product for older skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used Obagi products for years! I can tell a difference in my skin! Thank you for producing such a wonderful skin care!</li>
            <li> Used Obagi products for a long time and love the results.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying that I bought Obagi 3 and 5 at my dermatologists office not on amazon.  I paid double for it because I need to have the peace of mind that I am using the real thing.  The real Obagi works wonders!  I have mild to moderate melasma and have used many forms of treatment including laser and topicals over the years.  Obagi made a difference in the way my skin looks in as little as 3 weeks.  Although I still have some melasma, it was able to eliminate 80% of it when used day and night all over my face.  I spent a few thousand dollars on laser and only $200 on Obagi and love the results.  If you are struggling with melasma, give this a try but don&#x27;t sell yourself short by buying a fake product.</li>
            <li> It works as long as you use the other products and follow the instructions, your face can get very dry, but works, specially made for mild age spots</li>
            <li> Awesome product at a great price</li>
            <li> excellent product.. love it product arrive on time</li>
            <li> Not everyone has the same skin.  However, for mine the Obagi products in the Nu Derm line are the very best as exfoliating, clearing and maintaining.  They ARE expensive however, and from time to time I can not always afford them.  Yet, when i return to using Obagi I notice the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My fault.  I thought this one had hyaluronic acid but it doesn&#x27;t (and reading again, the seller clearly states this in the description). So, the two stars are essentially because I got something I was not interested in trying....but again the blame is on me!</li>
            <li> Love this Obagi product!</li>
            <li> Used this twice and it burned my face badly.  It arrived without a box - shrink wrapped only so I couldn&#x27;t check expiration date.  I can only assume that the product had expired.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Good blender to use. I have been using it for years and my 70 year old skin still gets compliments.</li>
            <li> I am totally an Obagi fan</li>
            <li> Great product and good seller</li>
            <li> Amazing product! No more painful laser treatments for me!</li>
            <li> This is Obagi&#x27;s NON Rx product to compare to the &amp;#34;blender&amp;#34; which is a Rx.  I&#x27;ve used them both and I had better luck with this NON Rx &amp;#34;Blend fx&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other products to reduce the appearance of my age spots on hands, forearms and face and this one (the NON Rx &amp;#34;blend fx&amp;#34;) has worked the best so far.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I use for my face</li>
            <li> This was the best product I have ever used on my face.I will buy some more.</li>
            <li> I love this it will get rid of dark marks!!!! I am black and this works. Worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear to see and order exact product at that time so,I got wrong one it&#x27;ll rerun !!</li>
            <li> Smells bad. If it works I will repost. Right now have to get past the smell.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better! I will continuously used this stuff!They works!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> it works awesome, just pricey.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments from strangers about my skin. I have been using it for over a year.</li>
            <li> Best product and price I could find.</li>
            <li> I need my. Revlon caramel to be send it</li>
            <li> Best product to remove frakles use it 3 months</li>
            <li> best stuff ever...and you save some money as well  tons of plastic surgeons sell this product</li>
            <li> I use Obagy every single day, and I love it but for some reason this lot was different and I don&#x27;t understand quite yet why</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and appears to be genuinely Obagi. I like this product and it works on my skin. I have regular skin. My skin is brighter and more even in color. I use the 3 and 5.</li>
            <li> Obagi is the best skin care line I have found.  I am a faithful user of the products for over 4 years now and gets lots of compliments on my skin and lack of wrinkles.  I highly suggest you see your skin care professional for instructions on how to use this wonderful line.</li>
            <li> Used as part of the set in a routine, you will not find a better product</li>
            <li> Been using for about a year. But need to have a script to blend it with.</li>
            <li> Expected &amp;#34;Obagi Nu Derm Blender&amp;#34; not the same product.</li>
            <li> item is very high quality and shipped very fast</li>
            <li> Very good , works best with other Obagi products.</li>
            <li> Fresh and new.....thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Marie</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting the original Obagi Nu-Derm Blender with Hydroquionone USP 4%, but the product I rec&#x27;d is Obagi Blend Fx  and does not contain that ingredient.  I am using it, nonetheless, by alternating it with the original Obagi Blender so it doesn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Thought this was the #5 Blender with hydoquinone but it is not, which is really confusing since it is still #5.</li>
            <li> Expected to eliminate more the spots on the face.</li>
            <li> Since I moved back to Arizona my face started hyperpigmenting (brown blotchy).  I have found this to keep the blotchy down to a minimum.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> for me it is the best product for spots</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 10 years.  It is part of the NuDerm regime my dermatologist gave me.  There are several tubes of different lotions you need to use in the Obagi Nu Derm regime. This particular product is used with RetinA. It is not meant to be used alone. Also it is the night part of the regime - After you use the Foaming Gel Cleaner, Toner and Clear, you put a bit of the BLEND in the palm of your hand then add a pea size amount of pure RetinA, which is a prescription product. A tube of it went up in price in the last year from $99/tube to $249/tube and as it is a dermatological product, it is not &amp;#34;medically necessary&amp;#34; per ALL insurance carriers, so it completely &amp;#34;out of pocket&amp;#34;. THE ONLY REASON to get this product is if you are using a specific Obagi NuDerm regime.&lt;br /&gt;  Furthermore, 2 of the other products that were able to be sold without a prescription are now prescription based.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your local dermatologist is not the one to get any of the scripts from. You have to find a dermatologist that uses and sells the OBAGI line from his offices. He is the one to give you the first scripts and tell you how much of what you should use.</li>
            <li> This is the best face product I have ever used and I have used them all; from la prerie to avon.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi for years and will continue for several more years.  Excellent products!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Product excellent.</li>
            <li> This products is amazing, I can&#x27;t believe how fast all the sun spots that I have on my face are basically gone in only four weeks that have been use it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy or oily. A little goes a long way. I know they say the best face products don&#x27;t smell good but this one smells bad.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten a bad batch it&#x27;s not working like it did before I want a replacement.</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several years ago and stopped for few years, and sure could tell the difference with my skin and the more appearance of the wrinkles.  I use this product as directed with Retinol every night and my skin looks so fresh and relaxed the next morning.  I will always use this and will not stop since I realized the consequences after I did stop before.  Highly recommend this product and use as directed.</li>
            <li> Is not a substitute for clear.  Has an odor.</li>
            <li> I love this line!  works great for discolorations.</li>
            <li> Obagi Nu Derm products work well together for skin care.</li>
            <li> This was perfectly packaged.  I have been using this product for about three years and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product.  Best skin care ever!</li>
            <li> great product well worth the money... but you also need the kit and Nu Derm FX skin brightening cream.</li>
            <li> Completely mislead here -- this is not the same item I actually have been using from dr.&#x27;s office that generally provides this product.  It is not the same contents as what I purchase. I will not purchase this again on line.</li>
            <li> VERY IMPORTANT!  Do not get this product!  My sister told me about Obagi 5 and how it has helped get rid of her dark spots.  She didnt tell me that this is a prescription product and can only be purchased from a dealer or MD.  I had been using the product for over 6 weeks and there were no results.  I went to a skin care specialist and she said she had never seen this product before.  It says &amp;#34;blend&amp;#34; on it.  Not &amp;#34;blender&amp;#34;  This is a total knock off!  And better yet the ingredients is all WATER based!  DO NOT BUY! and shame on Amazon for having this product even on their site!</li>
            <li> Shipped as stated. Item as described.</li>
            <li> Irritated my hyperpigmintation more. Saw no improvement.  Cosmelan 2 cleared me up in a week.</li>
            <li> It does seem to work at all.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any change in my skin.  It has a very strong almost vingear like scent.</li>
            <li> Love this product! The brown spots on my face were noticeably lighter after 10 days of use!</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. The real Obaji #5 can not be bought  online because you need a doctor&#x27;s RX to buy it. BEWARE</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I epected</li>
            <li> Love these products!!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years blended with tretinoin.  Have received many compliments on my complexion--and I never wear make up (foundation).</li>
            <li> good service. would recommend</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi series products since my doctor recommended and would not switch.</li>
