            <li>I love it also.</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>Get compliments all the time on how fantastic I smell tho!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I priced it through Sephora, and it was about $20 more than through this seller.</li>
            <li>OK, whatever.</li>
            <li>I must love it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item and love the scent.  </li>
            <li>love it ...</li>
            <li>My hubby,friends just love when I walk by..</li>
            <li>you will not be able to return these as they are considered HAZMAT  </li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>So unique &amp; sexy.</li>
            <li>I received my package quickly, opened the box, and saw the number code imprinted under the top flap of the perfume box was removed, like someone used a razor blade to cut it out.</li>
            <li>Light, sensual, and provocative all at once.  </li>
            <li>Scent - fantastic Delivery- meh</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand, but I was still excited to have a refill for my spray bottle.</li>
            <li>so both the boxes have the unique code that Thierry Mugler parfums always come with cut out and</li>
            <li>Not a copy but the original.  </li>
            <li>What a deal, right?</li>
            <li>Has a intoxicating aroma, very sensourous!  </li>
            <li>Bought my first refill.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it was through Sephora.</li>
            <li>Which, I supposed saved me some time, not having to put on perfume every day since my entire bag smelled pretty strongly of the stuff.</li>
            <li>But as I said, don&#x27;t know where the mistake lies, but I certainly hope that they aren&#x27;t going to go to the cylinder refill style bottle from here on out.</li>
            <li>I used too much force one day and it cracked.</li>
            <li>This is NOT the real perfume.</li>
            <li>I would buy the eco bottles but have to buy 2 at a time and that is a bit over-kill for how much I use this</li>
            <li>She has had more compliments on it than any other perfume she has ever worn.</li>
            <li>Alien is one of my favorite scents!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the round torpedo looking bottle for a refill, lose more of it to my pants</li>
            <li>I started using it and noticed that it smelled exactly the same when I sprayed it on, but the scent vanished almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I will only order from a reputable dealer, such as Sephora or the actual perfume&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>It was more like a cologne, or even as weak as a body spray.</li>
            <li>I gotten the refill that is shown here, similar in design as the spray cologne I have absolutely no trouble at all with that container.</li>

            <li> but the spray part of the refill bottle doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> The refill is really nice although a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> Very unfortunate when you think you are buying a new item and paying such a high price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like having a refillable bottle that doesn&#x27;t have to be trashed when empty.  </li>
            <li> I used it everyday, and needless to say, I ran out quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have issues with that due to loss of content when trying to refill my sprayer.</li>
            <li> The lid is a little tricky to take off, so be careful.</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Angel by Mugler, and now am a fan of Alien.</li>
            <li> Not worth saving just 4 dollars</li>
            <li> I WAS HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING AT THE DEPT. STORE.</li>
            <li> This is pretty bad and I will not be buying perfum again from here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alien perfume for a couple of years and use if as my &#x27;signature&#x27; scent.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, but all I got was a $60 bottle of weak body spray.</li>
            <li> Made matters worse when I put it in luggage and it leaked.</li>
            <li> Worst than that the perfume was watered down.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Every time I wear this scent, I get compliments. So unique &amp; sexy. Would buy again. But realize this is only the refill bottle. I had overlooked that lol</li>
            <li> Smells great on me!  Has a intoxicating aroma, very sensourous!  I can refill my bottle with it.</li>
            <li> luv the way it smells on me. I get compliments. but the spray part of the refill bottle doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> Love it. Get many compliments. Bought my first refill. Finally found a perfume scent that lasts. Do not ever discontinue it smells sooooo good!</li>
            <li> I just love this perfume.  I&#x27;ve worn it several years ago and I like it even more now than I did then.</li>
            <li> My wife LOVES it.She has had more compliments on it than any other perfume she has ever worn. I love it also.</li>
            <li> This is my fav out of all the perfumes created by Thierry Mugler.  Light, sensual, and provocative all at once.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this scent. The lid is a little tricky to take off, so be careful. I used too much force one day and it cracked. Made matters worse when I put it in luggage and it leaked. Which, I supposed saved me some time, not having to put on perfume every day since my entire bag smelled pretty strongly of the stuff. Get compliments all the time on how fantastic I smell tho! Synopsis? Scent - fantastic Delivery- meh</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. The first time I bought it was through Sephora. I bought the spray bottle. I used it everyday, and needless to say, I ran out quickly. I priced it through Sephora, and it was about $20 more than through this seller. What a deal, right? I received my package quickly, opened the box, and saw the number code imprinted under the top flap of the perfume box was removed, like someone used a razor blade to cut it out. OK, whatever. I didn&#x27;t understand, but I was still excited to have a refill for my spray bottle. I started using it and noticed that it smelled exactly the same when I sprayed it on, but the scent vanished almost immediately. It was more like a cologne, or even as weak as a body spray. This is NOT the real perfume. I learned my lesson in ordering something and trying to save money. You get what you pay for, but all I got was a $60 bottle of weak body spray. NEVER AGAIN! I will only order from a reputable dealer, such as Sephora or the actual perfume&#x27;s website. Buyers beware!</li>
            <li> They either made a  mistake or the packaging has changed for the refill bottle. I don&#x27;t like the round torpedo looking bottle for a refill, lose more of it to my pants before it get&#x27;s into the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Had I gotten the refill that is shown here, similar in design as the spray cologne I have absolutely no trouble at all with that container. But as I said, don&#x27;t know where the mistake lies, but I certainly hope that they aren&#x27;t going to go to the cylinder refill style bottle from here on out. I&#x27;ll have issues with that due to loss of content when trying to refill my sprayer.</li>
            <li> This is my mum&#x27;s favorite fragrance, so I bought it and it came in time and in perfect condition. I recommend it, the prize is very good!</li>
            <li> Second time purchasing.  I must love it.  I also get many compliments that it is a nice scent but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and love the scent.  In fact it is the only one I use.  Problem with my purchase was the box was opened and the product code was&lt;br /&gt;removed.  Worst than that the perfume was watered down.  Very unfortunate when you think you are buying a new item and paying such a high price.</li>
            <li> love it ... and i will buy it again and again .....</li>
            <li> My hubby,friends just love when I walk by..You dont need much to keep your delicious smell all day.I Believe is one the best perfume I ever try(and I has been trying lots perfume..lol)</li>
            <li> I am a long time user of Angel by Mugler, and now am a fan of Alien.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 refills BUYER BEWARE you will not be able to return these as they are considered HAZMAT  so both the boxes have the unique code that Thierry Mugler parfums always come with cut out and tape has been placed over them. This is pretty bad and I will not be buying perfum again from here. Not worth saving just 4 dollars which is what the difference was</li>
            <li> Alien is one of my favorite scents!  The refill is a great value and arrived in great condition in the manufacturers packaging.</li>
            <li> wife loves it!  the cap cracked a bit when it was opened so will leak if not upright.  great design.</li>
            <li> Good buy.  Not a copy but the original.  Get lots of good comments when I use it.  Very nice smell</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE FOR SOMETHING I WAS HAVING TROUBLE LOCATING AT THE DEPT. STORE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alien perfume for a couple of years and use if as my &#x27;signature&#x27; scent.  The refill is really nice although a little expensive.  I would buy the eco bottles but have to buy 2 at a time and that is a bit over-kill for how much I use this scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like having a refillable bottle that doesn&#x27;t have to be trashed when empty.  Like ease of refilling it.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  Always a winner for Christmas, anniversaries or birthdays.&lt;br /&gt;And it smells really great on her.  (Raising eyebrows !!)</li>
