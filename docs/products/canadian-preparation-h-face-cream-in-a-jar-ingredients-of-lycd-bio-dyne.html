            <li>That was amazing.</li>
            <li>But I make my own Vit C serum</li>
            <li>I bought this cream because I had heard so many good things about this type of cream for under your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The good part was it did smell better than preparation H.</li>
            <li>Fair  seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>and I decided to purchase this cream because I heard about Preparation-H usage being an effective way to reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>but I do like it and will continue using it and hope to get some benefits fro mit as well as just being a nice day cream.</li>
            <li>I am still trying it, I need to work on how to use this cream, I hope it does work it would be nice to help with the lines on my face.</li>
            <li>This form is very easy to use and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on my skin and leaves my skin looking smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>The most amazing cream I have ever used</li>
            <li>I think it ia an ideal cream for the older women.</li>
            <li>It really does have excellent ingredients and there&#x27;s no bad fragrance to it at all.  </li>
            <li>the product was shipped quickly and in good condition</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>I JUST BOUGHT 3 MORE JARS.</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>she seems pleased.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was pretty good</li>
            <li>It is an excellent wrinkle reducer and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that dissolves quickly and perfectly in my distilled water when I make my Vit C serum.)  </li>
            <li>-The product was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>It did not even diminish the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; of any fine lines, or wrinkles, or tighten anything, and it did not brighten up my skin.  </li>
            <li>and it does seem to lesson fine lines...</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s too soon to see any distinct good results as it&#x27;s the first jar.</li>
            <li>Super product!</li>
            <li>I gave this cream 2 stars because although it did not deliver any benefits that it was advertised to accomplish, it fortunately did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>And rather than spend $80 for a jar of cream that has the B3 (niacinamide) and has the DMAE, I&#x27;ll just add my own fresh powders to a good, solid, inexpensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This reduces puffiness and lines around my eyes in the morning, without the greasiness of the original Preparation H product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and my skin looks good</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is true yet</li>
            <li>No bad smell, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>well what can I say .. when I tried this cream the first time after about a week a saw an improvement in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>For me, this was nothing more than just an ‘okay’ moisturizer because even as a moisturizer I would have to re-apply it multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li>Customer service is quick to respond.</li>
            <li>Nice middle weight.</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth the try since the reviews and details compared the cream to preparation</li>
            <li>so it might be worth a try for you....</li>
            <li>It seems to be light yet makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for those puffy lids and tired eyes.</li>
            <li>The right combination for application to scar tissue.</li>
            <li>Boy did it really surprise me!</li>
            <li>You can also go directly to the MakingCosmetics site to purchase, and to see all the skin care powders, etc., they have available.  </li>
            <li>it does help!!&lt;br /&gt;Big difference since first apply.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>YOU CAN FEEL THE TIGHTENING WITH THE FIRST USE.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the first time using the product.</li>
            <li>First I would like to start off by quoting the card from the company that arrived with my product.</li>
            <li>I suffer from rosacea and for the first time in twenty years</li>
            <li>Feels good and isn&#x27;t heavy, just isn&#x27;t doing anything for me.</li>
            <li>Wife really enjoys using it on her skin.  </li>
            <li>and it really does seem to help with those bags under the eyes.</li>
            <li>DONT REALLY SEE ANY .RESULTS</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>No swelling under my eyes next morning and comments from other people saying that I looked good.</li>
            <li>Skin has tightened and wrinkles less notable but still there</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this face cream and will defiantly continue using it</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>Well packaged; seems to work very well--pleased with the results thus far.  </li>
            <li>It rates as well as any other OTC facial cream as far as giving my skin a nice feeling.</li>
            <li>Nothing like prep h cream or ointment with live yeast in it.</li>
            <li>The package came rather quickly however the cream did not live up to the description.</li>
            <li>It is ok as a moisture cream but a bit pricey for the small amount if you just use it a cream .</li>
            <li>So far, though, I can&#x27;t see that it does anything at all.</li>
            <li>I am 62 years old</li>
            <li>and I can really  tell a big difference in my face</li>
            <li>I use this during the day under a BB cream and it has a natural feel.  </li>
            <li>is Live Yeast Cell Derivative,an Element that was in PreperationH sold in America that&#x27;s now only found in Canada&#x27;s preperation</li>
            <li>I used this cream every day, at least twice a day for a solid month and it really did nothing special for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Small enough to pack for travel and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am reordering, the jar did last a long time and you do not have to use much.  </li>
            <li>I had very high hopes after doing my research on the active ingredient in this product.</li>
            <li>I have found that it will take some time so better to put on a thin layer just before going to bed, and then the morning there is improvement; to see for yourself, put some around only one eye and then check out the difference when you get up.</li>

            <li> I plan on using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> because I haven&#x27;t used it very long.  </li>
            <li> This is the only source I&#x27;ve found with the active ingredient in it.  </li>
            <li> It is creamy, and absorbs quickly, not leaving behind any trace that it was there, other than a dewy, fresh appearance to the skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as this jar is empty we will order.</li>
            <li> first thought I was not impressed with what it look like.</li>
            <li> I just open a capsule and pour about 1/2 of the powder into a small amount of this cream.  </li>
            <li> I immediately assumed they must get alot of negative feed back.</li>
            <li> It is a small jar, but a fingertip amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but it did not solve the problem I bought it for which was dark circles and undereye bags</li>
            <li> absolutely no difference ,don&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> Swelling under my eyes taking hours to go down and then not at all.</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy or greasy feel of a lot of other creams.  </li>
            <li> Thick and goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Saw this cream as I was looking for perparation h ointments to keep my skin tight.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps and saves you a little money and disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> purchased DMAE capsules (vitamins) and have kept them in fridge for a few months.  </li>
            <li> We wanted the BioDyne version, not available in the US.  </li>
            <li> you have any trouble with this order, please allow us to resolve any issue immediately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not available in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> It arrived late but that was due to the mail.</li>
            <li> With inadequate research, we ordered the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; tube of Prep H.  Not easy to apply to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s going to help, but I&#x27;ll give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I noticed any improvements  </li>
            <li> It work for me, I have small bags under my eyes and&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is hard to say that whether it works, since skin care is a long-term solution.</li>
            <li> There is no need to reply with Negative Feedback.</li>
            <li> This sucks!</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product did not like the feel of it ,didn&#x27;t even make my skin smoother or firmer...</li>
            <li> going to work and everybody asking what was wrong.</li>
            <li> It does not feel uncomfortable or drying on the skin.</li>
            <li> I was desperate, tried everything.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I was desperate, tried everything.Swelling under my eyes taking hours to go down and then not at all. going to work and everybody asking what was wrong. I was going to order the Preparation H from Canada saw this and decide to give it a try. first thought I was not impressed with what it look like. But thought oh well Might as well use it up. Boy did it really surprise me! No swelling under my eyes next morning and comments from other people saying that I looked good. I now use over my face and neck. Had my mother-in-law try it and she loved it! Just ordered my third bottle!</li>
            <li> Takes about 10 days to see results but I will continue using. Hopefully wrinkles will disappear. Skin has tightened and wrinkles less notable but still there</li>
            <li> A very nice cream. Nice middle weight. Will seem to last a long time. Can be used&lt;br /&gt;As a day or night cream. Has some very good herbal ingredients in it. Also has a&lt;br /&gt;Nice face tightening effect.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are good, the quality of cream seems very good as well.  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;, but I do like the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for about a month and my skin looks good (I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s).  But I make my own Vit C serum and I know that has been key in my skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased DMAE capsules (vitamins) and have kept them in fridge for a few months.  I decided to add the DMAE to this cream because of the skin care benefits I read about DMAE.  I just open a capsule and pour about 1/2 of the powder into a small amount of this cream.  Not sure it&#x27;s going to help, but I&#x27;ll give it a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide USP) - 1.0oz / 30g Powder Form.  It&#x27;s supposed to be an excellent addition to skin care products.  And rather than spend $80 for a jar of cream that has the B3 (niacinamide) and has the DMAE, I&#x27;ll just add my own fresh powders to a good, solid, inexpensive cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The B3 I purchased from MakingCosmetics Inc.  ( I LOVE the seller Making Cosmetics!  They have THE best Vitamin C powder - it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve found that dissolves quickly and perfectly in my distilled water when I make my Vit C serum.)  You can also go directly to the MakingCosmetics site to purchase, and to see all the skin care powders, etc., they have available.  And no, I don&#x27;t work for them, I have no relationship with them, they were just recommended by another reviewer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m going to add the Vit B3 to this Canadian Prep H Face Cream as well.  Will post again in a couple of months or so if I see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I would recommend this Prep H face cream.  It really does have excellent ingredients and there&#x27;s no bad fragrance to it at all.  It smells NOTHING like the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; Prep H thank God!</li>
            <li> I used this cream every day, at least twice a day for a solid month and it really did nothing special for my skin.  It did not even diminish the &amp;#34;appearance&amp;#34; of any fine lines, or wrinkles, or tighten anything, and it did not brighten up my skin.  For me, this was nothing more than just an ‘okay’ moisturizer because even as a moisturizer I would have to re-apply it multiple times a day.  I gave this cream 2 stars because although it did not deliver any benefits that it was advertised to accomplish, it fortunately did not irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Hoped this cream would make a noticeable difference in the puffiness under my eyes, but can&#x27;t see any change. Feels good and isn&#x27;t heavy, just isn&#x27;t doing anything for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it shipped promptly. There are all kinds of miracle creams out there,but this one has the LYCD in it - wich is Live Yeast Cell Derivative,an Element that was in PreperationH sold in America that&#x27;s now only found in Canada&#x27;s preperation H. A fashion industry tip was for models to use Prepeation H on their skin because it shrinks tissue! Back to the review,I haven&#x27;t used this product beyond 30 days,but I like what I see so far..a calming of the skin and it does seem to lesson fine lines...try it,buy it NOW!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I noticed any improvements  but it appears to be a good product. the product was shipped quickly and in good condition</li>
            <li> I use the cream every day, get lots of compliments. I will be ordering more soon as I don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this and see if it improves my skin.  So far, though, I can&#x27;t see that it does anything at all.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s too soon to see any distinct good results as it&#x27;s the first jar. It rates as well as any other OTC facial cream as far as giving my skin a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> Good stuff Will buy again. Wife really enjoys using it on her skin.  As soon as this jar is empty we will order.</li>
            <li> I received my cream on time and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week since I started to use it day and night...&lt;br /&gt;What a change... It work for me, I have small bags under my eyes and&lt;br /&gt;honestly it does help!!&lt;br /&gt;Big difference since first apply.&lt;br /&gt;I also use a Hyaluronic acid serum under this cream and sunscreen every day, big help...</li>
            <li> We wanted the BioDyne version, not available in the US.  With inadequate research, we ordered the &amp;#34;traditional&amp;#34; tube of Prep H.  Not easy to apply to the skin.  That was not what the design was for.  This form is very easy to use and smells nice.  The right combination for application to scar tissue.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, IT IS REAONABLY PRICED AND WORKS.  YOU CAN FEEL THE TIGHTENING WITH THE FIRST USE.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS CREAM.  I JUST BOUGHT 3 MORE JARS.</li>
            <li> This cream is a really good product.  It has definately given my face a lift and hydrated it.  I think it ia an ideal cream for the older women.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream because I had heard so many good things about this type of cream for under your eyes.  While it feels like a very nice cream, I cannot tell a difference under my eyes after a couple of months of use.</li>
            <li> This is the first time using the product. I am happy with it. It arrived late but that was due to the mail. It feels good on my skin and leaves my skin looking smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for the purpose that I bought it (to de-puff the under-eye area). The good part was it did smell better than preparation H.</li>
            <li> First I would like to start off by quoting the card from the company that arrived with my product. &amp;#34;If you have any trouble with this order, please allow us to resolve any issue immediately. There is no need to reply with Negative Feedback. I immediately assumed they must get alot of negative feed back. Anyway moving on to my review. If you are someone like myself that has hereditary under eye bags. This product will not work for you. I have tried EVERY eye cream in Sephora in addition to every home remedy out there, and I have not found any product that works. I had very high hopes after doing my research on the active ingredient in this product. I use it morning and night and have not seen ANY results at all. Hope this helps and saves you a little money and disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro-The product was delivered very quickly. (earned 1 star for this)&lt;br /&gt;Pro-It does not feel uncomfortable or drying on the skin. (earned 1 star for this)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con-It does not work for people who are born with under eye baggage.</li>
            <li> It has minimized the &amp;#34;11&amp;#34; lines between the eyes and forehead wrinkles.  No bad smell, not greasy.  This is the only source I&#x27;ve found with the active ingredient in it.  It&#x27;s not available in the U.S.A.</li>
            <li> This reduces puffiness and lines around my eyes in the morning, without the greasiness of the original Preparation H product. It is creamy, and absorbs quickly, not leaving behind any trace that it was there, other than a dewy, fresh appearance to the skin. It is a small jar, but a fingertip amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Saw this cream as I was looking for perparation h ointments to keep my skin tight. The details indicated that the cream helped to tighten the skin. I figured it was worth the try since the reviews and details compared the cream to preparation h. The package came rather quickly however the cream did not live up to the description. I would send it back but it&#x27;s already open. If you want a skin tightening cream I&#x27;d just go with perparation h!</li>
            <li> Problem with a cosmetic item like this is trying to decide if it works.  I wouldn&#x27;t bet the farm but I am convinced I&#x27;ve seen improvement in my morning bags. I would buy this item again so it might be worth a try for you....</li>
            <li> Well packaged; seems to work very well--pleased with the results thus far.  Small enough to pack for travel and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is ok as a moisture cream but a bit pricey for the small amount if you just use it a cream . I have almost finished the jar and have not noticed any tightening of the neck or face. So I continue my search for the perfect skin tightening /wrinkle cream.</li>
            <li> It was recommended as a product to keep wrinkles at bay.  I don&#x27;t know if this is true yet because I haven&#x27;t used it very long.  But I do like the way my face feels.</li>
            <li> The most amazing cream I have ever used I just love it I suffer from rosacea and for the first time in twenty years my face looks great I highly recommend this face cream and will defiantly continue using it</li>
            <li> Fair  seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> I had surgery and after 6 days my scars started to fade. That was amazing. I will recommend that to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years old and I decided to purchase this cream because I heard about Preparation-H usage being an effective way to reduce wrinkles. This is my second jar..... well what can I say .. when I tried this cream the first time after about a week a saw an improvement in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face and neck. I would highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day around my eyes, and I like the results! I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent wrinkle reducer and lasts a long time! I plan on using it as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> I use the cream before bed and when I wake up in the morning and I can really  tell a big difference in my face</li>
            <li> Bought for wife- she seems pleased.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do as promised. The only difference is that my skin feels softer. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months</li>
            <li> I like it. Thick and goes a long way. Waiting to see if it works.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was pretty good but it did not solve the problem I bought it for which was dark circles and undereye bags</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a month and it really does seem to help with those bags under the eyes. I have some eye allergies and get those bags under the eyes; and this cream does seem to help. I have found that it will take some time so better to put on a thin layer just before going to bed, and then the morning there is improvement; to see for yourself, put some around only one eye and then check out the difference when you get up. I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Everything is good. Customer service is quick to respond. No effect seen yet. It is hard to say that whether it works, since skin care is a long-term solution. I will update when hope and change realize.</li>
            <li> It seems to be light yet makes my skin feel soft and smooth.  I do not like heavy or greasy feel of a lot of other creams.  I use this during the day under a BB cream and it has a natural feel.  I am reordering, the jar did last a long time and you do not have to use much.  I can&#x27;t say if it tightens or not but I do like it and will continue using it and hope to get some benefits fro mit as well as just being a nice day cream.</li>
            <li> DONT REALLY SEE ANY .RESULTS BEEN USING FOR A MONTH</li>
            <li> This sucks! Made in USA not Canada. Would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this product did not like the feel of it ,didn&#x27;t even make my skin smoother or firmer...absolutely no difference ,don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money...</li>
            <li> Have no results. Nothing like prep h cream or ointment with live yeast in it. Will not buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> This did nothing to the puffiness of my upper lids, unfortunately, but otherwise it&#x27;s okay. If you have puffy eyes (and face), in the morning especially, get thyroid and cortisol support and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I am still trying it, I need to work on how to use this cream, I hope it does work it would be nice to help with the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Men like to take care of themselves too!  Perfect for those puffy lids and tired eyes. And no one has to know. Super product!</li>
