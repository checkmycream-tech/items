            <li>These work amazingly well</li>
            <li>so very glad to be able to order on line.  </li>

            <li>I love these tooth picks, used to get them from my dentist 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I love these tooth pics, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>

            <li>SO MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE OUT OF THEM.  </li>
            <li>WE WOULD LIKE TO ORDER MORE WITH OUT THE CASE.  </li>
            <li>I use these more thAn</li>
            <li>Very convenient, very effective.</li>
            <li>Handy &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; and the firm point combine to make this the perfect picking tool,&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>First tried these as samples from a dentist and found them easier to use and more effective for my teeth than most dental floss.</li>
            <li>still the best thing out there hands down.</li>
            <li>Clean easily.  </li>
            <li>recommended by my hygienist a great alternative to wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li>this is the one to use, just make sure you use them right.  </li>
            <li>really helps prevent plaque build-up and stimulates the gums to keep them healthy.</li>
            <li>The Rotadent Rota-point interdental cleaners are simple and easy to use, and are washable &amp; reusable (many times.)  </li>
            <li>I am buying them because un of the other brands on the market are as good.</li>
            <li>They are easy to keep anywhere - near my desk, in my fanny pack, in the car, so I use them all the time and notice the difference.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And when you use them once to twice a day and there is 2 of you, they go pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>Now they want so much for them</li>
            <li>They really protect your gum tissue.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;they really get in between the teeth and easier than flossing.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very portable.</li>
            <li>AT A TIME IT COST TO MUCH.</li>
            <li>love these little toothpicks!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently some people have a stickier &amp;#34;biofilm&amp;#34; which creates more plaque and using these little picks after every meal and snack</li>
            <li>I see they finally updated the quantity/packaging info after everyone including myself was flipping over the new price !&lt;</li>
            <li>The main key for me is the versatility.</li>
            <li>,still,it&#x27;s a bit price for a small box full of plastic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved these toothpicks.  But the price is getting out of control, I use to be in Dentistry for 33 years.  And after I retired I could still get 1000 for $25.00.  Now they want so much for them and you can&#x27;t get them in the bag of 1000.  And when you use them once to twice a day and there is 2 of you, they go pretty fast.  They are now making them in the town where I grow up Lompoc, CA but you can&#x27;t buy them from Denmat there.  You have to be a Dentist,  which is crazy for toothpicks.  The Dentist I worked for there hands the little containers of them to his patients.  And you use to be able to buy them at a pharmacy but not now.  But if you want a good toothpick for your dental health this is the one to use, just make sure you use them right.  They really protect your gum tissue.  The wooden ones are so hard on your gum tissue.  So if you don&#x27;t mind the money these are great.  I am buying them because un of the other brands on the market are as good.</li>
            <li> Had used these for years and was having a hard time finding them.  Of course Amazon.</li>
            <li> These are thicker than the ones the dentist gave me. I like them.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Used to get thru dentist ....  so very glad to be able to order on line.  the very best of the best tooth pick on the market!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for these since moving to another state.  My dentist had given these as samples after a cleaning and they are the best.  I get an excellent report on the condition of my teeth and gums each visit and it is a result of using these daily.</li>
            <li> These pick cleaners are the best</li>
            <li> In the area of dental health, a multi-pronged attack is necessary. The Rotadent Rota-Point Interdental Cleaners are a valuable addition to brushing, flossing and a water pick. And, it fits neatly into my wallet, so I always have one with me. Very convenient, very effective.</li>
            <li> love these little toothpicks!&lt;br /&gt;they really get in between the teeth and easier than flossing.</li>
            <li> I love these tooth picks, used to get them from my dentist 20 years ago. Every dentist I&#x27;ve been to says they can&#x27;t tell I don&#x27;t floss because I use these. Washable, reusable.</li>
            <li> Have used these for 20 years and wouldn&#x27;t be without them; perfect for the tricky tunnels. My gum health is superb.</li>
            <li> The Rotadent Rota-point interdental cleaners are simple and easy to use, and are washable &amp; reusable (many times.)  I prefer them over the wooden interdental sticks, especially for removing debris from between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Handy &amp;#34;handle&amp;#34; and the firm point combine to make this the perfect picking tool,&lt;br /&gt;but,still,it&#x27;s a bit price for a small box full of plastic.</li>
            <li> Best available.  Used them for 25 years.  Never wear out.  Clean easily.  Cut way down on plaque buildup and cavities.</li>
            <li> Great product for folks like me who hate to floss.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get along without these toothpicks - excecellent !</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and always carry 2-3 with me at all times.</li>
            <li> I use a roto point every day.  Love them.</li>
            <li> recommended by my hygienist a great alternative to wooden toothpicks.</li>
            <li> Use them all the time.</li>
            <li> I see they finally updated the quantity/packaging info after everyone including myself was flipping over the new price !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old review on the previous version already, but simply put...these are expensive but still the best thing out there hands down. The main key for me is the versatility. They work well in tight spaces as well as larger spaces, Nothing else I have tried could do that. They last for awhile too, just do not stab yourself with them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these since I had root planing done. I can&#x27;t use floss because my hands are crippled. These work amazingly well and they&#x27;re very portable.</li>
            <li> i have been using for years</li>
            <li> Have used them before and do like them.</li>
            <li> I like the style of the toothpicks and service was prompt.</li>
            <li> I like using this product to remove food from between the teeth.  I have seen similar products but these are the best.</li>
            <li> I love these tooth pics, won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;picks&amp;#34; are wonderful and effective. We have used them for 20 years. They are reusable over and over and over. Great for cleaning under bridges, too. We never leave home without one.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE AND I JUST LOVE YOUR ROTA-POINT. WE USE TO ORDER A 1000 AT A TIME AND NOW AT ONLY 30 AT A TIME IT COST TO MUCH. SO MOST OF THE TIME WE ARE OUT OF THEM.  WE WOULD LIKE TO ORDER MORE WITH OUT THE CASE.  WOULD IT BE LESS IN COST.  THANK YOU ROBERT JOHNSON  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF POSSABLE.</li>
            <li> My dentist&#x27;s office recommended this because I tend to build up plaque even though I floss daily and brush regulary with a Sonicare. Apparently some people have a stickier &amp;#34;biofilm&amp;#34; which creates more plaque and using these little picks after every meal and snack really helps prevent plaque build-up and stimulates the gums to keep them healthy. They are easy to keep anywhere - near my desk, in my fanny pack, in the car, so I use them all the time and notice the difference.</li>
            <li> First tried these as samples from a dentist and found them easier to use and more effective for my teeth than most dental floss.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I use to only get them from my dentist, I am so happy to find them here.  I use these more thAn floss mand my dental check are great! And have been for years!</li>
