            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>They were delivered fast.</li>
            <li>She wants hers done with a cat.  </li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>We love Hello Kitty and these are cute and they stay on long for little hands.</li>
            <li>These little stickers are very cute (possibly knockoffs, but that just adds humor and character, right?)</li>
            <li>so she did a coat of the color I wanted and let it dry in the UV light.</li>
            <li>I got all my hello kitty stickers on time and complete!!</li>
            <li>I love these for my little girls when they come to do nails.</li>
            <li>They r cute little designs 4 Hello kitt.</li>
            <li>We found it (the actual size) of the stickers was a bit large, and didn&#x27;t fit so well on fingernails, especially children&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Cute little nail decals!</li>
            <li>They are easy to stick on and last for a long time, if you put a coat of clear polish over it  </li>
            <li>They lay practically flat on the nail and you only need one top coat to protect it, since they are so flat.</li>
            <li>Recommend a couple coats of clear topcoat as the stickers start sliding around eventually</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 3 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>You could also use them as Party Favors for all kinds of functions, and for young or old.</li>
            <li>She was an adult.</li>
            <li>Each design was smaller than I had anticipated but my grand daughter has small nails</li>
            <li>The are cute, but the stickers are a bit thick, so they so to stay on as long as the thinner ones.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that they be small enough for her tiny little nails, and indeed, most of them are!  </li>
            <li>The decals are a bit small, more for little girl nails.</li>

            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> We love Hello Kitty and these are cute and they stay on long for little hands.</li>
            <li> These little stickers are very cute (possibly knockoffs, but that just adds humor and character, right?)</li>
            <li> so she did a coat of the color I wanted and let it dry in the UV light.</li>
            <li> I got all my hello kitty stickers on time and complete!!</li>
            <li> I love these for my little girls when they come to do nails.</li>
            <li> They r cute little designs 4 Hello kitt.</li>
            <li> We found it (the actual size) of the stickers was a bit large, and didn&#x27;t fit so well on fingernails, especially children&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Cute little nail decals!</li>
            <li> They are easy to stick on and last for a long time, if you put a coat of clear polish over it  </li>
            <li> They lay practically flat on the nail and you only need one top coat to protect it, since they are so flat.</li>
            <li> Recommend a couple coats of clear topcoat as the stickers start sliding around eventually</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 3 year old granddaughter.  </li>
            <li> You could also use them as Party Favors for all kinds of functions, and for young or old.</li>
            <li> She was an adult.</li>
            <li> Each design was smaller than I had anticipated but my grand daughter has small nails</li>
            <li> The are cute, but the stickers are a bit thick, so they so to stay on as long as the thinner ones.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they be small enough for her tiny little nails, and indeed, most of them are!  </li>
            <li> The decals are a bit small, more for little girl nails.</li>
            <li> Shipping was slow but product made it worth it.will buy again.</li>
            <li> They have a hard time staying on your nail at first</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last too long, but what can you expect from nail decals?  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> and they would not fit her 3 year old nails.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has had a couple on her toenails now for a couple of weeks, so they last longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and they last FOREVER when you use a base coat and cover with a clear top coat.</li>
            <li> I only wanted them a little bigger because I do nails</li>
            <li> Applied my nail polish, let dry</li>
            <li> And she can always wait to use the ones that are a little bigger!  </li>
            <li> A little bigger</li>
            <li> They also arrived way before I expected them to come in.</li>
            <li> Each package has quite a few stickers.</li>
            <li> I bought them for my 3 year old daughters who are obsessed with hello kitty.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how well they work but purley based on looks</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and am hard on my fingernails, these lasted.</li>
            <li> I mean over a week.</li>
            <li> Hello Kitty assorted nail stickers and 3 of the packs have a subtle glitter to them.  </li>
            <li> As soon as i get them ill be ordering the dotting tools from you</li>
            <li> I got this for my 16 year niece who is obsessed with Hello kitty.</li>

            <li> I purchased these nail stickers for my sister who loves hello kitty and doing her nails. At first I wasn&#x27;t so sure about the quality because of the price; but my sister loves them and said they work perfectly. She said they stick on and stay on. They also arrived way before I expected them to come in. I&#x27;ll probably buy them again in the future.</li>
            <li> I gave her 5 stars because I did receive the product in good conditions exactly what what was offered. So happy with my HK stickers. I am using them in my nails as well as in my cell &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Very cute I love them!!!</li>
            <li> Adorable! Water decals are always easy to use.</li>
            <li> So cute, and very tiny with a glitter shine. Very fragile when removing them from the sheet otherwise easy to apply, and with a nice shiny top coat it looks so adorable.</li>
            <li> well.. im still waiting on the stickers. As soon as i get them ill be ordering the dotting tools from you (:  i hope i receive them soon....</li>

            <li> I love all the designs and the quality is great!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how inexpensive these are how can you go wrong?! I had the girl who does my nails put these on for me. I always get a gel manicure so she did a coat of the color I wanted and let it dry in the UV light. Then she put the stickers on. Put the clear gel top coat on and let them dry under the UV light. I have had them on for about a week now and one of them is about to peel off :(  A couple of them are close to peeling off but the rest look great! The stickers themselves are really cute and sparkely! Great for the price but be careful not to touch the adhesive when putting on!</li>
            <li> great and easy with tweezers!!</li>
            <li> The decals are a bit small, more for little girl nails. I only wanted them a little bigger because I do nails but I&#x27;ll still make them work!</li>
            <li> Works as described and looks as depicted.</li>

            <li> I bought these for my 3 year old granddaughter.  I was concerned that they be small enough for her tiny little nails, and indeed, most of them are!

            <li> These are super cute. I ordered them for my daughter who loves Hello Kitty. They are easy to use and nice quality.</li>
            <li> These are cute for having fun looking nails. They lay practically flat on the nail and you only need one top coat to protect it, since they are so flat. The top coat does not affect the stickers that are glittery either!</li>

            <li> These nail stickers r fun and easy to use. I recieved 5 packages only 2 were duplicate.  They have a hard time staying on your nail at first so u really have to make sure everything is dry b4 u stick it on your nail .. Shipping was good took a little while to get to me but hey for the price I&#x27;ll wait..</li>

            <li> So many in this package!  My daughter has had a couple on her toenails now for a couple of weeks, so they last longer than I expected.  I feel this was a great deal for us. It makes my daugher and her friends happy and that it what matters most.</li>
