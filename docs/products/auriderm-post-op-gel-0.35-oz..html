            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a dramatic difference in healing time for bruises, but it works AMAZING for undereye circles.  </li>
            <li>Not really seeing much of a difference in bruising after application...</li>
            <li>but I noticed after a couple days that my dark circles under my eyes (which were not severe in the first place, but were definitely noticable)</li>
            <li>As some other reviewers mentioned, it does have an odd smell, but it is not unpleasant.</li>

            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product a little over 2 months and haven&#x27;t used it properly because my allergies require frequent nose blowing</li>
            <li> I think this is better than ANY typical expensive \\&quot;department store brand\\&quot; cream or serum you can buy for dark undereye circles.</li>

            <li> I had read some years back that products with Vitamin K Oxide could reduce the broken vessels appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I learned about it when I had some Botox and fillers injected around my eye area a few years ago, and they gave me a tube of Auriderm for any bruising that may occur from the needles.</li>
            <li> I only use a mineral-based powder makeup as my overall base makeup, but no extra concealer around the eyes whatsoever.</li>
            <li> 2 months so far with vague results....</li>
            <li> I got minor broken blood vessels around my nose 15 years ago as a result of heavy caffeine consumption.</li>
            <li> not sure if this works.  </li>
            <li> So small for the price</li>
            <li> Despite that, I have noticed a difference on one set of broken blood vessels.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I had fat grafting done and I know without using this product my bruising would have still be noticeable at 2 weeks, but it was zero by the end of 12 days.  I bruise easily, too!  I keep it on hand when I have any fillers or procedures done.</li>
            <li> Worked very well on my bruising style facial VBeam laser treatment.  My only wish is that I had ordered it earlier, as I ordered it the day I got the treatment and had to ship express one day.  Next time I will be ordering ahead of time.  Noticed a good amount of reduction in the bruises and redness - excellent product!!!  Highly recommend and I found studies online that talk about it.  Be sure to order it from DERMAdoctor, they have great service and the product arrived as promised.  Can&#x27;t say more about this product and DERMAdoctor products (an Amazon.com reseller), as they are wonderful.  And this says a lot, as I have Amazon Prime and normally don&#x27;t order anything but prime eligible items.</li>
            <li> Worked OK but was looking for quicker results</li>
            <li> Great stuff after fillers</li>
            <li> The product just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Not really seeing much of a difference in bruising after application...not sure if this works.  I wish there was a &#x27;star&#x27; for &amp;#34;Not sure how I feel about it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I got minor broken blood vessels around my nose 15 years ago as a result of heavy caffeine consumption. They have always bothered me. I had read some years back that products with Vitamin K Oxide could reduce the broken vessels appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this product a little over 2 months and haven&#x27;t used it properly because my allergies require frequent nose blowing &amp; I end up wiping the product away. Despite that, I have noticed a difference on one set of broken blood vessels. I just ordered more of it &amp; will post back with results in a few months.</li>
            <li> I recently had revision to lower eyelid surgery.  I read all the on -line reviews and decided to try Auriderm Post Op gel.  My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t know about this wonderful product during my first surgery!  The brusing went from a deep purple to lighter in color with yellow tinge overnight.  I am going to tell my plastic surgeon about this gel.  This should be offered/recommended to all patients after plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> Used with SinEcch, bruises gone in a week!</li>
            <li> i am so happy to find this product on Amazon because my dr. stopped carrying it.  I have used it for bruising in the past and, in spite of my skepticism, it has been extremely effective for me.  When i use this product my bruises resolve in at about 1/2 the time they would normally take to resolve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of procedures done on my face that left bruising. The doctor finally told me about Auriderm and had it in her office. So, I bought and used it after a procedure. I was amazed at how well it worked. There was only slight evidence of bruising in one area but none in the others. I highly recommend this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> Great for bruising! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different &amp;#34;bruising relief&amp;#34; products.  Some were really good however Auriderm has been the most effective in reducing bruising.</li>
            <li> I absolutely L-O-V-E Auriderm! I learned about it when I had some Botox and fillers injected around my eye area a few years ago, and they gave me a tube of Auriderm for any bruising that may occur from the needles. I didn&#x27;t have a lot of brusing but I noticed after a couple days that my dark circles under my eyes (which were not severe in the first place, but were definitely noticable) had virtually disappeared overnight!!!!! I didn&#x27;t even KNOW that this was a \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; of the cream! I was only using it for bruising! I was THRILLED beyone belief, and the effects actually lasted a very long time. To this day I no longer wear any under-eye concealer at all. I only use a mineral-based powder makeup as my overall base makeup, but no extra concealer around the eyes whatsoever. I think this is better than ANY typical expensive \\&quot;department store brand\\&quot; cream or serum you can buy for dark undereye circles. I&#x27;m really surprised that more people here didn&#x27;t have a good experience with it. By the way, it was the \\&quot;Post-Op Gel\\&quot; that I used, not any of the other products.</li>

            <li> Great product for ALL bruising. Shipper was very helpful and accommodating in the end. They have a large selection of great products I have used over the last ten years. Amazing prices too. I&#x27;ve used them twice and will watch for continued low prices/shipping.</li>
            <li> 2 months so far with vague results....it is a little overpriced for its quality. I am trying it for a few more weeks but I won&#x27;t recommend it for immediate results....</li>
            <li> So small for the price</li>
            <li> This works great, and a little bit goes a long way. So happy to find it here.</li>
