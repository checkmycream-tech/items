    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is a great product and was just how it was described.</li>
            <li>Great idea: cordless, swivel head , I can cut hair myself.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is great and always a pleasure to be here, good job Amazon.</li>
            <li>this is a good one.</li>
            <li>I think the product is good for use。My friend like it。I bought it as a gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>Good product at this price.</li>
            <li>It is quite good.</li>
            <li>Good price; paid for itself with one haircut.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Would have liked a charging station, but the included charging cable works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A nice carrying case and perhaps a beard trimmer attachment would make this the swiss-army knife of self-shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This clipper does what it says, allows you to cut your own hair with the swivel head.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking piece of hardware too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This set is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>good, it has good quality and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I was happy with it for the first couple months, until the smallest head broke.</li>
            <li>and you can easily clip your hairs on your own without any assistance from others .</li>
            <li>I would use scissors on top if I did it over again.</li>
            <li>After owning the qc5510 for a couple of days, I can say that the qc5530 is a much better purchase.</li>
            <li>If you have a clipper set already and hope this does a better job, I&#x27;d suggest you save the money.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Still, this model is sturdy and does an OK job.</li>
            <li>This is a good price product, and I like it and now using it to cut child&#x27;s hair very well.</li>
            <li>Also you can easily take it apart for wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat under-powered and the length adjuster is a plastic piece that can be over tightened easily.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing this product, I can easily trim my head at 1/8 inch all over whenever I want to.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice product.</li>
            <li>but i really love this product its quick and easy to use</li>
            <li>The clipper works fine.</li>
            <li>Cheap is cheap.</li>
            <li>Light weighted and cheap.</li>
            <li>it was fantastic</li>
            <li>Cheap.  </li>
            <li>it was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is it&#x27;s a great product as long as you don&#x27;t want your cut any higher than approx.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, even with the super saver.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not designed to be strong, exposing certain adjoining areas to too much strength, and it&#x27;s made of cheap material.</li>
            <li>Good for a buzz cut, NOT long enough to style in any way at all if you use it on top.</li>
            <li>It is worth for your money~~~, I like it</li>
            <li>The price is so worth it.</li>
            <li>anyway, worth to have one.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>had to remove the whole thing and clean it</li>
            <li>The small attachment is great for hair lengths of #1 or lower</li>
            <li>i have been using them since few months are they are very good and the best available, this product has few settings only .. by which you can only use to cut your hair at shorter length, there is an other product which has more settings with regards the hair length with inbuilt charging facility and which is also water resistance and only cost some $ more then this one .</li>
            <li>After the first few cuts, I LOVED this product.</li>
            <li>First of all, I received this shaver for $10 on a coupon promotion, and couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>So much easier to use!</li>
            <li>you are able to use clippers for your entire head, then I can see this clipper will work well.  </li>
            <li>No complaints, but if you want a very short cut, you&#x27;d be better off doing the research to find another brand or model.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I can cut my hair myself, even the back, and people say I look cute too.  </li>
            <li>if you trim your hair at setting 5  or higher , still it takes a bite  of hair  , and it also depends what position you hold it..</li>
            <li>: Easy to adjust the height of the blade rather than constantly switching out the blade guide!</li>
            <li>It has a tilting blade head which can tilt 180 degrees which makes it easy to trim the hair on the back of your head.</li>
            <li>I had to purely use the large attachment.</li>
            <li>Again, great idea, just poorly executed in the quality of the attachment.</li>
            <li>The 180-degree head provides a much easier experience in shaving my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>Very efficient.  </li>
            <li>The dial LIES and this cuts the hair much much shorter.  </li>
            <li>Altho both cuts are straight forward.</li>
            <li>The older one has a closer setting for hair cuts, which I prefer.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my pubic hair.  </li>
            <li>steady.  </li>
            <li>Now, I only need her to just check and clean the back, and blend in the cuts in certain areas!</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy this product for just a few dollars more than the lower end version, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li>Works well, but the guider broke through normal use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried do it yourself clippers before and they ended up disappointing me, but these here didn&#x27;t with the rotating head it truly makes it easy to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend if you have really coarse hair, may not be strong enough.</li>
            <li>That makes me think Philips is trying to trick me into buying a new clipper because of a plastic part that is supposed to be replaceable by design.</li>
            <li>And you know what, yes I am going to buy a new clipper, but it will not be a Norelco.</li>
            <li>A built in battery and several different heads earn this product a definite ok with me.</li>
            <li>Large attachment only for &#x27;70&#x27;s style cut</li>
            <li>However, it has considerably lessened the need for my wife to do all of my haircut.</li>
            <li>If you look at the geometry of the comb, you wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised why it breaks -</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old one.</li>
            <li>WOW.  </li>
            <li>I should have gotten a $12 set of old style clippers from the drugstore with lots of spacers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is replacing an older model that finally died on me.</li>
            <li>This product is very convinience and you can decide how long you want you hair to be.</li>
            <li>I used the small attachment for the back and sides of my hair and the larger attachment for the top.</li>
            <li>No other parts or spacers to get longer hair.  </li>
            <li>The only con is it doesn&#x27;t have battery, but  thanks the charger wire is long enough for me.</li>
            <li>The only complain (but a major one)</li>
            <li>Usually for me, I use clippers on the sides and slight trim on the top then blend in the top/sides together.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, but you need someone else to help you and very hard to do it by yourself.</li>
            <li>Bought this based on  the cool look and design.. it actually sucks.  </li>
            <li>You can create a custom stylish look for a plain and simple buzz cut with a little practice and patience.</li>

            <li> You can create a custom stylish look for a plain and simple buzz cut with a little practice and patience.</li>
            <li> I ended up using my older machine to fix the mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years with other types of standard clippers and this by far beats them all.</li>
            <li> At least this one was not expensive and this time no Norelco rebates as baits.</li>
            <li> It broke after a while, and based on other people&#x27;s review, obviously I&#x27;m not the only one having this problem.</li>
            <li> why did it take so long for us to figure this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Long cord btw.</li>
            <li> Quiet, lightweight and smooth cutting.</li>
            <li> Well you can choose to pay much more for other Norelco products, but sadly below average quality again.</li>
            <li> it allowed for a wide variety of lengths and styles.</li>
            <li> I guess it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Often you have to go over the same spot few times.  </li>
            <li> It cut my hair unevenly and left lines on my head.  </li>
            <li> What should other customers know when considering this item?&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> (In other words, if you apply any sort of pressure as you run the clippers over your head, the guard flexes, thus giving you a shorter length than what you set it at.)&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> The learning curve to use this is very minimal.</li>
            <li> My previous Philishave Clippers lasted 8 years, so I went with this one over other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the design of the head was poor, It just cant last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***This is Version 2 of my review as I was corrected in one of my previous statements.</li>
            <li> This is lighter, less noise and cut hair faster.</li>
            <li> Also, if you&#x27;re looking for little extras like trimmers, this item is not for you.</li>
            <li> I admit that when I first received it, I was very skeptical that it would work.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for over 15 years and this machine was terrible.</li>
            <li> Well, after 3-4 uses, the small attachment broke in a manner that would not allow me to change the length settings.</li>
            <li> and usually cut it at the 7/8\\&quot; mark.</li>
            <li> BUT, the small attachment broke rendering it USELESS.</li>
            <li> but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> Rip-off the customer rather than fix the problem.</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten quite thin and my haircuts were on record as an 1/8 inch all over.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to cut and was clogging a lot even though I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is intentional, but it made it difficult to get an even length.</li>
            <li> Trimmer length guard snapped after about a year of use, so the clippers are virtually useless now.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult with cleaning</li>
            <li> The small attachment is a piece of worthless junk.</li>
            <li> Bought this in the summer of 2011 with the intention of cutting my hair every 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> However, it is still awkward motion to do this yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any bad comments.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed the times it worked</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer on sale and hated it.  </li>

At least this one was not expensive and this time no Norelco rebates as baits. That is a plus. Never Norelco again. Amazon is great and always a pleasure to be here, good job Amazon.</li>
            <li> An adjustable clipper? why did it take so long for us to figure this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the maximum height is #5. That&#x27;s way too short for my hair. Good for a buzz cut, NOT long enough to style in any way at all if you use it on top. I would use scissors on top if I did it over again.</li>
            <li> Bought this in the summer of 2011 with the intention of cutting my hair every 2-3 weeks. After the first few cuts, I LOVED this product. I used the small attachment for the back and sides of my hair and the larger attachment for the top. Well, after 3-4 uses, the small attachment broke in a manner that would not allow me to change the length settings. I had to purely use the large attachment. The small attachment is great for hair lengths of #1 or lower so it was a shame to lose this piece. I searched for replacement attachments but could not find them online. Again, great idea, just poorly executed in the quality of the attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for about 3 yrs. and usually cut it at the 7/8\\&quot; mark. I didn&#x27;t realize that this product only does a max of 5/8\\&quot; and that when i used that setting I got about 1/4\\&quot;. Bottom line is it&#x27;s a great product as long as you don&#x27;t want your cut any higher than approx. 1/4\\&quot;. That&#x27;s too short for me so I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> Just got my hair cut with my wife&#x27;s help. this is a good one. Light weighted and cheap. It does not have a lot of accessories but who cares?</li>
            <li> First of all, I received this shaver for $10 on a coupon promotion, and couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I admit that when I first received it, I was very skeptical that it would work. However, it has considerably lessened the need for my wife to do all of my haircut. Now, I only need her to just check and clean the back, and blend in the cuts in certain areas! What a time saver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Easy to adjust the height of the blade rather than constantly switching out the blade guide! So much easier to use! The 180-degree head provides a much easier experience in shaving my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Would have liked a charging station, but the included charging cable works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: A nice carrying case and perhaps a beard trimmer attachment would make this the swiss-army knife of self-shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This is Version 2 of my review as I was corrected in one of my previous statements. Thank you!***</li>
            <li> Just received this product, charged it up and trimmed my hair with it. After owning the qc5510 for a couple of days, I can say that the qc5530 is a much better purchase. Shipping was quick, even with the super saver. The four heads and attatchments that came with it allowed for a wide variety of lengths and styles. A built in battery and several different heads earn this product a definite ok with me. Do yourself a favor and buy this product for just a few dollars more than the lower end version, you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> i have been using them since few months are they are very good and the best available, this product has few settings only .. by which you can only use to cut your hair at shorter length, there is an other product which has more settings with regards the hair length with inbuilt charging facility and which is also water resistance and only cost some $ more then this one . but i really love this product its quick and easy to use and you can easily clip your hairs on your own without any assistance from others .</li>
            <li> The clipper works fine. The only complain (but a major one) I have is that the plastic comb is made with low quality. It broke after a while, and based on other people&#x27;s review, obviously I&#x27;m not the only one having this problem. If you look at the geometry of the comb, you wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised why it breaks - it&#x27;s not designed to be strong, exposing certain adjoining areas to too much strength, and it&#x27;s made of cheap material. If that&#x27;s the only thing about it I would&#x27;ve given it a 3 star. What pisses me off is you can not find a replacement part! That makes me think Philips is trying to trick me into buying a new clipper because of a plastic part that is supposed to be replaceable by design. And you know what, yes I am going to buy a new clipper, but it will not be a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift. I didn&#x27;t get any bad comments.  I guess it worked as expected.</li>
            <li> This clipper does what it says, allows you to cut your own hair with the swivel head.  However, it is still awkward motion to do this yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are able to use clippers for your entire head, then I can see this clipper will work well.  Usually for me, I use clippers on the sides and slight trim on the top then blend in the top/sides together.  If you don&#x27;t already have a clipper set, this could be an in-between haircut solution.  It should save you some money after saving yourself one visit but I wouldn&#x27;t depend on it as the only haircut solution.  If you have a clipper set already and hope this does a better job, I&#x27;d suggest you save the money.</li>
            <li> I think the product is good for use。My friend like it。I bought it as a gift for my friend. Good product at this price.</li>
            <li> This hair clipper works okay but the quality is poor. It&#x27;s somewhat under-powered and the length adjuster is a plastic piece that can be over tightened easily. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Works well, but the guider broke through normal use.  No, I did not drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decent battery life too.  I would not recommend if you have really coarse hair, may not be strong enough.</li>
            <li> Not cordless h haven&#x27;t used it and probably won&#x27;t either</li>
            <li> The cord is shorting out after just the second use.  I was so disappointed the times it worked it was fantastic</li>
            <li> This is a great product and was just how it was described. I am very pleased with my purchase. Thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old one. This is lighter, less noise and cut hair faster. Just bought a second one for gift.</li>
            <li> This is replacing an older model that finally died on me. The older one has a closer setting for hair cuts, which I prefer. Still, this model is sturdy and does an OK job. No complaints, but if you want a very short cut, you&#x27;d be better off doing the research to find another brand or model. Also, if you&#x27;re looking for little extras like trimmers, this item is not for you.</li>
            <li> It is quite good. But it is not convenient without battery. a a a a a a a a a</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried do it yourself clippers before and they ended up disappointing me, but these here didn&#x27;t with the rotating head it truly makes it easy to cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> Great idea: cordless, swivel head , I can cut hair myself. BUT, the small attachment broke rendering it USELESS. The medium attachment broke but still can be used. Large attachment only for &#x27;70&#x27;s style cut so I do not use at all.The small attachment is a piece of worthless junk. I needed this one for trimming mustache and beard so now resort to scissors. I would not recommend this razor to anyone because of the defects. How did the folks at Philips allow this to happen?? Rip-off the customer rather than fix the problem. THEY KNEW it was a problem during testing. I&#x27;ll buy Panasonic now.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to cut and was clogging a lot even though I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair.  Often you have to go over the same spot few times.  Used it once and never again.  Definitely not recommended</li>
            <li> good, it has good quality and reasonable price. I strongly recommend it. It is worth for your money~~~, I like it</li>
            <li> This is a good price product, and I like it and now using it to cut child&#x27;s hair very well.Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Get&#x27;s the job done.  I use it mainly for my pubic hair.  Very efficient.  Cheap.  steady.  Solid.  Buy this if you are looking for a clipper to use at home.  Long cord btw.</li>
            <li> What should other customers know when considering this item?&lt;br /&gt;What aspects of this item do you like or dislike?&lt;br /&gt;How do you use this item?&lt;br /&gt;What similar items have you used?</li>
            <li> I was happy with it for the first couple months, until the smallest head broke. the design of the head was poor, It just cant last long.</li>
            <li> I can cut my hair myself, even the back, and people say I look cute too.  The price is so worth it.</li>
            <li> There is a dial setting for the length of hair you want. The dial LIES and this cuts the hair much much shorter.  I had it set to the longest hair setting and was going for it then saw my buzzz cut. Once I started it was too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS  Quiet, lightweight and smooth cutting. Nice looking piece of hardware too.&lt;br /&gt;CONS  I have a buzz cut!  No other parts or spacers to get longer hair.  The dial READ that the hair would be longer but let me tell you it is NOT!!  WOW.  I should have gotten a $12 set of old style clippers from the drugstore with lots of spacers!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just call me Buzz Cut Jackson for now.  I would not recommend this unless you are into short short hair- it was comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I used it on my son who is 4 and my fiance who has african american hair. Altho both cuts are straight forward.</li>
            <li> easy to use, but you need someone else to help you and very hard to do it by yourself. anyway, worth to have one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer on sale and hated it.  I have cut my own hair for over 15 years and this machine was terrible. It cut my hair unevenly and left lines on my head.  I ended up using my older machine to fix the mess.</li>
            <li> When i ordered the clipper it said it had a \\&quot;long-life litium ion battery\\&quot; that powered the clipper for one hour before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;the clipper i received was corded only .... beware</li>
            <li> Good price; paid for itself with one haircut. Lightweight, easy-to-use/grip. My previous Philishave Clippers lasted 8 years, so I went with this one over other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-- Trimmer length guard flexes quite a bit. I don&#x27;t know if this is intentional, but it made it difficult to get an even length. (In other words, if you apply any sort of pressure as you run the clippers over your head, the guard flexes, thus giving you a shorter length than what you set it at.)&lt;br /&gt;-- Trimmer length guard snapped after about a year of use, so the clippers are virtually useless now. I guess I&#x27;ll toss these out and upgrade to the Pro-Clippers.</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten quite thin and my haircuts were on record as an 1/8 inch all over.  Since purchasing this product, I can easily trim my head at 1/8 inch all over whenever I want to.  It works as a Norelco shaver should work and has saved me the cost of the clipper with only two trims.  People I see every day comment on my being &amp;#34;freshly&amp;#34; trimmed all of the time.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice product. You can cut your hair with 5 length variations. Pretty easy to handle. A bit difficult with cleaning but I guess that it is the same with all hair clippers. It has a tilting blade head which can tilt 180 degrees which makes it easy to trim the hair on the back of your head. You can remove the trim length set and use it for precision cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, it helps save $17 a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good one. I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> Bought this based on  the cool look and design.. it actually sucks.  the hair gets stuck in the rotator and makes screeching noise  and then  stops working.. had to remove the whole thing and clean it before i can proceed.&lt;br /&gt;Also if you trim your hair at setting 5  or higher , still it takes a bite  of hair  , and it also depends what position you hold it..</li>
            <li> This set is very easy to use.  The learning curve to use this is very minimal. You can create a custom stylish look for a plain and simple buzz cut with a little practice and patience. I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for years with other types of standard clippers and this by far beats them all.</li>
