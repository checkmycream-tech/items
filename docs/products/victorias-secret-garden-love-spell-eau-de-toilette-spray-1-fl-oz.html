            <li>I love the way it smells on her</li>
            <li>I really love this</li>
            <li>and I will be getting more soon...</li>
            <li>Love spell (the body spray) has always been my favorite scent to wear.</li>
            <li>spell fragrance for when he comes home :)</li>
            <li>Definitely a favorite scent of mine.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I have had many people inquire as to what the scent was I was wearing.</li>
            <li>I have used it for many years.  </li>
            <li>It shipped really fast... and the product is great.</li>
            <li>I personally love the way it smells as well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume from the moment I smelled it.</li>
            <li>so I recommend it with greater security that you will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li>Been using it for many years.</li>
            <li>I also purchase the body spray, lotion &amp; body butter from Amazon now as well, they all smell fantastic &amp; I love the way they feel on my skin.</li>
            <li>This scent also comes in a wide range of lotion and bath products and they smell great too!</li>
            <li>you get what you pay for - not bad nor really that great.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not as pretty of a bottle, but the same great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many guys, not only tell me I smell good...</li>
            <li>love spell smells sweet but not too sweet.</li>
            <li>I had heard that V Secret was not selling this perfume anymore and was more than excited to find it on Amazon and at this great price!</li>
            <li>My boyfriend, is a super huge fan.</li>
            <li>This arrived pretty quick, and is exactly what it says it is, it smells awesome and lasts longer than the regular body spray.</li>
            <li>bottle is so good for making the fragrance last longer.</li>
            <li>Had people come up to me multiple times to tell me that I smell good.</li>
            <li>More like a terrific body mist/spray than a perfume, but this bottle makes it more convenient to carry in my purse.  </li>
            <li>and I like the older formula better.</li>
            <li>I had it in the past as a hand lotion and body mousse and was a huge fan of both, so when I seen it available as a EDT spray here on Amazon for a great price I was pretty excited.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY sensitive to most perfumes as they make me nauseous.  </li>
            <li>This spray smells exactly like the other Love Spell products: super fruity, almost candy-like in it&#x27;s sweetness, and very light.</li>
            <li>so in love, cannot use any other perfume anymore, give a try, i&#x27;m sure you are not get dissapointed.</li>
            <li>Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t an exhorbitant amount of money to spend on a young teen, and it was what she wanted, so it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Victoria&#x27;s Secret Love Spell scent.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s currently deployed and I&#x27;m stocking up on my love</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t buy the perfume spray for Love Spell anymore through Victoria&#x27;s Secret, so I was thrilled to find it online.  </li>
            <li>It is becoming hard to find however, so I am always glad to see it for sale.</li>
            <li>This particular bottle has been discontiued!</li>
            <li>Although the box was damaged in the delivery and therefore I will not like to give it as a gift as much...</li>
            <li>Very fruity smell, almost life fruit juice.  </li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>Smells cheap and for tiny bompers!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely enticing!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the victoria secret love</li>
            <li>My Daughter introduced me to this scent when Victoria&#x27;s Secret still sold it in the stores, it quickly became my favorite scent!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to try something new or you are sensitive to most perfumes, you should definitely give it  a try.  </li>
            <li>its kind of small though and the box was opened but not used, i believe.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a longer lasting scent than the body spray, but both last a good long time.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this since high school.  </li>
            <li>This is better suited for little girls.  </li>
            <li>The original Love Spell with the jasmine in it, that Victoria&#x27;s Secret no longer carries!  </li>
            <li>... Will be coming back for more of this and other scents...</li>
            <li>I love this perfume it is hard to find</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering smell to it but its not too soft either.</li>
            <li>Its a floral and the other habd its so fresh.</li>
            <li>I only give this 4 stars because the EDT spray doesn&#x27;t last very long for me, but it smells so good that I&#x27;ll just have to keep spraying myself every few hours if that&#x27;s what it takes!  </li>
            <li>I have been using this scent since high school when I first found it at my local Victoria&#x27;s Secret store.  </li>

            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Victoria Secret doesn&#x27;t sell the perfume anymore, I&#x27;m thankful it was available here for a Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> Other than that, average product that I could have gotten cheaper at the VS store....</li>
            <li> The order was handled promptly and received just what I wanted within a few days.</li>
            <li> spray lasts a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this fragnance.jyst waist of mony....</li>
            <li> I have actually (as creepy as it sounds)</li>
            <li> This one I can wear and I don&#x27;t get sick.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I could never get sick of this smell!</li>

In a club one night a dude found me and said \\&quot;yep, I knew it.\\&quot; I looked at him questioningly and he said what I have written as the title of this review. Anyhow, I just wanted to put it out there for all fellow lovespell wearers, the toilette spray is as good as the body-spray, less expensive, and I am finding that I need to use less. Great Product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately Victoria Secret doesn&#x27;t sell the perfume anymore, I&#x27;m thankful it was available here for a Christmas gift! It wasn&#x27;t expected to make it before Christmas but I received it three days before, perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the items I received. Shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the victoria secret love spell.but it disappoint me. I am not happy with this fragnance.jyst waist of mony....but the service was very good and quik .so one star for service.</li>
            <li> Great quality in original packaging!  The original Love Spell with the jasmine in it, that Victoria&#x27;s Secret no longer carries!  If they had more, I&#x27;d buy them all!  Received very quickly also!</li>
            <li> My husband has always loved when I wear love spell. He will continuously compliment me on how good I smell and how I need to always wear this perfume. He&#x27;s currently deployed and I&#x27;m stocking up on my love spell fragrance for when he comes home :)&lt;br /&gt;This bottle is so good for making the fragrance last longer. I spray the body mist all over and then carry this in my purse for touch ups through out the day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!! And a great price, can&#x27;t beat it... Will be coming back for more of this and other scents... Thanks...</li>
            <li> Smells cheap and for tiny bompers! This is better suited for little girls.  I&#x27;ve already given it to a coworker!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Victoria&#x27;s Secret Love Spell scent. I had it in the past as a hand lotion and body mousse and was a huge fan of both, so when I seen it available as a EDT spray here on Amazon for a great price I was pretty excited.  This spray smells exactly like the other Love Spell products: super fruity, almost candy-like in it&#x27;s sweetness, and very light. More like a terrific body mist/spray than a perfume, but this bottle makes it more convenient to carry in my purse.  I only give this 4 stars because the EDT spray doesn&#x27;t last very long for me, but it smells so good that I&#x27;ll just have to keep spraying myself every few hours if that&#x27;s what it takes!  Definitely a favorite scent of mine.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  I have been wearing this since high school.  This particular bottle has been discontiued! So i was very happy when i found this on amazon!</li>
            <li> My Daughter introduced me to this scent when Victoria&#x27;s Secret still sold it in the stores, it quickly became my favorite scent! I also purchase the body spray, lotion &amp; body butter from Amazon now as well, they all smell fantastic &amp; I love the way they feel on my skin. This perfume is a longer lasting scent than the body spray, but both last a good long time. I have had many people inquire as to what the scent was I was wearing. This is a perfect perfume for the teens as well as older ladies (Im 45) and makes a great gift!  A great purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using this scent since high school when I first found it at my local Victoria&#x27;s Secret store.  It is just the perfect scent.  I am VERY sensitive to most perfumes as they make me nauseous.  This one I can wear and I don&#x27;t get sick.  I really don&#x27;t know how to describe the scent, but as amazing.  It will last for several hours and still not be over powering.  If you are looking to try something new or you are sensitive to most perfumes, you should definitely give it  a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  This scent also comes in a wide range of lotion and bath products and they smell great too!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and very good quality. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is a fruity, nice scent and the eau de toilette size wonderful for carrying around and spritzing!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get carried away with it though....a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> one of MY favorites but too pricy for that size</li>
            <li> I love this perfume it is hard to find and it was a great price.</li>
            <li> I have used it for many years.  Once in a Casino a Security Guard followed the scent of where I was until she found me so she could find out what is was I was wearing.  She Loved it.  Also my Hair Dresser loved the smell!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent... It shipped really fast... and the product is great. Doesn&#x27;t have a overpowering smell to it but its not too soft either. I personally love the way it smells as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for - not bad nor really that great.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not as pretty of a bottle, but the same great product! This is my favorite perfume from the moment I smelled it. Nothing else even compares.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the one that was discontinued. To me, they smell differently and I like the older formula better. Other than that, average product that I could have gotten cheaper at the VS store....</li>
            <li> I bought this cell because I like samsung despite its size because it works for me is so practical and buy him</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product, so we ordered it as a gift along with along with lotion and shower gel. She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> Hi, first of all buy this product with the greater expectation because I live in Venezuela and did not know how he was in physical, but to have it in my hands I feel satisfied because it was exactly as it was in the publication. so I recommend it with greater security that you will be satisfied with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent smell. Been using it for many years.</li>
            <li> so in love, cannot use any other perfume anymore, give a try, i&#x27;m sure you are not get dissapointed. Its a floral and the other habd its so fresh. ❤️</li>
            <li> I could never get sick of this smell! It&#x27;s absolutely enticing!&lt;br /&gt;One spray lasts a few hours. I have actually (as creepy as it sounds) Had people come up to me multiple times to tell me that I smell good. Haha!</li>
            <li> Love Spell has always been an awesome smell to have! This arrived pretty quick, and is exactly what it says it is, it smells awesome and lasts longer than the regular body spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect! Scent lasts for a long time, shipped fast, and the bottle will last you a while because you need hardly any. I love it!! Good buy!</li>
            <li> bought this for my daughter, it arrived in three days. she thinks the perfume smells good. its kind of small though and the box was opened but not used, i believe. love spell smells sweet but not too sweet. it is a good buy.</li>
