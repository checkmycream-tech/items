    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I have gum disease and this toothpaste is the best.</li>
            <li>Great taste, great cleaning effects.</li>
            <li>Great taste, and best ingredients - safe for use with homeopathics; no detergents, etc.  </li>
            <li>She loves the taste of it and the ingredients are safe for her as well, so that makes me happy!</li>
            <li>love weleda, this is not their best product</li>
            <li>Very good and chemicals free !</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love Weleda toothpaste and</li>
            <li>Aluminum has been associated with so many health problems it shoul dnot be in our toothpaste imo.</li>
            <li>We love Weleda Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoyed the strong licorice</li>
            <li>Clean feeling after brushing!</li>
            <li>A very reliable company that makes good product without adding harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>but it does clean the teeth very well and it is good for people who have gum irritations to help heal the periodontal problems.  </li>
            <li>Plus I enjoy the flavor as well.</li>
            <li>like the &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; smooth feel of this Calendula paste and the fennel taste is pleasing.</li>
            <li>Super product.  </li>
            <li>The service was very fast !</li>
            <li>Keeps my teeth pretty clean.  </li>
            <li>We use homeopathic remedies in our home and it is imperitive to stay away from strong oils such as eucalyptus and tea tree during such treatments so this made a good choice as calendula is soothing to the mouth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using their Salt toothpaste (blue tube) for many years.</li>
            <li>Besides who wants Hydrofluoric acid from Sodium Fluoride in your stomach after using a mainstream brand that doesn&#x27;t have a clue about tooth health.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loves this toothpaste .</li>
            <li>Since starting the use of natural toothpastes my family has had better dental check ups.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to the normal ingredients in toothpastes, and this product does not irritate my mouth at all.</li>
            <li>It does clean well, but you have to use a lot, seems to go down your throat, melts</li>
            <li>I really prefer the Ratahnia (red box) variety.  </li>
            <li>(and I couldn&#x27;t find the red box stuff at a reasonable price at the time).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this is my least favorite of the Weleda toothpastes.</li>
            <li>but it is still strides ahead of the rest of the industry in terms of health and environment conscious ingredients.</li>
            <li>Salt toothpaste is a gel with fine granules, whereas this Calendula variety is thick and chalky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; ingredients that nearly choke me in the back of the throat.</li>
            <li>kids actually like the taste of this natural paste (compared to others like TOMs and JASON).  </li>
            <li>On the expensive side but it leaves my teeth feeling real clean.</li>

            <li> On the expensive side but it leaves my teeth feeling real clean.</li>
            <li> I got this because I didn&#x27;t like the herbal stuff (green box) as it seemed to dry my mouth out and didn&#x27;t do much for breath freshening--even though it too cleans the teeth well</li>
            <li> I continue to avoid acidic foods and other triggers, but switching to Weleda and other natural toothpastes without fluoride is the only change I&#x27;ve made.</li>
            <li> Jason All-Natural toothpaste only takes a half to one coating on the same brush and foams up well to coat all the teeth.  </li>
            <li> this cleans my teeth well, but it does little for my breath overall.  </li>
            <li> Terrific, dulls the hot cold sensitivity while eliminating Flouride</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other toothpaste after getting used to Weleda.  </li>
            <li> away.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes like black licorice</li>
            <li> I need to coat the little round brush of my Oral B toothbrush at least twice to apply enough toothpaste to coat all my teeth evenly in one brushing.  </li>
            <li> Inflammation of taste buds and fissures in the tongue healed within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> No mint to interfere with homeopathic remedies; the flavor is delicate, not strong.</li>
            <li> The tube needs improvement is too hard no flexibility.</li>
            <li> I just want all geographic tongue suffers to know that switching to fluoride-free toothpastes has eased all my symptoms.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that this toothpaste does not contain any harmful chemicals or any of the sugar alcohols that are so bad for IBS suffers, and everyone else for that matter.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I only gave this 4 stars because it still contains glycerin which I was hoping would not be the case but it does clean the teeth very well and it is good for people who have gum irritations to help heal the periodontal problems.  We use homeopathic remedies in our home and it is imperitive to stay away from strong oils such as eucalyptus and tea tree during such treatments so this made a good choice as calendula is soothing to the mouth.  It tastes like anise or licorice so if you don&#x27;t like that flavor, you will need to make a different choice.</li>
            <li> A very reliable company that makes good product without adding harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> We use this as a family- my toddler included.  She loves the taste of it and the ingredients are safe for her as well, so that makes me happy!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this toothpaste does not contain any harmful chemicals or any of the sugar alcohols that are so bad for IBS suffers, and everyone else for that matter.  I also enjoyed the strong licorice flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it takes a lot of toothpaste to get it on all the teeth.  I need to coat the little round brush of my Oral B toothbrush at least twice to apply enough toothpaste to coat all my teeth evenly in one brushing.  Jason All-Natural toothpaste only takes a half to one coating on the same brush and foams up well to coat all the teeth.  I only hope that the foaming agents in it are not harmful.</li>
            <li> Super product.  Great taste, and best ingredients - safe for use with homeopathics; no detergents, etc.  Great price and fast shipment. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It does clean well, but you have to use a lot, seems to go down your throat, melts away.&lt;br /&gt;Tastes like black licorice</li>
            <li> Keeps my teeth pretty clean.  My son said it smell like pepper.</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;soapy&amp;#34; ingredients that nearly choke me in the back of the throat. No mint to interfere with homeopathic remedies; the flavor is delicate, not strong. Clean feeling after brushing!</li>

            <li> I have gum disease and this toothpaste is the best.</li>
            <li> It saved and healed my gums that had been eroded by toothpastes that contained SLS (sodium laurel sulfate).</li>
            <li> kids actually like the taste of this natural paste (compared to others like TOMs and JASON).  only bummer is price-wish it was a lil cheaper.</li>
            <li> Terrific, dulls the hot cold sensitivity while eliminating Flouride</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other toothpaste after getting used to Weleda.  Besides who wants Hydrofluoric acid from Sodium Fluoride in your stomach after using a mainstream brand that doesn&#x27;t have a clue about tooth health.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loves this toothpaste . The tube needs improvement is too hard no flexibility.</li>

            <li> Has no sulfates or peppermint, both of which I am allergic to.</li>

            <li> Product contains aluminum. Aluminum has been associated with so many health problems it shoul dnot be in our toothpaste imo.</li>
            <li> We love Weleda Toothpaste.  Decided to try this flavor after six months of using the sea salt flavor.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is definitely healthier than what you find at your grocery store, so if it&#x27;s this or Colgate, definitely go with this one.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is my least favorite of the Weleda toothpastes. I&#x27;ve been using their Salt toothpaste (blue tube) for many years. Awhile back that variety was out of stock from the Prime eligible supplier &amp; I needed toothpaste, so I ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rather gross compared to what I was used to using.&lt;br /&gt;The Salt toothpaste is a gel with fine granules, whereas this Calendula variety is thick and chalky.&lt;br /&gt;I love weleda, this is not their best product but it is still strides ahead of the rest of the industry in terms of health and environment conscious ingredients.</li>
            <li> On the expensive side but it leaves my teeth feeling real clean.</li>
            <li> Great taste, great cleaning effects. Since starting the use of natural toothpastes my family has had better dental check ups.</li>
