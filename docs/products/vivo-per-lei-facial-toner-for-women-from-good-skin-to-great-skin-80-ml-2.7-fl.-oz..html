            <li>I am glad it was offered</li>
            <li>It is a wonderful toner but even better is the soft fragrance that just make me smile when I use it.</li>
            <li>first day used this toner and day cream, just feels good.</li>
            <li>He tried to sell me a package at $150 , so glad I googled this product and saw it on Amazon for cheap.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face so smooth</li>
            <li>Made my skin feel smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>It significantly reduces it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better price than OROGOLD for the same amazing results.</li>
            <li>The shipping was reasonable and the packaging was safe.</li>
            <li>This toner has such a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>it smells fresh.</li>
            <li>It feels so fresh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.  </li>
            <li>I first heard about this product from a vendor in a mall in Hawaii.  </li>
            <li>I was looking around and found this product at first i was hesitant but</li>
            <li>I love these products enough that I would spend the money</li>
            <li>Pretty much looked like water and performed like it as well.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li>This is the second step in a routine to leave your skin clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Toners always seemed to really dry out the face and since many of them have a degree of alcohol in them they can often wind up</li>
            <li>thanks God I bought this.</li>
            <li>The toner works very well with the face peel or milk cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using cotton balls, not enough surface space.  </li>
            <li>: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.  </li>
            <li>I searched amazon and found it for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed that this product helps so much with my redness.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much to ph correct skin tone.</li>
            <li>but not what I like, I ended going back to my old products which is better suited for my skin type.</li>
            <li>So if you buy this product, make sure you get the other stuff too because it all needs to work together.</li>
            <li>And when the dead skin cells are gone your skin can more easily grow new ones which is critical for those of us who are getting up there in age.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for all ages.</li>
            <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them, especially when it came to toners.  </li>
            <li>I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  </li>
            <li>I have enjoyed Vivo products in the past , but this is a new item .</li>
            <li>The product was exactly the same as I had tried in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a toner that had a noticeable effect, tightening my skin and preparing it for application of a facial cream.</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter is using it too</li>
            <li>Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just ok very small amt.</li>
            <li>As a high school freshman, clear skin is essential...</li>
            <li>I am not impressed, I bought it because of the good reviews, but it is far from what I red about it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The toner dries fast and does not leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the cleanser, the facial peeling and the day moisturizer my skin has completely gone from something I was embarrassed about to something people are complimenting me on.  </li>
            <li>Cleans and refreshes your skin, but there is no &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>I have to say for me the facial peeling is critical to the success of the system because it gets off any dead skin cells so they don&#x27;t clog the pores</li>
            <li>And not only does it not dry out the skin it doesn&#x27;t sting.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered it many times in the past few years.</li>

            <li> I empty out and pour into a different container and add witch hazel to both!!!</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t get the dry patches.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and helps tighten pores before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin from feeling dry after washing.</li>

            <li> Takes very little to remove any leftover product on my face without making it feel dry.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s almost point less almost until you receive the product.</li>
            <li> I waste money on this item.</li>
            <li> Harsh on my skin, caused me to have a rash.</li>
            <li> the small is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> not sure the effect from the cream or the toner.</li>
            <li> Product was not authentic, it did not have a fragrance like the original/authentic.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 40s</li>
            <li> It was outrageously priced.</li>

            <li> This is the second step in a routine to leave your skin clean and fresh.  The toner dries fast and does not leave your skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I do love this product. It is a wonderful toner but even better is the soft fragrance that just make me smile when I use it.</li>
            <li> I am a repeat buyer.  This is a great toner and works really well.  All of Vivo Per Lei products are wonderful.  I use several.</li>
            <li> Really great toner. I think because I already use witch hazel on my face it&#x27;s almost point less almost until you receive the product.It&#x27;s great. To prolong it. I empty out and pour into a different container and add witch hazel to both!!! Tada!!!.2.for the price of one!!!</li>
            <li> I would not buy the toner again. I waste money on this item. the small is pretty bad. I use one time after that I have not use at all. but I like the facial pill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Vivo for over a year now.  It is the best product I&#x27;ve ever found for the money.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from a vendor in a mall in Hawaii.  He tried to sell me a package at $150 , so glad I googled this product and saw it on Amazon for cheap.  The scrub and toner both worked great , I love how my skin feels after each use .  This is a good find...</li>

            <li> good product for the price</li>
            <li> Takes very little to remove any leftover product on my face without making it feel dry. I will continue to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I love this. Makes my face so smooth and I&#x27;ve been using it for several months. I haven&#x27;t  had acne since.</li>
            <li> The toner works very well with the face peel or milk cleanser.  I will also try their bath products to verify the quality.</li>
            <li> This toner has such a nice scent.  It is refreshing to my skin.  I use a lot of the Vivo Per Lei products and love them all.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed, I bought it because of the good reviews, but it is far from what I red about it.&lt;br /&gt;It does not do anything to my face. I feel better when I put water than this product.</li>
            <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve played with many facial care products and never really liked them or enjoyed them, especially when it came to toners.  Toners always seemed to really dry out the face and since many of them have a degree of alcohol in them they can often wind up stinging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not this toner!  It actually moisturizers the face a bit.  You still need to use a moisturizer afterwards but when I use this toner, before I get to moisturizing I don&#x27;t have that tight dry feeling in my face, the feeling like I just got out of a pool and my skin is drying up!  It goes on smooth though I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using cotton balls, not enough surface space.  Get cosmetic cotton pads.  And not only does it not dry out the skin it doesn&#x27;t sting.  I absolutely love this stuff and use many other Vivo Per Lei products.  Already after only two weeks worth of use my skin is looking younger and firmer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy it here on Amazon, it&#x27;s MUCH cheaper than buying it from the mall kiosks or from vivopl.com.  I love these products enough that I would spend the money but it&#x27;s always nice to save a bundle!</li>
            <li> I had tried a sample of this in Las Vegas. It was outrageously priced. I searched amazon and found it for a reasonable price. The product feels great on my skin. I personally like the smell of the product. It does not smell clinical it smells fresh. Made my skin feel smooth and clean. I have oily skin but this did not make me oily at all. I highly recommend. The product was exactly the same as I had tried in Las Vegas.</li>
            <li> Harsh on my skin, caused me to have a rash.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a toner that had a noticeable effect, tightening my skin and preparing it for application of a facial cream. Usually, I skip using a toner after the first bottle is used up, but I think I&#x27;ll keep using this one. It&#x27;s especially effective after using the Vivo per lei facial peel.</li>
            <li> Cleans and refreshes your skin, but there is no &#x27;dry&#x27; feeling after using it. A perfect start for a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product. It has visibly made a difference in her facial appearance. Has restored her ccnfidence...As a high school freshman, clear skin is essential...</li>
            <li> I love Vivo per lei !</li>
            <li> It is okay but not what I like, I ended going back to my old products which is better suited for my skin type.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have ordered it many times in the past few years.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It feels so fresh on the skin. I have redness in my skin and I have noticed that this product helps so much with my redness. It significantly reduces it. Another great product from Vivo.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the cleanser, the facial peeling and the day moisturizer my skin has completely gone from something I was embarrassed about to something people are complimenting me on.  I am in my late 40s and I feel like my skin is better than it was in my 30s. I have to say for me the facial peeling is critical to the success of the system because it gets off any dead skin cells so they don&#x27;t clog the pores and so I don&#x27;t get the dry patches.  And when the dead skin cells are gone your skin can more easily grow new ones which is critical for those of us who are getting up there in age.  So if you buy this product, make sure you get the other stuff too because it all needs to work together. I highly recommend it for all ages. My 17 year old daughter is using it too</li>
            <li> Just started using Vivo Products.  I have been using on an unwanted blemish and  it seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I tried the more expensive version of this - Oro Gold, which I bought in Vegas for a huge amount of money.  This stuff is just as good, if not better</li>
            <li> Would not recommend.  There was no fragrance.  Pretty much looked like water and performed like it as well.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and helps tighten pores before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Awesome toner doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, cleans every bit of dirt you have on your face. The only problem is I wish it was little cheaper and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I never used a toner for years, but realized after using this toner, I now see the difference.  It closes the pores and my skin looks  better</li>
            <li> This toner is a perfect compliment after your face wash. Keeps your skin from feeling dry after washing. Doesn&#x27;t take much to ph correct skin tone. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Just ok very small amt. for the price.</li>
            <li> This toner is exceptional.  There is no burning or dryness from using this.  It does the job without leaving your face feeling oily or dry.</li>
            <li> This toner nicely balances out any cleanser, but seems to work best with the vivo per lei foaming cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed Vivo products in the past , but this is a new item . I am glad it was offered and I am happy with the product and the price too .</li>
