            <li>I am so happy and love it so much!</li>
            <li>Its more than you think.</li>
            <li>Best sunscreen &amp; moisturizer - I use it daily.</li>
            <li>The spf 45 is much better in this brand.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Best facial sunscreen around!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mineral sunscreen which does not use chemicals for sun protection that makes it safe.    </li>
            <li>Many sunscreens, including Olay, irritate my skin, but I have never had problems with this one.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>recommended by my dermatologist many years ago.</li>
            <li>Have used this sunscreen for several years and know that it is a superb product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous transparent sunscreen!</li>
            <li>and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li>So you just have to make sure if you&#x27;re exposed to the sun that you&#x27;ve got it covered.</li>
            <li>Love this sun block.</li>
            <li>Since they no longer had Skinceuticals sunscreen, I turned to Amazon to get some more.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals UV Defence for nine years and am well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love Skinceuticals sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I love how this feels on my face- not greasy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even re-apply most days even on my boyfriend&#x27;s boat.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>My skin felt healthy and works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS ITS GREAT AND CAN BE USED ON ITS OWN OR WITH YOUR REGULAR SKINCARE</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product several years ago and she has been using it ever since -- great skin-friendly adn effective sunscreen</li>
            <li>This rich, creamy sunscreen is excellent, I use it under make-up daily.  </li>
            <li>Good price compare to how much dermatologist sell it for</li>
            <li>Have used it every summer on vacation in FL and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li>For sports, a waterproof sunscreen would be better, but this is great for daily use.  </li>
            <li>After applying a bit of mascara and lipstick, I&#x27;m ready for the day, and can honestly say I have never received so many compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li>The rays were intensely strong.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin that is sensitive and easily breaks out.</li>
            <li>I liked the sunscreen so much I have contined to use it.  </li>
            <li>My MD always compliments me on how great my skin looks and observes that I use  sun block daily.  </li>
            <li>Great product - the only one I will use on my face.  </li>
            <li>so this gives me the defense against the sun I need and goes on smoothly and light.</li>
            <li>I use this under my makeup and like that it has zinc oxide in it and it is light and not oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As a moisturizer, it goes on smoothly and is odorless.</li>
            <li>It is light on my face and does not feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>Very worth the money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare to get something that does exactly what it says AND is cost effective.</li>
            <li>It applies easily and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it from my dermatologist to protect my skin after having laser work done on my face.  </li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li>The dermotologist originally sold me the Skinceuticals sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much after running out of the first tub</li>
            <li>Excellent product, at least for me.</li>
            <li>Best coverage, long lasting and good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>love in winter very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>--Skinceuticals Ultimate and Physical does not&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a timely fashion and in perfect condition</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The seller should be more careful about the shipping package, it is not acceptable even for my own use.</li>
            <li>I should done more research before ordering this particular product.</li>
            <li>It is a great moisturizer and it does not melt or run down on your skin even when you play sports.</li>
            <li>I have been using the product since last year, it is recommended by dermatologist and it does give you pretty good protection.  </li>
            <li>My husband, daughter &amp; I are all avid tennis players who need good protection without white residue on our faces &amp; necks.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>great product and very reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had so many, even with higher SPF that didn&#x27;t provide such good coverage and prevent darkening of old scars, freckles, etc.</li>
            <li>However, it was still deep enough to give me a very good scare.</li>
            <li>If the product wasn&#x27;t great, we wouldn&#x27;t go to that much trouble.</li>
            <li>The Sport one feels a bit heavier, but, it doesn&#x27;t sweat off, so it&#x27;s worth it for summer protection.</li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>The zinc is the key to keeping the skin healthy and free from blackheads etc.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to many products and I never have a problem with this product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>I put this on first thing every morning,  and while my face is still very moist, I smooth on just a bit of cream blush and an under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the fact that it is fragrance free and can be used under makeup easily.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li>Both of those products are 100% physical blockers yet are sheer and feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few high priced sunscreens, but this works by far the best (assuming that not getting a tan means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll try the SPF 50 after this tube for more protection since we live at 7000 feet in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li>I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my face look white as most of the sunscreens do</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I apply the sunscreen first thing in the morning, either under make-up or alone, and it works all day.  </li>
            <li>My face is not oily nor are my pores blocked, works very well under makeup as well!</li>
            <li>Living in an extremely hot and  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen and have been using it for several years since my friend told me about this product.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I never get red skin any more</li>
            <li>I do use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I live at a high altitude with strong sun and wear this sunscreen all year around.</li>
            <li>Just right for African-American skin too as it does not leave that milky-white cast on your face; unless of course you use to much.  </li>
            <li>I love the product but so dissatisfied  with how long tlit lasted.</li>
            <li>Plus it has a high SPF and uses the right ingredients for both UVA and UVB protection.</li>
            <li>very important when you live in florida and am in the sun constantly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a white cream but not greasy and therefore will wash off easily too.</li>
            <li>Love this product and can not live without it!</li>
            <li>and I was very disappoint.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Very lightweight.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying it again, thanks</li>
            <li>It goes on really smoothly and mixes well with daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Very well packaged.</li>
            <li>I am in Florida for a couple of months and the sun is intense.  </li>
            <li>i will not go out side camping hiking with out it , in fact I am ready to reorder</li>
            <li>I feel very protected when I use this product at 30spf.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth - no white residue</li>
            <li>Not heavy or greasy and has the right ingredients for sun protection.</li>
            <li>I have medium complexion, so the key is a little bit goes a long way for the best coverage.  </li>
            <li>It has zinc oxide which is a better ingredient than other chemicals found in the cheaper sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, and I apply loose powder and blush over it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very quickly and evenly, provides great sun protection and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve pretty much lost any tan that I once had though I still find myself out in the sun no less than before.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and the sun protection is evident.</li>
            <li>I have used the Skinceuticals sheer and physical fusion sunscreens for years and love them</li>
            <li>Works better than their 50 sheer fluid.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, but make sure you apply a generous amount, not too much as it will make you look a bit pale.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and physical blocking is what you want, order the skinceuticals Sheer Physical UV Defense or Physical Fusion UV Defense (great for faces</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this sunscreen to my family, friends, and co-workers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Love it,not thick easy to apply i will order my second one</li>
            <li>I was skeptical but it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sensitive to chemical and synthetic smells and really appreciate having a product with no smell at all.</li>
            <li>Worth it if you want to protect your skin from daily sun damage.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the extra $$!</li>
            <li>It keeps my dry skin soft and provides the needed protection for my light complextion.</li>
            <li>I am male, Latino, teen, and with light brown skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Glides on easily without any mess and no oily residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more and will explore other Skinceutical products because of this one.</li>
            <li>I love this product to my sensitive skin, I had used it in the past.</li>
            <li>I like it because it has zinc but will be clear on my skin after it is applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing (I have dry skin), compared to many zinc sunscreens which dry my already dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li>My face is so soft using it.</li>
            <li>I developed melanoma on my face a couple years ago.</li>
            <li>People think I have the skin of a 45 year old</li>
            <li>If applied very heavily, it leaves a whitish cast, but applied lightly, it protects and is invisible.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to find it under $30 at Amazon when dermatologist were selling it for $40, but now it is hard to find it at such a lower price even at Amazon.</li>
            <li>Just by using this product I feel I have held aging at bay, even though I live in Southern California.  </li>
            <li>easy to apply makeup over it and not too thick.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face, and this is one of the only sunscreens that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling burned.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the fact that I&#x27;m acne prone (at 31 years old, no less), and I get the big undergrounders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have tried a few other</li>
            <li>I found that using skinceuticals for under the eyes (deep dark circles) works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>For my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li>A daily practice that helps keep my skin young.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li>To protect my face from the sun&#x27;s harsh rays, I rely on this powerful sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This blends in completely with application, does not look greasy or leave a white residue and makes the face look moisturized, not dry and cakey.    </li>
            <li>A little dab goes a long way and it blends in quickly with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>too dry for my old skin</li>
            <li>With both of them, a little goes a very long way, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>

            <li> Its more than you think.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen &amp; moisturizer - I use it daily.</li>
            <li> The spf 45 is much better in this brand.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen around!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mineral sunscreen which does not use chemicals for sun protection that makes it safe.    </li>
            <li> Many sunscreens, including Olay, irritate my skin, but I have never had problems with this one.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> recommended by my dermatologist many years ago.</li>
            <li> Have used this sunscreen for several years and know that it is a superb product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous transparent sunscreen!</li>
            <li> and I love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> So you just have to make sure if you&#x27;re exposed to the sun that you&#x27;ve got it covered.</li>
            <li> Love this sun block.</li>
            <li> Since they no longer had Skinceuticals sunscreen, I turned to Amazon to get some more.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals UV Defence for nine years and am well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love Skinceuticals sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love how this feels on my face- not greasy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even re-apply most days even on my boyfriend&#x27;s boat.</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> My skin felt healthy and works great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS ITS GREAT AND CAN BE USED ON ITS OWN OR WITH YOUR REGULAR SKINCARE</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product several years ago and she has been using it ever since -- great skin-friendly adn effective sunscreen</li>
            <li> This rich, creamy sunscreen is excellent, I use it under make-up daily.  </li>
            <li> Good price compare to how much dermatologist sell it for</li>
            <li> Have used it every summer on vacation in FL and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> For sports, a waterproof sunscreen would be better, but this is great for daily use.  </li>
            <li> After applying a bit of mascara and lipstick, I&#x27;m ready for the day, and can honestly say I have never received so many compliments on my complexion.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply makeup over it.</li>
            <li> The rays were intensely strong.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin that is sensitive and easily breaks out.</li>
            <li> I liked the sunscreen so much I have contined to use it.  </li>
            <li> My MD always compliments me on how great my skin looks and observes that I use  sun block daily.  </li>
            <li> Great product - the only one I will use on my face.  </li>
            <li> so this gives me the defense against the sun I need and goes on smoothly and light.</li>
            <li> I use this under my makeup and like that it has zinc oxide in it and it is light and not oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As a moisturizer, it goes on smoothly and is odorless.</li>
            <li> It is light on my face and does not feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Very worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rare to get something that does exactly what it says AND is cost effective.</li>
            <li> It applies easily and disappears quickly.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought it from my dermatologist to protect my skin after having laser work done on my face.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Skinceuticals.  </li>
            <li> The dermotologist originally sold me the Skinceuticals sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much after running out of the first tub</li>
            <li> Excellent product, at least for me.</li>
            <li> Best coverage, long lasting and good for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> love in winter very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> --Skinceuticals Ultimate and Physical does not&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a timely fashion and in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The seller should be more careful about the shipping package, it is not acceptable even for my own use.</li>
            <li> I should done more research before ordering this particular product.</li>
            <li> It is a great moisturizer and it does not melt or run down on your skin even when you play sports.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product since last year, it is recommended by dermatologist and it does give you pretty good protection.  </li>
            <li> My husband, daughter &amp; I are all avid tennis players who need good protection without white residue on our faces &amp; necks.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> great product and very reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so many, even with higher SPF that didn&#x27;t provide such good coverage and prevent darkening of old scars, freckles, etc.</li>
            <li> However, it was still deep enough to give me a very good scare.</li>
            <li> If the product wasn&#x27;t great, we wouldn&#x27;t go to that much trouble.</li>
            <li> The Sport one feels a bit heavier, but, it doesn&#x27;t sweat off, so it&#x27;s worth it for summer protection.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> The zinc is the key to keeping the skin healthy and free from blackheads etc.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to many products and I never have a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I put this on first thing every morning,  and while my face is still very moist, I smooth on just a bit of cream blush and an under eye concealer.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it is fragrance free and can be used under makeup easily.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Both of those products are 100% physical blockers yet are sheer and feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few high priced sunscreens, but this works by far the best (assuming that not getting a tan means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.)</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll try the SPF 50 after this tube for more protection since we live at 7000 feet in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li> I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my face look white as most of the sunscreens do</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I apply the sunscreen first thing in the morning, either under make-up or alone, and it works all day.  </li>
            <li> My face is not oily nor are my pores blocked, works very well under makeup as well!</li>
            <li> Living in an extremely hot and  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and have been using it for several years since my friend told me about this product.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> I never get red skin any more</li>
            <li> I do use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I live at a high altitude with strong sun and wear this sunscreen all year around.</li>
            <li> Just right for African-American skin too as it does not leave that milky-white cast on your face; unless of course you use to much.  </li>
            <li> I love the product but so dissatisfied  with how long tlit lasted.</li>
            <li> Plus it has a high SPF and uses the right ingredients for both UVA and UVB protection.</li>
            <li> very important when you live in florida and am in the sun constantly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a white cream but not greasy and therefore will wash off easily too.</li>
            <li> Love this product and can not live without it!</li>
            <li> and I was very disappoint.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying it again, thanks</li>
            <li> It goes on really smoothly and mixes well with daily moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I am in Florida for a couple of months and the sun is intense.  </li>
            <li> i will not go out side camping hiking with out it , in fact I am ready to reorder</li>
            <li> I feel very protected when I use this product at 30spf.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth - no white residue</li>
            <li> Not heavy or greasy and has the right ingredients for sun protection.</li>
            <li> I have medium complexion, so the key is a little bit goes a long way for the best coverage.  </li>
            <li> It has zinc oxide which is a better ingredient than other chemicals found in the cheaper sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, and I apply loose powder and blush over it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very quickly and evenly, provides great sun protection and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve pretty much lost any tan that I once had though I still find myself out in the sun no less than before.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and the sun protection is evident.</li>
            <li> I have used the Skinceuticals sheer and physical fusion sunscreens for years and love them</li>
            <li> Works better than their 50 sheer fluid.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, but make sure you apply a generous amount, not too much as it will make you look a bit pale.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and physical blocking is what you want, order the skinceuticals Sheer Physical UV Defense or Physical Fusion UV Defense (great for faces</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this sunscreen to my family, friends, and co-workers.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love it,not thick easy to apply i will order my second one</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sensitive to chemical and synthetic smells and really appreciate having a product with no smell at all.</li>
            <li> Worth it if you want to protect your skin from daily sun damage.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the extra $$!</li>
            <li> It keeps my dry skin soft and provides the needed protection for my light complextion.</li>
            <li> I am male, Latino, teen, and with light brown skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Glides on easily without any mess and no oily residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more and will explore other Skinceutical products because of this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product to my sensitive skin, I had used it in the past.</li>
            <li> I like it because it has zinc but will be clear on my skin after it is applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing (I have dry skin), compared to many zinc sunscreens which dry my already dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for at least 5 years.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy.  </li>
            <li> My face is so soft using it.</li>
            <li> I developed melanoma on my face a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> People think I have the skin of a 45 year old</li>
            <li> If applied very heavily, it leaves a whitish cast, but applied lightly, it protects and is invisible.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to find it under $30 at Amazon when dermatologist were selling it for $40, but now it is hard to find it at such a lower price even at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Just by using this product I feel I have held aging at bay, even though I live in Southern California.  </li>
            <li> easy to apply makeup over it and not too thick.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, and this is one of the only sunscreens that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling burned.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the fact that I&#x27;m acne prone (at 31 years old, no less), and I get the big undergrounders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have tried a few other</li>
            <li> I found that using skinceuticals for under the eyes (deep dark circles) works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> For my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> A daily practice that helps keep my skin young.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of expensive</li>
            <li> To protect my face from the sun&#x27;s harsh rays, I rely on this powerful sunscreen.</li>
            <li> This blends in completely with application, does not look greasy or leave a white residue and makes the face look moisturized, not dry and cakey.    </li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way and it blends in quickly with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> too dry for my old skin</li>
            <li> With both of them, a little goes a very long way, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I tried dozens of other sunscreens in my early 20s</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with breakouts due to the product.  </li>
            <li> When the doc cut it out it was found not to be deep enough to cause me to loose my FAA medical certificate to flying airplanes.</li>
            <li> As long as I use this sunscreen daily, my rosacea stays under control.  </li>
            <li> I decided order a few for my friends as a surprise gift, but the package came in a soft padded envelope which didn&#x27;t give enough protection to the boxes inside.  </li>
            <li> Nice product without &#x27;bad for you&#x27; ingredient.</li>
            <li> Most \\&quot;sensitive-skin, dermatologist recommended\\&quot; products sting me like crazy.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it from skin ceurticals I lasted twice as long.  </li>
            <li> so a tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I use it every day all year long.</li>
            <li> I try other sunscreens occasionally</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t put chemical sunscreens on my skin and the other physical blocking sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (</li>
            <li> There are other skinceutical sunscreens which are like the sample I received: not greasy, not sticky, yet 100% physical blockers.</li>
            <li> and I feel it helps with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little dollop goes a long way so the tube can last you months.  </li>
            <li> It also contains a moisturizer - I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> While a bit pricey, a tube will last you a long time, a small amount is all that&#x27;s needed because it covers so well.  </li>
            <li> it goes on white and within a few seconds of massaging it in, it disappears into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I use sunscreen year round in a temperate climate (upper mid-west).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it on my kids&#x27; entire bodies, despite how CRAZY expensive it is, because I know that it is that good.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super expensive but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other creams or moisturizers or anti-aging products.  </li>
            <li> but unlike the other Skinceutical sunscreens  it stays sticky on your skin and not matte.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my skin as some other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for at least 8 years on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using it, I have had no additional dark spots or freckles.  </li>
            <li> I am a golfer and using this product has protected my face from those harmful rays thus putting me at less risk of obtaining freckles and age spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and my wrinkle less face shows it.</li>
            <li> i use it year round and have had no skin issues with outdoors.</li>
            <li> A little too greasy and not as thick as I remember it to be in the past.</li>
            <li> I found out when I read the label after opening it that it contains paraben, bad for your skin, same as paraffin or wax.&lt;br /&gt;Too late to send it back sao</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past and the place where I had purchased the product had stop carrying it</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the shipping charges were expensive.  </li>
            <li> I love that this lotion is also a sunscreen but doesn&#x27;t have that nasty sunscreen smell to it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday regardless if the sun is out our not!  </li>
            <li> This lotion is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t cause me problems.</li>
            <li> Try it at least once</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick yet not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a thick cream</li>
            <li> I buy a less expensive mineral sunscreen for the body.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product is not available in Italy and Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship it to her location</li>
            <li> I use the everyday!!!  </li>
            <li> and I can use it every day without irritating my skin</li>
            <li> I have used this product for approximately two years and will continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> A tube lasts me for months, so it&#x27;s not as expensive as it seems.  </li>
            <li> I bought four together but was somehow disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get any discount on the shipping charges.  </li>
            <li> I hate goopy sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use any makeup base.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am male, Latino, teen, and with light brown skin. It is lightweight, but make sure you apply a generous amount, not too much as it will make you look a bit pale. No such thing as a perfect sunscreen with perfect moisturizing effect but this comes close to perfect. Must have, especially for an acne regimen. Very worth the money. Its more than you think. Buy it man.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen &amp; moisturizer - I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Disappears into your skin and protects. I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and have tried a few other but they are &amp;#34;shiny&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t soak into my skin well enough to apply makeup over.</li>
            <li> Horrible. Unless you like white, oily, wrinkle/pore maximizing greasiness. I bought 10 of this spf, and am returning 9 of them. The spf 45 is much better in this brand.</li>
            <li> Product is as per my expectation. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t make my face look white as most of the sunscreens do and I like the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few high priced sunscreens, but this works by far the best (assuming that not getting a tan means it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job.)</li>
            <li> A little too greasy and not as thick as I remember it to be in the past. But it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> My daughter, who lives in Italy, has me buy her this product because she says it is the only one that works for her. Unfortunately, the product is not available in Italy and Amazon doesn&#x27;t ship it to her location so I send it by mail. If the product wasn&#x27;t great, we wouldn&#x27;t go to that much trouble.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  So good feeling on the skin and keeps out the sun rays.  Seems to help with wrinkles too.</li>
            <li> This product gave me excellent protection from all UV sun rays while I was in Thailand for a week .  The rays were intensely strong.  Thank you Amazon for allowing me to make the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this product. I have used it in the past and the place where I had purchased the product had stop carrying it and I was very disappoint. This is a great product for any skin tone. Exceptional!!!!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that is sensitive and easily breaks out. My dermatologist recommended I use this product daily on my face to prevent sun damage. I was skeptical but it works great. I have been using this product for years and never had a problem. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The product is great! I have used it before and find it is a great sunscreen.[[ASIN:B000NCA7NU Skin Ceuticals Ultimate UV Defense SPF 30 - 90ml/3oz]]</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial sunscreen. I&#x27;ve had so many, even with higher SPF that didn&#x27;t provide such good coverage and prevent darkening of old scars, freckles, etc. It&#x27;s a large tube and works perfectly. It&#x27;s rare to get something that does exactly what it says AND is cost effective. I&#x27;ll be back for more and will explore other Skinceutical products because of this one. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen on my face for 3 years.  It is a physical block, meaning it blocks the sun using zinc oxide rather than chemicals.  Unlike the zinc oxide of my youth it disappears on your skin.  It also contains a moisturizer - I have very dry skin and this is the only day-time moisturizer I use.  I apply the sunscreen first thing in the morning, either under make-up or alone, and it works all day.  I have not had even the slightest sunburn on my face since I started using Skinceuticals.  I think this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Best facial sunscreen around!</li>
            <li> This blends in completely with application, does not look greasy or leave a white residue and makes the face look moisturized, not dry and cakey.    A perfect product.    It&#x27;s a mineral sunscreen which does not use chemicals for sun protection that makes it safe.    It&#x27;s kind of expensive so I only use it on my face. I buy a less expensive mineral sunscreen for the body.     I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This rich, creamy sunscreen is excellent, I use it under make-up daily.  I originally bought it from my dermatologist to protect my skin after having laser work done on my face.  I liked the sunscreen so much I have contined to use it.  Many sunscreens, including Olay, irritate my skin, but I have never had problems with this one.  While a bit pricey, a tube will last you a long time, a small amount is all that&#x27;s needed because it covers so well.  Worth it if you want to protect your skin from daily sun damage.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this sunscreen because the zinc protects the skin against UVA, UVB, and the rays in between.  I&#x27;ve used it for at least 8 years on a daily basis.  It&#x27;s very moisturizing (I have dry skin), compared to many zinc sunscreens which dry my already dry skin.  It goes on easily, and I apply loose powder and blush over it.  If applied very heavily, it leaves a whitish cast, but applied lightly, it protects and is invisible.  For sports, a waterproof sunscreen would be better, but this is great for daily use.  As long as I use this sunscreen daily, my rosacea stays under control.  A tube lasts me for months, so it&#x27;s not as expensive as it seems.  Great product!</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN RECOMMENDED BY A DERMATOLOGIST I HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS ITS GREAT AND CAN BE USED ON ITS OWN OR WITH YOUR REGULAR SKINCARE</li>
            <li> Very lightweight. Not greasy at all. I have very sensitive skin and it has never caused me any problems. It was recommended by my dermatologist for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> skinceuticals moisturizing sunscreen spf 30 is a wonderful cream. It has zinc oxide in it which is supposed to be great for your skin according to my dermatologist. I have been using it for several years and give it a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used so far!! My face is not oily nor are my pores blocked, works very well under makeup as well! I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product to my sensitive skin, I had used it in the past. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m trying it again, thanks</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best sunscreen I&#x27;ve used.  Just right for African-American skin too as it does not leave that milky-white cast on your face; unless of course you use to much.  I have medium complexion, so the key is a little bit goes a long way for the best coverage.  I had darkening spot damage from over-expoxsure on driver&#x27;s side of my face.  My dermatologist recommended I use this and after a while the skintone has evened out and now my face has continued protection.  Use in year-round!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a friend and I am very pleased with it.  It applies easily and disappears quickly.  I think I&#x27;ll try the SPF 50 after this tube for more protection since we live at 7000 feet in New Mexico.  I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for at least 5 years.  I am a golfer and using this product has protected my face from those harmful rays thus putting me at less risk of obtaining freckles and age spots. My MD always compliments me on how great my skin looks and observes that I use  sun block daily.  Amazon.com allows me to purchase the product under cost from retail and actual website of the producer.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!  it goes on white and within a few seconds of massaging it in, it disappears into your skin.  my foundation goes on flawlessly afterward.  and i know i am protected from the suns harmful rays.  very important when you live in florida and am in the sun constantly.  great product!  recommended by my dermatologist many years ago.</li>
            <li> Have used this sunscreen for several years and know that it is a superb product.  I especially like the fact that it is fragrance free and can be used under makeup easily.</li>
            <li> This goes on well and provides good protection for the face and arms.  It goes on with a whitish look but disappears with rubbing.</li>
            <li> It was the product we expect.</li>
            <li> Great product - the only one I will use on my face.  Not heavy or greasy and has the right ingredients for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, at least for me. It is good for my skin type. It blends in and is not chalky in appearance.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. I have never gotten any kind of sunburn using this and I&#x27;ve used it for years. I use sunscreen year round in a temperate climate (upper mid-west). I use this in cool/cold weather and Skinceuticals Sport Suncreen 45 SPF in the summer.  This one feels lighter on my skin. The Sport one feels a bit heavier, but, it doesn&#x27;t sweat off, so it&#x27;s worth it for summer protection. With both of them, a little goes a very long way, so it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I use this and the SPF 20 sunscreen by Skinceuticals. They were recommended by my dermatologist because of the Zcote. They are effective and they feel good - I hate goopy sunscreen. I try other sunscreens occasionally but I always go back to Skinceuticals.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin. Most \\&quot;sensitive-skin, dermatologist recommended\\&quot; products sting me like crazy. Not to mention the fact that I&#x27;m acne prone (at 31 years old, no less), and I get the big undergrounders. This lotion is one of the very few that doesn&#x27;t cause me problems. Plus it has a high SPF and uses the right ingredients for both UVA and UVB protection. It&#x27;s expensive, but for me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  Best sunscreen for face.</li>
            <li> Good product.  easy to apply makeup over it and not too thick.  recommended by my dermatologist.  Good price for this product.</li>
            <li> Only problem is ....way too thick....made my face white !!  I&#x27;ve used the thinner consistency same brand.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and arrived as expected. I would order this item again.</li>
            <li> Awesome for face protection. It&#x27;seems not greasy, so great for people with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> When I ordered it from skin ceurticals I lasted twice as long.  I love the product but so dissatisfied  with how long tlit lasted.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so this gives me the defense against the sun I need and goes on smoothly and light.</li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and my skin looks and feels better than it has in years.  I put this on first thing every morning,  and while my face is still very moist, I smooth on just a bit of cream blush and an under eye concealer.  I do not have to use any makeup base.  After applying a bit of mascara and lipstick, I&#x27;m ready for the day, and can honestly say I have never received so many compliments on my complexion. Needless to say, I like this product very much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as a moisturizer and as sun protection. It works great!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily or heavy.  A little goes a long way.  I have had the same tube for about a year now.  I will definitely be reordering this.</li>
            <li> The product itself is good.  I&#x27;ve used it before and had no complain.  The only thing is that the shipping charges were expensive.  The product itself was twenty something dollars each, but the shipping fee was $5 ($4.99) each.  I bought four together but was somehow disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get any discount on the shipping charges.  $20 shipping fee for four slim tubes of cream seemed kind of unreasonable to me.</li>
            <li> I use this under my makeup and like that it has zinc oxide in it and it is light and not oily feeling.  Living in an extremely hot and  humid climate requires a good sunscreen and this one works.</li>
            <li> My skin is really sensitive and this works great!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and do not like any greasy lotion on my face.  This sunscreen doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, and is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and love it.  It goes on smooth and feels like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Skinceuticals sunscreen for years as my daily moisturizer. Love this product and can not live without it! A little dab goes a long way and it blends in quickly with no greasy feel. A must to,protect your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Great on the skin. It moistures the skin and protects it from the sun without that sunblock smell. Good price compare to how much dermatologist sell it for</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen every day for 10 years.  I am 38, but people tell me I look much younger.  Occasionally I even get carded.  I do not use any other creams or moisturizers or anti-aging products.  Just by using this product I feel I have held aging at bay, even though I live in Southern California.  It feels good on my skin and has never made me break out.  I tried dozens of other sunscreens in my early 20s before I found this product.  I am so happy and love it so much!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd tube of skinceuticals sunscreen that I have used.  I have been very pleased with it.  It goes on smoothly and works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> the best moisturizer to keep your face looking young and radiant.</li>
            <li> I am a landscaper and also go fishing (ie I spend a great deal of time in the sun) and this product is great.  It goes on very quickly and evenly, provides great sun protection and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Reapplication doesn&#x27;t make you feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Fabulous transparent sunscreen! Light weight and a very fair amount for the price (comparatively speaking)!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Recommended to me by a Dermatologist years ago and have been using it ever since! Try it at least once and you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist&#x27;s office.  I found it cheaper on line.  It goes on really smoothly and mixes well with daily moisturizer.  It only takes a dab as well (even when used alone) so a tube lasts a long time.  I use it only on face, neck and ears, occasionally on back of hands.</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen for years.  The zinc is the key to keeping the skin healthy and free from blackheads etc.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything else on my face during the day. I love that this lotion is also a sunscreen but doesn&#x27;t have that nasty sunscreen smell to it. It keeps my dry skin soft and provides the needed protection for my light complextion. I watch this product on Amazon closely because sometimes the price is reduced and so I grab it then! Wonderful product and would recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s dermatologist recommended this product several years ago and she has been using it ever since -- great skin-friendly adn effective sunscreen</li>
            <li> I been using this product for about 3 years. It is very good for any skin type. I feel happy protecting my skin against the sun damage.</li>
            <li> I found out when I read the label after opening it that it contains paraben, bad for your skin, same as paraffin or wax.&lt;br /&gt;Too late to send it back sao maybe I will just use it on my hands.</li>
            <li> I have used the Skinceuticals sheer and physical fusion sunscreens for years and love them so I was pretty excited to try this product. I used it for the first time today. It applies well but unlike the other Skinceutical sunscreens  it stays sticky on your skin and not matte. There is no way I can use this line under my mineral foundation. Will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like wearing sunscreen on my face as it NEVER feels good and makes me breakout. This product feels great, you don&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing it! And NO breakouts!!</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen and have been using it for several years since my friend told me about this product. I live at a high altitude with strong sun and wear this sunscreen all year around. It is a great moisturizer and it does not melt or run down on your skin even when you play sports. The price of this product has gone up a lot, though. I used to be able to find it under $30 at Amazon when dermatologist were selling it for $40, but now it is hard to find it at such a lower price even at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 8 years and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t greasy and some sun protection products make my face red--Skinceuticals Ultimate and Physical does not&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered in a timely fashion and in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;I consider the seller excellent</li>
            <li> This is great for sunscreen with a moisturizer. I use it daily under makeup. Skinceutical products are one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. My face is so soft using it. It is not just a sunscreen it is an every day moisterizer!</li>
            <li> Great product as a moisturizer and sunblock.  It&#x27;s thick yet not too greasy. Quick delivery. Very well packaged.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen. It has zinc oxide which is a better ingredient than other chemicals found in the cheaper sunscreen. It is a bit pricy but it is quite big. I can use for several months.</li>
            <li> The best SPF for my fair and sensitive skin. Easy to apply makeup over it. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years and my wrinkle less face shows it. Works better than their 50 sheer fluid. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Been using this sunscreen for years. Definitely one of the best I&#x27;ve ever found. Great protection and I can use it every day without irritating my skin</li>
            <li> excellent and worth the money.  no burn all summer in southern colorado.  when i sweat, does not sting eyes.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals is the only facial sunscreen I will use on my face. Best stuff on the market, in my opinion. Huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy, absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t sting your eyes. This is a product where you truly get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product since last year, it is recommended by dermatologist and it does give you pretty good protection.  I decided order a few for my friends as a surprise gift, but the package came in a soft padded envelope which didn&#x27;t give enough protection to the boxes inside.  All 3 tubes came in in crumbled boxes, and the tubes looked like it had been used so I ended up not giving them out as gifts.  The seller should be more careful about the shipping package, it is not acceptable even for my own use.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Skinceuticals.  It smells like some type of motor oil.  Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I use the everyday!!!  It&#x27;s the best for you and it feels light on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!  Gives total protection plus is non-greasy and transparent.</li>
            <li> I found that using skinceuticals for under the eyes (deep dark circles) works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  It seems to be good for producting the skin as well.  But, I use it for under the eyes.  great product and very reasonable compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, it protects your skin and it works great over your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love it,not thick easy to apply i will order my second one</li>
            <li> BEST FACE LOTION ON THE MARKET!</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there.  I now see it in dematologists office.  Protects for hours, doesn&#x27;t look too white.  Combines chemical and physical sunscreens.</li>
            <li> Five star!  This is good working for me!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face, and this is one of the only sunscreens that I have found that doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling burned. I use it on my kids&#x27; entire bodies, despite how CRAZY expensive it is, because I know that it is that good.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years- dermatologist recommended it and they use it personally.  I use it every day all year long.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  It gives great protection, and is not &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; like a lot of UV products.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product for skin issues and it has worked wonderfully. i use it year round and have had no skin issues with outdoors.</li>
            <li> The best face sunscreen I have ever used. For my sensitive skin, it&#x27;s the only one that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.  I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with Skinceuticals 1% retinol refining night cream and if you&#x27;re using any sort of retinoid, SUNSCREEN IS A MUST.  Not only does it protect, it blends into the skin, not leaving any white residue and it can also be dubbed as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This one isn&#x27;t for me.  It&#x27;s too greasy to wear under my makeup and causes  breakouts.</li>
            <li> Only sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause break outs!! Love this!!! I am a product junkie and this is the best suncreen ever.....not greasy and no clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer sunscreen. Does not burn eyes when sweating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sensitive to chemical and synthetic smells and really appreciate having a product with no smell at all. It also works flawlessly to protect my skin. I use this SPF daily and extra in the sun. Can&#x27;t recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t put chemical sunscreens on my skin and the other physical blocking sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried (zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide) were greasy, sticky and left me with a distinctly white hue. But I got a sample of skinceuticals and LOVED it. I should done more research before ordering this particular product. There are other skinceutical sunscreens which are like the sample I received: not greasy, not sticky, yet 100% physical blockers. THIS IS NOT. This product contains octinoxate, a potentially unstable chemical sunscreen. If you&#x27;re like me and physical blocking is what you want, order the skinceuticals Sheer Physical UV Defense or Physical Fusion UV Defense (great for faces, it&#x27;s tinted). Both of those products are 100% physical blockers yet are sheer and feel great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Has successfully kept me from getting aditional basal cells for over 5 years; however, when I sweat it irrritates my eyes.  Looking for a UV moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t irritate eyes when exercising.</li>
            <li> Best coverage, long lasting and good for sensitive skin.  Have used it every summer on vacation in FL and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!</li>
            <li> I developed melanoma on my face a couple years ago. When the doc cut it out it was found not to be deep enough to cause me to loose my FAA medical certificate to flying airplanes. However, it was still deep enough to give me a very good scare. After it was cut out my dermatologist recommended that I use this Ultimate UV Defense Nourishing Broad-spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30. It&#x27;s a white cream but not greasy and therefore will wash off easily too. So you just have to make sure if you&#x27;re exposed to the sun that you&#x27;ve got it covered. It works well too. I never get red skin any more and I&#x27;ve pretty much lost any tan that I once had though I still find myself out in the sun no less than before. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> this stuff does the trick, use it every day</li>
            <li> Use it all the time and I feel it helps with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this sun block. Have been using for year and Amazon had the best price. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea.  The dermotologist originally sold me the Skinceuticals sunscreen.  Last year the office changed to another product that left me feeling sticky.  Since they no longer had Skinceuticals sunscreen, I turned to Amazon to get some more.  I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am in Florida for a couple of months and the sun is intense.  This product provides great protection for my skin!</li>
            <li> Great product; love it.</li>
            <li> I find that the 30 SPF provides me with Excellent protection from UVA and UVB rays.  Since I have been using it, I have had no additional dark spots or freckles.  I do use it consistently. This is a thick cream so a little bit goes a long way.  Moisturizes my  skin also.  Does not irritate my skin as some other sunscreens do.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my face to prevent brown spots and cancer</li>
            <li> good sun protection, and a good moisturiser and does not cause break outs i will not go out side camping hiking with out it , in fact I am ready to reorder</li>
            <li> love in winter very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> recommended by dermatologists</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceuticals UV Defence for nine years and am well satisfied. One added benefit is that it improved my complexion. It would be a five star rating except for my belief that there is always room for improvement.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Doubles as a moisturizer.  I have used this product for approximately two years and will continue using it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years. I like it because it has zinc but will be clear on my skin after it is applied. My skin is sensitive to many products and I never have a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Love Skinceuticals sunscreen. Have used for years. Bought some for my niece - she&#x27;s a believer now too. I used daily on face, neck, chest, and hands.</li>
            <li> too dry for my old skin</li>
            <li> I feel very protected when I use this product at 30spf. As a moisturizer, it goes on smoothly and is odorless.</li>
            <li> Used to get this from my aesthetician and they changed to a different line. I love how this feels on my face- not greasy and it moisturizes wonderfully</li>
            <li> the sun. The ONLY thing I use, have used for some 5 years now probably. Worth the money. I don&#x27;t even re-apply most days even on my boyfriend&#x27;s boat. People think I have the skin of a 45 year old and I just turned 60. Essential.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for years. It keeps my skin soft and the sun protection is evident. no visible damage from the sun.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product on one of my visits to a Red Door Spa &amp; Salon.  I liked it so much after running out of the first tub I was happy to find it on Amazon and purchased another tub.  It is light on my face and does not feel greasy at all.  I have sensitive skin and have not had any problems with breakouts due to the product.  I use it everyday regardless if the sun is out our not!  A little dollop goes a long way so the tube can last you months.  It&#x27;s not super expensive but is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this Skinceuticals sunscreen! Glides on easily without any mess and no oily residue. My skin felt healthy and works great on my sensitive skin. Always reapply after swimming. I highly recommend this sunscreen to my family, friends, and co-workers.</li>
            <li> LOVE it. Goes on smooth - no white residue</li>
            <li> In the arid Southwest, skin can take a beating. To protect my face from the sun&#x27;s harsh rays, I rely on this powerful sunscreen. After cleansing, I apply a layer of Skinceuticals. A daily practice that helps keep my skin young. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I apply this before beach days and have never burned in years.  Even after 4 hours, in and out of the water, no burn!  And my skin stays moist.</li>
            <li> Nice product without &#x27;bad for you&#x27; ingredient.</li>
            <li> My husband, daughter &amp; I are all avid tennis players who need good protection without white residue on our faces &amp; necks. This product is the best we have come across. It is well worth the extra $$!</li>
            <li> Best UV protection and lotion. Been using this for years and it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it works great, no break outs.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in. Very disappointed. Stick with Neutrogena!&lt;br /&gt;Also I received a day later than what Amazon promised.</li>
