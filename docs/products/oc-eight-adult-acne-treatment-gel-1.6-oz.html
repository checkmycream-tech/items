            <li>I love this product and this purchase was in line with the consistently good product that I am accustom to.</li>
            <li>bought it for my 11 yr old daughter and it works great!</li>
            <li>Works great on my face, not so great on neck and back.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it works great as he keeps ordering it!</li>
            <li>She recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad I listened.</li>
            <li>Instead I got more oil, more irritation and shine that even blotting sheets couldn&#x27;t get rid of.</li>
            <li>we tried proactiv but its too many steps for a 12 yo.</li>

            <li>The acne medicine in it was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>

            <li>Totally worth it!</li>

            <li>feels okay on the skin, but the mattifying effect doesn&#x27;t really exist!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff it really works</li>
            <li>and i recieved it quickly</li>
            <li>It really works!!</li>
            <li>but if you rub it in all the way when you put it on in the first place, there should be no reason for it to bleach anything.</li>
            <li>It burned a tiny bit in the beginning, but not any more.  </li>
            <li>I recently wrote a review for the original formula, and I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars because it broke me out for some reason wherever I applied it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the regular OC8, and that worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It dries my skin out, but not so much that I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>Acne gel works really well.  </li>
            <li>But otherwise, this stuff works for real.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily for acne on my shoulders and back, but also to use on my face.  </li>
            <li>Now this gel is going straight in the trash</li>
            <li>Works well, but contains so much bleaching agents that almost anything it touches is ruined.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t last a full 8 hours on me), it&#x27;s still not a glossy type of shine on my face like it used to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This will dry you out so maybe match it up with a oil free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is effective with minimal irritation, and it can be used more or less according to my current needs.</li>
            <li>White part does not show up right away if you put too much on.  </li>
            <li>I still have the blackheads, but it has seemed to help clear my large cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I did cause a burning sensation the first several times I used it, but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i expect a gel to be clear.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far in that</li>
            <li>It really works, especially for pimples underneath the skin.</li>
            <li>I discovered, though, is that when I washed my clothes they came out completely ruined.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and have noticed a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much success with other things and this actually works.</li>
            <li>Was sent the regular blue oc8 gel and not the green adult acne oc8 gel which I had originally bought</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does dry out your skin a little bit, but if you&#x27;re a person with oily skin, this should work just fine for you.</li>
            <li>tube has so much additional air in it that with the thin viscosity it spurts out of the tube too quickly and wastefully.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne my entire teenage and adult life.</li>
            <li>Although it may seem expensive at first glance, it&#x27;s less pricey than my copay for prescriptions -- but it works better.</li>
            <li>Only thing is you have to be careful not to put too much on as it will leave a white finish on your face that you do not notice until later when you have probably had on your face without people telling you it is there!  </li>
            <li>this is a thin paste that leaves a fine white film on the skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Apparently it works great as he keeps ordering it!</li>
            <li> I will be honest, I am very skeptical about any acne treatments. I have had acne since I was a teenager and am now almost 30. It has been pretty frustrating.  I have used everything and nothing has helped. I&#x27;ve been to the dermatologist and the prescriptions have not helped.  Proactiv helped for a little while, but it&#x27;s almost as if my skin got used to it and it just stopped working. I gave this a shot, hoping that it would not cause a massive break out. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and I must say it&#x27;s pretty good. I still have the blackheads, but it has seemed to help clear my large cystic acne. Now if only I could find something for the blackheads, I&#x27;d be golden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely oily skin and it did dry it out a little at first, but now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Just started my 2nd tube.  Controls acne, and absorbs oil so that I&#x27;m not too greasy looking at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It felt weird when putting it on and also made my skin way too dry.</li>
            <li> Used this for several years...started when it was by prescription only.  If you apply this daily you will eliminate a lot of acne.  Apply it all over or just on a breakout as needed.  Sometimes if I apply it to a blemish right away, it magically disappears!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST! I recently wrote a review for the original formula, and I didn&#x27;t give it a full five stars because it broke me out for some reason wherever I applied it. So I ordered this one to counteract the acne that it caused me to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does dry out your skin a little bit, but if you&#x27;re a person with oily skin, this should work just fine for you. I only apply in the morning, and have used it one time as a spot treatment at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have said that it will bleach anything it touches... but if you rub it in all the way when you put it on in the first place, there should be no reason for it to bleach anything. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now and have noticed a major difference in my skin. It&#x27;s clear and it doesn&#x27;t shine like it used to- even when it&#x27;s worn off after a few hours (it doesn&#x27;t last a full 8 hours on me), it&#x27;s still not a glossy type of shine on my face like it used to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep buying this.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist for a recommendation on a product that would help cut down on the amount oil on my skin. She recommended this product and I&#x27;m so glad I listened. It does just what it says it will do. It dries my skin out, but not so much that I can&#x27;t use it. I can put my moisturizer on overtop of it, and still have oil-free skin all day. Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Use this all the time. Great at keeping oil to a minimum. Ordered several times and will continue . This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Acne gel works really well.  I have not had ANY break outs since starting to use this gel.  Only thing is you have to be careful not to put too much on as it will leave a white finish on your face that you do not notice until later when you have probably had on your face without people telling you it is there!  White part does not show up right away if you put too much on.  Use like pea size over entire face or smaller amt.</li>
            <li> It really works, especially for pimples underneath the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the regular OC8, and that worked fine.  This one, however, irritated my skin.  The acne medicine in it was too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> i expect a gel to be clear.  this is a thin paste that leaves a fine white film on the skin. tube has so much additional air in it that with the thin viscosity it spurts out of the tube too quickly and wastefully.  the medicine is strong enough that it is very drying and works best localized on the areas needed.</li>
            <li> i was spectating to much is no good product and it dos not work at all.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it&#x27;s possible, but this product made my oily skin problem worse! It didn&#x27;t help at all :-( Instead I got more oil, more irritation and shine that even blotting sheets couldn&#x27;t get rid of. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. Maybe it works for some but not for me...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it really works and i recieved it quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only thing that works. It hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin like other products. I&#x27;ll dilute it a bit with water and that helps reduce any potential dryness or redness.</li>
            <li> This will dry you out so maybe match it up with a oil free moisturizer. But otherwise, this stuff works for real. I didn&#x27;t have much success with other things and this actually works. I am super impressed but it can stain clothes if you have it on your hands. another watch out</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best invention, ever! I have suffered from acne my entire teenage and adult life. This product is the ONLY thing that has reduced the amount of oil production on my skin throughout the day. After a week, my facial blemishes were GONE. Apply a thin coat in the morning before applying makeup and you are done. I wish they made a product for chest and back acne because I would definitely try it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this purchase was in line with the consistently good product that I am accustom to.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily for acne on my shoulders and back, but also to use on my face.  It works great for body acne.  It worked for my face, but was not convenient for day time use because it has a somewhat gritty texture.  I did cause a burning sensation the first several times I used it, but I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I discovered, though, is that when I washed my clothes they came out completely ruined.  Every spot where I was using the gel, my clothing was dyed a bright color.  I had to throw away several shirts.  It did not appear until I washed my clothes, so I am still waiting to see if anything else is ruined.  Now this gel is going straight in the trash so it doesn&#x27;t happen.  Too bad because it did work well on acne.</li>
            <li> OC8 was recommended by my dermatologist. Although it may seem expensive at first glance, it&#x27;s less pricey than my copay for prescriptions -- but it works better. It is effective with minimal irritation, and it can be used more or less according to my current needs.</li>
            <li> Always had problem skin.  Was a little nervous about using it but it works great!  It burned a tiny bit in the beginning, but not any more.  In the beginning, I used it twice a day, but now only one time a day.  On my second tube now.  Works great on my face, not so great on neck and back.  Not sure why that is.  May be because I don&#x27;t use it every day there.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use this product because I have combination skin that gets oily during the day. It prevents breakouts and gives me a matte finish throughout the day. I have been using this product for about 2 years now and I have no plans on changing my routine. love it!</li>
            <li> Recommended by my esthetician and I&#x27;ve already been through one bottle!! Love this product!! It really works!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but contains so much bleaching agents that almost anything it touches is ruined.</li>
            <li> Was sent the regular blue oc8 gel and not the green adult acne oc8 gel which I had originally bought</li>
            <li> Worked when nothing else did-along with neutrogena acne stress control cleaning pads.  we tried proactiv but its too many steps for a 12 yo. We tried topical antibiotic/benzoyl peroxide, nothing. Oral antibiotic didnt even work. This product has a matte finish that takes the edge off the look of it, and seems to control oil production. His skin is dry sometimes but he just takes a break every couple of days. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product. My son was about to be on accutane and the doctor decided  not to use it&lt;br /&gt;Because of the amacing results</li>
            <li> bought it for my 11 yr old daughter and it works great!</li>
            <li> feels okay on the skin, but the mattifying effect doesn&#x27;t really exist!</li>
            <li> My wife uses it for medical reasons and this is very effective for acne condition</li>
