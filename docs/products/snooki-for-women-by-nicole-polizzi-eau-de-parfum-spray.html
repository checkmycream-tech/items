            <li>:) I would recommend this perfume and the price for it on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was able to test hers out.</li>
            <li>bottle was cute to</li>
            <li>Cute bottle, but if you have Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy like I do..</li>
            <li>yet?\\&quot;, you can imagine the face I made, but when I took a wiff of it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li>really really love the smell, i&#x27;d describe it as fruity and it lasts</li>
            <li>u put it on a jacket it smells like that for about a couple of weeks :))</li>
            <li>I love the scent bought two bottles and will buy more.</li>
            <li>Cute bottle too.</li>
            <li>I smelled this in the store and was in love with it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price they were charging.  </li>
            <li>but when I smelt it I fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>Love both.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel clean and nice.</li>
            <li>I have loved this perfume since it first came out</li>
            <li>I love how this perfume isn&#x27;t too strong and gradually smells sweeter (like candy)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a large bottle and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li>obviously I&#x27;m a HUGE Jersey Shore fan :)</li>
            <li>I use it frequently and am happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my sister for Christmas last year and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li>there was a free tote bag in the picture and in all the reviews people said how much they loved it.</li>
            <li>Amazingly this perfume smells really soft and nice.</li>
            <li>It kinda reminds me of the britney spears perfume Fantasy but its not has strong.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t give you a headache.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fruity, sweet, and sexy scent this is for you check it out.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too overwhelming or too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I am a true fan of this perfume now and all of my favorite brands (Juicy Couture, Beyonce Heat, Brittany Spears Fantasy) have now been replaced.</li>
            <li>The scent wears off fairly quickly, so you end up using more than you probably should.</li>
            <li>Great present.</li>
            <li>It smells like a light cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li>Light and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li>i think you will love it as much as i do:)</li>
            <li>It is sweet but not too sweet; it&#x27;s more of a fresh-sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>But for some reason she is really popular with high school students.</li>
            <li>such an all around great fragrance really for any age :)</li>
            <li>I was so excited to recieve it.</li>
            <li>i liked it, a little tooo strong but it was nice..</li>
            <li>I ordered it without smelling it first and was very surprised at how good it smelled.</li>
            <li>If you like floral sweet soft scented perfumes with a slight kick, you will definitely love this one and this seller is in my opinion the best person to buy it from.</li>
            <li>and it was a huge success...</li>
            <li>I will start by saying that I have about 112 perfumes, this fragrance had gotten good reviews on a website I regular</li>
            <li>am really picking up on the Lychee, Vanilla, and Jasmine the most.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it that much that I had to write a review.....</li>
            <li>It is definitely a sweet scent, but not overly so.</li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>
            <li>Does not smell cheap or too powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a very good, soft, sweet gourmand fragrance, similar to Fantasy, but lighter.  </li>
            <li>Since purchasing and wearing it, I&#x27;ve attracted the most handsome Italian men</li>
            <li>kinda figures that it would turn out to be a kmart worthy smell...</li>
            <li>it goes on smelling like \\&quot;cotton candy and perfume\\&quot; but quickly changes to \\&quot;just like cotton candy\\&quot;, and it does smell sweeter and sweeter longer</li>
            <li>Luckily my sister&#x27;s boyfriend bought it for her</li>
            <li>I found it to be pretty light, not a heavy sweet smell like Fantasy (which I do love as well).</li>
            <li>She loves this perfume, it is a nice soft scent for those who have to smell it ;-).</li>
            <li>Received item as described, fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li>I went to my first beach rave!  </li>
            <li>Not only does this smell amazing, the scent lasts for hours.</li>
            <li>I bought two bottles on the spot and got the bag for free (which I absolutely adore).</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND USED IT ALL UP A TWISTED A CANDY AND FLORAL SMELL GOOD JOB SNOOKIE</li>
            <li>and I started to make fun of her, because I cannot stand Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a trashy white girl perfume from the dollar store,</li>
            <li>This is a fun, carefree scent...</li>
            <li>While others make fun of her lifestyle, I just have to applaud it.  </li>
            <li>It is sort of light as for as lasting on your skin, but I was able to smell it all day.  </li>
            <li>I loved it so much, that the day I recieved it,I ordered her other perfume \\&quot;Snooki</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it, but it does not ship to where I live in Alaska.</li>
            <li>YouTube even contacted me about advertising on a channel and wants to pay me!  </li>
            <li>i bought this as a valentines present for my wife,  she said it smells ok</li>
            <li>-- but this is the first perfume</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty, sensual, and kinda fruity-flirty if that makes sense....</li>
            <li>I have never bought perfume without smelling it first, but when I heard it smelled like cotton candy I decided to take the risk.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous!</li>
            <li>If you know someone who loves Snooki, they are most likely going to like this.</li>
            <li>i love  this this perfume i cant say enough about it except it is awesome&lt;</li>
            <li>I fell in love with this stuff and could only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>absolutely!</li>
            <li>So MANY people love this that you can&#x27;t go wrong and will definitely NOT be disappointed!  </li>
            <li>it is an amazing scent i look forward to purchasing other fragrances from her.</li>
            <li>smells amazing and unlike other perfumes, does not stain clothing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with how reasonable the price is for this perfume since its eau de parfum spray- VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, exactly what is stated.</li>
            <li>Its not to strong but just enough that you can smell it.</li>
            <li>The perfume scent is amazing and doesn&#x27;t have that aggressive, harsh scent like those over-powering perfumes that have way too much alcohol.</li>
            <li>Ive heard mixed reviews on this fragrance by Nicole Polizzi (Snooki), but decided to go ahead and purchase it, I have a huge perfume collection.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve EVER bought just because Im that much into a TV show-</li>
            <li>So she really likes that.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness Amazon does AND at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone that wants that flirty perfume.</li>
            <li>In a way it smells like that pink bottle of perfume by Britany Spears, but its way better.</li>
            <li>They have a very fruity/candy like scent to them.</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived quickly and was bigger than I thought!</li>
            <li>I chose snooki and highly regret it.</li>
            <li>Lychee, Quince flower, Kiwi, Vanilla, White jasmine, &amp; fresh driftwood are the main notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know where to buy this in stores where I live</li>
            <li>this stuff is hard to find so we were glad about the price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love the pink to purple ombre of color and its a very big bottle too.</li>
            <li>A complete stranger uploaded video of me to YouTube where I&#x27;ve gotten a million views for  puking on cue!  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying anymore perfume online unless I&#x27;ve actually smelled it first.</li>
            <li>I love this scent, it&#x27;s a little different than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this and was hoping it would be different than everything else that&#x27;s out there,</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how well it smells.</li>
            <li>There are LOTS of floral notes in this perfume, but it still smells really soft.</li>
            <li>The contents was completely unharmed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells too sweet and musky and is not worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very overpowering and the first initial scent is a nose burning peppery smell.</li>
            <li>It smells like Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy perfume, the first Fantasy in the pink bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for myself has an early 20th birthday gift for me</li>
            <li>I discovered for the first time in my life, that I love to drink ridiculous alcoholic beverages, like energy drinks mixed with vodka and eye drops.  </li>

            <li> I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> The Bag is nice but the perfume smells really cheap.</li>
            <li> Its so cute, and i love how it has the animal print on it.  </li>
            <li> so i knew i would fall in love with this fragnaces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to say the design of the perfume bottle is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> :) I would recommend this perfume and the price for it on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was able to test hers out.</li>
            <li> bottle was cute to</li>
            <li> Cute bottle, but if you have Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy like I do..</li>
            <li> yet?\\&quot;, you can imagine the face I made, but when I took a wiff of it, I fell in love.</li>
            <li> really really love the smell, i&#x27;d describe it as fruity and it lasts</li>
            <li> u put it on a jacket it smells like that for about a couple of weeks :))</li>
            <li> I love the scent bought two bottles and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Cute bottle too.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in the store and was in love with it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price they were charging.  </li>
            <li> but when I smelt it I fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> Love both.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel clean and nice.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it first came out</li>
            <li> I love how this perfume isn&#x27;t too strong and gradually smells sweeter (like candy)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large bottle and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> obviously I&#x27;m a HUGE Jersey Shore fan :)</li>
            <li> I use it frequently and am happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas last year and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> there was a free tote bag in the picture and in all the reviews people said how much they loved it.</li>
            <li> Amazingly this perfume smells really soft and nice.</li>
            <li> It kinda reminds me of the britney spears perfume Fantasy but its not has strong.</li>
            <li> Its not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t give you a headache.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fruity, sweet, and sexy scent this is for you check it out.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too overwhelming or too sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I am a true fan of this perfume now and all of my favorite brands (Juicy Couture, Beyonce Heat, Brittany Spears Fantasy) have now been replaced.</li>
            <li> The scent wears off fairly quickly, so you end up using more than you probably should.</li>
            <li> Great present.</li>
            <li> It smells like a light cotton candy scent.</li>
            <li> Light and not overbearing.  </li>
            <li> i think you will love it as much as i do:)</li>
            <li> It is sweet but not too sweet; it&#x27;s more of a fresh-sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> But for some reason she is really popular with high school students.</li>
            <li> such an all around great fragrance really for any age :)</li>
            <li> I was so excited to recieve it.</li>
            <li> i liked it, a little tooo strong but it was nice..</li>
            <li> I ordered it without smelling it first and was very surprised at how good it smelled.</li>
            <li> If you like floral sweet soft scented perfumes with a slight kick, you will definitely love this one and this seller is in my opinion the best person to buy it from.</li>
            <li> and it was a huge success...</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I have about 112 perfumes, this fragrance had gotten good reviews on a website I regular</li>
            <li> am really picking up on the Lychee, Vanilla, and Jasmine the most.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it that much that I had to write a review.....</li>
            <li> It is definitely a sweet scent, but not overly so.</li>
            <li> Sweet.</li>
            <li> Does not smell cheap or too powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a very good, soft, sweet gourmand fragrance, similar to Fantasy, but lighter.  </li>
            <li> Since purchasing and wearing it, I&#x27;ve attracted the most handsome Italian men</li>
            <li> kinda figures that it would turn out to be a kmart worthy smell...</li>
            <li> it goes on smelling like \\&quot;cotton candy and perfume\\&quot; but quickly changes to \\&quot;just like cotton candy\\&quot;, and it does smell sweeter and sweeter longer</li>
            <li> Luckily my sister&#x27;s boyfriend bought it for her</li>
            <li> I found it to be pretty light, not a heavy sweet smell like Fantasy (which I do love as well).</li>
            <li> She loves this perfume, it is a nice soft scent for those who have to smell it ;-).</li>
            <li> Received item as described, fast shipping!!  </li>
            <li> I went to my first beach rave!  </li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing, the scent lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles on the spot and got the bag for free (which I absolutely adore).</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND USED IT ALL UP A TWISTED A CANDY AND FLORAL SMELL GOOD JOB SNOOKIE</li>
            <li> and I started to make fun of her, because I cannot stand Jersey Shore.</li>
            <li> Kind of like a trashy white girl perfume from the dollar store,</li>
            <li> This is a fun, carefree scent...</li>
            <li> While others make fun of her lifestyle, I just have to applaud it.  </li>
            <li> It is sort of light as for as lasting on your skin, but I was able to smell it all day.  </li>
            <li> I loved it so much, that the day I recieved it,I ordered her other perfume \\&quot;Snooki</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it, but it does not ship to where I live in Alaska.</li>
            <li> YouTube even contacted me about advertising on a channel and wants to pay me!  </li>
            <li> i bought this as a valentines present for my wife,  she said it smells ok</li>
            <li> -- but this is the first perfume</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty, sensual, and kinda fruity-flirty if that makes sense....</li>
            <li> I have never bought perfume without smelling it first, but when I heard it smelled like cotton candy I decided to take the risk.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous!</li>
            <li> If you know someone who loves Snooki, they are most likely going to like this.</li>
            <li> i love  this this perfume i cant say enough about it except it is awesome&lt;</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this stuff and could only find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> absolutely!</li>
            <li> So MANY people love this that you can&#x27;t go wrong and will definitely NOT be disappointed!  </li>
            <li> it is an amazing scent i look forward to purchasing other fragrances from her.</li>
            <li> smells amazing and unlike other perfumes, does not stain clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with how reasonable the price is for this perfume since its eau de parfum spray- VERY REASONABLE.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, exactly what is stated.</li>
            <li> Its not to strong but just enough that you can smell it.</li>
            <li> The perfume scent is amazing and doesn&#x27;t have that aggressive, harsh scent like those over-powering perfumes that have way too much alcohol.</li>
            <li> Ive heard mixed reviews on this fragrance by Nicole Polizzi (Snooki), but decided to go ahead and purchase it, I have a huge perfume collection.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve EVER bought just because Im that much into a TV show-</li>
            <li> So she really likes that.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness Amazon does AND at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that wants that flirty perfume.</li>
            <li> In a way it smells like that pink bottle of perfume by Britany Spears, but its way better.</li>
            <li> They have a very fruity/candy like scent to them.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived quickly and was bigger than I thought!</li>
            <li> I chose snooki and highly regret it.</li>
            <li> Lychee, Quince flower, Kiwi, Vanilla, White jasmine, &amp; fresh driftwood are the main notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where to buy this in stores where I live</li>
            <li> this stuff is hard to find so we were glad about the price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love the pink to purple ombre of color and its a very big bottle too.</li>
            <li> A complete stranger uploaded video of me to YouTube where I&#x27;ve gotten a million views for  puking on cue!  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying anymore perfume online unless I&#x27;ve actually smelled it first.</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s a little different than what I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this and was hoping it would be different than everything else that&#x27;s out there,</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how well it smells.</li>
            <li> There are LOTS of floral notes in this perfume, but it still smells really soft.</li>
            <li> The contents was completely unharmed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells too sweet and musky and is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very overpowering and the first initial scent is a nose burning peppery smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy perfume, the first Fantasy in the pink bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself has an early 20th birthday gift for me</li>
            <li> I discovered for the first time in my life, that I love to drink ridiculous alcoholic beverages, like energy drinks mixed with vodka and eye drops.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 star rating is because it doesnt seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s delicate and very girly.</li>
            <li> Usually when a celebrity comes out with a new perfume it smells like all the others out there, but this one does not.</li>
            <li> The closest Perfumania to me is around half an hour away, and due to the holiday season I was just too busy to get there.</li>
            <li> I usually pay no less than 35 for any parfum spray.</li>
            <li> Snooki&#x27;s perfume is a knock off of Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been wearing it for a few days.</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> This was only used for a few months before the spray connection started to leak.  </li>
            <li> I was so curious to smell this fragrance as soon as I heard about it.</li>
            <li> Fans of Fantasy, Pink Sugar and L de Lolita may like this one as well.</li>
            <li> and I was really not looking forward to opening the box.</li>
            <li> It reminds me a lot of Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way unless you want to smell like a cheapie..</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, it reminded me faintly of cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> She gets compliments at school from the other girls and boys too.</li>
            <li> It has no pretty fragrance to it like Vera Wang.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it did not come with the bag as described.</li>
            <li> It has no distinct smell, it just smells like musty poop...</li>
            <li> but with less of a spicy scent.</li>
            <li> It was in a little boxed wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the Jersey Shore craze.</li>
            <li> even if you do buy it without smelling first, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s been a big hit in family.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl-friend and when she sprayed it on she became a trashy alcoholic with hepatitis.  </li>
            <li> not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Hard Candy fragrance I have,</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the worse ever.  </li>
            <li> But this was way to expensive in the stores</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suttle and not like her other nasty floral smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li> and now I feel really bad for being so judgmental.</li>
            <li> very disappointed</li>
            <li> , kinda disappointed that I didnt keep it for myself!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Smells delicious its a good price for this perfume</li>
            <li> Received item as described, fast shipping!!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> there was a free tote bag in the picture and in all the reviews people said how much they loved it. it was one of the only reasons i bought the perfume. i never received the tote bag. was then promised a refund and never received it. very disappointed</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas last year and she loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> Excellent and cute product? Great present. Perfect timing for a Christmas present. Would definitely recommend this item to anyone who is into snooky</li>
            <li> I was looking for the perfect perfume, and a friend showed me a link to this delightful fragrance.  Since purchasing and wearing it, I&#x27;ve attracted the most handsome Italian men - you wouldn&#x27;t believe the attention I&#x27;m getting!  I discovered for the first time in my life, that I love to drink ridiculous alcoholic beverages, like energy drinks mixed with vodka and eye drops.  I went to my first beach rave!  I&#x27;m a daring fashionista wearing animal print!  A complete stranger uploaded video of me to YouTube where I&#x27;ve gotten a million views for  puking on cue!  YouTube even contacted me about advertising on a channel and wants to pay me!  I&#x27;m telling you - this perfume will make you RICH and FAMOUS!  It&#x27;s turned me into a completely different woman, which I never thought possible!  And the best part?  It smells like self-tanner, Aquanet, and shame!</li>
            <li> Truly an amazing product!! The perfume scent is amazing and doesn&#x27;t have that aggressive, harsh scent like those over-powering perfumes that have way too much alcohol. The extra bonus of the zebra print tote bag makes a a wonderful gift set. Great holiday gift or for any occassions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Jersey Whore but my wife is so I got this scent for her and we both love it. It smells like a light cotton candy scent. It&#x27;s suttle and not like her other nasty floral smelling perfumes. My only complaint is that it did not come with the bag as described.</li>
            <li> I have loved this perfume since it first came out and I met Snooki at her perfume signing. But this was way to expensive in the stores so I&#x27;m so  glad I found it on amazon for a great price!  I love the smell of the perfume an the bottle I so cute! I recommend!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells too sweet and musky and is not worth the price. It is stinky and feels like I need to take a shower after spritzing it on! It has no distinct smell, it just smells like musty poop...I purchased it at a kmart...kinda figures that it would turn out to be a kmart worthy smell...hopefully they will let me return it....not a fan!</li>
            <li> I love how this perfume isn&#x27;t too strong and gradually smells sweeter (like candy) the longer you wear it, especially because I like sweeter smelling perfumes (and not a flowery smell).</li>
            <li> Snooki&#x27;s perfume is a knock off of Aquolina&#x27;s Pink Sugar. I won&#x27;t be buying anymore perfume online unless I&#x27;ve actually smelled it first. This perfume does not smell like candy at all. It&#x27;s very overpowering and the first initial scent is a nose burning peppery smell. After about 5 minutes, the scent becomes nauseating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this and was hoping it would be different than everything else that&#x27;s out there, but it&#x27;s just not.</li>
            <li> I will start by saying that I have about 112 perfumes, this fragrance had gotten good reviews on a website I regular so I added it to my wish list. Lychee, Quince flower, Kiwi, Vanilla, White jasmine, &amp; fresh driftwood are the main notes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really picking up on the Lychee, Vanilla, and Jasmine the most. It smells very similar to he *Hard Candy fragrance I have, but with less of a spicy scent. All in all weather you like Snooki or not it&#x27;s a great fragrance for the price and I am glad it&#x27;s sticking around my perfume collection.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a xmas gift and it was a huge success... now I want to buy one for myself!  I loved the bag and the perfume smelled awesome, kinda disappointed that I didnt keep it for myself!!  lol</li>
            <li> i bought this as a valentines present for my wife,  she said it smells ok but it reminds her of cigarettes.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this.  When I first put it on, it reminded me faintly of cotton candy.  Light and not overbearing.  I use it frequently and am happy with the purchase.  Nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume as a recommendation from someone else. I ordered it without smelling it first and was very surprised at how good it smelled. I wear it all the time and the scent lasts all day. I have gotten numerous compliments from women as well as men on this scent. It is fresh and a great summer scent.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AWESOME MY DAUGHTER LOVED IT AND USED IT ALL UP A TWISTED A CANDY AND FLORAL SMELL GOOD JOB SNOOKIE</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of the Jersey Shore craze. BUT, my daughter is. She loves this perfume, it is a nice soft scent for those who have to smell it ;-). The bag was an added bonus. The bag is of nice quality for a gift with purchase. I reccommend for the Snooki fans...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this perfume.  It smells like candy!  I&#x27;ve received several compliments already and I&#x27;ve only been wearing it for a few days.</li>
            <li> i absoultly love this perfume from snooki it is an amazing scent i look forward to purchasing other fragrances from her. If you are looking for a fruity, sweet, and sexy scent this is for you check it out.</li>
            <li> I bought Snooki&#x27;s perfume as a gift to myself--obviously I&#x27;m a HUGE Jersey Shore fan :)-- but this is the first perfume I&#x27;ve EVER bought just because Im that much into a TV show- seriously-just sayin- and I LOVE it that much that I had to write a review..... it&#x27;s pretty, sensual, and kinda fruity-flirty if that makes sense....such an all around great fragrance really for any age :)</li>
            <li> Very nice perfume.  My granddaughter loved it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell amazing, the scent lasts for hours. It comes in a beautiful bottle and is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to order this for my daughter. She is 14. She gets compliments at school from the other girls and boys too. So she really likes that. I was surprised at how well it smells. Usually when a celebrity comes out with a new perfume it smells like all the others out there, but this one does not. Snookie did a great job !!</li>
            <li> This purchase was the worse ever.  I wrote to the seller for a refund/replacement and never heard a thing.  Be careful.  This was only used for a few months before the spray connection started to leak.  Did not like.</li>
            <li> i just love the smell of this. It makes me feel clean and nice. My friends love the smell of it :). i would recommend it to anyone who is scared of getting it</li>
            <li> This smells good. It is sold at a great price and it made a great gift.  I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> Amazingly this perfume smells really soft and nice. Every time I wear it I get so many compliments. I initially bought it at QVC but they don&#x27;t carry it anymore. Thank goodness Amazon does AND at a reasonable price. Please keep it in stock!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume off of HSN. My mom told me I could either pick snooki perfume or Vera Wang Princess. I chose snooki and highly regret it. The Bag is nice but the perfume smells really cheap. It has no pretty fragrance to it like Vera Wang. She asked me if I liked it. I said yeah, but if I could return it, I would</li>
            <li> This perfume is so amazing. I love the sweet smell of it. Its not to strong but just enough that you can smell it. It kinda reminds me of the britney spears perfume Fantasy but its not has strong. I was so excited to recieve it. Its so cute, and i love how it has the animal print on it.  I am a fan of jersey shore, and snooki reminds me of her so i knew i would fall in love with this fragnaces. I recommend this to anyone that wants that flirty perfume. I purchased this for myself has an early 20th birthday gift for me and i don&#x27;t regret it one bit.  \\&quot;TEAM SNOOKI\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with how reasonable the price is for this perfume since its eau de parfum spray- VERY REASONABLE. I usually pay no less than 35 for any parfum spray. I&#x27;ve ordered this twice from this selling now. I was over at a friends and we were looking through her perfume before going out. I saw she had this and I started to make fun of her, because I cannot stand Jersey Shore. She told me,&amp;#34;Laugh all you want, this perfume smells SOO GOOD.&amp;#34; Me being the stubborn person I am, I told her I couldn&#x27;t believe any product by any of those people could be good. I was dead wrong. This perfume smells SO DAMN GOOD. There are LOTS of floral notes in this perfume, but it still smells really soft. Almost like there is a spicy/vanilla undertone. I thought it would smell well.. Kind of like a trashy white girl perfume from the dollar store, and now I feel really bad for being so judgmental. I don&#x27;t know where to buy this in stores where I live so I&#x27;ve bought this twice now from the same seller. The shipping was faster than Amazon said it would be. The UPS packaging was awesome. It was in a little boxed wrapped in bubble wrap. The contents was completely unharmed. I&#x27;d also like to say the design of the perfume bottle is absolutely adorable. I love the pink to purple ombre of color and its a very big bottle too. If you like floral sweet soft scented perfumes with a slight kick, you will definitely love this one and this seller is in my opinion the best person to buy it from.</li>
            <li> Smell Great Ladies U Must Have</li>
            <li> I placed my order for snooki perfume on a wednesday and received it on Friday!! One of the best online shopping experiences I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
            <li> I have never bought perfume without smelling it first, but when I heard it smelled like cotton candy I decided to take the risk. I was very nervous! I&#x27;m glad I took risk, I love it! It smells great! it goes on smelling like \\&quot;cotton candy and perfume\\&quot; but quickly changes to \\&quot;just like cotton candy\\&quot;, and it does smell sweeter and sweeter longer you wear it. The bottle arrived quickly and was bigger than I thought!</li>
            <li> This perfume reminds me of Jessica Simpson&#x27;s Fancy perfume. It has that baby powder, musk type of smell, not flowery or fruity. It doesn&#x27;t smell like candy to me like everyone was saying and it doesn&#x27;t remind me of Britney Spear&#x27;s perfume Fantasy either. I recommend smelling it before buying it to smell for yourself. It does smell really good though so even if you do buy it without smelling first, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed :) I would recommend this perfume and the price for it on Amazon can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#LoveSnooki</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, exactly what is stated.</li>
            <li> I was so curious to smell this fragrance as soon as I heard about it. The closest Perfumania to me is around half an hour away, and due to the holiday season I was just too busy to get there. Luckily my sister&#x27;s boyfriend bought it for her and I was able to test hers out. I LOVE this scent! It is definitely a sweet scent, but not overly so. I found it to be pretty light, not a heavy sweet smell like Fantasy (which I do love as well). This is a fun, carefree scent...so if you tend towards the sweeter scents, buy this one. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> i liked it, a little tooo strong but it was nice.. little goes a long way unless you want to smell like a cheapie.. probably may buy it again.. bottle was cute to</li>
            <li> This is a very good, soft, sweet gourmand fragrance, similar to Fantasy, but lighter.  Fans of Fantasy, Pink Sugar and L de Lolita may like this one as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume for my daughter for Christmas.  She absolutely loved it.&lt;br /&gt;Was a good size bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> It smells like Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy perfume, the first Fantasy in the pink bottle. Cute bottle, but if you have Britney Spears&#x27; Fantasy like I do..no use in having the same fragrance unless you just have to have it.</li>
            <li> i love the perfume i will buy it again ,,,very light and smells great ..... if she ever comes out with another one i would buy that one too</li>
            <li> I bought this as my girlfriend loves snookie !! I&#x27;ve never been a fan of girl fragrances but this one sure does smell good ! Would recommend !!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for a relative who loves all things Snooki.  She loved it and stated it was a great fragrance (she is a teenager).  If you know someone who loves Snooki, they are most likely going to like this.</li>
            <li> I was never a big fan of Snooki, period. SO when I was browsing around in the perfume store and the sales lady goes \\&quot;Have you smelled the Snooki perfume yet?\\&quot;, you can imagine the face I made, but when I took a wiff of it, I fell in love. I bought two bottles on the spot and got the bag for free (which I absolutely adore). Then some of the ladies in my family complimented me on my perfume, I decided to hit up Amazon for it to give as gifts. They were all just as suprised as I was to smell Snooki&#x27;s perfume. Needless to say, it&#x27;s been a big hit in family.</li>
            <li> Got this for my birthday, was my biggest wish and i didn&#x27;t even know&lt;br /&gt;the smell so it was a big surprise (you cant buy it here in germany-&gt;import).&lt;br /&gt;I really really love the smell, i&#x27;d describe it as fruity and it lasts ultra long.&lt;br /&gt;If u put it on a jacket it smells like that for about a couple of weeks :))&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to miss it anymore </li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Awesome smell lasts all day. I had to get some for myself</li>
            <li> i love  this this perfume i cant say enough about it except it is awesome&lt;br /&gt;ladies try this i think you will love it as much as i do:)</li>
            <li> While others make fun of her lifestyle, I just have to applaud it.  Great scent and on her way to making a great empire.  Keep up the great work Nicole.  You&#x27;re awesome!</li>
            <li> I love the scent bought two bottles and will buy more. It works for me thank you nicole/snooki. You rock.</li>
            <li> this stuff is hard to find so we were glad about the price and fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> I love this scent, it&#x27;s a little different than what I&#x27;m used to but it&#x27;s light, sweet &amp; great for all occasions. I will use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of Snooki, only purchased it because I like the scent..reminds me of BCBG max azria&#x27;s perfume! Sweet.</li>
            <li> Love this! smells so good not to strong great price every time I go out someone says how good I smell love it great deal  5🌟</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this stuff and could only find it on Amazon. Would I order it again...absolutely!</li>
            <li> this is my favorite perfume! i will recommened it to anyone. smells amazing and unlike other perfumes, does not stain clothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girl-friend and when she sprayed it on she became a trashy alcoholic with hepatitis.  But for some reason she is really popular with high school students.</li>
            <li> Ive heard mixed reviews on this fragrance by Nicole Polizzi (Snooki), but decided to go ahead and purchase it, I have a huge perfume collection. When my package arrived, I put some on and loved the way it smelled! It&#x27;s not too overwhelming or too sweet smelling. I&#x27;m very glad that I purchased this fragrance. I loved it so much, that the day I recieved it,I ordered her other perfume \\&quot;Snooki Couture\\&quot;! I can&#x27;t wait for it to come in!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly smells great. Cute bottle too. not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I smelled this in the store and was in love with it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price they were charging.  Found on Amazon for $14 cheaper.  It&#x27;s a large bottle and it smells so good.  It is sweet but not too sweet; it&#x27;s more of a fresh-sweet smell.  It is sort of light as for as lasting on your skin, but I was able to smell it all day.  I sprayed enough of it on my skin and clothes and couldn&#x27;t get enough of smelling myself!  I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Every time I was with my oldest Daughter, She smelled soooo GOOD.  I had to ask her what the fragrance was that she was wearing because I was loving it!  She told me it was called Snookie.  She showed me the bottle and I immediately went online to Amazon.  I ordered 2 bottles so I could give one to my youngest daughter and I would keep one for myself.  Every time I wear Snooki everyone wants to know what smells so good!  So MANY people love this that you can&#x27;t go wrong and will definitely NOT be disappointed!  Go ahead and try it.  You&#x27;ll love it too!</li>
            <li> I can not tell you the number of people who told me I smelt delicious when wearing this perfume. My mother got it for me as a x-mas gift and I was really not looking forward to opening the box. I didn&#x27;t want to hurt my Mom&#x27;s feelings so I opened the box but when I smelt it I fell in love with the scent. It&#x27;s really sexy, nothing overbearing, and a wonderful perfume to wear in any occasion. The scent is uplifting and just a blend of perfection. It&#x27;s delicate and very girly. Does not smell cheap or too powerful. It&#x27;s not too light and not too heavy. I am a true fan of this perfume now and all of my favorite brands (Juicy Couture, Beyonce Heat, Brittany Spears Fantasy) have now been replaced.</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume, because I read all the good reviews about it. I was so excited to get it, but it does not ship to where I live in Alaska. So, I ordered it on ebay. In a way it smells like that pink bottle of perfume by Britany Spears, but its way better. Its not too strong, and doesn&#x27;t give you a headache. I sprayed it on, only once, and it lasts all day. I would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! Only reason I&#x27;m giving this product a 4 star rating is because it doesnt seem to last very long. The scent wears off fairly quickly, so you end up using more than you probably should. It reminds me a lot of Pink Sugar perfume. Love both. They have a very fruity/candy like scent to them.</li>
