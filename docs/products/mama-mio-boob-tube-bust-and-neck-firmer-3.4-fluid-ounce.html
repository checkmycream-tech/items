    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel great!</li>
            <li>It might not increase your size as some have claimed, but there is a very great benefit from using it regardless.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t see breast lift results, it gives you the best results a lotion can give you, but Mama mio is magic in a bottle!</li>
            <li>Has a great smell to it and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>nasties\\&quot; in its ingredients, as the manufacturer says, and the fragrance is light &amp; wonderful!  </li>
            <li>And the scent some people are claiming to be sooo good makes me feel nautious.</li>
            <li>I loved the Tummy Butter from Mama Mio, so I bought this product.</li>
            <li>I did not see any firming, and the pump wasn&#x27;t any good.</li>
            <li>I loved the consistency and smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see great progress from this product, and I plan to continue to use it, post pregancy, too!  </li>
            <li>Satisfied!</li>
            <li>It worked amazingly though.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of undecided about Boob Tube.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping on a great product!</li>
            <li>IS NICE -</li>
            <li>EXCEPT, START BEING NICE TO YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li>Smells nice, though.</li>
            <li>this was a very good product, right now I&#x27;m just watching to see if it works because I&#x27;m using it to prevent stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>but this one I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I love that it has \\&quot;no</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a quality product, but as it turns out, I can&#x27;t use it without also turning my stomach.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second bottle, so I guess that is the best review.  </li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THE INGREDIENTS AND THE SCENT</li>
            <li>I need to buy more already.</li>
            <li>I found it here on Amazon for a better price.  </li>
            <li>anything it promotes more wrinkles on Men&#x27;s necks.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend told me about mama mio products that he used as a massage therapist on pregnant woman and said it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure i could have gotten better results :)</li>
            <li>This product works so quickly!</li>
            <li>My decolette looked great last summer, hoping to do it again!</li>
            <li>Perfect cream for sore, heavy pregnancy boobs.</li>
            <li>I have used this product religious x 2 weeks and the tone and elasticity of my skin greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>I loved the consistancy and soft feeling it gave my skin</li>
            <li>It makes my boobs shiny, helps with the nipple chafing and itchiness, smells great, but I won&#x27;t really know if it really prevents sagging until after I have the baby and my breasts stop growing.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use this for the full 30 days as I went on vacation about 20 todays into the regimen.  </li>
            <li>It works as really good moisturizer, but I still do not know if it actually prevents stretch marks.</li>
            <li>At least it smells delicious and citrusy!</li>
            <li>But the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>I started using this stuff when I got pregnant and now that I have stopped breastfeeding</li>
            <li>&quot; it was [mild] sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>This absorbed really quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>but it was well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have already noticed a very positive difference.  </li>
            <li>You can notice a difference right away</li>
            <li>For a company that makes products geared towards pregnant women, you would think they would know not to use such strong fragrances.</li>
            <li>Soon after purchasing my first tube the pump stopped working</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li>Skin seems more healthy, firm, and soft.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re pregnant, you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances and this one did not sit well with me.</li>
            <li>I bought this product along with the Mama mio stretch mark oil and had to stop using them both because they have such a strong, musky, overbearing scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll check back in with you guys, but thus far I like how shiny it makes my chest area! :)</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes and mouth definitely don&#x27;t look as pronounced.  </li>
            <li>but if you use it every day you will really feel like you should thank this company.</li>
            <li>By the end of the 20 days there was a very noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>This one does not help that much.</li>
            <li>but I really wanted to try one of the products, so</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Not a miracle, but very close.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to have seen some results that this product promised, but it&#x27;s actually nothing special.</li>
            <li>Also, no break-out from using this on my face, and I am pretty sensitive to stuff like this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure whose idea it was to make a strongly scented product for pregnant women.</li>
            <li>My order came from Fab Products, and I was psyched that they got it to me so quickly via regular shipping.</li>
            <li>I am 16 weeks pregnant and have been using this product for the last 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Just seems like a normal lotion.</li>
            <li>I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED A TRUE DIFFERENCE, BUT IM ALSO AWARE THAT THERE IS NO QUICK OVERNIGHT CURE FOR WRINKLES  -</li>
            <li>It smells really good, but it is more expensive than the Tummy butter and lasts less.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty big chest</li>
            <li>Prior to use, it was not so much the pregnancy that seemed to be robbing my neck/chest area of its \\&quot;youth,\\</li>
            <li>I notice a marked difference between the skin&#x27;s firmness, lift, and softness when I use this product versus when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only started using this recently and a couple of times but have noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized (which is necessary for our Chicago winters!).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I know that surgery is the only thing that will make them perky again, but this stuff worked to lift and tighten and tone, as long as you do the exercises as well as use the lotions.  </li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Maybe Mama Mio means Ladies.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly is not for Men.</li>
            <li> I just like their other products</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34;, but I definitely did notice a small difference in my neck.  </li>
            <li> Pregnancy was hard enough without having to break bottles to retrieve product.</li>
            <li> i felt firmness and swelling relief after using this product which i thought would be impossible already jumping three sizes at 12 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> I just wish it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I applied this product every day and at 7 months i started to show a few stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month--sometimes twice a day, but so far I have noticed absolutely no difference :(.  </li>
            <li> I heard there is no product that helps to reduce/avoid stretch marks, but at least helps to reduce itching, etc.</li>
            <li> I am sad</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; look to the skin was just depressing.  </li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t find the smell to be bad, either.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion at the beginning of my pregnancy and it was very annoying to use.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this stuff when I got pregnant and now that I have stopped breastfeeding I am still going to continue using it. It makes my skin look and feel great! I use it on my neck and face too. You can notice a difference right away but if you use it every day you will really feel like you should thank this company. I just like their other products but this one I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and have been using it for about two weeks, now.  I have already noticed a very positive difference.  Skin seems more healthy, firm, and soft.  Prior to use, it was not so much the pregnancy that seemed to be robbing my neck/chest area of its \\&quot;youth,\\&quot; it was [mild] sun exposure.  I&#x27;m excited to see great progress from this product, and I plan to continue to use it, post pregancy, too!  I love that it has \\&quot;no nasties\\&quot; in its ingredients, as the manufacturer says, and the fragrance is light &amp; wonderful!  My order came from Fab Products, and I was psyched that they got it to me so quickly via regular shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this product along with the Mama mio stretch mark oil and had to stop using them both because they have such a strong, musky, overbearing scent. I loved the consistancy and soft feeling it gave my skin but i just could not stand the stong smell. It made me nausious even in my second trimester. For a company that makes products geared towards pregnant women, you would think they would know not to use such strong fragrances.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this for the full 30 days as I went on vacation about 20 todays into the regimen.  It worked amazingly though.  By the end of the 20 days there was a very noticeable difference.  I have a pretty big chest and I know that surgery is the only thing that will make them perky again, but this stuff worked to lift and tighten and tone, as long as you do the exercises as well as use the lotions.  And I didn&#x27;t find the smell to be bad, either.  Starting a diet and exercise program soon and hoping to use this again.  My decolette looked great last summer, hoping to do it again!</li>
            <li> It works as really good moisturizer, but I still do not know if it actually prevents stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of undecided about Boob Tube.  It makes my boobs shiny, helps with the nipple chafing and itchiness, smells great, but I won&#x27;t really know if it really prevents sagging until after I have the baby and my breasts stop growing.  I&#x27;ll check back in with you guys, but thus far I like how shiny it makes my chest area! :)</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have seen some results that this product promised, but it&#x27;s actually nothing special. Just seems like a normal lotion. And the scent some people are claiming to be sooo good makes me feel nautious.</li>
            <li> I loved the Tummy Butter from Mama Mio, so I bought this product. It smells really good, but it is more expensive than the Tummy butter and lasts less. I applied this product every day and at 7 months i started to show a few stretch marks. I heard there is no product that helps to reduce/avoid stretch marks, but at least helps to reduce itching, etc. This one does not help that much. My boobs are itching all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whose idea it was to make a strongly scented product for pregnant women. I&#x27;m sure this is a quality product, but as it turns out, I can&#x27;t use it without also turning my stomach. It sits forlornly on my bathroom vanity, open but unused. Every time I put it on, I retch, and immediately have to wash it off. This defeats the purpose of the product!    I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. If I could, I&#x27;d take it back.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion at the beginning of my pregnancy and it was very annoying to use. I did not see any firming, and the pump wasn&#x27;t any good. Soon after purchasing my first tube the pump stopped working and I had to break the bottle just to get the product out. Pregnancy was hard enough without having to break bottles to retrieve product. This was not for me!</li>
            <li> I just got it last week and started to see the difference ...If I wasn&#x27;t so sun tanned I am pretty sure i could have gotten better results :)</li>
            <li> This absorbed really quickly into my skin. I use it from my neck to my cleavage and the difference is almost immediately noticeable.</li>
            <li> This product works so quickly! I will reorder and reorder. Fast shipping on a great product! Thank you , Mama Mio! I was considering surgery, but this has delayed my decision for the time being...</li>
            <li> I am 16 weeks pregnant and have been using this product for the last 3 weeks. It leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized (which is necessary for our Chicago winters!). We&#x27;ll see how this works for the duration of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend told me about mama mio products that he used as a massage therapist on pregnant woman and said it was amazing. We are planning for a child next year but I really wanted to try one of the products, so I go boob tube. I really couldn&#x27;t believe it! I&#x27;d only been using it for two weeks and my breasts and neck are firmer and softer! You won&#x27;t see breast lift results, it gives you the best results a lotion can give you, but Mama mio is magic in a bottle! I definitely will be using these products during pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I actually felt like this made a difference. When I didn&#x27;t use it, I could notice the wrinkles the next morning. I just wish it was a little cheaper so I could keep using it</li>
            <li> I loved the consistency and smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Perfect cream for sore, heavy pregnancy boobs. I used it throughout my pregnancy and still use it while breastfeeding. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;miraculous&amp;#34;, but I definitely did notice a small difference in my neck.  My skin does seem to be &amp;#34;firmer&amp;#34; when I use it.  Also, I use it on my face in the morning and I noticed a bigger difference there.  The fine lines around my eyes and mouth definitely don&#x27;t look as pronounced.  Also, no break-out from using this on my face, and I am pretty sensitive to stuff like this.  I ordered a second bottle, so I guess that is the best review.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THE INGREDIENTS AND THE SCENT IS NICE - I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED A TRUE DIFFERENCE, BUT IM ALSO AWARE THAT THERE IS NO QUICK OVERNIGHT CURE FOR WRINKLES  - EXCEPT, START BEING NICE TO YOUR SKIN WHEN YOUR YOUNG AND DONT SLEEP ON YOUR SIDE, SLEEP ON YOUR BACK, YOU WILL HAVE LESS WRINKLES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this recently and a couple of times but have noticed a difference right away. I never buy any products like this for over $10 but it was well worth the price. Has a great smell to it and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky. Can&#x27;t wait to continue using it after breastfeeding!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month--sometimes twice a day, but so far I have noticed absolutely no difference :(.  I am sad I purchased this.  At least it smells delicious and citrusy!</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this product and the price was affordable.  She feels that it works. This is the second bottle she has used.</li>
            <li> I could see no noticeable results or difference. Smells nice, though. For the price I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Not a miracle, but very close. I notice a marked difference between the skin&#x27;s firmness, lift, and softness when I use this product versus when I don&#x27;t. It might not increase your size as some have claimed, but there is a very great benefit from using it regardless. Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I need to buy more already. i felt firmness and swelling relief after using this product which i thought would be impossible already jumping three sizes at 12 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> this was a very good product, right now I&#x27;m just watching to see if it works because I&#x27;m using it to prevent stretch marks.  But the smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> I could not stomach this product, literally. It smells horrible. When you&#x27;re pregnant, you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrances and this one did not sit well with me. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I came across this at a baby themed store.  I found it here on Amazon for a better price.  After my pregnancy and breastfeeding for 1 year...well my breast just were not the same.  The &amp;#34;crepe paper&amp;#34; look to the skin was just depressing.  I&#x27;m not the &amp;#34;go under the knife&amp;#34; type of gal.  I have used this product religious x 2 weeks and the tone and elasticity of my skin greatly improved.  No my crepe paper!  I&#x27;m so impress with this product that I just purchased another Mama Mio&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> This is a total waste of money.  Dr. Oz said \\&quot;run out an purchase this Tube for wrinkles on your neck\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;If anything it promotes more wrinkles on Men&#x27;s necks.  Maybe Mama Mio means Ladies.&lt;br /&gt;It certainly is not for Men.</li>
