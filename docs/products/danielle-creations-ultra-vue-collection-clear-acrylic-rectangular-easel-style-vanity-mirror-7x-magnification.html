            <li>Looks great, very compact.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT .</li>
            <li>The design is stylish and it&#x27;s well constructed.</li>
            <li>With the ability to adjust the tilt and the larger size over a compact has worked perfect.  </li>
            <li>, this one just helps me see even more.</li>
            <li>it should have cost more than it did.</li>
            <li>I used my cellphone flashlight as a light underneath to see better...</li>

            <li>EASY CLEAN .</li>
            <li>overall looks great but can&#x27;t adjust the angle.</li>
            <li>The acrylic makes it look light</li>
            <li>You can see things you may not even want to see, that is how powerful it is!</li>
            <li>and I am pretty ok with the distortion on the magnifying side.</li>
            <li>This mirror is distortion free and a nice size for a table-top makeup mirror, but it has a big drawback.  </li>
            <li>The magnification was also better than the mirror I replaced as I am getting older and obviously need it to see better :-)</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and it is still as nice as when I purchased it</li>
            <li>I needed to replace my old round mirror and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>worth the money .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The size is just right.</li>
            <li>I use my mirrors for a slightly different reason most people do.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Very classy and just the right size for the bathroom counter or to tuck in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>I use them to check my drawings (handy little trick to see if you&#x27;ve messed up).</li>
            <li>She loves the fact that it is portable and she can see her whole had</li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>She said the magnified mirror makes it much easier to complete a woman&#x27;s facial maintenance.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 3 year old to use to comb her hair and practice blowing her nose.  </li>
            <li>its for a 12 yr old girl</li>
            <li>It was small enough to fit where I need to use and store it, yet big enough to see what I needed.</li>
            <li>Its okay, its a little small</li>

            <li> Its okay, its a little small</li>
            <li> Not worth the money the mirror is very small and made of a cheap plastic frame</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was a little smaller than I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I had to point that out as the other review is based on not understanding that magnified mirrors distort.</li>
            <li> I simply wrapped it in a small amount of bubble wrap and tucked it into my luggage.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is very well made, unfortunately, there is a distortion in the magnified image of 7x.</li>
            <li> not worth</li>
            <li> Heavier than anticipated and a little heavy to hold while make-up is being applied.</li>
            <li> I wasted 19.99</li>
            <li> waste of money and they will not retur it or give me a refund!</li>
            <li> I do small jewelry shows on the weekends  at fleamarkets.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I do wear glasses for close vision since I&#x27;m past 50, so I guess I need at 10X for brow plucking, etc.</li>
            <li> However, after a week of use it became almost impossible to fix the mirror in a desired position – it keeps rotating because the acrylic joints are not good enough.</li>
            <li> But the attachment is weak on the frame, and keeping it at the angle</li>
            <li> Its very hard to see with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why, but it is impossible to keep the non-magnifying side at an angle to be viewed while sitting unless it is propped from behind.  </li>
            <li> I want it is difficult.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t stay in place and now its useless..</li>
            <li> but then again my eyesight is crap.</li>

            <li> The mirror is very well made, unfortunately, there is a distortion in the magnified image of 7x. Flipside is fine.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my desk at work</li>
            <li> My Mother loves it.  She loves the fact that it is portable and she can see her whole had while rolling or during her hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 3 year old to use to comb her hair and practice blowing her nose.  Perfect size.</li>
            <li> Great magnification and overall size on this mirror. You can see things you may not even want to see, that is how powerful it is!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Good buy. Perfect for my desk at work.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money the mirror is very small and made of a cheap plastic frame not worth the money should be sold at the dollar store</li>
            <li> I thought this was a light- up makeup mirror, but it is not. Its very hard to see with. waste of money and they will not retur it or give me a refund!</li>
            <li> I bought  this for a friend, who has eye problems. It helps him to be feel independent, when shaving. The price was good and I was able to search the web, since I don&#x27;t drive.</li>
            <li> Very high quality at a great price!</li>
            <li> Looks great, very compact. works well on a desk. Great space saver and works well for a dorm room. Very durable.</li>
            <li> This mirror is really nice!  The magnified side is perfect and doesn&#x27;t distort.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it was a little smaller than I had hoped.  Wish they had this same mirror but maybe twice the size!  Other than that....it&#x27;s PERFECT!</li>
            <li> My item has a defect : it would not stand up, instead, it falls and lies horizontally. The plastic stand is too light and  it was not tighten properly to the mirror.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT . PERFECT SIZE FOR MY TABLE . GOOD CLARITY ON BOTH SIDES . EASY CLEAN . STANDS UP WELL BY IT&#x27;S SELF .  GOOD GIFT FOR A TRAVELER .</li>
            <li> This one is perfect exactly what I needed. I do small jewelry shows on the weekends  at fleamarkets.  This is easy to pack up and take with me and easy to pack up and take home</li>
            <li> This mirror is distortion free and a nice size for a table-top makeup mirror, but it has a big drawback.  I&#x27;m not sure why, but it is impossible to keep the non-magnifying side at an angle to be viewed while sitting unless it is propped from behind.  Otherwise, it keeps rotating back to the magnifying side.  In addition, the magnification is not sufficient for me.  Yes, I do wear glasses for close vision since I&#x27;m past 50, so I guess I need at 10X for brow plucking, etc.</li>
            <li> Nice mirror! Very classy and just the right size for the bathroom counter or to tuck in your suitcase. Glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> I use my mirrors for a slightly different reason most people do. I use them to check my drawings (handy little trick to see if you&#x27;ve messed up). It&#x27;s a nice size, a good weight, and has a true reflection (something very important for my work). Yes, of course the magnified side is distorted, as that&#x27;s how they work. I had to point that out as the other review is based on not understanding that magnified mirrors distort.</li>
            <li> Nice and durable.  I have been using this for several years and it is still as nice as when I purchased it</li>
            <li> These days I need a mirror with magnification so I can see well enough to put on my make up.  I have a mirror attached to my wall for the house, but this one is great for traveling or for keeping on my desk at work.  The design is stylish and it&#x27;s well constructed.</li>
            <li> Its okay, its a little small but it does its job. I used my cellphone flashlight as a light underneath to see better...but then again my eyesight is crap.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  The 7x is the perfect multiplier for me.  I bought this to travel with and it works great.  With the ability to adjust the tilt and the larger size over a compact has worked perfect.  I simply wrapped it in a small amount of bubble wrap and tucked it into my luggage.  Thinking I may pickup another one to keep on hand for the future.  This was truly a great buy for me.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and great clarity.</li>
            <li> I like the design and I am pretty ok with the distortion on the magnifying side. However, after a week of use it became almost impossible to fix the mirror in a desired position – it keeps rotating because the acrylic joints are not good enough.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. She said the magnified mirror makes it much easier to complete a woman&#x27;s facial maintenance. The size is just right.</li>
            <li> Magnification on curved side distorted image some. Heavier than anticipated and a little heavy to hold while make-up is being applied.</li>
            <li> was way smaller then i thought it would be but over all good mirror its for a 12 yr old girl so it will do lol...</li>
            <li> Smaller size than it looks in picture!</li>
            <li> Great quality for the price and size!</li>
            <li> works well, shipped fast and protected very good.</li>
            <li> I wanted a bigger mirror, and it does the job. But the attachment is weak on the frame, and keeping it at the angle I want it is difficult.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my old round mirror and this was perfect. It was small enough to fit where I need to use and store it, yet big enough to see what I needed. The magnification was also better than the mirror I replaced as I am getting older and obviously need it to see better :-)</li>
            <li> It has a curve...can&#x27;t even c ur self right!! Only n the middle!!!!!</li>
            <li> overall looks great but can&#x27;t adjust the angle. It can&#x27;t hold it by itself. Guess it&#x27;s too loosened.</li>
            <li> Purchase this mirror ...&lt;br /&gt;It broke in one day.. it didn&#x27;t stay in place and now its useless..&lt;br /&gt;so bummed.. didn&#x27;t bother returning it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;not worth the money .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sad I wasted 19.99</li>
            <li> Perfectly sized, well balanced, and fairly priced. Just what I was looking for, and couldn&#x27;t be found elsewhere on the web.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you need an extra mirror that tilts just so.  I already have a lighted oval mirror on my vanity, this one just helps me see even more. The acrylic makes it look light it should have cost more than it did.</li>
