            <li>This company I purchased from provided it at a great price and delivered on time !&lt;br /&gt;Greggde</li>
            <li>However, it is the perfect scent and gift for him.</li>
            <li>THOSE ARE OUR TWO BEST MEN&#x27;S SCENTS.</li>

            <li>Awesome value!  </li>
            <li>The very best price I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>Great value on this purchase as well.</li>
            <li>Delivered on time, in  great shape, all that I knew it would be.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Quality product, shipped on time, and smells great.</li>
            <li>not the really great fragrance that I remember it was.</li>
            <li>One of my husband&#x27;s throw backs, at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>No problem with my order -- great experience.</li>
            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>Great.</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance</li>
            <li>This scent is very nice but not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Good purchase and good experience all around.</li>
            <li>Smell just as good as I remember.  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and appeared to be in good shape but the bottle cap will not move.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>always loved the smell</li>
            <li>Not so good.</li>
            <li>Good value arrived promptly.</li>
            <li>We both like a good musk cologne, and while this was a good product, and had excellent quality, it was not the right type of musk.</li>
            <li>She says it is very sexy on me and doesn&#x27;t let me go out without it.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;new scent&amp;#34; and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Christmas is coming time to order more!</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and received many compliments from the ladies.</li>
            <li>Still, he thought it was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>This being said the musk can stand on its own and by itself is a must buy</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell like what we are used to, very strong</li>
            <li>Old is sometimes best.</li>
            <li>This old time scent is definately a good price and a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>Its a good product but nothing special.</li>
            <li>royal Copenhagen is and continues to be one of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Amazon, can you please do a better job?</li>
            <li>This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne...must purchase the Musk - it&#x27;s my favorite too.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased this scent for my husband for many years.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I would give it 5 stars since the MUSK version is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>The scent is refreshing</li>
            <li>When I run out I will be reordering some more.</li>
            <li>ALSO LOVE VERSACE DREAMER</li>
            <li>I also love the royal Copenhagen colonge.</li>
            <li>I love and she loves it, that&#x27;s all that matters.  </li>
            <li>My dad&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>What more do you want in an aftershave?</li>
            <li>love the way he hints...</li>
            <li>we kind of have to both enjoy the smell :-)  </li>
            <li>Enjoy that musk scent!</li>
            <li>Love this product, have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Love this cologne as do many others..have been wearing for years.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed the Royal Copenhagen scent.</li>
            <li>all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>Also, good to get it, a glass bottle, not broken, cracked, or damaged screw top.  </li>
            <li>I will say to those reading this, that the scent of this cologne is bright, clean, fresh, manly and just a bit sweet.  </li>
            <li>I will use this cologne but am after a true musk scent and probably will not buy any more online.</li>
            <li>and it was fine</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Great smell, veyr soothing, and at a low cost.</li>
            <li>Finally found it and at a great price.</li>
            <li>It carries a bit too much of linen type overtones in the cologne that squash the musk smell, which for us kind of defeated the purpose.</li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of an older gentlemen though.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sexy yet classy scent on any man.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put it on I got so many compliments that it convinced me this was the cologne for me.</li>
            <li>I already have a bottle of the Royal Copenhagen Cologne and am familiar with the RC Musk scent from years ago.</li>
            <li>but the true reason for updating this review is amazon.</li>
            <li>smell fresh and clean</li>
            <li>Fresh clean aroma.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and undamaged.  </li>
            <li>Lasts long throughout the day; not too powerful, just a very pleasant masculine scent.</li>
            <li>When it is not a gift and he asks for it, he is always pleased that it arrives at his door, the price is very reasonable, and it is the real product.</li>
            <li>I have used the mist bottle previous and this is a great value for 8 oz.</li>
            <li>The price is more than reasonable and i have never had a problem with Amazon that they haven&#x27;t fixed very quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the soft fragrance when my husband puts this on.</li>
            <li>i got this for my sweetie for Xmas last year, and he liked it a lot...</li>
            <li>also i like the fresh smell of it on him...</li>
            <li>AN old favorite.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find such a great deal on their Musk offered here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Nice to have you back!</li>
            <li>The same great fragrance as my original bottle going back to the sixties.</li>
            <li>Not bad but certainly</li>
            <li>As described larger than the standard 4 oz bottles for a great price.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why they chose to mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li>very fast deleivery.</li>
            <li>it has provided more compliments by the opposite gender than any Cologne that I have worn .</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I first purchased a bottle of the cologne inBuffalo Newyork from a mens clothing store.</li>
            <li>WHEN I FIRST MET MY HUSBAND 33 YEARS AGO, HE WAS WEARING THIS SCENT.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this musk for many years and it is the only one that women have ever commented about.</li>
            <li>First time I bought it in line</li>
            <li>Great stuff and bottle larger than expected.</li>
            <li>This input (comment) box seems to require a certain amount of words before it allows you to save your settings and submit your comments.</li>
            <li>the price is pretty decent for the size..</li>
            <li>It seems a little strong when first put on but dissapates quickly.</li>
            <li>Apparently, when it was manufactured in Denmark, something special was added.  </li>
            <li>Its a hassle to have errors on your part that the customer has to return with absolutely nothing in return for the hassle.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast service</li>
            <li>so much that he hinted to the dog for her to get him this for Xmas this year...</li>
            <li>I like this cologne so much</li>
            <li>And a real value.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This American version is a bit weaker than the original which I think was oil based perfume.</li>
            <li>The package had quite a strong odor due this leakage, in fact, my whole home smells of this cologne.</li>
            <li>This seems to be water based and therefore not as long lasting or as rich, however, the scent is still basically the same and quite pleasing to most who notice it.  </li>
            <li>So for us, it was a smell preference, there was nothing wrong with the quality of the product, which as I said was excellent, it wears very well, and for a long time.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised to find that the cologne was &#x27;the real deal.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>It smells nice on him, but he admits that it&#x27;s not quite the same, and a little bit one dimensional as far as the scent is concerned.</li>
            <li>My wife ordered this for me, wrapped them for a gift and put it under the tree, when I opened them they were half full very dissapointing</li>
            <li>The fragrance changed several years back when the starting manufacturing it in the states and it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never sure if these are authentic products or not beyond &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; date...</li>
            <li>This product really outweighted my expectation, - BIG bottle,</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, LASTING Smell, 5 Stars recommended, ordering another bottle soooooooooooon.</li>
            <li>It smells masculine.  </li>
            <li>A very clean smelling scent that is so hard to find in any of the department stores in Kentucky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like the item, I did not like that the item leaked inside the packaging, leaked to where the bottle was just about half full.</li>
            <li>It is clean, fresh, serious, but sporty at the same time.</li>
            <li>there are two different products being sent to different people or those positive feedbacks are</li>
            <li>I prefer the natural smell of essential oils, but if you don&#x27;t mind the cologne (ie not all natural)</li>
            <li>no other way ...</li>
            <li>WE STILL BUY IT TO BRING BACK OLD MEMORIES.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge size, and my only complaint is that they send me begging letters like all the time.</li>
            <li>but not nearly as good as the original fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Also , the scent is not long lasting.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> royal Copenhagen is and continues to be one of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance&#x27;s , I realize that fragrance&#x27;s are Avery personal end ever but day in and out it has provided more compliments by the opposite gender than any Cologne that I have worn . This company I purchased from provided it at a great price and delivered on time !&lt;br /&gt;Greggde</li>
            <li> I purchase this for my Dad. We appreciate the chance to find it at Amazon because it is long since gone from the stores and no longer in the mainstream. However, it is the perfect scent and gift for him. When it is not a gift and he asks for it, he is always pleased that it arrives at his door, the price is very reasonable, and it is the real product. Good purchase and good experience all around.</li>
            <li> smell fresh and clean</li>
            <li> Smell just as good as I remember.  In this era of big names, pricey cologne this one stands out. Old is sometimes best. Thats the case here.     2009 Update  order this product again and it was fine but the true reason for updating this review is amazon. They have taken a decidedly turn for the worse. I order a lot from them and it seems now all shipments come either wrong and with the boxes banged around as if it was dropped from a 10th floor window. Amazon, can you please do a better job? Its a hassle to have errors on your part that the customer has to return with absolutely nothing in return for the hassle. Then the condition leaves a lot to be desired. I may finally have to stop buying on amazon and for that i do feel sad.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne...must purchase the Musk - it&#x27;s my favorite too.  Lasts long throughout the day; not too powerful, just a very pleasant masculine scent.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this scent for my husband for many years.  With this particular purchase we are not able to open the bottle!  It arrived on time and appeared to be in good shape but the bottle cap will not move.  It appears to be welded onto the bottle!  We even tried to open it using a wrench and it will not budge.  Any suggestions??  Otherwise I would give it 5 stars since the MUSK version is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The fragrance changed several years back when the starting manufacturing it in the states and it&#x27;s okay but not nearly as good as the original fragrance.  No comparison.  Don&#x27;t know why they chose to mess with a good thing.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell like what we are used to, very strong</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance but doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a very sexy yet classy scent on any man.  Great value on this purchase as well. Christmas is coming time to order more!</li>
            <li> This product really outweighted my expectation, - BIG bottle, Reasonably priced, LASTING Smell, 5 Stars recommended, ordering another bottle soooooooooooon.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean aroma. It&#x27;s the only cologne I use</li>
            <li> I have been a user of this product since the 1980s. I first purchased a bottle of the cologne inBuffalo Newyork from a mens clothing store. I loved the scent and received many compliments from the ladies. At that time , the product was manufactured in Denmark.  The last orders that I received were not marked \\&quot;Denmark\\&quot;, so I assumed they were manufactured in the USA.    Unfortunately, the product has changed radically in that it lacks that special scent it had previously. Also , the scent is not long lasting. Apparently, when it was manufactured in Denmark, something special was added.  Sorry I could not be more favorable.  Carl</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, in  great shape, all that I knew it would be. When I run out I&#x27;ll order it again and in the same way!</li>
            <li> As described larger than the standard 4 oz bottles for a great price.</li>
            <li> I love the soft fragrance when my husband puts this on. Older scent and hard to find. Still love it.</li>
            <li> I have used the mist bottle previous and this is a great value for 8 oz. The scent is refreshing and I use it for as after shave splash as well. The distributor shipped this product as expected and received on time.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised to find that the cologne was &#x27;the real deal.&#x27;  It was delivered quickly and undamaged.  When I run out I will be reordering some more.</li>
            <li> Its a good product but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It smells masculine.  Kind of reminds me of an older gentlemen though.  I prefer the natural smell of essential oils, but if you don&#x27;t mind the cologne (ie not all natural) smell you will like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since around 1974.  The first time I put it on I got so many compliments that it convinced me this was the cologne for me.</li>
            <li> WHEN I FIRST MET MY HUSBAND 33 YEARS AGO, HE WAS WEARING THIS SCENT.  WE STILL BUY IT TO BRING BACK OLD MEMORIES.  ALSO LOVE VERSACE DREAMER SO THOSE ARE OUR TWO BEST MEN&#x27;S SCENTS.</li>
            <li> I have tried to find a scent for my husband that did not offend my senses. I remembered that my brother wore Royal Copenhagen Musk years ago. Sorry to say it is not the same cologne. At this point, I wouldn&#x27;t care if he wore nothing.</li>
            <li> Good product. Will use as gifts  Accidently ordered wrong item but will retain for gifts to friends.  Thanks for fast service</li>
            <li> A very clean smelling scent that is so hard to find in any of the department stores in Kentucky. I also love the royal Copenhagen colonge.</li>
            <li> I love and she loves it, that&#x27;s all that matters.  She says it is very sexy on me and doesn&#x27;t let me go out without it.</li>
            <li> My dad&#x27;s favorite. Buy for Father&#x27;s Day every year. Great price</li>
            <li> not what it use to be.</li>
            <li> Great smell, veyr soothing, and at a low cost. What more do you want in an aftershave? Well, you have it with Royal Copenhagen.</li>
            <li> my husband is very happy with it</li>
            <li> i got this for my sweetie for Xmas last year, and he liked it a lot... so much that he hinted to the dog for her to get him this for Xmas this year... love the way he hints... well anyway the dog told me so i&#x27;m getting it for him... also i like the fresh smell of it on him... this has been around a while and that says something don&#x27;t you think... anyway that&#x27;s my review &amp; the price is pretty decent for the size..</li>
            <li> always loved the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I don&#x27;t like the item, I did not like that the item leaked inside the packaging, leaked to where the bottle was just about half full. The package had quite a strong odor due this leakage, in fact, my whole home smells of this cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never sure if these are authentic products or not beyond &amp;#34;freshness&amp;#34; date... It smells watered down but... Maybe it&#x27;s just me 😉</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this for a while. Finally found it and at a great price. Great stuff and bottle larger than expected.</li>
            <li> Quality product, shipped on time, and smells great. This input (comment) box seems to require a certain amount of words before it allows you to save your settings and submit your comments. Not so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy to select a cologne on-line, simply because you can&#x27;t smell it by looking at your computer screen.  I will say to those reading this, that the scent of this cologne is bright, clean, fresh, manly and just a bit sweet.  As a matter of fact, it&#x27;s my &amp;#34;new scent&amp;#34; and I am very satisfied.  I like this cologne so much, I decided to also order the Royal Copenhagen musk as well and will review that product when it arrives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation is to at least try it.  I&#x27;m not a big cologne wearer, but I am now, at least with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The scent seems to have changed from the last time that I used this product.  Not bad but certainly not the really great fragrance that I remember it was.</li>
            <li> This product was a gift for my husband, and while it was a gift for my husband lets face it we kind of have to both enjoy the smell :-)  We both like a good musk cologne, and while this was a good product, and had excellent quality, it was not the right type of musk. It carries a bit too much of linen type overtones in the cologne that squash the musk smell, which for us kind of defeated the purpose. So for us, it was a smell preference, there was nothing wrong with the quality of the product, which as I said was excellent, it wears very well, and for a long time.</li>
            <li> AN old favorite. I always keep this in the house.</li>
            <li> Well I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This was a knock-off. I have used the \\&quot;real\\&quot; musk from Denmark for over 30 years, but this product was colored water.</li>
            <li> I have been using this musk for many years and it is the only one that women have ever commented about. It seems a little strong when first put on but dissapates quickly. The price is more than reasonable and i have never had a problem with Amazon that they haven&#x27;t fixed very quickly. Recommended!</li>
            <li> The same great fragrance as my original bottle going back to the sixties. And a real value.</li>
            <li> Good value arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 20 yrs.  First time I bought it in line</li>
            <li> I did not  want the &amp;#34;Musk scent&amp;#34; I wanted regular scent. I did not realize I ordered musk. When the  order arrived one  on of the bottles had leaked half it&#x27;s contents.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who wore it when he was college. It smells nice on him, but he admits that it&#x27;s not quite the same, and a little bit one dimensional as far as the scent is concerned. Still, he thought it was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> One of my husband&#x27;s throw backs, at a great price.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Awesome value!  Enjoy that musk scent! Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> An oldie but a goodie.  This old time scent is definately a good price and a great purchase.  The size alone will allow you to wear this all year long.  I must recommend that if you buy the musk to also buy the cologne.  When used in conjunction with each other it enhances the other.  This being said the musk can stand on its own and by itself is a must buy</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, but it&#x27;s way too expensive in stores, if you can find it!  Also, good to get it, a glass bottle, not broken, cracked, or damaged screw top.  It&#x27;s a huge size, and my only complaint is that they send me begging letters like all the time.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this for me, wrapped them for a gift and put it under the tree, when I opened them they were half full very dissapointing</li>
            <li> My father has used this brand since I can remember. I am 36 and have had this smell around all my life. I have been using it for at least 15 years now myself.  It is clean, fresh, serious, but sporty at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love this product, have been using it for years. The very best price I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne as do many others..have been wearing for years. Can&#x27;t beat the prices and with Prime...no other way ...Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a staple for me --- I always keep it on hand.  I may change other fragrances from time-to-time, but I use RCM on an almost daily basis.  No problem with my order -- great experience.</li>
            <li> Great price and it arrived overnight.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed the Royal Copenhagen scent. I was surprised to find such a great deal on their Musk offered here on amazon. I already have a bottle of the Royal Copenhagen Cologne and am familiar with the RC Musk scent from years ago. Things may have changed over time but this Musk is not very different from the RC cologne. This scent is very nice but not what I was expecting. Perhaps they no longer make the same Musk scent offered years ago. I will use this cologne but am after a true musk scent and probably will not buy any more online. Samples from the brick and mortar dept stores so I know what I am getting.</li>
            <li> did i just buy some smelly water?either there are two different products being sent to different people or those positive feedbacks are fake.i saw the bad reviews but i chose to ignore them now i regret for paying this crap smelling like old people in hospice</li>
            <li> Dad used to wear thisn ,brings back memories. Great. very fast deleivery.</li>
            <li> Ah yes, Daddy smell. That is what my wife said as soon as I put it on.  -My all time favorite.  I have been saving the last of my cologne because I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Now I can use it at will.  This American version is a bit weaker than the original which I think was oil based perfume. This seems to be water based and therefore not as long lasting or as rich, however, the scent is still basically the same and quite pleasing to most who notice it.  Nice to have you back!</li>
