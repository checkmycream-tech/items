            <li>I love the huge selection and great quality.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color output on all of the colors, they all seem to have a sort of simmer to them and they wear off easily</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly and in great shape.  </li>
            <li>Super happy.</li>
            <li>Great product, color are bold and plentiful.</li>
            <li>Good quality , smear easily , recommended that you use a primer and</li>
            <li>Very bold bright colors</li>
            <li>I love them so much :D</li>
            <li>The quality of the eyeliners were good, they were creamy and went on easy.</li>
            <li>Pigmented and go on very easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to apply and make designs on the face.</li>
            <li>Glides on very easily.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see the color very strong around the eye....</li>
            <li>could not be more in love with these!</li>
            <li>I used them on my water line and they were pretty good!</li>
            <li>I am so proud of my new liner collection I have shown it off to four separate people and now they ALL want a set of their own!</li>
            <li>Bold colors and the colors are true and show up perfectly.</li>
            <li>They apply very smoothly and the range is amazing for a variety of choices.</li>
            <li>These liners are awesome super smooth to apply and very colorful!</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and vibrant, perfect for those days you are not feeling up to putting on full makeup.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best eyeliner sets I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I feel she will really enjoy them &amp; get good use out of them.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it went on, (smoothly).</li>
            <li>I wanted pencils that are soft and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li>These are, by far, the BEST eyeliners.  </li>
            <li>Very much worth the price, would recommend--these would also make a great gift for the makeup daredevil or makeup junkie in your life.</li>
            <li>These eye liners are by far the best quality.lasts</li>
            <li>I have to say I am impressed with the product this far.</li>
            <li>Even so, after more use, I noticed that the colours also fade sooner than liked, and you may have to apply it 2 or 3 times a day if you intend to have it all day.</li>
            <li>They also work fabulous for face painting (I do a lot of bright DAVID BOWIE things to my face).</li>
            <li>I would have liked them better if the pencils were fatter and smoother to use in</li>
            <li>They are brightly colored and glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>though this product need sharpening when you use it for a certain amount of time, it looks good!</li>
            <li>A good assortment of colors for the price, but they do wear off kind of quick, so bring it with you to freshen up.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this purchase, easy buy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna buy more for sure! :)</li>

            <li>I got a wonderful set of colors, all of them are amazing, can also be used as an eyeshadow since it is spreadable, but also stable enough to stay on as liner.</li>
            <li>and i love them a lot they are very easy to apply</li>
            <li>the item is adentical to the photo shown.however,some color does not have a great color payoff  when used or it fades away very fast</li>
            <li>I am in love with these, super smooth, great variety in colour, amazing pigmentation.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m really happy with this, some of the colors I don&#x27;t really like but the most of them are amazing</li>

            <li>For the price, these eyeliners are pretty great.</li>
            <li>at first I thought with the price of these eyeliners, the quality probably isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>It would be great if the blues and purples showed up because they are pretty.</li>
            <li>I went through a full work day not checking and when my boyfriend picked me up, he laughed his head off.</li>
            <li>(of course, I&#x27;m right-handed), but I&#x27;m able to use these liners easily with my non-dominant hand!</li>
            <li>and I have to say: luckily I did!!</li>
            <li>Very smooth</li>

            <li>and I did a quick line on my arms of all the colors and am amazed at how bright they are.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and package was also good, but one markdown is that one eyeliner had a crack.</li>
            <li>None of the colors I had found were what I wanted, and I&#x27;m super picky color wise.</li>
            <li>Nice colors, stay on easy application.</li>
            <li>They are creamy, which is generally nice, but they do smudge easily.</li>

            <li>(I lined and filled with these liners, eyeliner is perfectly safe for lips!)</li>
            <li>I love these pencils, the colors are bright and bold.</li>

            <li>Primer potion and setting powder should be able to fix that, but they don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t have oily eyelids, either.</li>
            <li>The thing that gets me the most though--</li>
            <li>Drugstore brands are creamier, scentless, and stay on better.</li>

            <li>AND DECLARES UNDYING LOVE OF ME AND THE PENCILS</li>

            <li>They came quickly and I love them.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised how good these pencils were.</li>
            <li>these are great colors and are going to look amazing under my sparkely glitter eyeliners, these colors are really going to pop under the barely tinted glittery liquid liner.</li>
            <li>However, the colors are not as vivid and bright</li>
            <li>They do not glide on as easily but the color payoff and the lasting power is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are also easy to apply and the color comes out clean and easy.</li>
            <li>Super smooth, many colors, wear all day - 10hrs +</li>
            <li>I loved how bold the colors are, and really for the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li>i will admit that i was sceptical at first because i never heard of the brand, but the quality is amazing, and the colors are so rich.</li>
            <li>I did not expect much because they were so cheap in price, but they came in and I love them!</li>
            <li>These eyeliners are amazing and the colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li>These are very pretty!  </li>
            <li>has very pretty colors!</li>
            <li>It took a little over a week for it to be delivered and they were packaged perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant (the white is perfect for brightening) and you can smudge them to use as eyeshadow instead of eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Great color choices and pretty decent pigmentation and application.</li>
            <li>The set was reasonably priced, the colors are vibrant and beautiful .</li>
            <li>Nice, vibrant colors!  </li>
            <li>vey soft and amazing colors :)</li>
            <li>Love all the different, bright colors.</li>
            <li>Except for the light purple and the light brown they were too light.</li>
            <li>it went on smooth and even...</li>
            <li>It was a cheap way to use colors I hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>The colors are creamy and glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smooth application.</li>
            <li>Applies on smoothly.</li>
            <li>They are great colors but they are too runny and they are being left at room temp.</li>
            <li>they are so smooth to put on and they irritate at all</li>
            <li>they glide on your eyelid smoothly and have a creamy quality.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Glide on smoothly, lasting power, great color...</li>
            <li>These liners are fantastic for the price.  </li>
            <li>The price is also cheap.</li>
            <li>These are great eyeliners, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>So cheap</li>
            <li>I am allergic to cheap product</li>
            <li>Not all pencils did but some yes... light itching.</li>
            <li>Overall.. Great buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great purchase overall!!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented and looks amazing</li>
            <li>Totally worth way more than $7.99</li>
            <li>and they go on smooth.</li>
            <li>These are great liner pencils, they go on soft and smooth, no tugging, and the colors are fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li>Use these with a light hand because they will be gone before you know it.</li>
            <li>did like them and the price is cheap for them.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t actually give you great</li>

            <li>they were really cheap too</li>
            <li>They are smooth just like my MAC also.</li>
            <li>Then when you put them on they run and they don&#x27;t go on smoothly if your looking to do a cut crease eye.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and do not run( melt) as the day carries</li>
            <li>Honestly though, for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>glides on smooth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re amazing, really.</li>

            <li>Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are more intense than others - I find the lavender and gold, for example, a little light, but they all go on smoothly and most of them have very good color.</li>
            <li>(they are super light weight and applied easily) for safety purposes-no marking on the of what they are made of.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchase and pretty quick shipping!</li>
            <li>Goes on eyes pretty easily, but since it goes on easily, it also smudges easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using make-up, so I don&#x27;t have any experience to compare these against, but the colors are nice and bright and lasted most of my shift (8 hours) in a fairly physical job, so they get a thumbs up from me!</li>

            <li>this is just what I&#x27;d call a true brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The gold is more of a copper color and not so much gold.</li>
            <li>They are nice &amp; soft</li>
            <li>True to color swatches in photo.</li>
            <li>Yes they are cheap but they don&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>and she uses them all the time and wants me to find her some lip liners like these :)</li>
            <li>I loved all of the different colors!</li>
            <li>but im hoping this holds true once i do</li>
            <li>/&gt;They look like a nice soft liner, and I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem letting someone know where I got them.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say what the true wear time can be.</li>
            <li>The quality is good, the pencils are soft enough to smudge nicely but not so creamy that the pigment won&#x27;t stay put.</li>

            <li>, if you want a really sleek look you are better off with the liquid version of these.</li>
            <li>They also have a sweet smell to them.</li>
            <li>Recieved it today and love them all ready..</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of those too good to be true deals.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice but be careful it smudges easy!</li>
            <li>These eye liners glide on smoothly and have a pretty great smudge factor - just the right amount without totally blending in.  </li>

            <li>They go on very smooth and are vibrant.</li>
            <li>They go on strongly and pretty evenly for me.  </li>
            <li>Wipes off pretty easily though</li>
            <li>I love these eyeliners for the vivid color, it glides on the eyelids smoothly.</li>
            <li>Love them they go on very smooth and for the price they are a total bargain</li>
            <li>The look isn&#x27;t too glitzy,and you can use a little for a touch of color, or a more generous application for a bright pop of attitude.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with these, the colors are almost the same ones pictured, go on smooth, nice bold colors, worth the money spent.</li>

            <li>So vibrant and so many colors to choose from.</li>

            <li>I am 98% sure you will love them unless you bought these for a specific color and didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this for any model who may need the bold colors.</li>
            <li>although I&#x27;m sure young girls would enjoy using them.</li>
            <li>however they are so greasy that they run off quickly.  </li>
            <li>Theses things are great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the white on my waterline and it goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;For lining my eyes, they work great, really pigmented and creamy.</li>
            <li>They came before expected with a sharpener, they go on smooth, and are surprisingly pigmented.</li>
            <li>These liners are vibrant and glide on so easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>colors are more vibrant than others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>They do wear off after several hours and can smudge -- but I don&#x27;t think any more than most drug-store brands costing $5-$10 each, and even some premium brands that cost $20.</li>
            <li>Older wrinkly lids love the  ease of application.</li>
            <li>I love the colors but they aren&#x27;t as vibrant as it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li>so they last quality is great colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li>When I came across the colors of the liners I was happy cause I was looking for all the bright liners, but when I received them they were all the wrong colors that were not pictured In the add.</li>
            <li>the colors are great and last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>The white is great for opening the eyes but seems to fade fast.</li>
            <li>They are super pigmented.</li>
            <li>Every colour just glides on and is so bold..</li>
            <li>A quick run along your lashes with one of the brighter colors and a coat of mascara and Viola</li>

            <li>they are really worth every penny they cost.</li>

            <li>I have fun matching the colors  with my clothes.</li>
            <li>However in any case these pencils are definitely worth it to buy.</li>

            <li>I will begin telling that i love that they give you 12 colors for such a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>The price makes it worth it though.  </li>
            <li>So worth for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;So worth it</li>
            <li>well worth my money would buy again</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Fun to play with for a pop of color or drama.</li>
            <li>the colors make make up fun</li>
            <li>but nothing worth complainning about.</li>
            <li>These are so worth the money, even if you throw out 3 or 4 you&#x27;ll never wear.</li>
            <li>If you into lipsticks, you must have some lip pencils and these are worth the buy</li>
            <li>And WELL worth it.</li>
            <li>Colors as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged in a clear top box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>took a while to get here ,but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li>The liner also blends quite nicely if wanted, I actually used two colors on my eyes and blended.</li>
            <li>Personally, I find the sparkle nice and not too over the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I noticed was that they do glide on nicely, however, they smear a lot.</li>
            <li>useful like eyeshadows and lipsticks...</li>
            <li>I  liked the eyeliners would like it if they were longer lasting...</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>I can buy more of it and really don&#x27;t lose too much quality.</li>
            <li>(I have had allergic reactions to some eyeliners but no swelling or burning with this product so far ) :)</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t get smudged though they seem to last all day nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for 3 stars is the color selection.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to get more of an experimental rainbow set with reds, yellows, and oranges...</li>
            <li>The colors are assorted so its kinda fun to see what you will get.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am just more sensitive to things on my eyes, but</li>
            <li>I rarely rate any product five stars</li>
            <li>Just used a bit but for the price i guess is worth it..</li>
            <li>They took a while to be delivered but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li>These are so worth the price.</li>
            <li>it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li>Gold and White were good modern choices.  </li>
            <li>As far as eyeliners go, this is one of the better sets I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>The colors are bold and vibrant and they go on so smooth.</li>
            <li>They stay on for hours and hours and rarely any smearing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth the price just to have the lighter colors to experiment with</li>
            <li>fun</li>
            <li>well I just wish some of the colors were more soft and easier to put on</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth buying...</li>
            <li>She was thrilled and said she&#x27;d heard of them but never actually bought herself any.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun matching my outfits with my liner.</li>
            <li>so easy to apply and very vivid colors.  </li>
            <li>they glide on super smooth and are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright very pretty applies and removes easily I highly recommend this eyeliner set and will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li>Then the rest are bold and bright colors like hot pink and teal.</li>
            <li>Very quality and very colorful.</li>
            <li>Tips not soft nor easy to put on , more like colored pencils than make up.</li>
            <li>unlike other pencils , ..&lt;br /&gt;super happy &amp; they stay for longer than expected on eyes, .It does smudge but otherwise stay nice .</li>
            <li>If you love bright eye make up and fun colors, you should seriously invest in these.  </li>
            <li>The color is rich and concentrated, and the texture is smooth and creamy (but not TOO soft).</li>
            <li>I got all the colors shown but no black which I&#x27;m ok with.</li>
            <li>The product came super quick and I would definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li>Pros: easy and smooth application, highly pigmented, great color variety, long lasting wear,&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Try to go with a seller that have high ratings (recently) and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I was</li>
            <li>, those colors in any other eyeliner I have ever tried have always shown up well and looked good on me.</li>
            <li>And the price was right.</li>
            <li>Glides right on.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t answer these questions right now.</li>
            <li>I do notice they can tend to smear right after application sometimes, though.</li>
            <li>the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The price right.</li>
            <li>they just glide right on like butter in a stick.</li>
            <li>I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in a sling for 5 weeks after right rotator cuff surgery</li>
            <li>I enjoy using my new eyelinets!</li>
            <li>But I still really enjoy them, and they are decent quality.</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented, they apply easily  and they are longer lasting than most bargain eyeliners that i have come across.</li>
            <li>they glide on smooth and are vibrant colors..</li>
            <li>These liners glide on smoothly, the color is vibrant and they stay in place (with primer or powder).</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>but they are decent and go on smooth.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re vibrant with smooth and silky application that lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on smooth and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li>I love these as they are soft and easy to use on the sensitive eye lids and under the bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the false eyelashes, and they are wonderful and fast delivery as well!  </li>
            <li>Very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Very easy and creamy but stern enough to get the job done!!</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smudges very easily.</li>
            <li>Several colors, goes on very easily.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vivid and they go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>WHen I do wear the makeup it goes on smooth and bold, lasts a long while, sometimes even to the next day when the faded look is more appealing.</li>
            <li>they are highly pigmented and goes on in smooth, sleek strokes.  </li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented, glide smoothly without clumps, smearing or dryness.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth they go on and how long it stays on!</li>
            <li>They do not fade quickly, they are high quality and worth far more than the price on amazon.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really need to buy a special sharpener for it.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and very useful.</li>
            <li>Breaks off easily, and overall cheap quality.</li>
            <li>They work as lip liners too which is awesome, but the only reason I took a star off, was for the Black liner which is what i bought the set for.</li>
            <li>I actually get a better smoky look with super creamy pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are super creamy and the colors are really bold and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not the most girly girl &amp; do bare minimum makeup for work.</li>
            <li>use them everyday great deal only wish I had more colors to choose from</li>
            <li>The dark purple and teal though are gorgeous though.</li>
            <li>these are great for a fun &amp; playful pop of color and the price point is really low so that it&#x27;s no big loss if you don&#x27;t like them or won&#x27;t use them very much.</li>
            <li>the colors glide on very vibrant!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t quite fine enough a tip for a crisp eyeliner, and almost too fine a tip for an eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li>It comes out very vibrantly and it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li>theyre super vibrant and smooooooth!</li>
            <li>Vibrant, rich colours.</li>
            <li>I received the exact same colors above, and they are smooth and bright.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very pretty and glides on easily, however the metallic colors (like the shimmery copper) barely show up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>most of the &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; type of eyeliners seem to be too hard the effectively transfer to the eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Because of their creaminess these eyeliners do need frequent sharpener in order o retain clean lines, but I didn&#x27;t really see that a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li>These liners were too colorful for my taste, but would probably be okay for someone younger.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, very creamy &amp; easy to put on..</li>
            <li>My skin is naturally oily, and makeup easily smears, but these don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>You can have fun with so many different looks.</li>
            <li>I did not get white, but I&#x27;m happy that I got 3 different pinks.</li>
            <li>They are soft and glide on easily to the eyelid.</li>
            <li>They go on easily and really are creamy and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>I was actually surprised how easy they were to apply to my eyelid.</li>
            <li>My pencils are soft and glide easy.</li>
            <li>but they are good for a slight under eyes glow</li>
            <li>Wd gladly pay double if colors were all cosmetically useful.  </li>
            <li>Black, charcoal, browns all good too.  </li>
            <li>Good eyeliners, and as an Italian I was pleasantly surprised by the non greasy and hairness of the set.  </li>
            <li>I also received super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve initially found this brand in Mexico and I was extra happy to have seen it for sale on here.</li>
            <li>They are soft and glide on easily to the eyelid.</li>
            <li>Works well, arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and evenly, and is very soft</li>
            <li>I am always having a problem finding an eye pencil that is both vivid and smooth,  and have gotten to the point I have refused to even put eye liner</li>
            <li>I first used them as a regular eyeliner (above the eye) but it didn&#x27;t work out so great</li>
            <li>All of the other ones have incredible pigment (even the black one which I find to be rare) and they glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not very easy to apply and colors rub off eaeasily, but really pretty and good for the price.</li>
            <li>Very creamy, glides on pretty easily and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>Does not last in the water line but very smooth and creamy for longer staying power set with eyeshadow</li>
            <li>They also sharpen very, very well.</li>
            <li>so I got these They go on very smooth and last.</li>
            <li>Love love love the colors they go on soft and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Love them I used them all the time I only wished I brought them in only light brown and dark brown there great for my eyebrows</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also quite large, so for the price, these eyeliners are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>which is fine with me, i had no expectation as far as what colors to expect i was just excited about trying something new.</li>
            <li>then used the pencil a bit more on top of shadow and blended a little!</li>
            <li>I would, however, not use these pencils if you are very sensitive about strong smells, as the whole time I was putting it on</li>
            <li>white - just a pure white (these are great for making eyes look</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Mighty Gadget(USA Merchant)\\&quot; based on the positive reviews of these eyeliners and because I wanted to try pastel &amp; vivid eyeliner colors from a \\&quot;new\\&quot; brand that I&#x27;ve never tried before for this Spring-Summer.</li>
            <li>pretty colors durable as well</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than the urban decay eyeliner</li>
            <li>I put up a picture with all the colors I received, one picture in natural light and one with the flash</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy from this seller again.. :-)</li>
            <li>i love experimenting with all of the different colors.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Nice assortment of colors that look as expected when applied.</li>
            <li>Love these and will buy them again when I start to run low.</li>
            <li>Trust me, I shopped around first because I have to shop on a budget.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>colors are so pretty</li>
            <li>so beware, you will not receive the exact color they display here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the colors, just wish they had white.</li>
            <li>Colors are pigmented and will go on even more pigmented if white liner is used first.</li>
            <li>They came in on time and are really pigmented!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it&#x27;s a set of so many different colors.</li>
            <li>Nice set of eyeliners, came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>First day wearing it, I wore my glasses just in case.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to fall in love with them especially if you have tried a lot of the cheaper brands out there.</li>
            <li>So its pretty creamy.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors but the quality just isn&#x27;t there for me.</li>
            <li>they have okay lasting power on</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying make up on Amazon</li>
            <li>I will absolutely order again!</li>
            <li>The colors are all pretty and show on my skin.</li>
            <li>Extremely fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to create different looks with them, I know for sure</li>
            <li>The pencils are all very well pigmented!</li>
            <li>I cannot stress this enough though, make sure that if you buy this, you plan on checking your makeup every now and again.</li>
            <li>My eyelids are really sensitive to both pressure and ingredients, and they really enjoy these eyeliners.</li>
            <li>and I love that this comes with 3 different purple options!</li>
            <li>It goes on very well!</li>
            <li>&amp; have found myself using most of them on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>First off, I did receive all the colors pictured.</li>
            <li>Pretty colors</li>
            <li>At such a low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but these are great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon and thank you too reviewers!  </li>
            <li>- she was glad that there was a White eyeliner in the packet!</li>

            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>I got the exact colors that were advertized.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sure i would come back to buy this item</li>
            <li>However the colors do match the color indication on the end of the pencil pretty well.</li>
            <li>Get them ;)</li>
            <li>u to me&amp;#34; :)Totally recommend !</li>
            <li>No constantly wetting every time I needed to apply another line :)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>would definitely buy more of these even before I run out</li>
            <li>and I actually like these better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My expectations were higher.</li>
            <li>These are pretty low-end.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future !!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors (white is not in the kit).  </li>
            <li>I received them in a timely manner and got exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>so it ends up looking a bit clowny ;)</li>
            <li>I use the white and purple the most.</li>
            <li>most likely order again.</li>
            <li>but at first i was iffy about them</li>
            <li>:) they do last all day on my lower lash line.</li>
            <li>I love them, and the actual makeup is scentless...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering some more for my collection.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that had a pop of color, and these beauties were exactly what I was looking for.....intense color, ease application, and very pigmented!  </li>
            <li>i got all the exact colors as shown.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>but ok is not really enough for me</li>
            <li>The colors are all fairly simple and enjoyable and I haven&#x27;t seen any that make me think &amp;#34;God</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>Love the Blue &amp; Silver</li>
            <li>are only 4 dollars for 12 but that steal just makes them better</li>
            <li>I have really watery eyes when I yawn or laugh..</li>
            <li>Love this set a bunch of different colors.</li>
            <li>No rashes or breakouts and no weird smells.</li>
            <li>addressed on exact time .</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty smudge-prone, but I guess that could just be me being spoiled by gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Love the colors, especially for my summer wardrobe.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought these mostly for the white, and the brown.  </li>
            <li>This is a fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>many colors that you can make yourself look 80&#x27;s to present day!</li>
            <li>I love the different colors that were included in the packet.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, they were exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>was really hoping for those colors too...!</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, it is the best.</li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t say that I purchased this because my mom bought them for me on her account.</li>
            <li>:) I got every eyeliner showed above.</li>
            <li>so pretty.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smudges first</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying these!!</li>
            <li>All day pretty</li>
            <li>Have the make up remover ready!  </li>
            <li>so make sure to apply a solid coat</li>
            <li>Just wonder exactly what is in them though.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of shimmery eyeliners but I love the shimmer ones in this set.</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty and i have one for</li>
            <li>pencil color is exactly as the end color tip.</li>
            <li>I love the colors I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I Love all the different colors in this set.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>which is a first</li>
            <li>The eyeliners are great, very soft and vibrant, but I expected to receive the colors shown in the picture</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something subtle, this isn&#x27;t really the pack you want, but if you want an extreme look, this is a great deal for good pencils.</li>
            <li>The liner applies very well, it doesn&#x27;t skip across the fine wrinkles in eyelids as mush as most other liners I have used.</li>
            <li>They smudge and are deff not lasting, the black and brown work better but it was so cheap I wanted to try it, u need to re touch it for sure, pretty colors.</li>
            <li>I have fun playing around with these, trying new colorful eye looks.</li>
            <li>The colours are great, but unfortunately it smears quite easily.</li>
            <li>And every girl needs a black liner, so I was happy the seller set my expectations instead of being surprised when package arrived.</li>
            <li>I own Urban Decay and many other Sephora favorites</li>
            <li>The colors are quality, they last a long time, and its fantastic to have so many choices to change your look!</li>
            <li>For the money these are amazing goes on smooth and very vibrant - set with same color eye shadow and it will last</li>
            <li>so well I had to try it on a friend sitting with me (she has very, very black skin) and the colours all look gorgeous on both of us.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to take of and if your a person like me that can&#x27;t get the right design you could keep on starting over</li>
            <li>The pink eyeliner isn&#x27;t as bright as it looks on the bottom of the pencil, but that is the only one that doesn&#x27;t look true to shade.</li>
            <li>I was so excited for these, and they came a week early or so.</li>
            <li>Some colors are not my taste but other are really nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Super excited to start using them, was surprised they were so pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Other than that they work really nice.</li>
            <li>I use to buy Hard Candy eyeliners, cause they&#x27;re nice and smooth, or I&#x27;d use a gel liner.</li>
            <li>the application is very smooth and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>All the quality for a low price...definitely worth it!!  </li>
            <li>very pigmented, last very long great value too</li>
            <li>But seriously, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li>The white is bright white</li>
            <li>Very vibrant and pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Would have like to be able to pick colors since I really wanted red eyeliner</li>
            <li>They are just as good as my Sephora colored liners that are so much more expensive.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants more colored eyeliners in their collection.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am ready to head to Italy now that I have such lovely eyeliner to use.  </li>
            <li>They are very soft, blendable, and super pigmented.</li>
            <li>Some are just fine in depth of color and glide on easily and others (about 1/2) are harder to apply because the color is too light to actually show up as an eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received all the colors shown very fast and they&#x27;re very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy these when I run out, which won&#x27;t be very long :P</li>
            <li>Pretty colors but dry &amp; does not go on smoothly !</li>
            <li>But on the positive side given the price, I think they are a deal....</li>
            <li>Navy, Olive and Maroon or Rose wd be better color choices than sky blue and grass green, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>my only caveat was one of the eyeliners was damage it look as if it was burn other then that great buy</li>
            <li>The price was pretty much what one &#x27;name-brand&#x27; pencil would have cost, but I couldn&#x27;t even find the shade I needed in their lines.  </li>
            <li>Really like these colors, but the electric blue is a bit much for me, the rest are lovely colors though.</li>
            <li>They are soft and worth every penny :) technically there are 11 Eye pencils and one lip pencil</li>
            <li>but they came in pretty fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>i will be reordering soon, i go through makeup pretty fast.</li>
            <li>They stayed on all day and pretty much all night.</li>
            <li>The only reason I like them instead of love them is because I don&#x27;t really wear too much make up as it is</li>
            <li>I bought these because most of the colors pictured were bright but the majority of them I got were dark and included black which I did not want.</li>
            <li>Love them they go on easy and last a long time</li>
            <li>There is a nice range, and the colors are average enough that I think are easily wearable on any day.</li>
            <li>this kit has just the right colors that I like to wear but wish blk could have been included with the kit other than that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>i love them all well most of the like only one of the colors did not work for me but other</li>
            <li>there is def a smell to them but it doesnt smell bad, kinda sweet.. very happy with product</li>
            <li>Easy to use this is my second batch of pencils.</li>
            <li>: easily smudged, color transfer to upper part of eyelid</li>
            <li>and while they looked as bright, they did not last as long.</li>
            <li>I saw a couple reviews complaining that white it not in it, and no, it is not, this is silver, I knew that, but can easily understand the confusion.</li>
            <li>I received more blues than expected and none of the colors were exactly like the picture, the orange wasn&#x27;t there either.</li>
            <li>I was super surprised that it didnt rub off.</li>
            <li>The only problems I have had with this product is that it breaks and smears easily.</li>
            <li>My only con is it smudges easily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably mix most of these colors with a black eyeliner because the colors are so vibrant and out of the norm, but they really are nice overall.</li>
            <li>They are good and last long</li>
            <li>they came in good condition and the colors are really pretty they&#x27;re thick too</li>
            <li>I love every single one of the colors.</li>
            <li>Large pencils.</li>
            <li>I was able to get the cool gold color, white, and black - which I consider to be kind of essential for any eyeliner 12 pack -</li>
            <li>These pencils have bautiful colors and are soft and easy to apply, not like most cheap pencils which are very hard.</li>
            <li>they are soft and easy to apply, they last a long time and are very easy to store and travel with.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t receive the white one, but thats fine.</li>
            <li>and they are pigment the packing was very decent and shipping was fast always on time</li>
            <li>The description says 12 metallic eyeliners but only 5 of the 12 are metallic, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li>but the colors are so vibrant and opaque..very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>These eyeliners are creamy/soft and really vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li>However make sure you decide your shade for the day and be sure of it - very hard to wash off as it smudges and smears all over your face.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that because of my Indian skin color, some of the more glittery liners do not show up as vibrant as the normal ones.</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone who wants some vibrant eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>but they are a little light kind of creamy,  but I will use them daily and recommend them highly!</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much in way of pigment or texture since they were so cheap, but they are extremely pigmented and they go on super creamy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend them, especially considering the amazing price.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>I really like this set of eye liner pencils.  </li>
            <li>I hope these continue to be made available, as I would definitely buy them again.    </li>
            <li>They are ALL very pigmented and soft.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I feel very girl needs these</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very matte</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really had any issues with smudging.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this product to any makeup aficionado.</li>
            <li>It came packaged very well and everything was intact.</li>
            <li>The colors of these liners really POP...</li>
            <li>There is no difference in quality between the colors and they are all very creamy and pigmented.  </li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t have any problems.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented and creamy, but some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li>they stay on really well</li>
            <li>These eyeliners are creamy and work very well.</li>
            <li>and they came in fast, got every color as shown in picture .</li>
            <li>I really do like it.</li>
            <li>They go on smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li>They are very creamy and very pigmented</li>
            <li>Very pigmented. .</li>
            <li>I love the shimmery pink and blue/green colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a fantastic buy</li>
            <li>I guess this can be remedied with getting cheap individual eyeliner brushes for each color</li>
            <li>Very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li>dont smudge that much.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>

            <li>My package very closely resembles the picture shown.</li>
            <li>I really recomended them.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I have to be careful what eye liners I use because most of them irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have never had eyeliner run so much.</li>
            <li>so b gentle.</li>
            <li>(: I use them very often.</li>
            <li>was a very convienet  package</li>
            <li>Plus the colors are also very pigmented.</li>
            <li>Quite frankly even with the reviews I was not expecting much.  </li>
            <li>I really liek this, it does smudge a bit, but</li>
            <li>I also recieved them sooo fast</li>
            <li>Be careful about how much pressure you use or you&#x27;ll find yourself with a much thicker like than you want and be sure to let it set or use a powder to set it.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>The metallic colors I received are actually metallic, and reflect light like they should.</li>
            <li>These are better than i expected.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t smudge as much as my Maybeline does.</li>
            <li>Not the whole time.</li>
            <li>So it really doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Colors are very visible.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to make up.</li>
            <li>(they don&#x27;t really show up...)  </li>
            <li>I got a white, which is important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very creamy, but hold well with a powder eyeshadow applied over.</li>
            <li>and I have really oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>It seems they are much easier to &amp;#34;play with&amp;#34; and apply than others.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, can&#x27;t beat them for the price.  </li>

            <li>very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li>two days ago the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll believe that they are working very well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who loves makeup and wants an inexpensive, well-made product.</li>
            <li>The colors are REALLY pigmented &amp; stay on my waterline all day.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li>I would have paid this price for just 2 of these colors and got the whole rainbow instead.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li>They are very creamy</li>
            <li>I like all the colors that came but there aren&#x27;t any pinks or oranges or well, light colors aside from white and gold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They also hold rather well ,really have to scrub to get these off</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t notice too much smudging</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast and arrived a day before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>My wife ordered it and she really likes them.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li>and they really should</li>
            <li>You dont need much to make the color pop.</li>
            <li>I was just trying to buy the product, because the price for 12 eyeliners is a real bargain.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>they show up very well.</li>
            <li>I wore the purple to work and within one hour I noticed I had purple &amp;#34;Racoon Eyes&amp;#34; - very embarrassing.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and blendable.</li>
            <li>I do find I absolutely need primer to keep this in place for an all-day wear but that may just be me and my oily eyelids.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price</li>
            <li>I really like the color selection that they send.</li>
            <li>Soft...much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors and have used all of the even the pink eyeliner.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re really creamy .</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR READING, BYE👌</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li>I really like these products.</li>
            <li>I want to thank you so much</li>
            <li>In my more mature years I keep my make up simple.</li>
            <li>I own brands such as Urban Decay 24/7 and Smashbox Limitless eyeliners</li>
            <li>will purchase more in the near future</li>
            <li>Warm them up by drawing a very short line between the thumb and index finger, or like seen in the pic above.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and if i am feeling lazy i just slide a line of color on my eye lids instead of full eye shadow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the black one at all if I can help it because they smudge very easily.</li>
            <li>I am very very happy since I enjoy using a color liner above my usual black liner..</li>
            <li>dont smudge... and the colors have so far stayed in place all day for me every time !!!</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean off with either plain soap and water, or makeup remover (I use coconut oil btw).</li>
            <li>I got them pretty quick, but it was a week before I finally tried them out.  </li>
            <li>they do not smear easily and they do stay on for a long time</li>
            <li>go on very smooth, and work with any conventional wood sharpener.  </li>
            <li>and they go on very easy with little to no pressure...</li>
            <li>and I am so excited to use these on my next clients!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Silver and Pearl Pink!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors endless options I added swatches of all the colors.</li>
            <li>Overall, worth it!</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised by the quality, as they are very inexpensive.    </li>
            <li>and i probably won&#x27;t use the green, but it&#x27;s worth it because the colors are very creamy and slide on easily.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented, soft and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I use urban decay on a day to day basic and, now I catch myself reaching for these more than my expensive high end brand theses are amazing!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a cool makeup trick to make your eyes look bigger/bolder, and this white shows up so much better than the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented and very creamy.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see this at such a low price and have such great ratings.</li>
            <li>Love all the options, I wear the blue, green, turquoise, brown, gold, copper and violet most and use the pinks for lips with a natural lip color gloss for blending.</li>
            <li>You can go to the pharmacy and get one decent eyeliner for $10, or you can get these, which is the same (if not better) quality at a cheaper price - and the color range is great, too.  </li>
            <li>but I like them so much that if I have to gift someone I will really buy a new set and give it.</li>
            <li>only the black is good...</li>
            <li>Just make sure that the caps are on well, they can come off easily, and I&#x27;m sure nobody wants dirty eyeliner and/or makeup cases!</li>
            <li>and I am in love with using the darker blue on my outer lower lash line and the forest green in my inner lower lash line, then I just blend(: I definitely recommend these to anyone debating whether or not to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li>These are terrific quality, vivid colors and go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>The color of these liners is much more vivid than I expected.</li>
            <li>The pencils are soft enough for easy steady application.</li>
            <li>(Unlike alot of eyelines that usually just rub off on the eye without the shimmer).&lt;br /&gt;The gold pencil kind of smells like bubble</li>
            <li>the wont stab you eye and the can also be used a lip liner because they are so soft the color are pretty</li>
            <li>(I have super small eye lids honestly), but it did last all day.  </li>
            <li>No repeat colours,  no black (got enough of those,  thank you)  just nice pencils that actually stay on for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all the color options and I love that they all show up on my dark brown African American skin!!!!</li>
            <li>smooth silk finish very long</li>
            <li>For less than $8, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>The black and silver are my favorite colors out of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Have paid much more for much less, that ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li>I just wish this set included orange and silver instead of the violate which it looks more like black.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, they stay on all day, they do not flake, and they go on without any problems.</li>
            <li>The main reason I ordered this was for the colors not given to me.</li>
            <li>Received this eyeliner set only 2 days after I ordered it...surprised to see it had shipped so quickly.</li>
            <li>I feel like a lot of colored eye liners aren&#x27;t as vibrant against my skin</li>
            <li>They are vibrant and don&#x27;t run or bleed.</li>
            <li>Even now that I&#x27;ve started building a better and more expensive makeup collection, I would still recommend these.</li>
            <li>The only issue is, that i diddnt get the colors in the picture, i diddnt get the white or the orange color, i got mostly greens and purples.</li>
            <li>Such lovely colors and this set will last forever!</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant without being gaudy.</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I got two different browns and a bit more blue</li>
            <li>I was iffy about ordering these because the reviews, I needed a white eye liner but for the price I figured I would order this, if I didn&#x27;t like it I could give it to my step daughter, but I do like it very much!</li>
            <li>Blue - It looks a bit purple just looking at it, but it goes on as a very pretty blue&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Very vivid.</li>
            <li>The colors are very vivid.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with all of the colours I received, and yes, they are a little tougher to remove manually than other eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend these, they last very long and you are definitely given more than your moneys worth!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They are highly pigmented and I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates.  </li>
            <li>These colors are highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>they r highly pigmented</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>At this price point, I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Highly recommended..</li>
            <li>However I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The quality is on the okay side and they do last a long time especially if you use an eyelid primer (I get mine like most of my makeup from Urban Decay.)</li>
            <li>Lasts ok on the lash line, but definitely not for the water line unless you have a super heavy duty sealer.</li>
            <li>They glide on very smooth and are long lasting.</li>
            <li>These go on very smoothly and last a long time without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve like a little more variation.</li>
            <li>I think the packaging should be a little better considering the quality of them but no biggie I guess.</li>
            <li>, they are vivid and noticable and they make my eyes pop!</li>
            <li>Some of the colors fall a little over the day, but using eye shadow over top helps with that.</li>
            <li>Totally recommend them if you&#x27;re looking to expand your collection and get some pretty colors!</li>
            <li>These are phenomenal, but if you sweat a little, it spreads.</li>
            <li>I was seriously not expecting much for the price, but they have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>You know those cheap liners that look vibrant but are actually scratchy and barely leave a trace of color on skin?</li>
            <li>If you are looking for some new eye liner with vibrant color get these.</li>
            <li>all the colors are fun... but at least 3 or 4 are 2 light to be of much use</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a pink, or light purple.</li>
            <li>Great for use on kids or stage plays/costumes where make up should be exaggerated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that there are a few colors in here I will probably never use, but there are so many to choose from, that doesn&#x27;t seem like an issue to me.  </li>
            <li>The white one is my preferred pencil for the inner corners and highlighting directly under the brows (blend well before it dries) because they do not collect/bunch up like many pencils do.</li>
            <li>It comes with lots of different and fun colors.</li>
            <li>I am getting  few more sets for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li>There are many colors and they last a long time.</li>
            <li>The colors are fun, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Normally I get the roll up eyeliners so i dont have to use a sharpener, which I dont have at the moment.</li>
            <li>So I had to buy a few more.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t last quite a whole 9 hour work day - start looking pretty faded.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth $8 if you aren&#x27;t looking for a specific color.</li>
            <li>Not Urban Decay quality, but still well worth it for the bargain shopper.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to experiment with different colors</li>
            <li>It wasnt really worth the energy to send them back...</li>
            <li>These are such fun.  </li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re kind of forced to sharpen them between every use.</li>
            <li>These are nice...not super high quality, but soft enough to blend.</li>
            <li>They smell (strongly) almost like paint (and the pink one is like a mixture of paint and artificial bubble gum) and they can smudge quite a bit if you have oily eyelids (-1 star), but as I kind of like the smudgy look this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me.  </li>
            <li>(usually when eyeliner goes on easy, it comes off even easier!).</li>
            <li>: Keep them sharp to get a fine line.</li>
            <li>I like the way they glide on and the colors are different than typical eye liner sets, which was nice to have a variety.  </li>
            <li>I received these eyeliner pencils very quickly and I tried the white eyeliner pencil the same day.</li>
            <li>Other than this, it&#x27;s really good for such a low price.</li>
            <li>They will be perfect for an all over lid smudge/ base for a similar color to go on top instead of just as a basic &#x27;eyeliner line&#x27; on the lid.</li>
            <li>The colors are all pretty vibrant except the browns require multiple strokes to retain color.</li>
            <li>This is totally worth it, and I found the dark blue, pink, green to be my favorite!!!</li>
            <li>Just like any other eyeliner they are smooth and can be sharpened.</li>
            <li>colors do go on smooth and no complaints about smells and so forth like other comments ...</li>
            <li>Wish they came in other colors.they apply smoothly.</li>
            <li>They blend smoothly with other colours or sit well by themselves.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to future buyers of this item to spend the few cents more and choose either one of them to purchase from if you want to receive EXACTLY the colors of eyeliners that are shown in the pictures.  </li>
            <li>and btw they have almost the same exact set at Sephora (a high end makeup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I needed some new eyeliners for upcoming events.</li>
            <li>Live them all</li>
            <li>im gonna have to buy a new set</li>
            <li>The smell of this product reminds me of a mix of wax, wood blocks and like a new building.</li>
            <li>It for some reason just seems to bleed with the eye-juices and sweat produced through the day (I live in a HUMID ATX)</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;d like to say that the colors in the picture don&#x27;t really look the same as the when you see them in real life.</li>
            <li>I used the blue pencil to outline my eyes and then lightly shadowed with a lighter blue.....</li>
            <li>I initially bought this A for the cheap price, and B for the white pencil, which I did not receive.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak too much for the staying power on all of these, only for two of them, (Black and Light Brown) but the two I tried stayed all day!</li>
            <li>It applies too thick and smudges very easily.</li>
            <li>Great purchase there are only 11 eyeliners and 1 lip liner which came in pink the colors last long</li>
            <li>They are very very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They look very classy.</li>
            <li>the pencils are very soft, and I like that a lot.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised when I got them.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and glide on</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is easy to apply, and a long pencil so it will last a while, too.</li>
            <li>I thought most of the other colors were a little intense/immature, but they are delightfully soft and easy to blend, so they can be much more subtle.  </li>
            <li>Clear Winner!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the light purple yet but the light blue, light green, regular green and gold I gave to a friend who has a much fairer complexion than I do</li>
            <li>I only have two complaints, first:</li>
            <li>They are so soft and beautifull !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would wear most of these colors.</li>
            <li>Softer pencils  vivid colors</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these eyeliners!  </li>
            <li>they stand out and accesses a make-up palette use all the colors for a great fresh look cordinating it with the colors of your tops or hair accesories but to those whom use the base lipstick eyeshadow the whole bit</li>
            <li>Creamy enough with really pretty colors</li>
            <li>These go on really smooth and show up on dark skin like mine.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it through Urban Decay or Nyx, so I figured this would be my next bet since I was getting more colors for the same price as one Nyx liner.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is cause the navy blue one is the only one with okay pigment.</li>
            <li>My review is based on first impressions currently.</li>
            <li>Be aware that you will not get the colors provided in the pictures above.</li>
            <li>Cool colors, but smears too much and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Received these exact colors except for the orange unless it&#x27;s the gold I have and just looks different in the picture.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how pigmented and soft these liners are!</li>
            <li>Fun and long wearing ...can not beat the price</li>
            <li>Pretty low quality</li>
            <li>Not sure how I&#x27;ll use most of these colors,</li>
            <li>They come on dark and smooth.</li>
            <li>Rosa - this looks like a true pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft not hard</li>
            <li>Yes, they smudge easily, but all you need is a little, then blend it out to the thickness you want.</li>
            <li>The colors are also very nice, though I usually like to use the purple, black, brown, and indigo.</li>
            <li>I then opened each pencil to mark my skin to see exactly how it would look on me (and also making sure that there weren&#x27;t any empty pencils like previous posters have stated)</li>
            <li>Colors are great but pencils harder than expected thus more difficult for it to be applied and must be applied over and over to get desired color effect.</li>
            <li>The intense shades last the day without needing to reapply the product despite temps in the high 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but I set it with transparent powder, totally worth a few seconds of extra work for the price and color and ease of application (smooth and soft on the skin)</li>
            <li>Very creamy highly pigmented prompt arrival overall would recommend</li>
            <li>They are vivid, glide on smoothly and last long.</li>
            <li>eyeliners are not thick enough ,can&#x27;t really see the colored ones on me ...</li>
            <li>These are really cheap for their pigmentation and the number that you get, but they don&#x27;t last long on oily lids like mine (even with primer and setting it with powder).  </li>
            <li>Added  new colors to my eyeliner game 👌 applys nice</li>
            <li>They are super soft, be really careful when you take the caps off.</li>
            <li>Some are more metallic than others when applied, but only slightly.</li>
            <li>i read the reviews, for the price, you get what you pay for, the colors are nice, but they smudge a lot, and they are very hard when</li>
            <li>I do think, however, that if they are kept out of the original packaging for long enough the smell will probably go away.</li>
            <li>I got a bunch of nice matte colors including: Lilac (pink), royal blue, &amp;#34;neon green&amp;#34; (more of a grass green, not neon at all), turqouise, and violet (dark purple).</li>
            <li>ok, I have to say this, I marked all the colors on my hand &amp; it smeared right off, BUT when I went to wash them off, it was really hard to wash it off!!</li>
            <li>theyre so smooth that they smear with a little touch.</li>
            <li>Applying a little powder or light eye shadow also helps the colors stay put.</li>
            <li>I love these liners you don&#x27;t have to press hard for them to show....</li>
            <li>when you first open the package it has an odd smell of laffy taffy, but that goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>They are super pigmented and creamy!&lt;br /&gt;There arrive like 2 weeks before expected!</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, the only problem is it hard to put on..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why so many people gave them such high reviews and 4-5 stars.</li>
            <li>to use these as an eye liner stinks, the color is great going on but runs and bleeds.  </li>
            <li>It came earlier than I expected and glides on really smooth.</li>
            <li>I was SO SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY of these......</li>
            <li>Superbly soft, I&#x27;ve been using them as eye shadows.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only thing that really disappoints me</li>
            <li>The pencils are pretty long so I just have to apply at an angle , so I wont hit the mirror.</li>
            <li>So far I can tell they will work well for both but MUST be set with powder.</li>
            <li>but I was very disponted to not get white and there was like 3 browns for that reason</li>
            <li>The only reason that I don&#x27;t give them one star is because the colors are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>have about 1-3 hours before it starts to look like a 3 year old</li>
            <li>I was just conscious not to touch/rub at my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I really like the quality of these eyeliners especially for the price..</li>
            <li>Very creamy, I don&#x27;t know how they will last when applied.</li>
            <li>I can easily do a complete look.</li>
            <li>Not messy.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think that they are any different from the cheap ones like Wet n Wild and the like.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by these eyeliners.</li>
            <li>Actually did really well.</li>
            <li>and I found that I can use these on my lashes for a natural look, or neon lashes if that is the case.</li>
            <li>Nothing too young or wild</li>
            <li>Soft to the point</li>
            <li>Its like a creme eyeliner in pencil form, they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li>problem is that the pencils are a bit too soft so it becomes a problem when trying to line the eyelids.</li>
            <li>I was hoping one would be red, but that&#x27;s really my fault for not paying attention.</li>
            <li>they are really soft.</li>
            <li>16 year old granddaughter loves the gift.</li>
            <li>I had a pproblem with my tracking but the seller fixed it all.</li>
            <li>and I found the metallic lavender and light green</li>
            <li>Soooo soft and creamy</li>
            <li>I was surprised by this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Arrived early in the delivery timeframe given.  </li>
            <li>so be sure to do at least one check up every eight or so hours, if you don&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li>They are soft and glide on well.  </li>
            <li>so when I purchased these I assumed they would be very smudgy but actually aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My 20 year old daughter loves experimenting with all the colors.</li>
            <li>However, ALL the colors are very pigmented and go on well with only 1-3 strokes depending on the thickness of the line you want..</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t say on even with primer, I&#x27;m going to try to set them next time</li>
            <li>The only thing is, the silver pencil doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I am a professional visagist</li>
            <li>But as far as the eyeliners go</li>
            <li>They are too soft.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that I wish each pencil came with it&#x27;s own smudger.  </li>
            <li>For the price they were so worth it even if the gold wasn&#x27;t as expected.</li>
            <li>but most of the colors I received were variation of blue and green.</li>
            <li>I also use them as eye shadows sometimes because the colors are cute and a thick coat.</li>
            <li>I got a few duplicates in colors that I wouldn&#x27;t use and was missing the silver (which I would have loved).</li>
            <li>I thought these would not be good for the money that I paid for, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li>Who ever said affordable makeup doesn&#x27;t work as good as expensive makeup hasn&#x27;t tried these eyeliners..</li>
            <li>They were good and met my expectations, but not great!</li>
            <li>The only negative I should say is that when u first put it on it can easily rub off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says they however don&#x27;t seem to be super long lasting, but the price makes up for it.</li>
            <li>I keep them upside down in a low jar so I can see the colors easily.</li>
            <li>and they go on smoothly since i&#x27;m an older lady its hard to find pencils that don&#x27;t tug your eyelids and these didn&#x27;t tug or burn my eyes.</li>
            <li>I thought they were going to be super waxie &amp; not worth it at all</li>
            <li>So many colors, and for such little money!</li>
            <li>You can also blend the lighter color directly under the dark all the way across the bottom, or use a light eyeshadow to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant enough to make me</li>
            <li>The colors in this variety pack are not only vibrant, but enduring.  </li>
            <li>They last a decent amount of time too.</li>
            <li>I wanted the EXACT colors of the 12 pencils shown in the pictures,otherwise I would have chosen a different listing of Italia eyeliners from the several on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Decided to order a set for a friend, no black.</li>
            <li>They are not very good quality and they break so beyond easy.</li>
            <li>high quality, especially considering that each eyeliner is aprox.</li>
            <li>Totally high pigmented and color that pops on alabaster white skin...</li>
            <li>I am a retired aesthetician and use to by and use only high end products.</li>
            <li>the pigment is great lasts for quite a long time and comes off with a small damp towel or a little bit of lotion.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, I am just bad at applying makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad to because the colors are beautiful but they need to fix the staying power.  </li>
            <li>These pencils are long rather than the midget sized you might pay a whole lot for in brand names.</li>
            <li>I accidentally marked my hand with it (the neon green if you&#x27;re curious) and was able to immediately wipe it off.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to purchase because normally one eyeliner is 7 bucks, but I was getting 12 for the same price!</li>
            <li>Instead of sending these exact colors to me that are pictured, this seller pulled a bait &amp; switch without warning or consultation of any substitutions and sent BLACK,TEAL,WHITE &amp; another PINK</li>
            <li>They are VERY highly pigmented and stay in place for a very long time.</li>
            <li>At first I was a bit skeptical on the quality of these since they were so cheap, but when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The colors I got in my pack are:  Royal blue, Neon blue,  Avocado, Neon green,  Pearl pink, Lilac, Lavender,  Light and Dark brown (which look the same, more on the light side),  Silver,  Gold,  and Black.    </li>
            <li>As a teen, she loves to try out new looks and experiment with makeup.</li>
            <li>so much I bought an extra set of white too.  </li>
            <li>the only complaint was that she wish it had more colors to choose from so</li>
            <li>Then use a fun - lighter color that matches your outfit (or eye shadow) half way from the inside out.</li>
            <li>:) they last much longer than other eyeliner I have used in the past</li>
            <li>that when I first got them and was swatching them all on my hand, I broke the points off a few because I pressed too hard :)  </li>
            <li>(remember I haven&#x27;t tried other higher end makeup.)</li>
            <li>from~~just as I avoided the OTHER 2 sellers that stated up-front in their listings the exact colors that will be switched out if one orders from them.</li>
            <li>i cant really say anything horrible about this item i love it!!!</li>
            <li>I was originally only looking for a black pencil for daily wear and found this set; it is cheap</li>
            <li>I got a nice variety of colors, including white, black, and a few metallic ones.</li>
            <li>My only tiny gripe is that the caps on mine tended to come off rather easily which lead to some messy moments in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, certainly, but it is money well spent.</li>
            <li>them on, they are not creamy, they are dry, and smudge within a few hours....if you are looking for waterproof or smudgeproof, do NOT by these, the colors are nice, but do not stay on long enough.</li>
            <li>Does smudge a little, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I purchased these to have a little fun with my eyes.</li>
            <li>the colors are very vibrant, however I noticed they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li>They are the hard eyeliner that do not go on smooth at all</li>
            <li>The black liner is nice, but the other colors do not really show.</li>
            <li>Too bad my all my make up got stolen lol</li>
            <li>The pencils themselves are really amazing quality, these feel expensive and the caps that come on them aid with that affects.</li>
            <li>They are soft enough for me to use them as eyeliners, lip liners, and shadows.</li>
            <li>I barely ever use eye liner bc</li>
            <li>It clumps if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>The only thing I will say is that if you have sensitive eyes like myself, eyes that water throughout the day, you should know that these eyeliners do run a bit</li>
            <li>Will re order in near future!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes and these liners</li>
            <li>These were bought as a Christmas present for a young girl to practice with.  </li>
            <li>These are soft enough that I can use them to draw a design on my daughters faces</li>
            <li>Blue is my favorite color , it was at least 3-4 different blues included.</li>
            <li>With barely any pressure the pencils draw a line.</li>
            <li>I was really surprised how low maintenance they are .</li>
            <li>This set of pencils surprised me big time.</li>
            <li>The lip liner is this red toned hot pink that glides on.</li>
            <li>Nothing is more frustrating than when your items arrive damaged.</li>
            <li>They go on thick and slide smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Like the colors although most that we received were dark or not an everyday color you would wear.</li>
            <li>Thick, smooth colors with staying power and lots of options.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented, just doesn&#x27;t have long staying power!</li>
            <li>Those colors are rosa, black, white, violet, royal blue, neon blue and light brown.</li>
            <li>so you have more control, less waste and</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they do have a slight chemical smile that doesn&#x27;t bother me I tried them on my arm for a day to see if I would breakout before I used them.</li>
            <li>The only gripe I had was that they wiped off fairly quickly (like after a few rubs)</li>
            <li>I love the colors I hate that they run and smug easily</li>
            <li>these are very smooth and dont have that hard drag alot of pencils have.</li>
            <li>They have a slight, funny smell but is not over powering.</li>
            <li>and there was NO MENTION of any possible substitutions in their listing as there was in TWO OTHER sellers descriptions that stated up-front the exact colors they will be switching out if you purchase from them.</li>
            <li>For the low cost I expected they would dry out quickly - but they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I generally find that buying a bunch of colors in a cluster - especially for a low price - is usually a recipe for disaster, with the products ending up being cheap and unusable.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and they will last me a long time because the length of the pencils are alot longer than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li>they are so vibrant and they last a really long time also.</li>
            <li>Other than that I really hope my review helped some of you.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not exactly water proof, but are very smudge and water resistant.</li>
            <li>I also already have plenty of shades white (and nude/beige) eyeliners and of pink LIP liners and had I wanted more, then I would have chosen to purchase from my usual trusted brands for those,too.  </li>
            <li>Set the eyeliner with a little eyeshadow of similar color and then push a little MUFE or ELF HD powder right onto the eyeliner, dust a little over your lids and under your eyes and they will stay put much better.</li>
            <li>I ended up with 3 blues and 2 purples which are not colors I use, but the others are much more neutral (black, brown, tan, copper, silver, white, green, etc.)</li>
            <li>It comes for a long time as these pencils are really long and the color selection is really wearable.</li>
            <li>I have had much more expensive eyeliners that were no where near the quality.</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and came exactly as expected.</li>
            <li>Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get white, but I did get a nice array of colors.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is, like others said, these smudge very easily which is good for blending but annoying for me when I just want to wear it as eyeliner.</li>
            <li>The colors are royal blue, electric blue, chocolate, green, purple, black, white, lavender, gold (more of a bronze), sky blue, hot pink, and silver.</li>
            <li>whether you have oily skin or not(: (I do happen to have oily skin and was still very pleased with the product!)</li>
            <li>While the price is great, I was disappointed that I did not get the colors as pictured.</li>
            <li>The color on the pencils show up very well on dark skin.</li>
            <li>I really Like the Italia Eyeliners Set of 12.The colors work on Dark tone Skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I do not like is that they are too soft and go flat after one use before I have to sharpen them again</li>
            <li>No pink, lavender, purple or sky blue.</li>
            <li>The set is as described and the colors are vivid And long lasting.</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with colored eyeliner for a small price, these are definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li>They are fun to blend and a few colors work well as a lip liner too!</li>
            <li>They were not expensive so even if a few were blah</li>
            <li>I got a few chrome-y sparkly colors: gold, satin blue, sky teal (more blue than green, close to turqoiuse), and lavender.</li>
            <li>I read some of the previous reviews and was very unsure about them...</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s the gold, light purple, and dark green that are shimmery.</li>
            <li>The black one is SUPER smudgy, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with the other colors.</li>
            <li>There not long lasting or smudge</li>
            <li>The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that they do smudge (\\&quot;traveled\\&quot; to the upper parts of my eyelids after a few hours of wear) and you should probably use a primer first.    </li>
            <li>but I did not get the exact product as mentioned but a different brand with a few different colors.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come on too light or too thick!  </li>
            <li>Some of the pencils are soft like the black, others - not so soft.</li>
            <li>It advertises as a set of 12 metallic colors, but only about half of them were really metallic.</li>
            <li>The seller was very informative after placing my order with my email confirmation, to notify me that the darker shade of blue was replaced by black.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that I thought I could go my whole life with only black eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Not hard or rough on the eyes at all!  </li>
            <li>(its the pink one) liners come in bubble rap and an extra clear plastic lining inside !</li>
            <li>Now that I know the hairdryer trick on 2 second warmup to make them not so pointy hard the first time I use them, I&#x27;m even happier!</li>
            <li>Colors are a little too dull for what I wanted but they are still cute</li>
            <li>oh gurl, the inside is where these little beauty really shine.</li>
            <li>They do smudge a little if you want a smokey eye, but stayed put through the whole day of wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Upon swatching I found that the metallic colors (green, dark and light purple, blue,  green, brown, copper toned gold) were still creamy enough but not as much as the solid colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of this brand before prior to purchase, and I was a tiny bit skeptical, but these eyeliners are very smooth and creamy.</li>

            <li> Very easy to apply.</li>

            <li> Glides on very easily.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see the color very strong around the eye....</li>
            <li> could not be more in love with these!</li>
            <li> I used them on my water line and they were pretty good!</li>
            <li> I am so proud of my new liner collection I have shown it off to four separate people and now they ALL want a set of their own!</li>

            <li> I wanted pencils that are soft and I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> These are, by far, the BEST eyeliners.  </li>
            <li> Very much worth the price, would recommend--these would also make a great gift for the makeup daredevil or makeup junkie in your life.</li>
            <li> These eye liners are by far the best quality.lasts</li>
            <li> I have to say I am impressed with the product this far.</li>
            <li> Even so, after more use, I noticed that the colours also fade sooner than liked, and you may have to apply it 2 or 3 times a day if you intend to have it all day.</li>
            <li> They also work fabulous for face painting (I do a lot of bright DAVID BOWIE things to my face).</li>
            <li> I would have liked them better if the pencils were fatter and smoother to use in</li>
            <li> They are brightly colored and glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> though this product need sharpening when you use it for a certain amount of time, it looks good!</li>
            <li> A good assortment of colors for the price, but they do wear off kind of quick, so bring it with you to freshen up.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this purchase, easy buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna buy more for sure! :)</li>

            <li> I went through a full work day not checking and when my boyfriend picked me up, he laughed his head off.</li>
            <li> (of course, I&#x27;m right-handed), but I&#x27;m able to use these liners easily with my non-dominant hand!</li>
            <li> and I have to say: luckily I did!!</li>
            <li> Very smooth</li>
            <li> The colors are well pigmented and go on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Very smooth.</li>
            <li> They go on very smoothly</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly...</li>
            <li> The pencil glides on very smoothly and has a silky texture.</li>
            <li> Go on and blend VERY smoothly.</li>
            <li> They are very smooth and offer a variety of colors which I like to use on my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> Very smooth eyeliner.</li>
            <li> These pencils are very smooth, no tugging against your eyes at all.</li>
            <li> and I did a quick line on my arms of all the colors and am amazed at how bright they are.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and package was also good, but one markdown is that one eyeliner had a crack.</li>
            <li> None of the colors I had found were what I wanted, and I&#x27;m super picky color wise.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, stay on easy application.</li>
            <li> They are creamy, which is generally nice, but they do smudge easily.</li>
            <li> They came in a nice plastic bag that is easy to carry around in my bag.</li>
            <li> Nice color selection and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and in good condition.</li>
            <li> the colors smudge easily &amp; kind of break at the tip but for what i paid they were pretty good</li>
            <li> Nice colors, but they run easy.  </li>
            <li> They glide on easy with nice color pigmentation.</li>
            <li> pretty colors and very nice</li>
            <li> very good product, the crayon pencil is a creamy, intense color, is easy to wash no water resistant.</li>
            <li> (I lined and filled with these liners, eyeliner is perfectly safe for lips!)</li>
            <li> I love these pencils, the colors are bright and bold.</li>
            <li> Great quality &amp; glides on smooth &amp; bold.</li>
            <li> This item came super fast which is awesome.</li>

            <li> very smooth and creamy... love all the colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like and doesn&#x27;t glide on very smoothly, but it&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>

            <li> beautiful vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> they were very reasonably priced!!!</li>
            <li> It is a regular stick eyeliner that applies very smoothly but can spread throughout the day, best to use primer or finisher.</li>
            <li> They are very bright, soft and they do smudge.</li>
            <li> these are amazing bright colors, the colors really show on the eyes</li>

            <li> I would recommend, just with more of a caution.</li>
            <li> I just got these in the mail today and immediately placed an order for more.</li>
            <li> Primer potion and setting powder should be able to fix that, but they don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t have oily eyelids, either.</li>
            <li> The thing that gets me the most though--</li>
            <li> Drugstore brands are creamier, scentless, and stay on better.</li>

            <li> Hi I have received this beautiful pencils and it&#x27;s very pigmented and shipping is very fast.im basically from India</li>
            <li> just fine..</li>
            <li> They go on super nice and smooth and are super pigmented, there&#x27;s one downside though.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous when I bought this eyeliner because I thought it might be cheap quality and smudge easily.</li>
            <li> These are Ultra Fine.</li>
            <li> But for face coloring for a Halloween style, it works just fine.</li>
            <li> They are easy to apply and they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> SUPER pigmented!</li>

            <li> They came quickly and I love them.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised how good these pencils were.</li>
            <li> these are great colors and are going to look amazing under my sparkely glitter eyeliners, these colors are really going to pop under the barely tinted glittery liquid liner.</li>
            <li> However, the colors are not as vivid and bright</li>
            <li> They do not glide on as easily but the color payoff and the lasting power is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are also easy to apply and the color comes out clean and easy.</li>
            <li> Super smooth, many colors, wear all day - 10hrs +</li>
            <li> I loved how bold the colors are, and really for the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> i will admit that i was sceptical at first because i never heard of the brand, but the quality is amazing, and the colors are so rich.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much because they were so cheap in price, but they came in and I love them!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are amazing and the colors are very vibrant.</li>
            <li> These are very pretty!  </li>

            <li> It took a little over a week for it to be delivered and they were packaged perfectly.</li>

            <li> Great color choices and pretty decent pigmentation and application.</li>
            <li> The set was reasonably priced, the colors are vibrant and beautiful .</li>

            <li> Love all the different, bright colors.</li>
            <li> Except for the light purple and the light brown they were too light.</li>
            <li> it went on smooth and even...</li>
            <li> It was a cheap way to use colors I hadn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> The colors are creamy and glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smooth application.</li>
            <li> Applies on smoothly.</li>
            <li> They are great colors but they are too runny and they are being left at room temp.</li>
            <li> they are so smooth to put on and they irritate at all</li>
            <li> they glide on your eyelid smoothly and have a creamy quality.  </li>

            <li> It is very worth the price</li>

            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are more intense than others - I find the lavender and gold, for example, a little light, but they all go on smoothly and most of them have very good color.</li>
            <li> (they are super light weight and applied easily) for safety purposes-no marking on the of what they are made of.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchase and pretty quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Goes on eyes pretty easily, but since it goes on easily, it also smudges easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using make-up, so I don&#x27;t have any experience to compare these against, but the colors are nice and bright and lasted most of my shift (8 hours) in a fairly physical job, so they get a thumbs up from me!</li>

            <li> I would suggest this for any model who may need the bold colors.</li>
            <li> although I&#x27;m sure young girls would enjoy using them.</li>
            <li> however they are so greasy that they run off quickly.  </li>
            <li> Theses things are great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the white on my waterline and it goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;For lining my eyes, they work great, really pigmented and creamy.</li>
            <li> They came before expected with a sharpener, they go on smooth, and are surprisingly pigmented.</li>
            <li> These liners are vibrant and glide on so easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> colors are more vibrant than others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> They do wear off after several hours and can smudge -- but I don&#x27;t think any more than most drug-store brands costing $5-$10 each, and even some premium brands that cost $20.</li>
            <li> Older wrinkly lids love the  ease of application.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but they aren&#x27;t as vibrant as it shows in the picture.</li>
            <li> so they last quality is great colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li> When I came across the colors of the liners I was happy cause I was looking for all the bright liners, but when I received them they were all the wrong colors that were not pictured In the add.</li>
            <li> the colors are great and last a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> The white is great for opening the eyes but seems to fade fast.</li>
            <li> They are super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Every colour just glides on and is so bold..</li>
            <li> A quick run along your lashes with one of the brighter colors and a coat of mascara and Viola</li>

            <li> The price makes it worth it though.  </li>
            <li> So worth for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;So worth it</li>
            <li> well worth my money would buy again</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Fun to play with for a pop of color or drama.</li>
            <li> the colors make make up fun</li>
            <li> but nothing worth complainning about.</li>
            <li> These are so worth the money, even if you throw out 3 or 4 you&#x27;ll never wear.</li>
            <li> If you into lipsticks, you must have some lip pencils and these are worth the buy</li>
            <li> And WELL worth it.</li>
            <li> Colors as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged in a clear top box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> took a while to get here ,but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li> The liner also blends quite nicely if wanted, I actually used two colors on my eyes and blended.</li>
            <li> Personally, I find the sparkle nice and not too over the top.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I noticed was that they do glide on nicely, however, they smear a lot.</li>
            <li> useful like eyeshadows and lipsticks...</li>
            <li> I  liked the eyeliners would like it if they were longer lasting...</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> I can buy more of it and really don&#x27;t lose too much quality.</li>
            <li> (I have had allergic reactions to some eyeliners but no swelling or burning with this product so far ) :)</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t get smudged though they seem to last all day nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for 3 stars is the color selection.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to get more of an experimental rainbow set with reds, yellows, and oranges...</li>
            <li> The colors are assorted so its kinda fun to see what you will get.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am just more sensitive to things on my eyes, but</li>
            <li> I rarely rate any product five stars</li>
            <li> Just used a bit but for the price i guess is worth it..</li>
            <li> They took a while to be delivered but they were worth the wait.</li>
            <li> These are so worth the price.</li>
            <li> it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li> Gold and White were good modern choices.  </li>
            <li> As far as eyeliners go, this is one of the better sets I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> The colors are bold and vibrant and they go on so smooth.</li>
            <li> They stay on for hours and hours and rarely any smearing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth the price just to have the lighter colors to experiment with</li>
            <li> fun</li>
            <li> well I just wish some of the colors were more soft and easier to put on</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth buying...</li>
            <li> She was thrilled and said she&#x27;d heard of them but never actually bought herself any.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun matching my outfits with my liner.</li>
            <li> so easy to apply and very vivid colors.  </li>
            <li> they glide on super smooth and are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright very pretty applies and removes easily I highly recommend this eyeliner set and will definitely purchase again!!</li>
            <li> Then the rest are bold and bright colors like hot pink and teal.</li>
            <li> Very quality and very colorful.</li>
            <li> Tips not soft nor easy to put on , more like colored pencils than make up.</li>
            <li> unlike other pencils , ..&lt;br /&gt;super happy &amp; they stay for longer than expected on eyes, .It does smudge but otherwise stay nice .</li>
            <li> If you love bright eye make up and fun colors, you should seriously invest in these.  </li>
            <li> The color is rich and concentrated, and the texture is smooth and creamy (but not TOO soft).</li>
            <li> I got all the colors shown but no black which I&#x27;m ok with.</li>
            <li> The product came super quick and I would definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li> Pros: easy and smooth application, highly pigmented, great color variety, long lasting wear,&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Try to go with a seller that have high ratings (recently) and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I was</li>
            <li> , those colors in any other eyeliner I have ever tried have always shown up well and looked good on me.</li>
            <li> And the price was right.</li>
            <li> Glides right on.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t answer these questions right now.</li>
            <li> I do notice they can tend to smear right after application sometimes, though.</li>
            <li> the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The price right.</li>
            <li> they just glide right on like butter in a stick.</li>
            <li> I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in a sling for 5 weeks after right rotator cuff surgery</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my new eyelinets!</li>
            <li> But I still really enjoy them, and they are decent quality.</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented, they apply easily  and they are longer lasting than most bargain eyeliners that i have come across.</li>
            <li> they glide on smooth and are vibrant colors..</li>
            <li> These liners glide on smoothly, the color is vibrant and they stay in place (with primer or powder).</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and they go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> but they are decent and go on smooth.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re vibrant with smooth and silky application that lasts for awhile.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner goes on smooth and the color is vibrant.</li>
            <li> I love these as they are soft and easy to use on the sensitive eye lids and under the bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the false eyelashes, and they are wonderful and fast delivery as well!  </li>
            <li> Very soft and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Very easy and creamy but stern enough to get the job done!!</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smudges very easily.</li>
            <li> Several colors, goes on very easily.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vivid and they go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> WHen I do wear the makeup it goes on smooth and bold, lasts a long while, sometimes even to the next day when the faded look is more appealing.</li>
            <li> they are highly pigmented and goes on in smooth, sleek strokes.  </li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented, glide smoothly without clumps, smearing or dryness.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth they go on and how long it stays on!</li>
            <li> They do not fade quickly, they are high quality and worth far more than the price on amazon.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really need to buy a special sharpener for it.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and very useful.</li>
            <li> Breaks off easily, and overall cheap quality.</li>
            <li> They work as lip liners too which is awesome, but the only reason I took a star off, was for the Black liner which is what i bought the set for.</li>
            <li> I actually get a better smoky look with super creamy pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are super creamy and the colors are really bold and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the most girly girl &amp; do bare minimum makeup for work.</li>
            <li> use them everyday great deal only wish I had more colors to choose from</li>
            <li> The dark purple and teal though are gorgeous though.</li>
            <li> these are great for a fun &amp; playful pop of color and the price point is really low so that it&#x27;s no big loss if you don&#x27;t like them or won&#x27;t use them very much.</li>
            <li> the colors glide on very vibrant!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t quite fine enough a tip for a crisp eyeliner, and almost too fine a tip for an eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> It comes out very vibrantly and it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li> theyre super vibrant and smooooooth!</li>
            <li> Vibrant, rich colours.</li>
            <li> I received the exact same colors above, and they are smooth and bright.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very pretty and glides on easily, however the metallic colors (like the shimmery copper) barely show up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> most of the &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; type of eyeliners seem to be too hard the effectively transfer to the eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Because of their creaminess these eyeliners do need frequent sharpener in order o retain clean lines, but I didn&#x27;t really see that a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> These liners were too colorful for my taste, but would probably be okay for someone younger.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, very creamy &amp; easy to put on..</li>
            <li> My skin is naturally oily, and makeup easily smears, but these don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> You can have fun with so many different looks.</li>
            <li> I did not get white, but I&#x27;m happy that I got 3 different pinks.</li>
            <li> They are soft and glide on easily to the eyelid.</li>
            <li> They go on easily and really are creamy and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> I was actually surprised how easy they were to apply to my eyelid.</li>
            <li> My pencils are soft and glide easy.</li>
            <li> but they are good for a slight under eyes glow</li>
            <li> Wd gladly pay double if colors were all cosmetically useful.  </li>
            <li> Black, charcoal, browns all good too.  </li>
            <li> Good eyeliners, and as an Italian I was pleasantly surprised by the non greasy and hairness of the set.  </li>
            <li> I also received super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve initially found this brand in Mexico and I was extra happy to have seen it for sale on here.</li>
            <li> They are soft and glide on easily to the eyelid.</li>
            <li> Works well, arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and evenly, and is very soft</li>
            <li> I am always having a problem finding an eye pencil that is both vivid and smooth,  and have gotten to the point I have refused to even put eye liner</li>
            <li> I first used them as a regular eyeliner (above the eye) but it didn&#x27;t work out so great</li>
            <li> All of the other ones have incredible pigment (even the black one which I find to be rare) and they glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Not very easy to apply and colors rub off eaeasily, but really pretty and good for the price.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, glides on pretty easily and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> Does not last in the water line but very smooth and creamy for longer staying power set with eyeshadow</li>
            <li> They also sharpen very, very well.</li>
            <li> so I got these They go on very smooth and last.</li>
            <li> Love love love the colors they go on soft and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Love them I used them all the time I only wished I brought them in only light brown and dark brown there great for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also quite large, so for the price, these eyeliners are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> which is fine with me, i had no expectation as far as what colors to expect i was just excited about trying something new.</li>
            <li> then used the pencil a bit more on top of shadow and blended a little!</li>
            <li> I would, however, not use these pencils if you are very sensitive about strong smells, as the whole time I was putting it on</li>
            <li> white - just a pure white (these are great for making eyes look</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Mighty Gadget(USA Merchant)\\&quot; based on the positive reviews of these eyeliners and because I wanted to try pastel &amp; vivid eyeliner colors from a \\&quot;new\\&quot; brand that I&#x27;ve never tried before for this Spring-Summer.</li>
            <li> pretty colors durable as well</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than the urban decay eyeliner</li>
            <li> I put up a picture with all the colors I received, one picture in natural light and one with the flash</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy from this seller again.. :-)</li>
            <li> i love experimenting with all of the different colors.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  </li>

            <li> They are exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> so beware, you will not receive the exact color they display here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the colors, just wish they had white.</li>
            <li> Colors are pigmented and will go on even more pigmented if white liner is used first.</li>
            <li> They came in on time and are really pigmented!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s a set of so many different colors.</li>
            <li> Nice set of eyeliners, came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> First day wearing it, I wore my glasses just in case.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to fall in love with them especially if you have tried a lot of the cheaper brands out there.</li>
            <li> So its pretty creamy.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but the quality just isn&#x27;t there for me.</li>
            <li> they have okay lasting power on</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying make up on Amazon</li>
            <li> I will absolutely order again!</li>
            <li> The colors are all pretty and show on my skin.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to create different looks with them, I know for sure</li>
            <li> The pencils are all very well pigmented!</li>
            <li> I cannot stress this enough though, make sure that if you buy this, you plan on checking your makeup every now and again.</li>
            <li> My eyelids are really sensitive to both pressure and ingredients, and they really enjoy these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> and I love that this comes with 3 different purple options!</li>
            <li> It goes on very well!</li>
            <li> &amp; have found myself using most of them on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> First off, I did receive all the colors pictured.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors</li>
            <li> At such a low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but these are great.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon and thank you too reviewers!  </li>
            <li> - she was glad that there was a White eyeliner in the packet!</li>
            <li> Love the different colors that come with.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> I got the exact colors that were advertized.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sure i would come back to buy this item</li>
            <li> However the colors do match the color indication on the end of the pencil pretty well.</li>
            <li> Get them ;)</li>
            <li> u to me&amp;#34; :)Totally recommend !</li>
            <li> No constantly wetting every time I needed to apply another line :)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> would definitely buy more of these even before I run out</li>
            <li> and I actually like these better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My expectations were higher.</li>
            <li> These are pretty low-end.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future !!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors (white is not in the kit).  </li>
            <li> I received them in a timely manner and got exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> so it ends up looking a bit clowny ;)</li>
            <li> I use the white and purple the most.</li>
            <li> most likely order again.</li>
            <li> but at first i was iffy about them</li>
            <li> :) they do last all day on my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> I love them, and the actual makeup is scentless...</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering some more for my collection.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that had a pop of color, and these beauties were exactly what I was looking for.....intense color, ease application, and very pigmented!  </li>
            <li> i got all the exact colors as shown.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> but ok is not really enough for me</li>
            <li> The colors are all fairly simple and enjoyable and I haven&#x27;t seen any that make me think &amp;#34;God</li>
            <li> Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> Love the Blue &amp; Silver</li>
            <li> are only 4 dollars for 12 but that steal just makes them better</li>
            <li> I have really watery eyes when I yawn or laugh..</li>
            <li> Love this set a bunch of different colors.</li>
            <li> No rashes or breakouts and no weird smells.</li>
            <li> addressed on exact time .</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty smudge-prone, but I guess that could just be me being spoiled by gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, especially for my summer wardrobe.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought these mostly for the white, and the brown.  </li>
            <li> This is a fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> many colors that you can make yourself look 80&#x27;s to present day!</li>
            <li> I love the different colors that were included in the packet.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, they were exactly what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> was really hoping for those colors too...!</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more of these in the future.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, it is the best.</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t say that I purchased this because my mom bought them for me on her account.</li>
            <li> :) I got every eyeliner showed above.</li>
            <li> so pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smudges first</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying these!!</li>
            <li> All day pretty</li>
            <li> Have the make up remover ready!  </li>
            <li> so make sure to apply a solid coat</li>
            <li> Just wonder exactly what is in them though.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of shimmery eyeliners but I love the shimmer ones in this set.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and i have one for</li>
            <li> pencil color is exactly as the end color tip.</li>
            <li> I love the colors I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I Love all the different colors in this set.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> which is a first</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are great, very soft and vibrant, but I expected to receive the colors shown in the picture</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something subtle, this isn&#x27;t really the pack you want, but if you want an extreme look, this is a great deal for good pencils.</li>
            <li> The liner applies very well, it doesn&#x27;t skip across the fine wrinkles in eyelids as mush as most other liners I have used.</li>
            <li> They smudge and are deff not lasting, the black and brown work better but it was so cheap I wanted to try it, u need to re touch it for sure, pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I have fun playing around with these, trying new colorful eye looks.</li>
            <li> The colours are great, but unfortunately it smears quite easily.</li>
            <li> And every girl needs a black liner, so I was happy the seller set my expectations instead of being surprised when package arrived.</li>
            <li> I own Urban Decay and many other Sephora favorites</li>
            <li> The colors are quality, they last a long time, and its fantastic to have so many choices to change your look!</li>
            <li> For the money these are amazing goes on smooth and very vibrant - set with same color eye shadow and it will last</li>
            <li> so well I had to try it on a friend sitting with me (she has very, very black skin) and the colours all look gorgeous on both of us.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to take of and if your a person like me that can&#x27;t get the right design you could keep on starting over</li>
            <li> The pink eyeliner isn&#x27;t as bright as it looks on the bottom of the pencil, but that is the only one that doesn&#x27;t look true to shade.</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these, and they came a week early or so.</li>
            <li> Some colors are not my taste but other are really nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Super excited to start using them, was surprised they were so pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that they work really nice.</li>
            <li> I use to buy Hard Candy eyeliners, cause they&#x27;re nice and smooth, or I&#x27;d use a gel liner.</li>
            <li> the application is very smooth and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> All the quality for a low price...definitely worth it!!  </li>
            <li> very pigmented, last very long great value too</li>
            <li> But seriously, they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> The white is bright white</li>
            <li> Very vibrant and pretty colors.</li>
            <li> Would have like to be able to pick colors since I really wanted red eyeliner</li>
            <li> They are just as good as my Sephora colored liners that are so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants more colored eyeliners in their collection.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am ready to head to Italy now that I have such lovely eyeliner to use.  </li>
            <li> They are very soft, blendable, and super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Some are just fine in depth of color and glide on easily and others (about 1/2) are harder to apply because the color is too light to actually show up as an eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received all the colors shown very fast and they&#x27;re very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy these when I run out, which won&#x27;t be very long :P</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but dry &amp; does not go on smoothly !</li>
            <li> But on the positive side given the price, I think they are a deal....</li>
            <li> Navy, Olive and Maroon or Rose wd be better color choices than sky blue and grass green, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> my only caveat was one of the eyeliners was damage it look as if it was burn other then that great buy</li>
            <li> The price was pretty much what one &#x27;name-brand&#x27; pencil would have cost, but I couldn&#x27;t even find the shade I needed in their lines.  </li>
            <li> Really like these colors, but the electric blue is a bit much for me, the rest are lovely colors though.</li>
            <li> They are soft and worth every penny :) technically there are 11 Eye pencils and one lip pencil</li>
            <li> but they came in pretty fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> i will be reordering soon, i go through makeup pretty fast.</li>
            <li> They stayed on all day and pretty much all night.</li>
            <li> The only reason I like them instead of love them is because I don&#x27;t really wear too much make up as it is</li>
            <li> I bought these because most of the colors pictured were bright but the majority of them I got were dark and included black which I did not want.</li>
            <li> Love them they go on easy and last a long time</li>
            <li> There is a nice range, and the colors are average enough that I think are easily wearable on any day.</li>
            <li> this kit has just the right colors that I like to wear but wish blk could have been included with the kit other than that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> i love them all well most of the like only one of the colors did not work for me but other</li>
            <li> there is def a smell to them but it doesnt smell bad, kinda sweet.. very happy with product</li>
            <li> Easy to use this is my second batch of pencils.</li>
            <li> : easily smudged, color transfer to upper part of eyelid</li>
            <li> and while they looked as bright, they did not last as long.</li>
            <li> I saw a couple reviews complaining that white it not in it, and no, it is not, this is silver, I knew that, but can easily understand the confusion.</li>
            <li> I received more blues than expected and none of the colors were exactly like the picture, the orange wasn&#x27;t there either.</li>
            <li> I was super surprised that it didnt rub off.</li>
            <li> The only problems I have had with this product is that it breaks and smears easily.</li>
            <li> My only con is it smudges easily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably mix most of these colors with a black eyeliner because the colors are so vibrant and out of the norm, but they really are nice overall.</li>
            <li> They are good and last long</li>
            <li> they came in good condition and the colors are really pretty they&#x27;re thick too</li>
            <li> I love every single one of the colors.</li>
            <li> Large pencils.</li>
            <li> I was able to get the cool gold color, white, and black - which I consider to be kind of essential for any eyeliner 12 pack -</li>
            <li> These pencils have bautiful colors and are soft and easy to apply, not like most cheap pencils which are very hard.</li>
            <li> they are soft and easy to apply, they last a long time and are very easy to store and travel with.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive the white one, but thats fine.</li>
            <li> and they are pigment the packing was very decent and shipping was fast always on time</li>
            <li> The description says 12 metallic eyeliners but only 5 of the 12 are metallic, which is fine with me.</li>
            <li> but the colors are so vibrant and opaque..very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are creamy/soft and really vibrant and pretty.</li>
            <li> However make sure you decide your shade for the day and be sure of it - very hard to wash off as it smudges and smears all over your face.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that because of my Indian skin color, some of the more glittery liners do not show up as vibrant as the normal ones.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone who wants some vibrant eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> but they are a little light kind of creamy,  but I will use them daily and recommend them highly!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting much in way of pigment or texture since they were so cheap, but they are extremely pigmented and they go on super creamy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend them, especially considering the amazing price.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> I really like this set of eye liner pencils.  </li>
            <li> I hope these continue to be made available, as I would definitely buy them again.    </li>
            <li> They are ALL very pigmented and soft.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I feel very girl needs these</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very matte</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really had any issues with smudging.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this product to any makeup aficionado.</li>
            <li> It came packaged very well and everything was intact.</li>
            <li> The colors of these liners really POP...</li>
            <li> There is no difference in quality between the colors and they are all very creamy and pigmented.  </li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t have any problems.  </li>
            <li> Very pigmented and creamy, but some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t show up as well.</li>
            <li> they stay on really well</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are creamy and work very well.</li>
            <li> and they came in fast, got every color as shown in picture .</li>
            <li> I really do like it.</li>
            <li> They go on smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li> They are very creamy and very pigmented</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. .</li>
            <li> I love the shimmery pink and blue/green colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a fantastic buy</li>
            <li> I guess this can be remedied with getting cheap individual eyeliner brushes for each color</li>
            <li> Very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li> dont smudge that much.</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> Shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> fast delivery...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like mascara much</li>
            <li> Very creamy and blendable</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I really do like them.</li>
            <li> My package very closely resembles the picture shown.</li>
            <li> I really recomended them.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what eye liners I use because most of them irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have never had eyeliner run so much.</li>
            <li> so b gentle.</li>
            <li> (: I use them very often.</li>
            <li> was a very convienet  package</li>
            <li> Plus the colors are also very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly even with the reviews I was not expecting much.  </li>
            <li> I really liek this, it does smudge a bit, but</li>
            <li> I also recieved them sooo fast</li>
            <li> Be careful about how much pressure you use or you&#x27;ll find yourself with a much thicker like than you want and be sure to let it set or use a powder to set it.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> The metallic colors I received are actually metallic, and reflect light like they should.</li>
            <li> These are better than i expected.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smudge as much as my Maybeline does.</li>
            <li> Not the whole time.</li>
            <li> So it really doesnt bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Colors are very visible.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> I am very picky when it comes to make up.</li>
            <li> (they don&#x27;t really show up...)  </li>
            <li> I got a white, which is important to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very creamy, but hold well with a powder eyeshadow applied over.</li>
            <li> and I have really oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> It seems they are much easier to &amp;#34;play with&amp;#34; and apply than others.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this.  </li>
            <li> It absolutely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, can&#x27;t beat them for the price.  </li>

            <li> The colors are REALLY pigmented &amp; stay on my waterline all day.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> I would have paid this price for just 2 of these colors and got the whole rainbow instead.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast though.</li>
            <li> They are very creamy</li>
            <li> I like all the colors that came but there aren&#x27;t any pinks or oranges or well, light colors aside from white and gold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They also hold rather well ,really have to scrub to get these off</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t notice too much smudging</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast and arrived a day before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it and she really likes them.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li> and they really should</li>
            <li> You dont need much to make the color pop.</li>
            <li> I was just trying to buy the product, because the price for 12 eyeliners is a real bargain.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> they show up very well.</li>
            <li> I wore the purple to work and within one hour I noticed I had purple &amp;#34;Racoon Eyes&amp;#34; - very embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and blendable.</li>
            <li> I do find I absolutely need primer to keep this in place for an all-day wear but that may just be me and my oily eyelids.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price</li>
            <li> I really like the color selection that they send.</li>
            <li> Soft...much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I love the colors and have used all of the even the pink eyeliner.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re really creamy .</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR READING, BYE👌</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> I really like these products.</li>
            <li> I want to thank you so much</li>
            <li> In my more mature years I keep my make up simple.</li>
            <li> I own brands such as Urban Decay 24/7 and Smashbox Limitless eyeliners</li>
            <li> will purchase more in the near future</li>
            <li> Warm them up by drawing a very short line between the thumb and index finger, or like seen in the pic above.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and if i am feeling lazy i just slide a line of color on my eye lids instead of full eye shadow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the black one at all if I can help it because they smudge very easily.</li>
            <li> I am very very happy since I enjoy using a color liner above my usual black liner..</li>
            <li> dont smudge... and the colors have so far stayed in place all day for me every time !!!</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean off with either plain soap and water, or makeup remover (I use coconut oil btw).</li>
            <li> I got them pretty quick, but it was a week before I finally tried them out.  </li>
            <li> they do not smear easily and they do stay on for a long time</li>
            <li> go on very smooth, and work with any conventional wood sharpener.  </li>
            <li> and they go on very easy with little to no pressure...</li>
            <li> and I am so excited to use these on my next clients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the Silver and Pearl Pink!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors endless options I added swatches of all the colors.</li>
            <li> Overall, worth it!</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised by the quality, as they are very inexpensive.    </li>
            <li> and i probably won&#x27;t use the green, but it&#x27;s worth it because the colors are very creamy and slide on easily.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, soft and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I use urban decay on a day to day basic and, now I catch myself reaching for these more than my expensive high end brand theses are amazing!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a cool makeup trick to make your eyes look bigger/bolder, and this white shows up so much better than the other ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented and very creamy.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see this at such a low price and have such great ratings.</li>
            <li> Love all the options, I wear the blue, green, turquoise, brown, gold, copper and violet most and use the pinks for lips with a natural lip color gloss for blending.</li>
            <li> You can go to the pharmacy and get one decent eyeliner for $10, or you can get these, which is the same (if not better) quality at a cheaper price - and the color range is great, too.  </li>
            <li> but I like them so much that if I have to gift someone I will really buy a new set and give it.</li>
            <li> only the black is good...</li>
            <li> Just make sure that the caps are on well, they can come off easily, and I&#x27;m sure nobody wants dirty eyeliner and/or makeup cases!</li>
            <li> and I am in love with using the darker blue on my outer lower lash line and the forest green in my inner lower lash line, then I just blend(: I definitely recommend these to anyone debating whether or not to buy this amazing product!</li>
            <li> These are terrific quality, vivid colors and go on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> The color of these liners is much more vivid than I expected.</li>
            <li> The pencils are soft enough for easy steady application.</li>
            <li> (Unlike alot of eyelines that usually just rub off on the eye without the shimmer).&lt;br /&gt;The gold pencil kind of smells like bubble</li>
            <li> the wont stab you eye and the can also be used a lip liner because they are so soft the color are pretty</li>
            <li> (I have super small eye lids honestly), but it did last all day.  </li>
            <li> No repeat colours,  no black (got enough of those,  thank you)  just nice pencils that actually stay on for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all the color options and I love that they all show up on my dark brown African American skin!!!!</li>
            <li> smooth silk finish very long</li>
            <li> For less than $8, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> The black and silver are my favorite colors out of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Have paid much more for much less, that ended up in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I just wish this set included orange and silver instead of the violate which it looks more like black.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant, they stay on all day, they do not flake, and they go on without any problems.</li>
            <li> The main reason I ordered this was for the colors not given to me.</li>
            <li> Received this eyeliner set only 2 days after I ordered it...surprised to see it had shipped so quickly.</li>
            <li> I feel like a lot of colored eye liners aren&#x27;t as vibrant against my skin</li>
            <li> They are vibrant and don&#x27;t run or bleed.</li>
            <li> Even now that I&#x27;ve started building a better and more expensive makeup collection, I would still recommend these.</li>
            <li> The only issue is, that i diddnt get the colors in the picture, i diddnt get the white or the orange color, i got mostly greens and purples.</li>
            <li> Such lovely colors and this set will last forever!</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant without being gaudy.</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I got two different browns and a bit more blue</li>
            <li> I was iffy about ordering these because the reviews, I needed a white eye liner but for the price I figured I would order this, if I didn&#x27;t like it I could give it to my step daughter, but I do like it very much!</li>
            <li> Blue - It looks a bit purple just looking at it, but it goes on as a very pretty blue&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Very vivid.</li>
            <li> The colors are very vivid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with all of the colours I received, and yes, they are a little tougher to remove manually than other eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend these, they last very long and you are definitely given more than your moneys worth!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> They are highly pigmented and I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates.  </li>
            <li> These colors are highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> they r highly pigmented</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> At this price point, I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Highly recommended..</li>
            <li> However I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The quality is on the okay side and they do last a long time especially if you use an eyelid primer (I get mine like most of my makeup from Urban Decay.)</li>
            <li> Lasts ok on the lash line, but definitely not for the water line unless you have a super heavy duty sealer.</li>
            <li> They glide on very smooth and are long lasting.</li>
            <li> These go on very smoothly and last a long time without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve like a little more variation.</li>
            <li> I think the packaging should be a little better considering the quality of them but no biggie I guess.</li>
            <li> , they are vivid and noticable and they make my eyes pop!</li>
            <li> Some of the colors fall a little over the day, but using eye shadow over top helps with that.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend them if you&#x27;re looking to expand your collection and get some pretty colors!</li>
            <li> These are phenomenal, but if you sweat a little, it spreads.</li>
            <li> I was seriously not expecting much for the price, but they have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> You know those cheap liners that look vibrant but are actually scratchy and barely leave a trace of color on skin?</li>
            <li> If you are looking for some new eye liner with vibrant color get these.</li>
            <li> all the colors are fun... but at least 3 or 4 are 2 light to be of much use</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a pink, or light purple.</li>
            <li> Great for use on kids or stage plays/costumes where make up should be exaggerated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that there are a few colors in here I will probably never use, but there are so many to choose from, that doesn&#x27;t seem like an issue to me.  </li>
            <li> The white one is my preferred pencil for the inner corners and highlighting directly under the brows (blend well before it dries) because they do not collect/bunch up like many pencils do.</li>
            <li> It comes with lots of different and fun colors.</li>
            <li> I am getting  few more sets for Christmas gifts this year.</li>
            <li> There are many colors and they last a long time.</li>
            <li> The colors are fun, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Normally I get the roll up eyeliners so i dont have to use a sharpener, which I dont have at the moment.</li>
            <li> So I had to buy a few more.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last quite a whole 9 hour work day - start looking pretty faded.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth $8 if you aren&#x27;t looking for a specific color.</li>
            <li> Not Urban Decay quality, but still well worth it for the bargain shopper.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fun to experiment with different colors</li>
            <li> It wasnt really worth the energy to send them back...</li>
            <li> These are such fun.  </li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re kind of forced to sharpen them between every use.</li>
            <li> These are nice...not super high quality, but soft enough to blend.</li>
            <li> They smell (strongly) almost like paint (and the pink one is like a mixture of paint and artificial bubble gum) and they can smudge quite a bit if you have oily eyelids (-1 star), but as I kind of like the smudgy look this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me.  </li>
            <li> (usually when eyeliner goes on easy, it comes off even easier!).</li>
            <li> : Keep them sharp to get a fine line.</li>
            <li> I like the way they glide on and the colors are different than typical eye liner sets, which was nice to have a variety.  </li>
            <li> I received these eyeliner pencils very quickly and I tried the white eyeliner pencil the same day.</li>
            <li> Other than this, it&#x27;s really good for such a low price.</li>
            <li> They will be perfect for an all over lid smudge/ base for a similar color to go on top instead of just as a basic &#x27;eyeliner line&#x27; on the lid.</li>
            <li> The colors are all pretty vibrant except the browns require multiple strokes to retain color.</li>
            <li> This is totally worth it, and I found the dark blue, pink, green to be my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> Just like any other eyeliner they are smooth and can be sharpened.</li>
            <li> colors do go on smooth and no complaints about smells and so forth like other comments ...</li>
            <li> Wish they came in other colors.they apply smoothly.</li>
            <li> They blend smoothly with other colours or sit well by themselves.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to future buyers of this item to spend the few cents more and choose either one of them to purchase from if you want to receive EXACTLY the colors of eyeliners that are shown in the pictures.  </li>
            <li> and btw they have almost the same exact set at Sephora (a high end makeup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I needed some new eyeliners for upcoming events.</li>
            <li> Live them all</li>
            <li> im gonna have to buy a new set</li>
            <li> The smell of this product reminds me of a mix of wax, wood blocks and like a new building.</li>
            <li> It for some reason just seems to bleed with the eye-juices and sweat produced through the day (I live in a HUMID ATX)</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;d like to say that the colors in the picture don&#x27;t really look the same as the when you see them in real life.</li>
            <li> I used the blue pencil to outline my eyes and then lightly shadowed with a lighter blue.....</li>
            <li> I initially bought this A for the cheap price, and B for the white pencil, which I did not receive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak too much for the staying power on all of these, only for two of them, (Black and Light Brown) but the two I tried stayed all day!</li>
            <li> It applies too thick and smudges very easily.</li>
            <li> Great purchase there are only 11 eyeliners and 1 lip liner which came in pink the colors last long</li>
            <li> They are very very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They look very classy.</li>
            <li> the pencils are very soft, and I like that a lot.  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I got them.</li>
            <li> They are very soft and glide on</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is easy to apply, and a long pencil so it will last a while, too.</li>
            <li> I thought most of the other colors were a little intense/immature, but they are delightfully soft and easy to blend, so they can be much more subtle.  </li>
            <li> Clear Winner!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the light purple yet but the light blue, light green, regular green and gold I gave to a friend who has a much fairer complexion than I do</li>
            <li> I only have two complaints, first:</li>
            <li> They are so soft and beautifull !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I would wear most of these colors.</li>
            <li> Softer pencils  vivid colors</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these eyeliners!  </li>
            <li> they stand out and accesses a make-up palette use all the colors for a great fresh look cordinating it with the colors of your tops or hair accesories but to those whom use the base lipstick eyeshadow the whole bit</li>
            <li> Creamy enough with really pretty colors</li>
            <li> These go on really smooth and show up on dark skin like mine.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it through Urban Decay or Nyx, so I figured this would be my next bet since I was getting more colors for the same price as one Nyx liner.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is cause the navy blue one is the only one with okay pigment.</li>
            <li> My review is based on first impressions currently.</li>
            <li> Be aware that you will not get the colors provided in the pictures above.</li>
            <li> Cool colors, but smears too much and doesn&#x27;t last long.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Received these exact colors except for the orange unless it&#x27;s the gold I have and just looks different in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how pigmented and soft these liners are!</li>
            <li> Fun and long wearing ...can not beat the price</li>
            <li> Pretty low quality</li>
            <li> Not sure how I&#x27;ll use most of these colors,</li>
            <li> They come on dark and smooth.</li>
            <li> Rosa - this looks like a true pink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft not hard</li>
            <li> Yes, they smudge easily, but all you need is a little, then blend it out to the thickness you want.</li>
            <li> The colors are also very nice, though I usually like to use the purple, black, brown, and indigo.</li>
            <li> I then opened each pencil to mark my skin to see exactly how it would look on me (and also making sure that there weren&#x27;t any empty pencils like previous posters have stated)</li>
            <li> Colors are great but pencils harder than expected thus more difficult for it to be applied and must be applied over and over to get desired color effect.</li>
            <li> The intense shades last the day without needing to reapply the product despite temps in the high 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> but I set it with transparent powder, totally worth a few seconds of extra work for the price and color and ease of application (smooth and soft on the skin)</li>
            <li> Very creamy highly pigmented prompt arrival overall would recommend</li>
            <li> They are vivid, glide on smoothly and last long.</li>
            <li> eyeliners are not thick enough ,can&#x27;t really see the colored ones on me ...</li>
            <li> These are really cheap for their pigmentation and the number that you get, but they don&#x27;t last long on oily lids like mine (even with primer and setting it with powder).  </li>
            <li> Added  new colors to my eyeliner game 👌 applys nice</li>
            <li> They are super soft, be really careful when you take the caps off.</li>
            <li> Some are more metallic than others when applied, but only slightly.</li>
            <li> i read the reviews, for the price, you get what you pay for, the colors are nice, but they smudge a lot, and they are very hard when</li>
            <li> I do think, however, that if they are kept out of the original packaging for long enough the smell will probably go away.</li>
            <li> I got a bunch of nice matte colors including: Lilac (pink), royal blue, &amp;#34;neon green&amp;#34; (more of a grass green, not neon at all), turqouise, and violet (dark purple).</li>
            <li> ok, I have to say this, I marked all the colors on my hand &amp; it smeared right off, BUT when I went to wash them off, it was really hard to wash it off!!</li>
            <li> theyre so smooth that they smear with a little touch.</li>
            <li> Applying a little powder or light eye shadow also helps the colors stay put.</li>
            <li> I love these liners you don&#x27;t have to press hard for them to show....</li>
            <li> when you first open the package it has an odd smell of laffy taffy, but that goes away fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> They are super pigmented and creamy!&lt;br /&gt;There arrive like 2 weeks before expected!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, the only problem is it hard to put on..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people gave them such high reviews and 4-5 stars.</li>
            <li> to use these as an eye liner stinks, the color is great going on but runs and bleeds.  </li>
            <li> It came earlier than I expected and glides on really smooth.</li>
            <li> I was SO SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY of these......</li>
            <li> Superbly soft, I&#x27;ve been using them as eye shadows.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only thing that really disappoints me</li>
            <li> The pencils are pretty long so I just have to apply at an angle , so I wont hit the mirror.</li>
            <li> So far I can tell they will work well for both but MUST be set with powder.</li>
            <li> but I was very disponted to not get white and there was like 3 browns for that reason</li>
            <li> The only reason that I don&#x27;t give them one star is because the colors are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> have about 1-3 hours before it starts to look like a 3 year old</li>
            <li> I was just conscious not to touch/rub at my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I really like the quality of these eyeliners especially for the price..</li>
            <li> Very creamy, I don&#x27;t know how they will last when applied.</li>
            <li> I can easily do a complete look.</li>
            <li> Not messy.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think that they are any different from the cheap ones like Wet n Wild and the like.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Actually did really well.</li>
            <li> and I found that I can use these on my lashes for a natural look, or neon lashes if that is the case.</li>
            <li> Nothing too young or wild</li>
            <li> Soft to the point</li>
            <li> Its like a creme eyeliner in pencil form, they&#x27;re so soft.</li>
            <li> problem is that the pencils are a bit too soft so it becomes a problem when trying to line the eyelids.</li>
            <li> I was hoping one would be red, but that&#x27;s really my fault for not paying attention.</li>
            <li> they are really soft.</li>
            <li> 16 year old granddaughter loves the gift.</li>
            <li> I had a pproblem with my tracking but the seller fixed it all.</li>
            <li> and I found the metallic lavender and light green</li>
            <li> Soooo soft and creamy</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Arrived early in the delivery timeframe given.  </li>
            <li> so be sure to do at least one check up every eight or so hours, if you don&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> They are soft and glide on well.  </li>
            <li> so when I purchased these I assumed they would be very smudgy but actually aren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My 20 year old daughter loves experimenting with all the colors.</li>
            <li> However, ALL the colors are very pigmented and go on well with only 1-3 strokes depending on the thickness of the line you want..</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t say on even with primer, I&#x27;m going to try to set them next time</li>
            <li> The only thing is, the silver pencil doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I am a professional visagist</li>
            <li> But as far as the eyeliners go</li>
            <li> They are too soft.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I wish each pencil came with it&#x27;s own smudger.  </li>
            <li> For the price they were so worth it even if the gold wasn&#x27;t as expected.</li>
            <li> but most of the colors I received were variation of blue and green.</li>
            <li> I also use them as eye shadows sometimes because the colors are cute and a thick coat.</li>
            <li> I got a few duplicates in colors that I wouldn&#x27;t use and was missing the silver (which I would have loved).</li>
            <li> I thought these would not be good for the money that I paid for, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Who ever said affordable makeup doesn&#x27;t work as good as expensive makeup hasn&#x27;t tried these eyeliners..</li>
            <li> They were good and met my expectations, but not great!</li>
            <li> The only negative I should say is that when u first put it on it can easily rub off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says they however don&#x27;t seem to be super long lasting, but the price makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I keep them upside down in a low jar so I can see the colors easily.</li>
            <li> and they go on smoothly since i&#x27;m an older lady its hard to find pencils that don&#x27;t tug your eyelids and these didn&#x27;t tug or burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I thought they were going to be super waxie &amp; not worth it at all</li>
            <li> So many colors, and for such little money!</li>
            <li> You can also blend the lighter color directly under the dark all the way across the bottom, or use a light eyeshadow to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant enough to make me</li>
            <li> The colors in this variety pack are not only vibrant, but enduring.  </li>
            <li> They last a decent amount of time too.</li>
            <li> I wanted the EXACT colors of the 12 pencils shown in the pictures,otherwise I would have chosen a different listing of Italia eyeliners from the several on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Decided to order a set for a friend, no black.</li>
            <li> They are not very good quality and they break so beyond easy.</li>
            <li> high quality, especially considering that each eyeliner is aprox.</li>
            <li> Totally high pigmented and color that pops on alabaster white skin...</li>
            <li> I am a retired aesthetician and use to by and use only high end products.</li>
            <li> the pigment is great lasts for quite a long time and comes off with a small damp towel or a little bit of lotion.  </li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, I am just bad at applying makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad to because the colors are beautiful but they need to fix the staying power.  </li>
            <li> These pencils are long rather than the midget sized you might pay a whole lot for in brand names.</li>
            <li> I accidentally marked my hand with it (the neon green if you&#x27;re curious) and was able to immediately wipe it off.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase because normally one eyeliner is 7 bucks, but I was getting 12 for the same price!</li>
            <li> Instead of sending these exact colors to me that are pictured, this seller pulled a bait &amp; switch without warning or consultation of any substitutions and sent BLACK,TEAL,WHITE &amp; another PINK</li>
            <li> They are VERY highly pigmented and stay in place for a very long time.</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical on the quality of these since they were so cheap, but when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The colors I got in my pack are:  Royal blue, Neon blue,  Avocado, Neon green,  Pearl pink, Lilac, Lavender,  Light and Dark brown (which look the same, more on the light side),  Silver,  Gold,  and Black.    </li>
            <li> As a teen, she loves to try out new looks and experiment with makeup.</li>
            <li> so much I bought an extra set of white too.  </li>
            <li> the only complaint was that she wish it had more colors to choose from so</li>
            <li> Then use a fun - lighter color that matches your outfit (or eye shadow) half way from the inside out.</li>
            <li> :) they last much longer than other eyeliner I have used in the past</li>
            <li> that when I first got them and was swatching them all on my hand, I broke the points off a few because I pressed too hard :)  </li>
            <li> (remember I haven&#x27;t tried other higher end makeup.)</li>
            <li> from~~just as I avoided the OTHER 2 sellers that stated up-front in their listings the exact colors that will be switched out if one orders from them.</li>
            <li> i cant really say anything horrible about this item i love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was originally only looking for a black pencil for daily wear and found this set; it is cheap</li>
            <li> I got a nice variety of colors, including white, black, and a few metallic ones.</li>
            <li> My only tiny gripe is that the caps on mine tended to come off rather easily which lead to some messy moments in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, certainly, but it is money well spent.</li>
            <li> them on, they are not creamy, they are dry, and smudge within a few hours....if you are looking for waterproof or smudgeproof, do NOT by these, the colors are nice, but do not stay on long enough.</li>
            <li> Does smudge a little, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I purchased these to have a little fun with my eyes.</li>
            <li> the colors are very vibrant, however I noticed they don&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> They are the hard eyeliner that do not go on smooth at all</li>
            <li> The black liner is nice, but the other colors do not really show.</li>
            <li> Too bad my all my make up got stolen lol</li>
            <li> The pencils themselves are really amazing quality, these feel expensive and the caps that come on them aid with that affects.</li>
            <li> They are soft enough for me to use them as eyeliners, lip liners, and shadows.</li>
            <li> I barely ever use eye liner bc</li>
            <li> It clumps if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> The only thing I will say is that if you have sensitive eyes like myself, eyes that water throughout the day, you should know that these eyeliners do run a bit</li>
            <li> Will re order in near future!!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes and these liners</li>
            <li> These were bought as a Christmas present for a young girl to practice with.  </li>
            <li> These are soft enough that I can use them to draw a design on my daughters faces</li>
            <li> Blue is my favorite color , it was at least 3-4 different blues included.</li>
            <li> With barely any pressure the pencils draw a line.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised how low maintenance they are .</li>
            <li> This set of pencils surprised me big time.</li>
            <li> The lip liner is this red toned hot pink that glides on.</li>
            <li> Nothing is more frustrating than when your items arrive damaged.</li>
            <li> They go on thick and slide smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Like the colors although most that we received were dark or not an everyday color you would wear.</li>
            <li> Thick, smooth colors with staying power and lots of options.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, just doesn&#x27;t have long staying power!</li>
            <li> Those colors are rosa, black, white, violet, royal blue, neon blue and light brown.</li>
            <li> so you have more control, less waste and</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they do have a slight chemical smile that doesn&#x27;t bother me I tried them on my arm for a day to see if I would breakout before I used them.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I had was that they wiped off fairly quickly (like after a few rubs)</li>
            <li> I love the colors I hate that they run and smug easily</li>
            <li> these are very smooth and dont have that hard drag alot of pencils have.</li>
            <li> They have a slight, funny smell but is not over powering.</li>
            <li> and there was NO MENTION of any possible substitutions in their listing as there was in TWO OTHER sellers descriptions that stated up-front the exact colors they will be switching out if you purchase from them.</li>
            <li> For the low cost I expected they would dry out quickly - but they don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I generally find that buying a bunch of colors in a cluster - especially for a low price - is usually a recipe for disaster, with the products ending up being cheap and unusable.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and they will last me a long time because the length of the pencils are alot longer than I thought they&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> they are so vibrant and they last a really long time also.</li>
            <li> Other than that I really hope my review helped some of you.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not exactly water proof, but are very smudge and water resistant.</li>
            <li> I also already have plenty of shades white (and nude/beige) eyeliners and of pink LIP liners and had I wanted more, then I would have chosen to purchase from my usual trusted brands for those,too.  </li>
            <li> Set the eyeliner with a little eyeshadow of similar color and then push a little MUFE or ELF HD powder right onto the eyeliner, dust a little over your lids and under your eyes and they will stay put much better.</li>
            <li> I ended up with 3 blues and 2 purples which are not colors I use, but the others are much more neutral (black, brown, tan, copper, silver, white, green, etc.)</li>
            <li> It comes for a long time as these pencils are really long and the color selection is really wearable.</li>
            <li> I have had much more expensive eyeliners that were no where near the quality.</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and came exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get white, but I did get a nice array of colors.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, like others said, these smudge very easily which is good for blending but annoying for me when I just want to wear it as eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The colors are royal blue, electric blue, chocolate, green, purple, black, white, lavender, gold (more of a bronze), sky blue, hot pink, and silver.</li>
            <li> whether you have oily skin or not(: (I do happen to have oily skin and was still very pleased with the product!)</li>
            <li> While the price is great, I was disappointed that I did not get the colors as pictured.</li>
            <li> The color on the pencils show up very well on dark skin.</li>
            <li> I really Like the Italia Eyeliners Set of 12.The colors work on Dark tone Skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is that they are too soft and go flat after one use before I have to sharpen them again</li>
            <li> No pink, lavender, purple or sky blue.</li>
            <li> The set is as described and the colors are vivid And long lasting.</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with colored eyeliner for a small price, these are definitely worth a shot.</li>
            <li> They are fun to blend and a few colors work well as a lip liner too!</li>
            <li> They were not expensive so even if a few were blah</li>
            <li> I got a few chrome-y sparkly colors: gold, satin blue, sky teal (more blue than green, close to turqoiuse), and lavender.</li>
            <li> I read some of the previous reviews and was very unsure about them...</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s the gold, light purple, and dark green that are shimmery.</li>
            <li> The black one is SUPER smudgy, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with the other colors.</li>
            <li> There not long lasting or smudge</li>
            <li> The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that they do smudge (\\&quot;traveled\\&quot; to the upper parts of my eyelids after a few hours of wear) and you should probably use a primer first.    </li>
            <li> but I did not get the exact product as mentioned but a different brand with a few different colors.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come on too light or too thick!  </li>
            <li> Some of the pencils are soft like the black, others - not so soft.</li>
            <li> It advertises as a set of 12 metallic colors, but only about half of them were really metallic.</li>
            <li> The seller was very informative after placing my order with my email confirmation, to notify me that the darker shade of blue was replaced by black.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I thought I could go my whole life with only black eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Not hard or rough on the eyes at all!  </li>
            <li> (its the pink one) liners come in bubble rap and an extra clear plastic lining inside !</li>
            <li> Now that I know the hairdryer trick on 2 second warmup to make them not so pointy hard the first time I use them, I&#x27;m even happier!</li>
            <li> Colors are a little too dull for what I wanted but they are still cute</li>
            <li> oh gurl, the inside is where these little beauty really shine.</li>
            <li> They do smudge a little if you want a smokey eye, but stayed put through the whole day of wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Upon swatching I found that the metallic colors (green, dark and light purple, blue,  green, brown, copper toned gold) were still creamy enough but not as much as the solid colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this brand before prior to purchase, and I was a tiny bit skeptical, but these eyeliners are very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the first time a few weeks ago and the set included grey color.</li>
            <li> The usual problem in pencil liners that I have is they&#x27;re not so long and lasting and it messes up so easily, but this one is different because it last longer and the color is very unique than the other expensive eyeliner that I see.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I received 12 different colors, two shades of pink ROSA &amp; PEARL PINK, two shades of purple LAVENDER &amp; PURPLE, three shades of blue ELECTRIC BLUE, NEON BLUE, &amp; ROYAL BLUE, two shades of brown GOLD &amp; LIGHT BROWN, one shade of green GREEN, and two dark shades BLACK &amp; GRAY.</li>
            <li> Seeing high reviews for these i bought them, all I needed was a white and black eyeliner but for the price I just bought the set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of color around my eyes; however these are subtle and very pretty, and I get compliments when I do use the color.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical due to the low cost, but they&#x27;re surprisingly nice.</li>
            <li> My set came with black, white, light brown, lavender, violet, royal blue, electric blue, neon blue, green, turquoise, rosa (pink), and gold.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t hv any kind of prob with the way I feel after applying wen compared to other expensive</li>
            <li> The colors I received are Silver, Rosa, Light Brown, White, Gold, Cafe, Neon Blue, Pearl Pink, Royal Blue, Black, Green, and Lavender.</li>
            <li> I got a dark purple, a silver, a dark brown, and a dark gray instead of white and the three light colored purples.</li>
            <li> My only con, which really isn&#x27;t much of a con because I usually do this anyways, but you should set the color with the same or similar color shadow because they will smudge.</li>
            <li> As far as other people complaining about a smell I didn&#x27;t notice any smell.</li>
            <li> I got Gold, Soft Pink Lip Liner (wtf), Royal Blue, Black, Green Frost, Light Brown, Purple, White, Sky Teal (my favorite), Satin Blue, Green, and Violet (a blurple).</li>
            <li> I have been spending a small fortune on Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner pencils and these are very comparable for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> The pencils are also longer than a standard eyeliner pencil, so I expect them to last for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, they don&#x27;t last too long if you don&#x27;t use proper primer but for the price</li>
            <li> Personally i dont like these, not even long lasting not even stay for 2 hours, spread under ur eyes</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly, no irritation and vibrant colors.  </li>
            <li> The pictures clearly show that this set is suppose to include THREE different shades of purple/lavender/lilac--TWO different shades of blue--and TWO different shades of green.</li>
            <li> She has to reapply several times a day because it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I can see these lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> These will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Last long.</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Just as long as they last, I&#x27;ll give them a 5!</li>
            <li> They last long.</li>
            <li> They apply smoothly, last a long time, and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> Some colors are flat</li>
            <li> nothing that you can&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are SUPER pigminted, including the pink- which I thought wouldn&#x27;t work, because usually water lines are pink, but hey, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;You can tell there&#x27;s shimmer if there is any.</li>
            <li> Other than that, no other issues for me.</li>
            <li> They are so vivid and also a little bit creamy.</li>
            <li> though they dont really last very long.</li>
            <li> Also, the eyeliner sticks are very long, so they&#x27;re gonna last me forever!</li>
            <li> WOW are these a hidden gem.</li>
            <li> Plus they&#x27;re long and will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> It comes with gold, silver, pink, black, and a light and dark blue, purple, green, and brown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only potential issue (which is why I&#x27;m rating this 4.0/5.0, instead of the full 5.0/5.0 stars) is that the colors are chosen at random and sent to your door.</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> The pencils are creamy-- not as creamy as high end brands like Urban Decay, Nars, Mac, and surprisingly, not as creamy as drugstore brands like NYX, Rimmel, L&#x27;Oreal, or Wet n&#x27; Wild.</li>
            <li> Very long so they should last a long time.  </li>
            <li> They are very long too, and should last a long time -</li>
            <li> That was just very disappointing because the quality of them seem as good as the Italia.</li>
            <li> I already have NINE different shades/textures/brands of black pencils (not counting the several different brands</li>
            <li> A variety of colors and very long pencils so they will last long!</li>
            <li> But the pencils are extremely soft and often break into little clumps on the eyes when applied.</li>
            <li> while not as creamy as some of the higher end brands, they aren&#x27;t hard and don&#x27;t drag on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> They were soft enough so that it didn&#x27;t peek your eye out but hard enough to be put on well and not fall apart.</li>
            <li> i give it 4 stars because i bought this set for the white pencil and the dark blue, but i did not receive those color in my package</li>
            <li> They stay long as well</li>
            <li> The pencil itself is actually longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> they do stay on for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i wore the pink one and the next day it was still on.&lt;br /&gt;good</li>
            <li> Would buy again, arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I admit there are a few wild colors in there</li>
            <li> The pencils are extremely long</li>
            <li> They also arrived earlier than I expected.</li>
            <li> They are long</li>
            <li> I ordered again this week for my sister, but the set no longer includes grey color and has some additional colors, etc.</li>
            <li> This is quite the bargain to stumble upon.</li>
            <li> I wish the pink was a little stronger and the gold a little brighter but other than that the colors are true to the picture.</li>
            <li> Especially the pink one, I went to Sephora, MAC, NARS and could not find what I want.</li>
            <li> Not professional though</li>
            <li> If I use the purple or brown I have to really pile it on thick for it to show up at all</li>
            <li> Since they are all very different colors I am having to constantly get the previous color out of my one eyeliner brush/smudger.  </li>
            <li> The smell is only noticed if you actually smell the pencil, or maybe for less than a minute during application.</li>
            <li> : The pink shown is brighter in real life; my camera is not very good.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as long lasting as other eyeliners</li>
            <li> I have a very oily face and when I wear colored eyeliner it usually rubs off, this one didnt, only a little bit but the rest stayed.</li>
            <li> contain: Mica, Red iron oxide, Yellow iron oxide, Black iron oxide, Titanium oxide, Ultra marine blue, Hydrated chrome oxide green, D&amp;C red no.7</li>
            <li> I ordered another as a christmas gift for my sister and I recieved the same colors yet again which was a relief based on other reviews</li>
            <li> The only problem is the fact that you have to sharpen them, but they&#x27;re not mini size so they will last a little while</li>
            <li> other similar lilac colors</li>
            <li> the only problem ...need to sharp all the time!!&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a white, but I did get a silver color along with all the other colors.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a red one, but other than that I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> ive been waiting for this liner a long time ago &amp; couldnt find it!</li>
            <li> When purchasing products for my initial makeup pro kit, I knew that I couldn&#x27;t buy EVERYTHING from the MAC store and other &#x27;pro&#x27; shop places.</li>
            <li> I use several of the other colors to line my lower lid without any allergy or &amp;#34;crying&amp;#34; issues.</li>
            <li> First of all , I did get a white eye pencil , I&#x27;m sorry for the customers&#x27; who didn&#x27;t receive a white one.</li>
            <li> They are extremely dry ...</li>
            <li> The color goes on thick and vibrant, so I&#x27;m going to keep using them and just check for running every hour.</li>
            <li> (An electric blue--more like navy), a blue (a little lighter) and a baby blue (not really baby blue, just a tad lighter than the other</li>
            <li> Of course, as soon as I received them I swatched every single one onto my forearm.</li>
            <li> I had to sharpen the black one down to half the first time I had to sharpen it because it wouldnt stay sharp.</li>
            <li> They make amazing lip liners too if you like crazy colors as I do!</li>
            <li> They were not worth even the low cost.</li>
            <li> one *tiny* complaint is that some colors (the neon blue especially) smudge a bit so they have to be set with a powder.</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised and have recommended them to a few other people.</li>
            <li> My package arrived on time, nothing was broken and, the colors look exactly like they do on the bottom of the eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It seems (from other reviews) that the color selection can be a bit random, I recieved pearl pink, rosa, lavender, gold, silver, black, brown, light brown, neon blue, satin blue, royal blue, and green.</li>
            <li> I received a variety of colors, including white, black, several shades of blue and green, purple, lavender, pink, brown, and gold.</li>
            <li> I would buy them again though I wont need to for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy other sets for friends and family!</li>
            <li> They came earlier than what I expected!!</li>
            <li> On eyelid as a liner and under the eye as a shadow it lasts  with only a little movement  at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> In fact, the only ones I am using at all are the black, dark blue and sometimes the purple and the brown.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the black liner Tip was cut in half not sure why but all the other liners were perfect.</li>
            <li> These pencils are also very long!</li>
            <li> Texture is similar to Kajal (Indian black eye liner).  </li>
            <li> Seriously, all 12 colors are vibrant, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> These have a slight sparkle on the outside where the color is indicated.</li>
            <li> I only wear it over my waterproof black eyeliner to add a hint of color.</li>
            <li> the only thing is I wish black would have came with them in this package</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are every bit as good, if not better, than some other expensive brands that I have tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> However, the color still really pops as a lot of pigment comes off, so the color isn&#x27;t weak.</li>
            <li> Lip (soft pink), eye liners (royal blue) ,( purple), ( violet), (satin blue), (white), (green), (sky teal) , (gold), (light brown) , (green forest) and (BLACK) !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Use your darker color (Black or Brown) on the bottom part of the eye - from the outside to the center.</li>
            <li> throughout the day it starts to spread a bit with sweat and stuff which is a bit annoying, but a quick touchup after 5 hours isn&#x27;t much of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t particular about the colors anyway as long as I got at least one pink and a black.</li>
            <li> I only use a little at a time</li>
            <li> The only downside is if you put eyeliner on your bottom lid, they do smudge a little.</li>
            <li> the colors I got a little different from the colors in the picture.  </li>
            <li> They are also really hard to sharpen (because of how soft they are)</li>
            <li> I currently only use the brown and black because none of the other colors show up.</li>
            <li> I really love these colors, but they run really bad.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised to say the least.</li>
            <li> I bought this set late Tuesday night and they were delivered early Friday morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t no much about make up.</li>
            <li> I only had them a few days</li>
            <li> and my finger came back green</li>
            <li> and i did not get the colors I expected.</li>
            <li> but I am giving 4 stars because the colors were not what I expected according to the picture.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than expected, I did have to wait to use them since it&#x27;s - degrees here to use them.</li>
            <li> And all the shades were just what I expected.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> pink</li>
            <li> pink</li>
            <li> because I don&#x27;t like pink eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> This performs exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> the lavender, sky teal and pearl pink are my faves.</li>
            <li> Pink-</li>
            <li> and it shipped sooner than i expected.</li>
            <li> need to soften them with match but be careful not to melt</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars, I was missing 4 of the liners.</li>
            <li> Be careful because they do smudge a bit, so try to set it with some powder.</li>
            <li> I wish the color center were a bit softer.  </li>
            <li> I used the pink and brown to contour my lips</li>
            <li> but a couple are just eh not much pigment.</li>
            <li> The color options are widely variable, but not ostentatious.  </li>
            <li> Plus, arrived befor the expected date.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the colors were as expected.  </li>
            <li> but we did get like, three different shades of purple and three shades of green.</li>
            <li> I am using the pink one as a lip liner and have used the brown as an eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> I use the pink as a lip liner sometimes.</li>
            <li> I have tried many color eyeliners and I hate when the pay aren&#x27;t creamy enough to go on the waterline.</li>
            <li> There are a few pastels like lilac, baby blue and baby pink.</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the reviews and the price, and I expected them to be like any other inexpensive eyeliner, dry, but they were not!</li>
            <li> Left my eyes black!</li>
            <li> however, the colors are not as deep as I would like, and are too pale in providing color.</li>
            <li> She is blonde &amp; blue-eyed and I have dark eyes and slightly darker skin</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t take too long to reach me after purchase, about a week, week and a half.</li>
            <li> They do smudge slightly (especially when you&#x27;re wearing which can be a drag because concealer combining with black eyeliner combines to make a very dirty eye look) but this can be fixed if you swipe a brush right under the liner to form it in the shape you want it to be.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> From what i read of other reviewers, it seems the luck of the draw.  </li>
            <li> and I do like the fact they go on easier than other pencils i have used.</li>
            <li> the other hand</li>
            <li> Extremely pigmented.  </li>
            <li> It smears, for all day as said in other commits.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any idea what other color I will need.  </li>
            <li> The eyeliner stayed longer than the other eyeliner brands that I have.</li>
            <li> The other colors are all matte.</li>
            <li> These are not like other eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> They are extremely creamy, almost gooey and do not apply well at all.  </li>
            <li> all the other brands that I buy.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, my mother was nonplussed by the smell, and took them when I said I wouldn&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> From other reviews you can see the colors.</li>
            <li> But as 10mins go by you see it smuggled other places.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how other people didn&#x27;t get all the colors</li>
            <li> Never any sharp bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they don&#x27;t fall apart at the end like other brands do.</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> Creamy, not much tugging which Im grateful for!</li>
            <li> and I was extremely dissapointed in that.</li>
            <li> however I wish the other colors showed up.</li>
            <li> SHARP PENCILS TO PUT AGAINST EYELIDS</li>
            <li> Though I got some lame colors which were: black (I really don&#x27;t need anymore black eyeliner), white, and brown.</li>
            <li> still like my colors, but I would rather have gotten maybe a dark green instead of a basic black.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is an amazing product that&#x27;s shockingly inexpensive for it&#x27;s quality.</li>
            <li> but i expected a black liner to be there too which was not the case.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointing but the colors are still very pretty.</li>
            <li> but all I got were browns blacks and other dark colors.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other than black one, however.</li>
            <li> I can use somewhat for only $6, that&#x27;s less than half what I would usually spend on two eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick on my eyelashes so easily hard to run several times...</li>
            <li> Only thing I will say that once put on its hard to remove it with just tissue or water.</li>
            <li> I have a really hard time finding nice eye liners that wear all day long without getting smudgy and nasty by the end of the day especially after a workout.</li>
            <li> I was shocked over the quality because I have bought cheap pencils before and know what they can be like when applying to the eyes or lips.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> dark brown</li>
            <li> But not worth the price for me...</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;slightly annoying&amp;#34; thing with these, is that you have to reapply about every two hours, because the liner just seems to disappear--but at least it isn&#x27;t making my eyes look like clown eyes.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to anyone and I am dark skinned</li>
            <li> My only issue is that the color loses its vibrancy on your eyes after awhile.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> If set with eyeshadow they last for at least 9 hrs and didn&#x27;t need a touch-up before I removed them.</li>
            <li> They were dark and not one of the colors I wanted were in the set.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is they bleed once worn for an extended period.</li>
            <li> There are still some I have left to try, maybe at least one of them will work well.</li>
            <li> And everytime you use them the tip goes down a LOT</li>
            <li> For those who were wondering I&#x27;ll put down the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cera</li>
            <li> They are not like the pencils that you have to press down on to show up.</li>
            <li> Other than that these are a steal that you shouldn&#x27;t pass up!</li>
            <li> i tend to set them with eyeshadow just based on the other reviews i have seen and to smoke it out a bit, but when i don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t budge!</li>
            <li> Oddly this kit does not include a black, but that&#x27;s the only negative I can find with these</li>
            <li> I always have a hard time finding green and blue eye</li>
            <li> if you usually get plain black eye-liners you are verily missing out on the colored ones i get compliments on the blue even having black eyes</li>
            <li> These liners are not the typical size either.  </li>
            <li> No smudge or black eyes even after 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I did like the colors I wish they had a black in there.</li>
            <li> black</li>
            <li> But hey can&#x27;t complain I guess when they are less than $1 a piece</li>
            <li> The black pencil works, the rest I cannot see after I apply them.  </li>
            <li> just wish they had black</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the black pencil, but I have plenty of those</li>
            <li> And of course brown and black.</li>
            <li> For a price of less than 70¢ per eyeliner</li>
            <li> but I knew that from previous comment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll end up with racoon eyes by lunch time if I use their black instead of my L&#x27;Oreal black.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> If your looking for colors besides black to put on your eyes</li>
            <li> After 1/2-1 hr, bottom of my eyes were black.</li>
            <li> I like their black look a lot.</li>
            <li> In the seller listings for this item are the sellers \\&quot;MissPinkCat\\&quot; and \\&quot;Kolorize Me\\&quot; and I have previously purchased from both those sellers with no problems at all...</li>
            <li> The black liner looked like I had two black eyes.  </li>
            <li> I do not regret buying these since the price is still less than purchasing one quality liner.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a black eye shadow and angled brush to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the black liner on your upper/lower lid.</li>
            <li> I wore the dark purple liner over my eyeshadow (which was a lighter purple), and you couldn&#x27;t even tell that it got a little runny.</li>
            <li> Also, I was a little disappointed with the colors they gave me as they weren&#x27;t exactly the same as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> (makes a gooey mess when sharpening)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to tone down a few of the darker colors to keep them from looking too gawdy.</li>
            <li> Caps make a click-sound that seals so pencils won&#x27;t dry out, and get hard.  </li>
            <li> A tad bit softer that the usual pencil eyeliner, but hard enough that is doesn&#x27;t break off in chunks.</li>
            <li> Also, they can be use as an eye shadow if you smudge a little on your eyelid..</li>
            <li> I always set my eyeliner with shadow so I am not worried if they are a little smudgy.</li>
            <li> SMUDGY - not worth it!</li>
            <li> as dark as the picture!</li>
            <li> They stay on my lids for a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do tend to smear a little and fade throughout the day</li>
            <li> Once applied it holds up well and requires little maintenance.</li>
            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> The product was not the quality I expected, is a hard pencil, is not smooth to the eye.</li>
            <li> I have wasted money buying pencils that won&#x27;t put a line on at all.  </li>
            <li> I have bought two of these and was going to order another,  I found out that the product was not available.  </li>
            <li> Until she realized that it was missing one.</li>
            <li> A few days after the fact.</li>
            <li> I am going to be using these for everyday makeup AND for cosplay makeup.</li>
            <li> Already sent the link to a few friends to purchase.</li>
            <li> The green and blues are to die for</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few months and they still smell when I use them.</li>
            <li> I have tried these a few times</li>
            <li> lime green</li>
            <li> happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would include a few reds but otherwise no complaints at all.  </li>
            <li> they do after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> but their quality is not cheap.</li>
            <li> Alone, these eyeliners stay on my lids for a few hours without primer.</li>
            <li> The metallic shades are lavender, gold, green, green frost and sky teal.</li>
            <li> Although the green colors have some alike</li>
            <li> I would diffidently reccomd these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> green - it&#x27;s a bit pearlized, and a mid-green, a bit lighter than kelly green</li>
            <li> They are creamy and stay on without caking up or melting in the harsh reality of Summertime Heat.  </li>
            <li> They came in a matter of a few days, and they did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> wearing neon green in the picture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money .</li>
            <li> Even with eye shadow primer, there is noticeable smudging in a few hours.</li>
            <li> i ordered these eyeliners just a few days ago</li>
            <li> I bought these and was hoping that I would like a few of them.</li>
            <li> There are a few metallics like bronze, silver and gold.</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> Not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I bought them on a whim because the price was so low, figuring even if they were not great</li>
            <li> The color was non existent and the application was not smooth at all.</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of $7.</li>
            <li> Werent as quality and don&#x27;t come off without scrubbing in a harsh manner.</li>
            <li> I also received a pink lip liner which I&#x27;m not thrilled about because I havent worn lip liner since the 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of glitter</li>
            <li> and you get 12 each less than a dollar!</li>
            <li> Dedicate the black one to smoky eye days!</li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> not too stiff or creamy.</li>
            <li> easily never recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> They tugged on my eyes, and had very little color payoff.</li>
            <li> But the one thats missing is one I paid for, and did not receive!</li>
            <li> I guess :/</li>
            <li> It is waste of money to buy that !</li>
            <li> but I am not sure of this..</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I simply wanted a variety of colors for those random days</li>
            <li> I am not sure about these.</li>
            <li> not sure if it was the set I got or if this is how the color wears on the skin.  </li>
            <li> The second I opened the package I noticed this weird, chemical-ly smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even wear eyeliner</li>
            <li> The last all day for me and ill</li>
            <li> they are so creamy and pigmented its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Usually you get what you pay for,  but not with these.</li>
            <li> then I would have purchased from my usual TRUSTED brands of blacks.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would purchase these again.  </li>
            <li> I find myself having trouble deciding which colour to use in the morning!</li>
            <li> I usually use gel or liquid eyeliners</li>
            <li> and you can always use them as a base for eyeshadows to extend the life of your more expensive eye primers/bases, if nothing else.</li>
            <li> One of my eyeliners arrived completely broken in half.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are hard, even after lighting them with a cigarette lighter, the color didn&#x27;t budge.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard like wax.</li>
            <li> I bought the set mainly for the gold liner but was slightly disappointed in it.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time choosing what to rate this , but in the end I went off of what I felt when I swatches them.</li>
            <li> They smudge a bit and some of them where hard to apply.</li>
            <li> But some of them are hard to notice when you apply them</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.  </li>
            <li> I see nothing wrong with them at all, even the packaging was a lot nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Introduced it to our beauty group on FB, to say the least, at least between 5-10 girls ordered these liners, and said &amp;</li>
            <li> At least not for me.</li>
            <li> Requires at least 2-3 repeated stokes to make the color visible on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am so shocked and pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> They sharpen well and draw on the delicate eye area skin without pulling.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to sharpen them a lot because the least amount of pressure will give off opac color.</li>
            <li> You can feel the product on your eyelid because its really thick and creamy..</li>
            <li> I wear my eyeliner rather thick</li>
            <li> Not very happy with that.  </li>
            <li> I mean come on</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve paid twice this for ONE liner.  </li>
            <li> But seriously, its hell to get off.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t believe how affordable this was.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that there was no black or silver, instead i received two purples and two violets.</li>
            <li> They are about 2 inches long and so hard they&#x27;re impossible to use.</li>
            <li> liners are too stiff; drag eyelid along with tip, and leave no color unless you hold eyelid with fingertip, and then eyelid is painful</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t find anything bad to say about this set of pencils, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> : If you don&#x27;t usually wear the &amp;#34;colorful&amp;#34; eyeliners, don&#x27;t waste them or be afraid of them.</li>
            <li> she first opened them was nasty!!</li>
            <li> I am not one to do a lot of crazy colors with my eyeshadows--I just wanted something to add a little touch of color to make my brown eyes pop.  </li>
            <li> They smudge way less than expensive brands!</li>
            <li> Also using white as a base works too.</li>
            <li> None broken or cracked.</li>
            <li> Total crap.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this item</li>
            <li> On closer [sniffing] examination, I noticed the smell was exponentially worse when I uncapped them.</li>
            <li> poor selection goes on with difficulty</li>
            <li> Not happy with them at all</li>
            <li> I was disappointed  that the pink was a lip liner and not an eye liner they don&#x27;t have that on the product  description</li>
            <li> in spite that I read a few bad reviews</li>
            <li> I didnt receive the black color :(</li>
            <li> With this price and quality, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> For the price of multi-purpose use you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> can go wrong with colors</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that sometimes colored liners can get a weird hardened, cracked texture, which these do not have.  </li>
            <li> They have a weird smell and it is not packaging.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> They smell weird, buuuut they&#x27;re $0.54 each</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with the qaulity at all.</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t too expensive, and for 12 eyeliner pencils, $6 was a STEAL.</li>
            <li> Even with all the rave reviews, I was skeptical - thinking maybe they were fake or</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other users have noticed a weird smell about them, which I agree with, but it smells just like my mineral makeup</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these</li>
            <li> They have a weird smell.</li>
            <li> And I probably spelled that wrong.</li>
            <li> and I was skeptical</li>
            <li> You get a random assortment of 12.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this product made my eye lids itch and felt irritated.  </li>
            <li> So that was weird.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on getting these since it was a brand I never heard of and</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am allergic to these I guess.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong.</li>
            <li> well cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> As an eyeliner I found them to be quite difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Still sad about the false advertising!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear make-up so these were a gift to a friend that&#x27;s obsessed with the stuff.</li>
            <li> I expecte because of the price that they would be hard and probably annoying.</li>
            <li> and this isn&#x27;t really bad, it just made my skin weird.  </li>
            <li> The colors don&#x27;t stay put and smear like crazy.</li>
            <li> However, for the price, they aren&#x27;t too disappointing, thus the 3 stars....</li>
            <li> I have bought some very terrible eyeliners in the past, but these aren&#x27;t so</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these eyeliners!</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very random.</li>
            <li> Bad luck</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t check on it, it starts to look bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a bad review</li>
            <li> /&gt;-overall bad quality</li>
            <li> Disappointed but the colors weren&#x27;t that bad to work with.</li>
            <li> So, when I opened my package I was REALLY disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the lavender.</li>
            <li> Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> otherwise I didn&#x27;t get all the colors advertised hmmm :(</li>
            <li> Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> :(  </li>
            <li> Disappointed , change needed</li>
            <li> And there wasn&#x27;t one :(</li>
            <li> I was wiping off makeup around my eyes and lower lids, very disappointing for being italia..</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> I was nervous, because of the price that these would either not work or be very bad</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I am very disappointed because I did not get the colours that were advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with these!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>
            <li> Smears terribly within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> The shipping was horrible!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on here, terrible</li>
            <li> and then the nasty smell was gone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they were painted with a nasty smelling chemical paint.</li>
            <li> when she gets clients that want that outrageous look</li>
            <li> well i say outrageous</li>
            <li> Each one is insanely pigmented, and I got all of the colors pictured.</li>
            <li> No smudging or anything in this awful Arizona weather.</li>
            <li> These pencils are horrible!!!</li>
            <li> This product is nasty!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was SO SURPRISED AT THE QUALITY of these......it went on smooth and even...color was bright....pleasantly suprised for the price!</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and came exactly as expected. I have oily skin, so I am going to try using these with a translucent finishing powder to help prevent smearing. It is a regular stick eyeliner that applies very smoothly but can spread throughout the day, best to use primer or finisher.</li>
            <li> Excellent liners and they last and last.</li>
            <li> These are amazing I just got them today and they are all so beautiful, it said they&#x27;d be in by the end of next month so I&#x27;m really happy with this, some of the colors I don&#x27;t really like but the most of them are amazing</li>
            <li> It was a cheap way to use colors I hadn&#x27;t before. The colors are creamy and glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> So much fun. No matter what mood you&#x27;re in they&#x27;ve got you covered. Love to play with all the colors.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! LOVE these colours! Superbly soft, I&#x27;ve been using them as eye shadows.</li>
            <li> Good produce. Smooth application. Great price.</li>
            <li> Love these pens! They go on pretty smooth, I just wish some of the colors went on darker! Like red!</li>
            <li> Totally loved this product and they last longer than most eyeliners. I went ahead and bought two sets.... I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li> used in under eye line had been colour faded</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliner pencils. I have wasted money buying pencils that won&#x27;t put a line on at all.  But these go on beautifully. And the price was right. I will definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> Great Product, the item was way better that expected specially the quality.</li>
            <li> Great colors and price for a quality set of Eyeliners. Each eyeliner is about 5 1/2 inches in length. Applies on smoothly.</li>
            <li> No complaints! It does smudge but overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice. It&#x27;s very pigmented and goes on very smoothly. I only have two complaints, first: It is very creamy and smudges very easily, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for you will love this product. Second: The white is not as pigmented as I would like it to be. Other than that it is a fabulous product for a great price!</li>
            <li> vey soft and amazing colors :)</li>
            <li> EVER SINCE I BOUGHT THESE, I HAVE NEVER BOUGHT A LIPSTICK. THEY ARE MY LIPSTICK. ONLY PROBLEM IS MY FRIENDS KEEP TAKING IT FROM ME. I WILL KEEP ORDERING.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and you can see all of the colors 👏👌</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these! The delivery took a while but came on time. No running, smudging, and lasts all day. Very pigmented. Would definitely recommend these. Packaging was great. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> pretty colors durable as well</li>
            <li> I have bought two of these and was going to order another,  I found out that the product was not available.  The pencils are sote in going on and they sharpen nicely.</li>
            <li> Like this product, but sometimes the product smudges</li>
            <li> I was delighted with these. I expecte because of the price that they would be hard and probably annoying. I was WRONG, they are brilliant and trust me they stay better than some of my waterproof makeup. I&#x27;d not heard of this brand before but now I love it</li>
            <li> Very nice colors. Incredible deal.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the same colors as shown at all. I wanted these eyeliners so I can have a variety of bright colors but all I got were browns blacks and other dark colors. That&#x27;s the only thing that really disappoints me</li>
            <li> I love these liners you don&#x27;t have to press hard for them to show....</li>
            <li> I was so excited for these, and they came a week early or so. But they ended up being a different by the name of &amp;#34;me now&amp;#34;. That was just very disappointing because the quality of them seem as good as the Italia. But I still really enjoy them, and they are decent quality. Just the fact that it&#x27;s a different brand is just off.</li>
            <li> Hey girls, these take a minute of working with for them to start flowing, but they are really great once you get the protective &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; off.  This is one of the best deals around!!  I&#x27;d give them a 5 star, but then it would just jinx the ones I have not used yet!  Seriously, I&#x27;ve paid twice this for ONE liner.  The colors are really great and all the pinks work really well as lip liners.</li>
            <li> I recieved the same colors they advertised! The colors are sooooo beautiful and the show very well. I also use them as eye shadows sometimes because the colors are cute and a thick coat.</li>
            <li> Love these eyeliner! They show up nice and bright and the eye liner itself is nice and smooth and thick. Great color choices as well!</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners they are great and I love all the colors great variety for the price. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that they do have a slight chemical smile that doesn&#x27;t bother me I tried them on my arm for a day to see if I would breakout before I used them. If you like to play with color on your eyes then you will love these!!!!!</li>
            <li> It took awhile for the eyeliners to get here.  The eyeliners are great, and go on smooth. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYE LINERS! VERY CREAMY AND GOOD QUALITY! WOULD RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Very bold colors and easy to apply , shipping took a while though!</li>
            <li> Perfect set. I love it for eyes and lips. Convenient and good quality.</li>
            <li> I use glasses, so I have to be up close to the mirror. The pencils are pretty long so I just have to apply at an angle , so I wont hit the mirror. Good quality!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are great! I bought them because at this price I figured, why not. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much. But the liners arrived in a timely manner, and they have BIG color pay off! they glide on super smooth and are highly pigmented. such a great deal! I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I really like this set of eye liner pencils.  Some really cool colors an nice to have a variety to choose from.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I love them the colors are very pigmented i will buy again.</li>
            <li> These pencils have bautiful colors and are soft and easy to apply, not like most cheap pencils which are very hard.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are amazing!! Pigmented and go on very easily. Also, they can be use as an eye shadow if you smudge a little on your eyelid.. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found and tried these. I was pretty surprised by the quality, as they are very inexpensive.    You know those cheap liners that look vibrant but are actually scratchy and barely leave a trace of color on skin? These are NOT like that. The color is rich and concentrated, and the texture is smooth and creamy (but not TOO soft). I generally find that buying a bunch of colors in a cluster - especially for a low price - is usually a recipe for disaster, with the products ending up being cheap and unusable. I am quite impressed as that is not the case here.    I hope these continue to be made available, as I would definitely buy them again.    I would say these are almost akin to something you might find at Sephora. The look isn&#x27;t too glitzy,and you can use a little for a touch of color, or a more generous application for a bright pop of attitude. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that they do smudge (\\&quot;traveled\\&quot; to the upper parts of my eyelids after a few hours of wear) and you should probably use a primer first.    If you think you will use these colors, then go for it. With this price and quality, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife as a Christmas gift. I saw she had them bookmarked as something she wanted. When the package arrived I wrapped it promptly so that she wouldn&#x27;t see it. When she opened it, her eyes lit up. She was very excited!! Until she realized that it was missing one. There were only 11 in the package. Happy she got the ones that she did, she said &#x27;It&#x27;s ok honey, thank you SO much!!&#x27; But missing one is really bothering me now. A few days after the fact. She has used the ones we DID get, and loves them. But the one thats missing is one I paid for, and did not receive! It&#x27;s rather frusterating!!</li>
            <li> They are so soft and beautifull !&lt;br /&gt;Son super suavecitos y lindos... Quiero masss!!! I&#x27;m gonna buy more for sure! :)</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors, easy to use, and they&#x27;re creamy so they just glide on. Great eyeliners</li>
            <li> these pencils tend to run and smear around your eye.  There not long lasting or smudge proof.&lt;br /&gt;By the middle of the day I was wiping off makeup around my eyes and lower lids, very disappointing for being italia..&lt;br /&gt;Not buying these again..</li>
            <li> In love!! The colors are beautiful and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> These liners were too colorful for my taste, but would probably be okay for someone younger.</li>
            <li> love these liners colors are great</li>
            <li> Great colors and quality.</li>
            <li> Bold colors; do not sharpen well</li>
            <li> They look like a good eyeliner,  but wasn&#x27;t inpressed with the packaging.</li>
            <li> I got every color that is shown in the picture. I have not had a chance to do more than swatch them, however, from the swatches I will say this:&lt;br /&gt;1) They are ALL very pigmented and soft.&lt;br /&gt;2) 1006 NEON BLUE and 1019 SKY TEAL look very similar, but 1019 SKY TEAL has shimmer and they are different enough that I am not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;3) These eyeliners MUST be set with powder. They DO NOT have good staying power and will smudge. I am going to be using these for everyday makeup AND for cosplay makeup. So far I can tell they will work well for both but MUST be set with powder. ELF has a good setting powder that is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Received very quickly. Excellent color assortment, including white. From what i read of other reviewers, it seems the luck of the draw.  Goes on very smoothly and easily.  Excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Good quality pencils for decent price.</li>
            <li> Very smooth! The colors are vibrant, they stay on all day, they do not flake, and they go on without any problems.</li>
            <li> I like how creamy this product is and I like the colors but I was very disponted to not get white and there was like 3 browns for that reason I&#x27;m gonna give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my niece and she said they are very nice and that the colors are bright.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these. I own Urban Decay and many other Sephora favorites yet I still use these over everything. Very soft and easy to apply. Last forever but they do smudge easily.</li>
            <li> This makeup made my face breakout</li>
            <li> My wife loves these.  She says they&#x27;re the best eye liners she&#x27;s ever had.  She got all the colors that were displayed, she says they have great pigment, and that they glide on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says they however don&#x27;t seem to be super long lasting, but the price makes up for it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these, super smooth, great variety in colour, amazing pigmentation.</li>
            <li> just got these today. i love them.  the colors glide on very vibrant! i ike em alot. came in about 3 days after i placed my order!</li>
            <li> nice pencils, perfect for my eyes, so soft, and came in a nice variety of colors</li>
            <li> Got these and love them!</li>
            <li> Omg this eyeliner is amazing I feel very girl needs these it&#x27;s such good quality it&#x27;s better than the urban decay eyeliner I have I&#x27;ve been using it for months now. It comes with amazing colors write for every occasion it&#x27;s very matte and it&#x27;s stays on for so long, and it&#x27;s for a very cheap price I love it</li>
            <li> Love love these. The colors are awesome on dark skin. Glides right on. Happy with this product. ....</li>
            <li> Colors are bright and popping! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> these are very vibrant beautiful colors went on smoothly ,I will be looking for more colors also&lt;br /&gt;great price also came off no problem with eye makeup remover wipe.</li>
            <li> Love these pencils. Unique colors and they go on really smooth. :)</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting great quality based on the price and some of the reviews. I recieved all the colors shown in the picture. Goes on easily and I haven&#x27;t really had any issues with smudging. The colors are vibrant and they will last me a long time because the length of the pencils are alot longer than I thought they&#x27;d be. I ordered another as a christmas gift for my sister and I recieved the same colors yet again which was a relief based on other reviews saying they had different colors.</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I had to give them a try.. &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I did. The colors are vibrant, very creamy &amp; easy to put on.. I can honestly say these are the best eye liners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> nice variety of colors that can work both on lips and eyes</li>
            <li> Nice set at a very fair price. Shipped on time</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive these! Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t like them as much as I thought I would. Yes they are very smooth but either my sharpeners suck or the penicl sucked! Bad luck I guess :/</li>
            <li> They are super soft, be really careful when you take the caps off. Beautiful color.</li>
            <li> Easy to use this is my second batch of pencils. they are really worth every penny they cost.</li>
            <li> Horrible! The colors don&#x27;t stay put and smear like crazy. The only reason that I don&#x27;t give them one star is because the colors are very pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have about 1-3 hours before it starts to look like a 3 year old did your makeup with the intention to make you look like a clown.</li>
            <li> This set was not for me but my friend was very happy and after 2 weeks now of having them she told me that they are great, so she is happy and that is what I care for so yeah great purchase</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever! Glides on well! Looks amazing! Got so many compliments!!</li>
            <li> Smeared a lot.  Not very happy with that.  But there was a lot of fun colors.  I let my grandkids play with them.</li>
            <li> They are great colors but they are too runny and they are being left at room temp. But overall I&#x27;d recommend them.</li>
            <li> Good quality. They stay long as well</li>
            <li> I love these pencils. They are soft enough for me to use them as eyeliners, lip liners, and shadows. For the price of multi-purpose use you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They are so creamy and pigmented! I love them, they do smear after a while though. But over all great products ! Shopping packaging were great!</li>
            <li> Easily one of the best purchasers i have made on Amazon. They are VERY highly pigmented and stay in place for a very long time. They make amazing lip liners too if you like crazy colors as I do! I really do recommend this product to any makeup aficionado. They are a fantastic addition to my cosmetics storage box!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these. The colors are well pigmented and go on very smoothly. I put up a picture with all the colors I received, one picture in natural light and one with the flash so you can tell the difference between the regular ones and the metallic ones. It came packaged very well and everything was intact.</li>
            <li> I like these, I have never used creamy eye shadows before but these work well. Nice assortment of colors and pretty cheap too! If you like to play around with your makeup these are a good choice.</li>
            <li> While the price is great, I was disappointed that I did not get the colors as pictured. I bought these because most of the colors pictured were bright but the majority of them I got were dark and included black which I did not want. Just beware you may not get colors pictured.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliners, will get more in the future.</li>
            <li> Really creamy and great eyeliners specially for the price.  Will definitely buy from this seller again.. :-)</li>
            <li> These liners glide on smooth,I love them</li>
            <li> They glide on nicely. I&#x27;m not sure I would wear most of these colors. Would be nice if we could pick our own colors.</li>
            <li> I have never heard of the brand so I was hesitant , but, for the price and variety of colors I couldn&#x27;t resist - and - I LOVE THEM!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they go on great and stay in place all day. going to buy more products buy Italia!</li>
            <li> Softer pencils  vivid colors</li>
            <li> Works well. Beauuutiiifuuulll!!! Reasonable Price!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing is more frustrating than when your items arrive damaged. One of my eyeliners arrived completely broken in half.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for product. The colors are amazing and vibrant for such a great price</li>
            <li> They are about 2 inches long and so hard they&#x27;re impossible to use.</li>
            <li> I barely ever use eye liner bc I don&#x27;t no much about make up. But these eyeliners are amazing they are so smooth to put on and they irritate at all and plus they come in so many colors&lt;br /&gt;Who can go wrong with colors</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors,and go on the skin easy.  I have fun matching the colors  with my clothes.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! I used them for halloween makeup and for bold looks. I added a couple of pics where I used the liners. I would buy them again though I wont need to for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these eyeliners!  The texture is great- they glide on your eyelid smoothly and have a creamy quality.  I&#x27;ve found that sometimes colored liners can get a weird hardened, cracked texture, which these do not have.  I also used several colors to do a kid&#x27;s halloween makeup as a butterfly and it stayed for hours- even through the rumble and tumble of a children&#x27;s halloween party. I&#x27;d say that there are a few colors in here I will probably never use, but there are so many to choose from, that doesn&#x27;t seem like an issue to me.  The pencils are also longer than a standard eyeliner pencil, so I expect them to last for a long time.  Once you factor in the price, these are a no-brainer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft/oily eyeliner which rubs off easily. I like all the colors, but I would probably not buy it again.</li>
            <li> These pencils are perfect....i love experimenting with all of the different colors. The only downside is that because of my Indian skin color, some of the more glittery liners do not show up as vibrant as the normal ones. However in any case these pencils are definitely worth it to buy.</li>
            <li> These did not go on well at all. They tugged on my eyes, and had very little color payoff. They were not worth even the low cost.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! They are soft, easy to apply!  Not hard or rough on the eyes at all!  Nice, vibrant colors!  I definitely recommend these!</li>
            <li> Loveeeee this! !! Goes on smoothly. Love the colors. Fast shipping!  :) thanks ! Will buy again</li>
            <li> These were amazing they went on amazing and really smooth</li>
            <li> Colors are great! Only problem is that I received 11 eyeliners and a fuchsia lip liner instead of 12 eyeliners but hey I guess I can count that as a bonus!</li>
            <li> Love these! Bold colors and the colors are true and show up perfectly. Quill definitely buy these again once I run out</li>
            <li> I, too, was pleasantly surprised by how nice these eyeliners were.  I am not one to do a lot of crazy colors with my eyeshadows--I just wanted something to add a little touch of color to make my brown eyes pop.  I absolutely love them and all of the colors.  Great product!</li>
            <li> The colors of these liners really POP...I like them so much I bought an extra set of white too.  Glide on smoothly, lasting power, great color...what more could a girl ask for?  These liners are not the typical size either.  They are as big as regular pencils.  I was really impressed by that.  All the quality for a low price...definitely worth it!!  You gotta add these to your makeup collection.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good.  These liners are fantastic for the price.  There is no difference in quality between the colors and they are all very creamy and pigmented.  The staying power leads something to be desired, but for the price, I can get over that.  They don&#x27;t smudge all over the place, they just sort of fade.</li>
            <li> Nice assortment of colors that look as expected when applied. The pencils are soft enough for easy steady application.</li>
            <li> They smell like colored pencils but that isn&#x27;t why I am not giving it 5 stars. I only had them a few days and I do like the fact they go on easier than other pencils i have used. But the liner material is softer than I was hoping. It clumps if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> for my niece for holiday and she loved colors</li>
            <li> The colors are good (mostly the dark colors). Stays on throughout the day. The price is also cheap.</li>
            <li> These are great eyeliners, especially for the price! They are very pigmented, they apply easily  and they are longer lasting than most bargain eyeliners that i have come across. The color selection is great too!</li>
            <li> This product is one that is what I was looking for. It stays on when I apply it, do not run when I start to sweat or water in put on it. Its great!!!</li>
            <li> Use once,and never use again . It is waste of money to buy that !</li>
            <li> The product is quality, but only received 10 pencils and I do not like</li>
            <li> for the price these are great</li>
            <li> This set was a gift for my daughter...a bit hit with her indeed</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners for the vivid color, it glides on the eyelids smoothly. The only thing I do not like is that they are too soft and go flat after one use before I have to sharpen them again</li>
            <li> these are amazing bright colors, the colors really show on the eyes and i only need to apply it once, im glad i bought it</li>
            <li> I love them. They are very pigmented and glide smooth. Just wish they were smudge proof.</li>
            <li> Great colors and a great deal for the price. throughout the day it starts to spread a bit with sweat and stuff which is a bit annoying, but a quick touchup after 5 hours isn&#x27;t much of a hassle. I would buy these again. the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. Very good quality for cheap. They are super easy to apply. Creamy texture, not like some brands where applying is like taking a colored pencil to your eyelid. Love these and will buy them again when I start to run low. **The pencil itself is actually longer than I expected. Bonus!</li>
            <li> Love !!! So cheap and they work great, as long as you use a primer underneath. I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Creamy application, well pigmented colors. The metallic shades are particularly awesome. Great price, too, considering it&#x27;s a dozen new colors to use.</li>
            <li> Creamy, bright and arrived on time just as pictured!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these as eyeliner for my funky colored lipstick and they&#x27;re working out very nicely.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get these eyeliners because of the array of colors. i will admit that i was sceptical at first because i never heard of the brand, but the quality is amazing, and the colors are so rich.</li>
            <li> Would be good for use in a coloring book, not foe eyes.  Explains the price.</li>
            <li> I thought that they would be more of a firmer pencil. I am happy they are soft and very easy to use. I love them so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent product 100% recommend five star well deserved ....</li>
            <li> I really love these colors, but they run really bad. I use primers and setting sprays, but after just a couple hours, I have to wipe eyeliner off my face. The color goes on thick and vibrant, so I&#x27;m going to keep using them and just check for running every hour.</li>
            <li> I had read mixed reviews before I got these.  I did end up deciding to get them because they were cost effective and the colors looked amazing.  I got them pretty quick, but it was a week before I finally tried them out.  They went on super smooth.  I accidentally marked my hand with it (the neon green if you&#x27;re curious) and was able to immediately wipe it off. That made me leery that it was smudge easily.  Honestly, I wore it all day and I really didn&#x27;t have any problems.  Where my bottom and top eye lid touched, it did seem to gradually fade as it rubbed a bit (I have super small eye lids honestly), but it did last all day.  I was just conscious not to touch/rub at my eyes.  I did that once and my finger came back green but it was only for a second and when I check my eye liner still looked pretty perfect. No touch up needed.  I also bought a set for a friend of mine and she loves them.  The quality and colors make me want to recommend this to all of my friends.  I&#x27;m really glad I bought these and I&#x27;ll definitely replace my set when I run out! If you love bright eye make up and fun colors, you should seriously invest in these.  Going to a store and trying to find them will just be a headache and you&#x27;ll go broke. Trust me, I shopped around first because I have to shop on a budget.</li>
            <li> I ordered this through a third party and i did not get the colors I expected.</li>
            <li> love these. they go on great.</li>
            <li> I like it. Colors are great. Good quality and I am extremely satisfied with the product. It arrived quickly and package was also good, but one markdown is that one eyeliner had a crack. However there are still colors and I&#x27;ve been using it already.</li>
            <li> I really like the quality of these eyeliners especially for the price.. but I am giving 4 stars because the colors were not what I expected according to the picture. I received way too many blues and not the variety as pictured.</li>
            <li> i have had these eyeliners for almost 6 months now and they work great. the application is very smooth and it lasts a long time. i would buy this for my family. well worth your moey</li>
            <li> Very creamy, I don&#x27;t know how they will last when applied.</li>
            <li> if you usually get plain black eye-liners you are verily missing out on the colored ones i get compliments on the blue even having black eyes they stand out and accesses a make-up palette use all the colors for a great fresh look cordinating it with the colors of your tops or hair accesories but to those whom use the base lipstick eyeshadow the whole bit these are the eye-liquer of the clown face you have been looking for clown face i meaning a palace as a queen like woman whom use make up 2 look more exotic or more fun 2 use make up and to add 2 your collection these would be good for teens 2 if the simple thing a mother would allow the eyeliner colored would be nice as well....</li>
            <li> high quality, especially considering that each eyeliner is aprox. 50 cents. when you first open the package it has an odd smell of laffy taffy, but that goes away fairly quickly. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> They came sooner than expected, I did have to wait to use them since it&#x27;s - degrees here to use them. They are exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Good product. Very smooth. Does smudge a little, but definitely worth it</li>
            <li> Just as advertised, thank you!!</li>
            <li> Nice colors but very light color except for black. Doesn&#x27;t stick on my eyelashes so easily hard to run several times... it is creamy. like cheese..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did cause me some irritation. I am allergic to cheap product but I am not sure of this.. Not all pencils did but some yes... light itching.</li>
            <li> loved them..colors are so pretty</li>
            <li> The colors are all fantastic and come off beautifully. They&#x27;re easily removed at the end of the day and I only find myself needing to reapply once. This is by far one of the best eyeliner sets I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to have a little fun with my eyes. They glide on very easily and they&#x27;re super pigmented. Great price as well.The only problem is the fact that you have to sharpen them, but they&#x27;re not mini size so they will last a little while</li>
            <li> They are okay, best for days I&#x27;m not wearing eyeshadow. Otherwise they don&#x27;t show.</li>
            <li> Pretty great! You get what you pay for, certainly, but it is money well spent. Very pigmented and creamy, but some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t show up as well. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> My only complaints:&lt;br /&gt;-Not waterproof, even remotely&lt;br /&gt;-There were 3 versions of the same bronze-brown</li>
            <li> Amazing colors in this set. Added bonus they stay on really well so you do not have to worry about smudging or if you work up a sweat it wont just come off its on til you clean your face.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and really pigmented! Yeah, they don&#x27;t last too long if you don&#x27;t use proper primer but for the price it&#x27;s a total steal. I saw a lot of reviews saying their isn&#x27;t a white eyeliner that comes with the set, but mine had one with it.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are creamy and work very well.</li>
            <li> Already previously reviewed this product, very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the color, texture and everything because I can use any one depend of the close a I put.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Creamy,easy to apply,bright colors,matte and metalic variety.Very easy to apply.Smooth:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eyeliners. They are very soft, blendable, and super pigmented. I have even used them for lining my lips. I would repurchase these any day. I think for the price, everyone should have these in their makeup collection!</li>
            <li> I will begin telling that i love that they give you 12 colors for such a cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very pigmented, they have an amazing quality, they are very creamy that you can also use it on your lips (I know i do) they do stay on for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand i give it 4 stars because i bought this set for the white pencil and the dark blue, but i did not receive those color in my package so beware, you will not receive the exact color they display here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is a picture of the color i received and i love them all.</li>
            <li> Do not buy! They do not give you the ones you see in the picture. They are thieves. Warning do not buy!!</li>
            <li> Creamy enough with really pretty colors</li>
            <li> This is the best product , it&#x27;s really good!</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;Italia Eyeliners Set of 12 will be great for my girlfriend that I bought them for as a Christmas Gift.  I feel she will really enjoy them &amp; get good use out of them.</li>
            <li> Great colors, easy to apply</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first about getting these but now that I have them I am really happy I got them. They have very nice and vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> Items rec&#x27;d on time. And all the shades were just what I expected. They are very creamy &amp; easily glide on the eyes &amp; have pigmentation. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, just wish they had white. Goes on smooth and the colors are great!</li>
            <li> Vibrant, and goes on very smooth. They tend to run but not if you put on over shadow or your powder. Overall.. Great buy.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and it doesn&#x27;t rub off or smear. I will totally buy these again. Worth the money</li>
            <li> ordered these and they came in fast, got every color as shown in picture . and they stay on well.</li>
            <li> these work great. Nice color</li>
            <li> Lovely colors. Excellent condition. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I loved the color output on all of the colors, they all seem to have a sort of simmer to them and they wear off easily so I suggest using a primer</li>
            <li> I love how this goes on. Very easy and creamy but stern enough to get the job done!! I really do like it. The only problem with this purchase was I got 4 different shades of blue. In the picture, it shows 1 navy blue, and 1 teal. The price makes it worth it though.  It&#x27;s a great purchase overall!!</li>
            <li> My wife likes these eyeliners. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE these eyeliners. All the different colors. So easy to apply. I am not much of a makeup person, so it is nice that they go on easy. Already sent the link to a few friends to purchase. will definitely be purchasing again once they run out!</li>
            <li> Great colors blends well</li>
            <li> Seeing high reviews for these i bought them, all I needed was a white and black eyeliner but for the price I just bought the set. But I was totally happy that I tried it. It is so buttery soft, that now I have explored on many colors and tried many looks too. Many a times I can do smoky eyes with all these beautiful color eyeliners and do not need to use any eyeshadow. I can easily do a complete look. Also using white as a base works too. It comes for a long time as these pencils are really long and the color selection is really wearable. I was initially thinking for giving away the rest of the colours but I like them so much that if I have to gift someone I will really buy a new set and give it. So worth for the price and you get 12 each less than a dollar!</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing! They go on smoothly and last all day. The only thing I will say is that if you have sensitive eyes like myself, eyes that water throughout the day, you should know that these eyeliners do run a bit but that is to be expected. I am very happy with my purchase and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> ok, I have to say this, I marked all the colors on my hand &amp; it smeared right off, BUT when I went to wash them off, it was really hard to wash it off!! So, I figured I dab a q-tip w/water and after applying my eyeliner, dabbed it and fool proof eyeliner :D great deal :) love them!  Very pretty colors.</li>
            <li> The colors in this set are great! Warning: they smudge REALLY easily. However, the color still really pops as a lot of pigment comes off, so the color isn&#x27;t weak.</li>
            <li> These are very colorful, they look just like the picture shows. They apply smoothly and depending on how you wear it, it can really make your eyes stand out. I like them a lot. The only reason I like them instead of love them is because I don&#x27;t really wear too much make up as it is so I only use them when I am going to work or out on the town.</li>
            <li> I was really excited for this, but reading the ingredients label, I found out it has aluminum powder. I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s only in the metallic liners, though. Other than this, it&#x27;s really good for such a low price. It glides really easily, smells nice, and looks great too. I reccomend this, but remember to use something to hold the liners in place; they smear easily.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are so great! I&#x27;m a make up artist and have used some top name brand eyeliners. These I would buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> Love them they go on easy and last a long time</li>
            <li> Wonderfully creamy, they go on great and provide bold colors on the eyes!</li>
            <li> They were all here and packaged properly. None broken or cracked. I haven&#x27;t worn them but the swatches were great. Colors are pigmented and will go on even more pigmented if white liner is used first.</li>
            <li> Love these liners!!!!! So vibrant and so many colors to choose from. #DarkSkinGirlApproved</li>
            <li> Excellent product will buy more.</li>
            <li> They are very creamy and very pigmented&lt;br /&gt;So worth it&lt;br /&gt;I love all these colors&lt;br /&gt;I have an eye primer so I don&#x27;t know how they work without it</li>
            <li> Very vibrant and pretty colors. The green and blues are to die for</li>
            <li> Not messy.No smudge or black eyes even after 4 hours. I didn&#x27;t go to the powder room and discover I look like a raccoon. Get you a set! Great colors</li>
            <li> was really surprised at how bright these colors show up! love them! great price!</li>
            <li> Nice bright colors. Goes on easily. I&#x27;d order again.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome and they are nice and soft, so you don&#x27;t tear your skin trying to line your eyes.  My friend drew a butterfly on my face for Halloween, and these worked great!!</li>
            <li> They came in on time and are really pigmented! I love how they smudge alil and sort of turn into like a eyeshadow look</li>
            <li> I love the colors and they look gorgeous</li>
            <li> the pigment in these is outstanding. when I swatched them on my hand I couldn&#x27;t believe how bright and shimmery they were</li>
            <li> Product was as described, and no problems. packaged well, and works fine.Brilliant colors on the pencils. Great buy, good packaging.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.  Price is great.  Some colors are not my taste but other are really nice.  They have a weird smell and it is not packaging.  It worries me to think what might be in them.  They are not the firmest pencils I have tried.  Very long so they should last a long time.  I have had these for a few months and they still smell when I use them.</li>
            <li> Good eyeliners. Works great</li>
            <li> theyre super vibrant and smooooooth! al though they dont really last very long. theyre so smooth that they smear with a little touch.</li>
            <li> These pencils are very smooth &amp; vibrant colors! Cant wait to try them out w/ my full face of makeup!</li>
            <li> Mice shimmery colors and I like the fact that it&#x27;s a set of so many different colors. Great buy for the price I think!</li>
            <li> Pros: easy and smooth application, highly pigmented, great color variety, long lasting wear,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: easily smudged, color transfer to upper part of eyelid (hooded eyelid)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love these eyeliners! The colors are stunning and the product applies smoother than any liner I&#x27;ve ever used. The liners are easily smudged which could be a pro or a con depending on your desired look. I have hooded eyelids and the liner leaves a color transfer mark.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. . Glides effortlessly!</li>
            <li> Love the set of colours and works well for me...</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and looks amazing</li>
            <li> These go on easily but they don&#x27;t stay on very long, if you do periodic touchups, they are great but if you don&#x27;t check on it, it starts to look bad.</li>
            <li> I was happy with my selection of eyeliner..they glide on smooth and are vibrant colors..well worth my money would buy again</li>
            <li> Love them!  I am picky about eyeliners so figured these would be a bust.. They aren&#x27;t!  Totally worth way more than $7.99</li>
            <li> very good product is recommended</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and they go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Extremely pigmented.  so easy to apply and very vivid colors.  I was nervous, because of the price that these would either not work or be very bad but they exceed my expectations. Im in love!!!  and btw they have almost the same exact set at Sephora (a high end makeup store)for almost triple the price!! And they work the same I have used them both.</li>
            <li> Large pencils. Great creamy consistency and colors are as pictured. I have to sharpen for each use.</li>
            <li> These are great liner pencils, they go on soft and smooth, no tugging, and the colors are fun to experiment with.</li>
            <li> They are very bright, soft and they do smudge. I know someone posted that they do not smudge, but they do.&lt;br /&gt;Once again, &amp;#34;You get what you pay for&amp;#34; is True.</li>
            <li> not enough variety in th ecolors, received doubles...</li>
            <li> bought them for my niece and she loves the colours</li>
            <li> Colors are great but pencils harder than expected thus more difficult for it to be applied and must be applied over and over to get desired color effect.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter as a gift, she loved them from the great colors, ease of use, and sharp lines.</li>
            <li> Omg these liners are LOVELY!! The pencils themselves are really amazing quality, these feel expensive and the caps that come on them aid with that affects. But the inside....oh gurl, the inside is where these little beauty really shine. Every color has AMAZING payoff. They can smudge for a softer smokey effect, or you can pit a matching powder shade over top and they don&#x27;t budge. I have makeup coming out of the wazzu, bit I have never run across an eye liner that impressed me so much, high end or not. These are a flipping steal, and they are worthy five times the price. I will purchase again, one for my girlfriend and one for her sister.</li>
            <li> Nice set of eyeliners, came faster than I expected. Would have like to be able to pick colors since I really wanted red eyeliner</li>
            <li> Ok havent use them yet.</li>
            <li> These eye liners are wonderful, they are super pigmented and last for a long time. The colors are vibrant and beautiful. Totally worth the price. They have a very smooth texture and run on smoothly and easily. I recommend it !</li>
            <li> These are just as described. I love the shimmery pink and blue/green colors. They look great on my complextion and last for most of the day, unless I&#x27;ve been rubbing on my eyes. Some colors are better than others I would definitely buy these again for myself or as a gift!</li>
            <li> The pencils came on time.  the colors are vibrant and goes on very smooth.  I would recommend this product and would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love these colors! They&#x27;re very vivid and go on very nicely. My skin is naturally oily, and makeup easily smears, but these don&#x27;t :) they last much longer than other eyeliner I have used in the past</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these eye liners and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Love all the colors and tones. They work great,  applies smoothly and they give a shiny metallic finish, love it!</li>
            <li> The colours are great, but unfortunately it smears quite easily.</li>
            <li> Third set I&#x27;ve purchased, one was given as gift. I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of those too good to be true deals. First day wearing it, I wore my glasses just in case. Boy, am I glad I did! My eyes got soooo itchy from these. I used the turquoise blue color. It smears all over your face without you ever even touching your eye. The ends break off really easily as well. Definitely a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Going to be completely honest, I love eyeliners that go on smoothly but these are actually too creamy if there is such a thing. You can feel the product on your eyelid because its really thick and creamy..but the colors are so vibrant and opaque..very pretty colors. They are also really hard to sharpen (because of how soft they are) the product gets all over your sharpener and the tips just break..I had to sharpen the black one down to half the first time I had to sharpen it because it wouldnt stay sharp. And everytime you use them the tip goes down a LOT so you&#x27;re kind of forced to sharpen them between every use. Use these with a light hand because they will be gone before you know it.</li>
            <li> I love these colors!  They go on strongly and pretty evenly for me.  Now to get better at applying it xD</li>
            <li> These go on really smooth and show up on dark skin like mine. However, there were several colors I can&#x27;t use because they blend into my skin tone. Would&#x27;ve like a little more variation. The whole pack seems like it&#x27;s blue and green.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and opaque a few are metallic though, there&#x27;s one that&#x27;s very sheer but nonetheless I love my purchase and it&#x27;s great for anyone trying to get into makeup.</li>
            <li> well worth the money. liked them even better than  i expected</li>
            <li> LOVE all the colors and goes on smoothly and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> I got every color that is shown in the picture. I have tried these a few times and I don&#x27;t think that they are any different from the cheap ones like Wet n Wild and the like. I&#x27;m not sure about the higher end brands I&#x27;ve only purchased UD (Urban Decay) ones before and they don&#x27;t compare to those at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like them and the price is cheap for them. The quality is on the okay side and they do last a long time especially if you use an eyelid primer (I get mine like most of my makeup from Urban Decay.) I would recommend them for the price but I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to fall in love with them especially if you have tried a lot of the cheaper brands out there. This will compare to those more so than the higher end. This is my personal opinion from what I have tried (remember I haven&#x27;t tried other higher end makeup.) So I can&#x27;t actually give you great insight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I did like the colors I wish they had a black in there. Other than that they are awesome. Most of the colors are metallic and are not matte. The white in my set is the only matte in the bunch. The rest have the glitter effect. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of glitter and if I had known that I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten them. Oh, the glitter is fine and is like the substance of a glitter shadow from say Maybeline color tattoo&#x27;s. So its pretty creamy.</li>
            <li> So, this is getting a bang for your buck! The colors are vibrant and the application is easy (very smooth and you don&#x27;t have to go over the application spots over and over, that&#x27;s nice!). I&#x27;ll probably mix most of these colors with a black eyeliner because the colors are so vibrant and out of the norm, but they really are nice overall. :) I was overall impressed. I would like to know what the composition of these crayons are (they are super light weight and applied easily) for safety purposes-no marking on the of what they are made of.</li>
            <li> I love the colors, and they&#x27;re very creamy and glide right on. The price is great and they arrived very quickly. They have a slight, funny smell but is not over powering. Would definately purchase these again.</li>
            <li> the colors are great and everything but, it doesn&#x27;t last. within 10-20 minutes it was already blended into my eyelid, but maybe i have oily eyelids, who knows. still cheap though</li>
            <li> these eyeliners are awesome! they are highly pigmented and goes on in smooth, sleek strokes.  Texture is similar to Kajal (Indian black eye liner).  I love it and will definitely be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> You have to buy these eyeliners!!! They are AMAZING. I have tried many color eyeliners and I hate when the pay aren&#x27;t creamy enough to go on the waterline. These eyeliners line the rim and stay on for hours. They are just as good as my Sephora colored liners that are so much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. I have a really hard time finding nice eye liners that wear all day long without getting smudgy and nasty by the end of the day especially after a workout. I am very happy with this product. It wears well, there are tons of colors to choose from and I get a lot of compliments on them. I am so happy with my purchase and the product definately surpassed my expectations. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by these eyeliners. They were super cheap and are actually good quality.  There are a couple flaws though. They smell (strongly) almost like paint (and the pink one is like a mixture of paint and artificial bubble gum) and they can smudge quite a bit if you have oily eyelids (-1 star), but as I kind of like the smudgy look this wasn&#x27;t a huge deal for me.  Also, I was a little disappointed with the colors they gave me as they weren&#x27;t exactly the same as in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;In the picture, there is:&lt;br /&gt;A lavender&lt;br /&gt;A teal&lt;br /&gt;Two greens&lt;br /&gt;Two other similar lilac colors&lt;br /&gt;A gold&lt;br /&gt;A navy blue&lt;br /&gt;A pink&lt;br /&gt;A brown&lt;br /&gt;A white&lt;br /&gt;And a bronze-ish sort of color&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the pack I received, I got&lt;br /&gt;A pink&lt;br /&gt;THREE blues! (An electric blue--more like navy), a blue (a little lighter) and a baby blue (not really baby blue, just a tad lighter than the other two)&lt;br /&gt;A gold-bronze&lt;br /&gt;A dark brown&lt;br /&gt;A lavender&lt;br /&gt;A lime green&lt;br /&gt;A white&lt;br /&gt;A black&lt;br /&gt;A silver&lt;br /&gt;And a lavender (I&#x27;m guessing on this one because I lost one)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like my colors, but I would rather have gotten maybe a dark green instead of a basic black.  The colors are awesome though! Very vibrant (the white is perfect for brightening) and you can smudge them to use as eyeshadow instead of eyeliner.  I also use the pink as sort of a matte lip color or lip liner (it&#x27;s a bit bright but you can make it work) because I don&#x27;t like pink eyeliner.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a fantastic buy and if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with colored eyeliner for a small price, these are definitely worth a shot. I recommend!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how good these pencils were. I have been spending a small fortune on Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliner pencils and these are very comparable for a fraction of the price. They do not glide on as easily but the color payoff and the lasting power is great. These seem to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; after a few minutes and stick very well. I do notice they can travel under your eyes but all my pencils do that, even the UD one. The white one is my preferred pencil for the inner corners and highlighting directly under the brows (blend well before it dries) because they do not collect/bunch up like many pencils do. Set the eyeliner with a little eyeshadow of similar color and then push a little MUFE or ELF HD powder right onto the eyeliner, dust a little over your lids and under your eyes and they will stay put much better. Excellent value, I will definitely buy these again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;I swatched these on my hand along with the similar Colors of Urban Decay 24/7 eyeliners and while they looked as bright, they did not last as long. I washed the colors off with hand soap and the iItalia eyeliners washed off but the UD 24/7 pencils stayed on. Just something to take into consideration. For the price I&#x27;d still rather buy these as they stay well enough for me.</li>
            <li> These eye liners glide on smoothly and have a pretty great smudge factor - just the right amount without totally blending in.  The colors come out vibrant, especially on top of eye shadow primer (I use Elf&#x27;s eye shadow primer).  Only complaint is that I wish each pencil came with it&#x27;s own smudger.  Since they are all very different colors I am having to constantly get the previous color out of my one eyeliner brush/smudger.  I guess this can be remedied with getting cheap individual eyeliner brushes for each color type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what you get, it&#x27;s a great deal.  You can go to the pharmacy and get one decent eyeliner for $10, or you can get these, which is the same (if not better) quality at a cheaper price - and the color range is great, too.  I always have a hard time finding green and blue eye liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also work great as lip liner.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous! Bought these on a whim for the variety and price. Very creamy and pigmented. A mix of matte and shimmers. Fun to play with for a pop of color or drama.</li>
            <li> Smears terribly within minutes of application. Total crap.</li>
            <li> Great pencils!! The colors are super bright! The pencils are super creamy. Also, a great variety of colors. You can have fun with so many different looks. I always set my eyeliner with shadow so I am not worried if they are a little smudgy. I actually get a better smoky look with super creamy pencils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I am so happy with my purchase. Will buy them again when I need too</li>
            <li> I use them for costume makeup more than every day</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> These arrived fast but even if they didn&#x27;t the price and the quality of these lovely eyeliner pencils.. they have a quality feel about them, not overly creamy so you have more control, less waste and the colors are vibrant enough to make me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would include a few reds but otherwise no complaints at all.  I love these and will buy more.</li>
            <li> surpried me has very good pigmentation</li>
            <li> Considering how inexpensive these are, the colors are fantastic.  I bought one for me and one for my mom. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> could not be more in love with these! can&#x27;t beat the price &amp; they&#x27;re great quality!</li>
            <li> These liners are cream so they melt and spear. You will have to set them not to have racoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Color stays on and is very bright</li>
            <li> Pretty colors but the quality just isn&#x27;t there for me.</li>
            <li> these eyeliners have been so easy to use and the colors are great. I didn&#x27;t receive the white one, but thats fine. they have okay lasting power on dont smudge that much. they do after a few hours of wear.</li>
            <li> These are so cute and i&#x27;m happy with this product! I will definitely buy other sets for friends and family!</li>
            <li> These liners glide on smoothly, the color is vibrant and they stay in place (with primer or powder). I love all the color options and I love that they all show up on my dark brown African American skin!!!! The browns and gold look great in my eyebrows... I just love them all!!!! Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and I needed some new eyeliners for upcoming events. I received these within 3 days! The colors are really nice, vibrant, and metallic. And they don&#x27;t rub off too easily. I can&#x27;t wait to use these on my clients!</li>
            <li> This is a great set for teens that are experimenting with makeup. I gave it as a gift and she was thrilled with it. It comes with lots of different and fun colors.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! XD&lt;br /&gt;These colors are bold and sexy! It smells nice to me.&lt;br /&gt;very fast delivery and I can&#x27;t wait to use them on my trip to Florida with the fam. :-*</li>
            <li> AMAZING value! I was hesitant to purchase because normally one eyeliner is 7 bucks, but I was getting 12 for the same price! they all apply easily and the colors are so vibrant!</li>
            <li> i wore the pink one and the next day it was still on.&lt;br /&gt;good for the price and the colors make make up fun</li>
            <li> My wife loved her always wanted to buy My wife loved her always wanted to buy has a better than the other</li>
            <li> TOTALLY WASN&#x27;T EXPECTING THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT! GOT HERE EVEN SOONER THAN SHIPPING DATE WAS SCHEDULED!</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and it glides right on.  I love this set for cosplay purposes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get all the colors pictured, but I&#x27;m still happy  with my purchase. Can&#x27;t beat the price and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> First off I&#x27;d like to say I am 14 and love to wear colorful makeup. This is my first time buying make up on Amazon and I was so excited to get these eyeliners and literally ran to the mailbox when they got here. When comparing the colors in the picture and to colors I actually got, there were only four that didn&#x27;t match up. I didn&#x27;t get duplicates or anything, and in fact I am quite happy with the colors I received. I got a dark purple, a silver, a dark brown, and a dark gray instead of white and the three light colored purples. Also, I&#x27;d like to say that the colors in the picture don&#x27;t really look the same as the when you see them in real life. Only five of the colors I got were metallic (Electric Blue, Gold, Silver, Gray and Cafe). The rest were matte. One of the reasons I got this set of eyeliners was for the white eyeliner shown in the picture. Instead I got a silver color (which actually works just as well as white for the bottom waterline in my opinion). And I wanted the orange color, but it turned out to be gold which is just as nice. As for the quality, PERFECT! This is my first time using pencil eyeliners instead of the kind you roll out of a plastic tube, and I have to say, the experience is way better than I thought. It goes on smoothly and evenly, and is very soft so you don&#x27;t have to go over your line more than once. They do and will smudge though if you rub your eye, but shouldn&#x27;t if you don&#x27;t. They are easy to clean off with either plain soap and water, or makeup remover (I use coconut oil btw). I am 98% sure you will love them unless you bought these for a specific color and didn&#x27;t get it. Other than that I really hope my review helped some of you. Will definitely buy these when I run out, which won&#x27;t be very long :P Hope the colors in the picture I posted turn up okay.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, true to color on end! Stays where you put it - no running, bleeding or smudging.</li>
            <li> These 12 liners surpassed my expectation.WOW.Great liners &amp; the pencil , wooden part is so well made.When i sharpen they stay strong ,does not chip off. !!!!!!!!!!!!  unlike other pencils , ..&lt;br /&gt;super happy &amp; they stay for longer than expected on eyes, .It does smudge but otherwise stay nice .&amp; looks so good. Loved the Golden one.I wear that on my lower eye lashes /lid.</li>
            <li> Actually did really well. Beautiful colors. I loved the way it went on, (smoothly). The only issue I had was the tip kept breaking.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are great, very soft and vibrant, but I expected to receive the colors shown in the picture and I did not. Still, would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love them! The colors were remarkable.  They glide on easily and stay on. Used them a lot during the holidays.</li>
            <li> easiest eyeliners I have ever had in life!  I love how easy it was to put on.  Loved the colors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been enjoying splitting up the set with my daughter and granddaughter We all have the colors that we love best!</li>
            <li> This set has some awesome colors in it!  I have colors now that I would have never thought to put on my eyes.  I am so excited to have all these colors.  I used the gold today!  They are easy to apply,  they just glide on and wash off easily as well with face soap or makeup remover.  I am getting  few more sets for Christmas gifts this year. Thank you so much!!! This is a great way to get a bunch of colors and have the ability to play with your make up.</li>
            <li> Love them so much! Came with NO duplicates. Shipped fast as well.</li>
            <li> Did not think this would be as awesome as it is!!!!!! Fantastic product. Excellent price.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented, just doesn&#x27;t have long staying power! If it had longer wear it would be awesome! But hey can&#x27;t complain I guess when they are less than $1 a piece</li>
            <li> Love it... fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Brightly colored when applied to the eyes. Just what I hoped for!!!</li>
            <li> The black pencil works, the rest I cannot see after I apply them.  Could just be my skin, I am olive complexion.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners are very good quality and very well priced! They also arrived a day before the earliest predicted date.</li>
            <li> These pencils are pretty good but not across the board.  Some are just fine in depth of color and glide on easily and others (about 1/2) are harder to apply because the color is too light to actually show up as an eyeliner.  However, for the price, they aren&#x27;t too disappointing, thus the 3 stars....they&#x27;re okay!</li>
            <li> Would buy again, arrived earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It smears, for all day as said in other commits. A good primer prevents it and allows it to last longer. I would suggest this for any model who may need the bold colors. They last a perfect time for photo sessions. It is also very easy to apply and make designs on the face.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I wanted pencils that are soft and I&#x27;m very happy with them. The colors I got in my pack are:  Royal blue, Neon blue,  Avocado, Neon green,  Pearl pink, Lilac, Lavender,  Light and Dark brown (which look the same, more on the light side),  Silver,  Gold,  and Black.    I did not get white, but I&#x27;m happy that I got 3 different pinks. Also some of the colors are shimmery and some are not. I don&#x27;t like mascara much and I found that I can use these on my lashes for a natural look, or neon lashes if that is the case.</li>
            <li> These pencils are a Dream! SUPER pigmented! I looooovee them. Very creamy and blendable so if you wish to, you can use them over your entire eyelid as eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;Great quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I was iffy about ordering these because the reviews, I needed a white eye liner but for the price I figured I would order this, if I didn&#x27;t like it I could give it to my step daughter, but I do like it very much! Works good and doesn&#x27;t sweat off. I will absolutely order again!</li>
            <li> these eyeliner are really good and i love them. i use them all the time and will keep using them. they were really cheap too but their quality is not cheap.</li>
            <li> I have bought this as a gift so I can&#x27;t answer these questions right now.</li>
            <li> I love using these eyeliners</li>
            <li> These pencils are so smooth going on and manageable to use! I used the blue pencil to outline my eyes and then lightly shadowed with a lighter blue.....then used the pencil a bit more on top of shadow and blended a little! WOW! is all I have to say! These are my babies! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are very good quality. They go on really smooth with no tugging on the skin and the colors are perfect. Nothing too young or wild although I&#x27;m sure young girls would enjoy using them. There isn&#x27;t a color that I wont use.  Also arrived in 2 days! Very, very happy with this purchase!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and they go on smoothly. The variety of the colors makes this set a superb buy.</li>
            <li> Love how smoothly it g hours on and how dense the colors are. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is it smudges very easily.</li>
            <li> Great vibrant colors, goes on easy, you get 12 of them and it shipped and arrived fast, just wish they had black that&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait for these to come.  When I got them I loved them right away.  I don&#x27;t have any idea what other color I will need.  I will reorder them again, again and again....</li>
            <li> I have tried these for about a month now and they dont smear on me. I can put them on my Bottom lid/waterline without having any issues. They are highly pigmented and I didn&#x27;t receive any duplicates.  The colors are all pretty and show on my skin. I have fair skin. I didnt notice any smell like some people say. They smell the same as my MAC pencils. They are smooth just like my MAC also. I dont see any difference. I don&#x27;t have to put anything else on like some suggest. But I only use them on the bottom of my eye for a pop of color. Only thing I will say that once put on its hard to remove it with just tissue or water. It comes off easily with makeup remover. The price is very cheap and good quality. I would buy these again.</li>
            <li> The colors in this variety pack are not only vibrant, but enduring.  I do recommend using a good makeup remover in combination with these, as soap can just smear them.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast delivery! I literally just took them out of my mailbox &amp; did swatches. Before ordering them I was concerned that all the blues would look the same but every pencil has its own unique color. These colors are beautiful, very high pigmented &amp; it glides on so smoothly. I can&#x27;t wait to create different looks with them, I know for sure a few of these are gonna make great lip colors. I&#x27;m not sure if I got the exact colors that were pictured for example I didn&#x27;t get the black pencil, but I have plenty of those so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li> This performs exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> These are great quality for a great price!  I like the way they glide on and the colors are different than typical eye liner sets, which was nice to have a variety.  I do not need to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use all the colors because of my skin tone, but I the ones I can use I love. I got a few duplicates in colors that I wouldn&#x27;t use and was missing the silver (which I would have loved). Aside from that, I really do like them.</li>
            <li> Impressed with the quality of these! I love adding a bit of color to my days!</li>
            <li> SMUDGY - not worth it! save your money &amp; purchase quality liners - color pay off is not too good</li>
            <li> I love love love these eyeliners. There very smooth, long lasting and the pigmentation is wonderful. Will repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Love the eyeliners ....it stays on well. Haven&#x27;t had that good of success with a eyeliner in a while. .</li>
            <li> I love these! There are many colors and they last a long time. They don&#x27;t run or fade. This one of the best things that I have bought.</li>
            <li> Lets just say you get what you paid for. The colors I was looking forward to getting weren&#x27;t sent to me, there were a lot of blues and greens. Then when you put them on they run and they don&#x27;t go on smoothly if your looking to do a cut crease eye.</li>
            <li> I bought two sets of this kind, very beautiful and distinctive, and I advise you to buy a total experience . .</li>
            <li> decent quality eyeliners for so cheap!!! how can you refuse</li>
            <li> Love these eyeliners.  They go on smoothly and do not run( melt) as the day carries on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish i would have bought a larger set..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These colors are wonderful. Live them all</li>
            <li> I love these pencils, the colors are bright and bold. It&#x27;s super easy to apply , may buy another set.</li>
            <li> I got this set basically for the lavender color pictured at the top of the photo. I couldn&#x27;t find it through Urban Decay or Nyx, so I figured this would be my next bet since I was getting more colors for the same price as one Nyx liner. So, when I opened my package I was REALLY disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get the lavender. I got Gold, Soft Pink Lip Liner (wtf), Royal Blue, Black, Green Frost, Light Brown, Purple, White, Sky Teal (my favorite), Satin Blue, Green, and Violet (a blurple). They smell weird, buuuut they&#x27;re $0.54 each so who cares. They&#x27;re fine, just not what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are hard, even after lighting them with a cigarette lighter, the color didn&#x27;t budge. I am not impressed with the qaulity at all. They can&#x27;t be used as &#x27;eyeliner&#x27; at all, the product does not transfer to the eye. If you put some effort into lining the outside of your eyelid, you may have some luck. I would not buy these again or recommend them to my friends.</li>
            <li> The shipping on this was so quick it was unbelieveable! Pay off was great, good quality there is a slight odor but nothing worth complainning about. Will re order in near future!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with the colors I received. My package very closely resembles the picture shown. The pencils are all very well pigmented! Plus they&#x27;re long and will last me a long time. They&#x27;re not exactly water proof, but are very smudge and water resistant. I swatched the colors on my hand when I received them and had to use makeup remover to get them off.</li>
            <li> as dark as the picture! these a great for the price!</li>
            <li> Great colors, very vibrant. I only use a little at a time so I don&#x27;t see a need to reapply...I can see these lasting a long time. If you are looking to expand your eyeliner color line this is a great start.</li>
            <li> Nice array of colors. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The color on the pencils show up very well on dark skin. But the pencils are extremely soft and often break into little clumps on the eyes when applied. It applies too thick and smudges very easily. It&#x27;s like lipstick in a stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I use some of the darker colors as lip liner and it works very well though so my money wasn&#x27;t wasted.</li>
            <li> Personally i dont like these, not even long lasting not even stay for 2 hours, spread under ur eyes easily never recommend this to anyone. Disappointed :(</li>
            <li> Wish it stayed on longer but I still love them...&lt;br /&gt;Would also like if they had more colors to pick from..</li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant colors can&#x27;t wait to go out and use them</li>
            <li> Great colors! the colors are very vibrant, however I noticed they don&#x27;t last that long. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase though.</li>
            <li> Pretty colors! These will last forever as well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in need of some new eyeliner for a while, and was hunting for the perfect color. None of the colors I had found were what I wanted, and I&#x27;m super picky color wise. Then I stumbled across these, and saw I would get 12 different colors. These aren&#x27;t too expensive, and for 12 eyeliner pencils, $6 was a STEAL. And they said it should be here by next week, and today, after 3 days they arrived and are perfect! These are marvelous!</li>
            <li> So worth the buy! Eyeliners go on so smooth and the colors are beautiful! Very satisfied with this purchase! I would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great purchase there are only 11 eyeliners and 1 lip liner which came in pink the colors last long and they are pigment the packing was very decent and shipping was fast always on time my only caveat was one of the eyeliners was damage it look as if it was burn other then that great buy</li>
            <li> They have nice color to them. Just like any other eyeliner they are smooth and can be sharpened. So they are good too me.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors and they work really well.  The package arrived quickly and in great shape.  Great value and great products.</li>
            <li> Even with all the rave reviews, I was skeptical - thinking maybe they were fake or something. Sure enough, THESE ARE AMAZING!! They are very very soft. Soft to the point that when I first got them and was swatching them all on my hand, I broke the points off a few because I pressed too hard :)  But seriously, they&#x27;re great. I admit there are a few wild colors in there I&#x27;ll never use, but I found a way to work in the blues and purples and bronzey-gold and white already.  And of course brown and black. I&#x27;ve never been very into colored eyeliner, but I love to do deeper shadows all over and then line the bottom with a bright color. I got a lot of compliments on my makeup the days I wore the blue and purple!  These are so worth the money, even if you throw out 3 or 4 you&#x27;ll never wear.</li>
            <li> I love the colors but you gotta apply it correctly the first time. If you make a mistake, its sheer hell to get it off. And if you use it, it has a tendency to get in your eyelashes. But seriously, its hell to get off.</li>
            <li> Very nice! Doesn&#x27;t come on too light or too thick!  I was very pleased with this product and will buy again</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliners, they are very soft. The colors are really beautiful. I really recomended them.&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars instead of 5 is cause the navy blue one is the only one with okay pigment. All of the other ones have incredible pigment (even the black one which I find to be rare) and they glide on smoothly. They&#x27;re a must have. Also, the eyeliner sticks are very long, so they&#x27;re gonna last me forever! I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The shipping was horrible! The product is ok... colors do go on smooth and no complaints about smells and so forth like other comments ... otherwise I didn&#x27;t get all the colors advertised hmmm :(</li>
            <li> These are perfect. Every color looks great and goes on smooth. This is a really great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> I have to be careful what eye liners I use because most of them irritate my eyes. These go on smooth, don&#x27;t irritate and look AWESOME!!! The only downside is if you put eyeliner on your bottom lid, they do smudge a little.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love the colors that are in this. I saw a couple reviews complaining that white it not in it, and no, it is not, this is silver, I knew that, but can easily understand the confusion. The eyeliners are very smooth and go on easily. I cannot stress this enough though, make sure that if you buy this, you plan on checking your makeup every now and again. It is incredibly runny. I went through a full work day not checking and when my boyfriend picked me up, he laughed his head off. I have never had eyeliner run so much. lol. Honestly though, for the price, you can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> So creamy! Perfect glide on for top and bottom eyelids, I love all the colors, if yoy rub your eye it will come off, however you can reapply really quick.</li>
            <li> glides on smooth. im gonna have to buy a new set soon i went through these very fast! colours are bright and last all day</li>
            <li> This was a good deal for all of these lip pencils. I love them. If you into lipsticks, you must have some lip pencils and these are worth the buy</li>
            <li> my wife loved it she said she deff recommends it to evryone to buy asap!!!! thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;-Los Angeles</li>
            <li> Love love shows up the color very well. It&#x27;s soft not hard so b gentle. Recommend to everyone who loves to make there eyes pop</li>
            <li> I love these liners. The only negative I should say is that when u first put it on it can easily rub off. However, it doesn&#x27;t rub off entirely so it&#x27;s like just the excess that comes off</li>
            <li> They work well and have every color you could ever want to use to look good on a night out.</li>
            <li> I use to buy Hard Candy eyeliners, cause they&#x27;re nice and smooth, or I&#x27;d use a gel liner. My eyelids are really sensitive to both pressure and ingredients, and they really enjoy these eyeliners. The colors are beautiful, and the pigment is amazing. Its like a creme eyeliner in pencil form, they&#x27;re so soft. Yes, they smudge easily, but all you need is a little, then blend it out to the thickness you want. They&#x27;re amazing, really. And WELL worth it. I&#x27;d pay $7 just for ONE. I hope these never get discontinued.</li>
            <li> Would have been a five star review but I did not get the exact product as mentioned but a different brand with a few different colors. Slightly disappointing but the colors are still very pretty.</li>
            <li> I thought these were an awesome deal. However, I think the use of these makes my face oily. They go on really smooth because they have a waxy texture. Gals with oily faces to begin with, just beware of that.</li>
            <li> Present for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> It came fast and I love each and every one of them. Such a great deal. If you are looking for some new eye liner with vibrant color get these.</li>
            <li> Not the best eyeliners ever, but def worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> very good product, the crayon pencil is a creamy, intense color, is easy to wash no water resistant. recommended, excelent</li>
            <li> Not very easy to apply and colors rub off eaeasily, but really pretty and good for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners. The colors are so bright! Purple eyeliner is my favorite and I love that this comes with 3 different purple options! The pink eyeliner isn&#x27;t as bright as it looks on the bottom of the pencil, but that is the only one that doesn&#x27;t look true to shade. The brown may be my new favorite brow pencil. They all glide on really easy, BUT DON&#x27;T SMUDGE EASY! That&#x27;s the best part (usually when eyeliner goes on easy, it comes off even easier!). They do smudge a little if you want a smokey eye, but stayed put through the whole day of wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other users have noticed a weird smell about them, which I agree with, but it smells just like my mineral makeup so I&#x27;m not THAT worried about it. I would, however, not use these pencils if you are very sensitive about strong smells, as the whole time I was putting it on that&#x27;s all I could smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend these to any colored eyeliner lover!</li>
            <li> I received these today. Am very happy with the creamy texture of these pencils. The variety of colors are nice as well. Would definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Just got them today ripped open the package... love the colors so awesome...the lavender, sky teal and pearl pink are my faves. Totally high pigmented and color that pops on alabaster white skin...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the great quality and how cheap they are. These will last a long time. I like that you get a variety of colors. I use the pencil but the. I have a brush that I smoothie out with so it doesn&#x27;t look like I drew on my face. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors, shared a couple with my daughter.  They go on fairly easily, but wear very well, this is a great bargain.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t even last one hour! stay away from these and this brand. I&#x27;m not sure why so many people gave them such high reviews and 4-5 stars. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Holy crap these are amazingly pigmented! Love them so much!</li>
            <li> I really love this and I will buy again next time!! I tried to use it as soon as it arrived and I really love how it&#x27;s so fine. The eyeliner stayed longer than the other eyeliner brands that I have. I always use liquid liner and sometimes I also use pencil liner. The usual problem in pencil liners that I have is they&#x27;re not so long and lasting and it messes up so easily, but this one is different because it last longer and the color is very unique than the other expensive eyeliner that I see. Therefore, I will buy again from this brand and I will try different products from now on. 5 stars for you Italia.</li>
            <li> I love them. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;Super excited to start using them, was surprised they were so pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants more colored eyeliners in their collection.</li>
            <li> Colors as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;Nicely packaged in a clear top box.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that the pencils are a bit too soft so it becomes a problem when trying to line the eyelids.</li>
            <li> For the price these are very nice. I was hoping one would be red, but that&#x27;s really my fault for not paying attention. Alone, these eyeliners stay on my lids for a few hours without primer. They stay on my lids for a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look very classy.</li>
            <li> U guys rock colors are awesum this will be my fifth order..took a while to get here ,but we&#x27;ll worth it.</li>
            <li> THESE EYELINERS GO ON SMOOTH AND HAVE A VARIETY OF COLORS. YOU CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE! TRY THEM, BUY THEM!</li>
            <li> They are creamy when you swatch them on your hand. But when you try it on your eye it&#x27;s hard like wax. As eyeliner it doesn&#x27;t work. It works better for your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I just recieved it today,I love these pencils and they work really great. They are soft and glide on easily to the eyelid. Love all of the colors.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are awesome! They are very pigmented and the colors glide on smoothly. It is very worth the price and I would order this product again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with these, very creamy, lots of beautiful colors that blend together well...for six bucks and some change these are amazing. I have had much more expensive eyeliners that were no where near the quality. They are fun to blend and a few colors work well as a lip liner too! WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> Best eyeliner ever. It goes on very well! not too stiff or creamy. Its perfect. I LOVE it so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so obsessed with these!!! I think the packaging should be a little better considering the quality of them but no biggie I guess. Beautiful colors. Really smooth and worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> These colors are highly pigmented.  however they are so greasy that they run off quickly.  Would not suggest buying except for kiddo dressup</li>
            <li> I love them so much!(: I use them very often. I have green/hazel/blueish eyes and I am in love with using the darker blue on my outer lower lash line and the forest green in my inner lower lash line, then I just blend(: I definitely recommend these to anyone debating whether or not to buy this amazing product! Although I do recommend setting it with a translucent powder, an eyeshadow, etc. whether you have oily skin or not(: (I do happen to have oily skin and was still very pleased with the product!) hope this helped!</li>
            <li> was a very convienet  package</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for sugar skull designs for Halloween. &amp; have found myself using most of them on a daily basis. Great quality &amp; glides on smooth &amp; bold. Totally worth the purchase! I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and there is 12! Absolutely love them. My husband loves the color on my bottom eye lids when I use them!</li>
            <li> These things are AMAZING.  These are, by far, the BEST eyeliners.  They go on easily and really are creamy and vibrant.  These are a fantastic buy and I know I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering again, if god-forbid... mine run out.  The pencils are extremely long and I don&#x27;t see this happening anytime soon.  Seriously, all 12 colors are vibrant, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.  :)</li>
            <li> I like the colors, but they will smudge. I tried it with and without primer and both times I had smudges after a while</li>
            <li> I gave these eyeliners 4 stars as I have yet to test them. My review is based on first impressions currently. First off, I did receive all the colors pictured. I ordered the one being offered through Amazon with prime shipping since I knew if I didn&#x27;t receive the colors pictured I could easily return it. But I did and have taken pictures so you can see the names and swatches. The description says 12 metallic eyeliners but only 5 of the 12 are metallic, which is fine with me. These have a slight sparkle on the outside where the color is indicated. The metallic shades are lavender, gold, green, green frost and sky teal. The other colors are all matte. Those colors are rosa, black, white, violet, royal blue, neon blue and light brown. For a price of less than 70¢ per eyeliner this is an excellent deal. They glide effortlessly on the skin and they are easy to blend as well. Plus the colors are also very pigmented. The only flaw I can see is that the liners are not smudge proof but then again what eyeliner truly is. I had it swatched on my hand for awhile and I rubbed it and they all smeared. But for the price, the range of colors given and the quality, I would definitely recommend this set to anyone. Hands down! I will try this out further and update later.</li>
            <li> These go on smooth and wear well. I do notice they can tend to smear right after application sometimes, though. After it sets or whatever, it is fine and doesn&#x27;t smear. Other than that, no other issues for me.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners go on smoothly! I love it!  The colors are fun, especially for the price.  Quite frankly even with the reviews I was not expecting much.  Even though there are a few colors I will never use, I am very happy with this purchase.  The liner also blends quite nicely if wanted, I actually used two colors on my eyes and blended. The result was much more than I believed my skills to be.</li>
            <li> love these ! theyre so bright and colorful ! couldnt of asked for better</li>
            <li> Nice but u have to make sure u go over two times to really see the colors</li>
            <li> Does not last in the water line but very smooth and creamy for longer staying power set with eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I really liek this, it does smudge a bit, but nothing that you can&#x27;t handle.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are SUPER pigminted, including the pink- which I thought wouldn&#x27;t work, because usually water lines are pink, but hey, it worked!&lt;br /&gt;You can tell there&#x27;s shimmer if there is any. (Unlike alot of eyelines that usually just rub off on the eye without the shimmer).&lt;br /&gt;The gold pencil kind of smells like bubble gum.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use this as a light line for my eyes before putting on gel liner, just to add definition to my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this and I would for sure reccomend this!!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, within 3 days!!</li>
            <li> Excellent buy for the price.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> These are very sustainable and lovely shades.</li>
            <li> These r soooooo soooooo good. Awesome colours, v smooth. I didn&#x27;t hv any kind of prob with the way I feel after applying wen compared to other expensive brands.&lt;br /&gt;My cousin liked it so much...ordering one for her again.</li>
            <li> Although the green colors have some alike and i probably won&#x27;t use the green, but it&#x27;s worth it because the colors are very creamy and slide on easily. I have bought some very terrible eyeliners in the past, but these aren&#x27;t so I would diffidently reccomd these eyeliners.(:</li>
            <li> My grandaughter loves it</li>
            <li> these are nice pencils... they are full sized and a very nice selection of colours, this is a nice set for yourself or a gift for someone who likes to try new ideas and colours. I would buy these again as they are good quality !</li>
            <li> So I actually use these as lipliners and lip colors. I love them but they do have to be reapplied. Either way, good for value. The colors are nice and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Cain&#x27;t say that I don&#x27;t have all the colors I need when it comes to my eyeliners this kit has just the right colors that I like to wear but wish blk could have been included with the kit other than that I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because of the white pencil in it.  Well, there was not a white pencil, and there was actually 5 different shades of purple.  Be aware that you will not get the colors provided in the pictures above.</li>
            <li> id really recommend these if your looking for a cheap , good quality eyeliner. I really liked the say the look , I love all the colors  .</li>
            <li> I got my pencils today!!!!!! Yayyy They are beautiful. No harm in the packaging what so ever! Happy Me</li>
            <li> They smudge and are deff not lasting, the black and brown work better but it was so cheap I wanted to try it, u need to re touch it for sure, pretty colors.</li>
            <li> I was looking to buy some new eyeliners and this set looked perfect. I really enjoy the colors included, and are very well chosen. There is a nice range, and the colors are average enough that I think are easily wearable on any day. A tad bit softer that the usual pencil eyeliner, but hard enough that is doesn&#x27;t break off in chunks. Great if you&#x27;re eyes are sensitive to pressure! A bit of sparkle in them, but enough to set it off. Personally, I find the sparkle nice and not too over the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fair priced range of eyeliners.</li>
            <li> These are not like other eyeliner pencils I&#x27;ve purchased.  They are extremely creamy, almost gooey and do not apply well at all.  They are going in the trash.</li>
            <li> does not slide on as easily as hoped for</li>
            <li> Cool colors, but smears too much and doesn&#x27;t last long.  I only wear it over my waterproof black eyeliner to add a hint of color.</li>
            <li> These things are good.</li>
            <li> Went in the trash feels like trying to get chalk on your eyelid!!  Will not rebuy. Pretty colors but dry &amp; does not go on smoothly !</li>
            <li> For the money these are amazing goes on smooth and very vibrant - set with same color eye shadow and it will last</li>
            <li> The colors are extremely bright.  They go on thick and slide smoothly.  If you are looking for something subtle, this isn&#x27;t really the pack you want, but if you want an extreme look, this is a great deal for good pencils.</li>
            <li> I have bought these twice as gifts for women who love colorful eyeliner--they both seemed to be very pleased with them!  If I was into colored eyeliner, I would buy them for myself!</li>
            <li> You need to wear an eye primer or the colors will run. Pretty colors</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners they are very vibrant and go on so smoothly!! I just wish I would&#x27;ve gotten a white color instead of silver. But all in all these are very nice and such a good deal!!! I would definetely buy these again and again. I also recieved them sooo fast I was very pleased. I would reccomend these to alot of people.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS SO AMAZING. I got this in a bit of a whim, to play around with eyeliner colours, and this set is one of the most glorious purchases I have ever made. Especially for the price, the quality is top-noch: the colours are deeply pigmented, and the texture is creamy. I have medium brown skin, and when the colours showed up so well I had to try it on a friend sitting with me (she has very, very black skin) and the colours all look gorgeous on both of us. It&#x27;s so amazing. I&#x27;m in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the white-- I use white eyeliner on my waterline because I wear glasses and it&#x27;s a cool makeup trick to make your eyes look bigger/bolder, and this white shows up so much better than the other ones I&#x27;ve used. Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> At such a low price I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but these are great. Goes on easy without clumping or hurting. Great range of colours. On eyelid as a liner and under the eye as a shadow it lasts  with only a little movement  at the end of a long day.</li>
            <li> They are super colorful and they go on as the color shows. They got to me on time even before they were suppose to. If you want good colored eyeliners these are the ones to buy.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on reviews I found here and I have to say: luckily I did!! They came in a beautiful array of colors, I&#x27;m still testing them but so far I can say they&#x27;re strongly pigmented and very creamy in texture... very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I got these because my son needed a good red-brown for a costume he was doing.  The price was pretty much what one &#x27;name-brand&#x27; pencil would have cost, but I couldn&#x27;t even find the shade I needed in their lines.  I am glad I took the chance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go on very smooth, and work with any conventional wood sharpener.  They keep a tip well though - to me they are the perfect mix of smooth and sturdy to actually draw a line with.  They are very long too, and should last a long time - in fact, they are about twice the size of most lining pencils.  I have not had any problems with them smearing, and they last me through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DID get a white in my set.  I got 12.&lt;br /&gt;1. Pearl Pink- It&#x27;s a light pearlized rose color.&lt;br /&gt;2. Jet black&lt;br /&gt;3.Satin Blue - It looks a bit purple just looking at it, but it goes on as a very pretty blue&lt;br /&gt;4. lavender - this is a pearly purple shade.  LOVE this one!&lt;br /&gt;5. white - just a pure white (these are great for making eyes look bigger.)&lt;br /&gt;6. green - it&#x27;s a bit pearlized, and a mid-green, a bit lighter than kelly green&lt;br /&gt;7.silver - it&#x27;s metallic silver&lt;br /&gt;8. my favorite - SKY TEAL - great on blue eyes - it&#x27;s a teal blue that is rather metallic&lt;br /&gt;9.Medium brown -this is what we used to get the reddish brown eyebrow look for the oostume.&lt;br /&gt;10. GOLD - just a metallic gold&lt;br /&gt;11. Rosa - this looks like a true pink&lt;br /&gt;12 - Cafe - this is just what I&#x27;d call a true brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy I took a chance and bought these.  HIGHLY recommend. Great price on a nice selection of eye pencils.</li>
            <li> These eyeliner pencils have beautiful colors that are silkier than I would have thought considering the price. I am very happy I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> This was AMAZING the colors are bright, vibrant, go on smooth, and stay on ALL DAY. No joke. I put some on then washed my face with soap and water and took a shower and it still looked fresh! This is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> They go on very smoothly I love these eyeliners and will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> the colors are beautiful and easy to apply</li>
            <li> these were advertised as Italia eyeliners, which they are not. They are the hard eyeliner that do not go on smooth at all and they ship from China.</li>
            <li> AWESOME PRODUCT LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Like the colors although most that we received were dark or not an everyday color you would wear. Teens would love it. The only thing I noticed was that they do glide on nicely, however, they smear a lot.</li>
            <li> Really like these colors, but the electric blue is a bit much for me, the rest are lovely colors though.</li>
            <li> I love them the colors are awesome!</li>
            <li> I am always having a problem finding an eye pencil that is both vivid and smooth,  and have gotten to the point I have refused to even put eye liner on- I received the exact same colors above, and they are smooth and bright. The white is bright white and I did a quick line on my arms of all the colors and am amazed at how bright they are. Be careful about how much pressure you use or you&#x27;ll find yourself with a much thicker like than you want and be sure to let it set or use a powder to set it. But i won&#x27;t be going back to any eye liner I have used before, these are awesome and have great staying powder.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners work amazing. The colors are so vibrant and pretty:)  the only thing I have to say is I have to sharpen them a lot cause they are really soft. Other than that they work really nice. Defiantly would buy again if I needed to.&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love all the colours.</li>
            <li> Good product, I would buy again!</li>
            <li> These are very pretty!  So creamy!  Very pigmented.  Perfect for those like me who are trying to break out of the constant neutrals and nudes for more sassy pops of color.  Excellent product.  I would definitely buy again and will look into the rest of their line too.  Thanks Amazon and thank you too reviewers!  :)</li>
            <li> i have got these before and i absolutely love them . i have got every color in the rainbow from them i use them 1 daily 24/7 they do not smear easily and they do stay on for a long time i cant really say anything horrible about this item i love it!!!</li>
            <li> very pigmented, last very long great value too</li>
            <li> receved yesterday and love them</li>
            <li> This eyeliners are amazing&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors and it&#x27;s very cheap</li>
            <li> It came promptly and nice packaging.  It was a gift for my soon to be 15 year od Granddaughter - She was happy to receive it but I haven&#x27;t talked to her yet about her trying them - she was glad that there was a White eyeliner in the packet!</li>
            <li> Good quality. Last long. Good price. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the colors. Normally I get the roll up eyeliners so i dont have to use a sharpener, which I dont have at the moment. lol thats my only problem.</li>
            <li> all beautiful colors... useful like eyeshadows and lipsticks... the only problem ...need to sharp all the time!!&lt;br /&gt;but nice and smells like gum!!</li>
            <li> Love all the different, bright colors.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners! They go on very smooth and are extremely bright. They do tend to smudge a bit, but I&#x27;ve found that using a powder over them, like matching eyeshadow, reduces this. The metallic colors I received are actually metallic, and reflect light like they should. It&#x27;s fantastic. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprized with these. I thought these would not be good for the money that I paid for, but boy was I wrong. These go on smoothly and stay all day provided you dont scrub your eyes. I am thoroughly enjoying these.</li>
            <li> Love these eyeliners! The colors are great and they go on very well. A very well made pencil for a great price!</li>
            <li> They have a weird smell. When you sharpen then it, the eyeliner inside breaks off. I didn&#x27;t receive the colors mentioned they substituted colors. The main reason I ordered this was for the colors not given to me.</li>
            <li> I  liked the eyeliners would like it if they were longer lasting...For better results add  translucent powder to area you are  using eyeliner on... Pretty colors!</li>
            <li> So, I read the reviews that were raving about these, so I went for it. Theses things are great!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the white on my waterline and it goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;For lining my eyes, they work great, really pigmented and creamy. I see nothing wrong with them at all, even the packaging was a lot nicer than I expected.</li>
            <li> None of the colors I received were the same as shown in the picture. I received more blues than expected and none of the colors were exactly like the picture, the orange wasn&#x27;t there either.</li>
            <li> These are better than i expected. Love the different colors that come with. Didn&#x27;t smudge as much as my Maybeline does.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for beginners it&#x27;s easy to take of and if your a person like me that can&#x27;t get the right design you could keep on starting over</li>
            <li> I love the colors that came, they&#x27;re pretty good materials. I have sensitive skin, especially around my eyes and these liners do not break me out at all, i do use eye primer to keep the color deep set so it doesn&#x27;t bleed, when i used them without the primer, the color bled quite a bit. Im also AA and im VERY HAPPY with the amount of pigmentation in the colors, they are vivid and noticable and they make my eyes pop! Very satisfied with this purchase, easy buy and it shipped sooner than i expected. THANKS!</li>
            <li> There really nice quality vibrant and blend able. This my second time with these eyeliners</li>
            <li> This came with a bunch if bright colors that truly show up well. They aren&#x27;t all the colors that are shown in the photo but I knew that from previous comment and I didn&#x27;t mind. I think they were defiantly worth buying, perfect for some cosplay a I plan to do!</li>
            <li> I dont know why ibwas ever nervous about ordering these, but when I recieved them and immediately pulled them all out for inspection I was thrilled. I made sure to have the correct amount, colors, abd bo duplicates. All was there. I then opened each pencil to mark my skin to see exactly how it would look on me (and also making sure that there weren&#x27;t any empty pencils like previous posters have stated) There was no issue. The ONLY thing I have to say about these pencils that isnt flattering is that they smell like. Yaegermesiter. And I probably spelled that wrong. The smell is only noticed if you actually smell the pencil, or maybe for less than a minute during application. Not the whole time. So it really doesnt bother me at all. I would recommend this to anyone looking for colorful eyeliner&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliners they give my makeup case a professional look and feel!</li>
            <li> LOVE THEM WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> My wife likes the variety of colors to choose from. Glides on very easily. Stays all evening. Colors are very visible. No foundation required,</li>
            <li> I use the bright colors on my water line for a &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; of color... goes on smoothe and very silky.</li>
            <li> These colors are wonderful better then some of the more expensive pencils I have used, nice travel pack and i have yet had to sharpen them</li>
            <li> Their just ok...shipping was excellent....eyeliners are not thick enough ,can&#x27;t really see the colored ones on me ...only the black is good... But not worth the price for me... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these....</li>
            <li> some of these look better on top, others on the bottom. great colors and you can sharpen it.</li>
            <li> I would definitely order these again.  They are highly pigmented and very creamy.  They do smear a bit, but I just work with it. They do have a funny, kind of sweet smell when you take them out of the package, but it lightens up after a while.  I got the exact colors that were advertized.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Love this liner! It goes on like butter and stays on! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i love this colors are really good and the price it&#x27;s excellent i&#x27;m sure i would come back to buy this item</li>
            <li> They arrived fast and work great... Go on creamy and very bright colors, no duplicates.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Works great and it came in basically the next day. I seriously can&#x27;t believe how affordable this was.</li>
            <li> This product is incredible for the price. The colors are all so bright and vibrant and the shipping was unbelievably fast. Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I am really happy with these eyeliners! They are so smooth and they glide on easy. The colors are so vibrant and bright. One thing that would make it even better is if I had a sharpener. I&#x27;m really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazing pencils. great for lip liners as well.</li>
            <li> The price is great and the color variety is awesome. They last a decent amount of time too.</li>
            <li> very smooth and creamy... love all the colors. A must have product.</li>
            <li> it would have been nice to have the color names listed out.&lt;br /&gt;The Red I thought I was going to get was really pink.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped fast and without damage.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, soft and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I simply wanted a variety of colors for those random days I wanted a pop of color but didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot on something I wouldn&#x27;t use too often. These are perfect for me. They aren&#x27;t as long lasting as other eyeliners but they are decent and go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Great color choices and pretty decent pigmentation and application. I bought the set mainly for the gold liner but was slightly disappointed in it. The gold is more of a copper color and not so much gold. However the colors do match the color indication on the end of the pencil pretty well. For the price they were so worth it even if the gold wasn&#x27;t as expected.</li>
            <li> These liners are awesome super smooth to apply and very colorful! Get them ;)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about these, but I definitely don&#x27;t regret purchasing them--the colors are great and it is easy to apply.  The only &amp;#34;slightly annoying&amp;#34; thing with these, is that you have to reapply about every two hours, because the liner just seems to disappear--but at least it isn&#x27;t making my eyes look like clown eyes. Very much worth the price, would recommend--these would also make a great gift for the makeup daredevil or makeup junkie in your life.</li>
            <li> These work great, although you may need to reapply they are great for the price. The colors are all pretty vibrant except the browns require multiple strokes to retain color.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, works great! I love it! Great product quality!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors, glide on great. Some of the colors fall a little over the day, but using eye shadow over top helps with that. Good value.</li>
            <li> Love them..!! fast service, great product got all the colors absolutely will buy again; thank u...</li>
            <li> The product was not the quality I expected, is a hard pencil, is not smooth to the eye.</li>
            <li> These pencils r so gud for the pruce, love them, they r highly pigmented n i recommend anyone who wanna buy cheap but gud pencils to try these for sure</li>
            <li> these are perfect. they are soft and easy to apply, they last a long time and are very easy to store and travel with. I&#x27;d buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors. They are nice &amp; soft I love how easily they blend*; 0)</li>
            <li> Dear sirs. I secured the order, remained is happy with purchase. I wish you the udachnkh of sales of warm responses from buyers and happiness in new year. Yours faithfully, your client Sergey.</li>
            <li> I really Like the Italia Eyeliners Set of 12.The colors work on Dark tone Skin.Will be getting more products like this from Italia.</li>
            <li> These are nice...not super high quality, but soft enough to blend. They stayed on all day. I ended up with 3 blues and 2 purples which are not colors I use, but the others are much more neutral (black, brown, tan, copper, silver, white, green, etc.) which is good.</li>
            <li> the colors I got a little different from the colors in the picture.  the pigment is great lasts for quite a long time and comes off with a small damp towel or a little bit of lotion.  Its colors are great especially if you like to experiment or simply love makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a retired aesthetician and use to by and use only high end products. In my more mature years I keep my make up simple. These are terrific quality, vivid colors and go on so smoothly. I always go over it with a brush to blend it out a tad and any pencil liner will stay on longer that way. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Accidentally came across these liners. They smell nice and apply very easy. Love love it.  Introduced it to our beauty group on FB, to say the least, at least between 5-10 girls ordered these liners, and said &amp;#34;thank u to me&amp;#34; :)Totally recommend ! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Well, I was pleasantly surprised when these great eyeliners arrived.  I love them.  They are creamy and stay on without caking up or melting in the harsh reality of Summertime Heat.  I feel like I am ready to head to Italy now that I have such lovely eyeliner to use.  Love all of them!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I received 12 different colors, two shades of pink ROSA &amp; PEARL PINK, two shades of purple LAVENDER &amp; PURPLE, three shades of blue ELECTRIC BLUE, NEON BLUE, &amp; ROYAL BLUE, two shades of brown GOLD &amp; LIGHT BROWN, one shade of green GREEN, and two dark shades BLACK &amp; GRAY. I initially bought this A for the cheap price, and B for the white pencil, which I did not receive. I contacted customer support and they happily sent me a WHITE pencil at no charge too me. So I received 13 pencils for the price listed. GREAT customer service. The liner is smooth and stays on all day with a light light dusting of white shadow powder and looks great all day! Worth the price I am very pleased with this purchase and will defiantly purchase again!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t go on like I wanted it too. And with in a hour it was off. Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Amazing very fast delivery and the eyeliners are so pigmented and the colors are gorgeous! Can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very bright and look just like the colors printed on the outside. But they don&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like. I don&#x27;t use the black one at all if I can help it because they smudge very easily. I&#x27;ll end up with racoon eyes by lunch time if I use their black instead of my L&#x27;Oreal black.&lt;br /&gt;They go on EXTREMELY easy. I was actually surprised how easy they were to apply to my eyelid. No constantly wetting every time I needed to apply another line :)</li>
            <li> Good color variety.  Longer length pencil makes it easy to do precise lines.  Pencil is softer than it looks and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Lots of colors for the price, but I find I only use two or three.</li>
            <li> They are so so the eyeliner Runs</li>
            <li> Great buy and colors are vibrant</li>
            <li> needs a good sharpener...rather soft for the reg. type</li>
            <li> Love the colors. They are very creamy and glide on smoothly. They also blend easily because the texture is so smooth. All of the colors are great! They show up as they were marked,and even look amazing on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> I like them a lot. I have a very oily face and when I wear colored eyeliner it usually rubs off, this one didnt, only a little bit but the rest stayed. I was super surprised that it didnt rub off. I highly recommend them!</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughters Xmas and then my wife and mother and mother in law all wanted them because they are so nice. So I had to buy a few more. Not problem for a well priced item.</li>
            <li> I just received these today and i love them the colors are gorgeous and the liners are creamy and smooth!</li>
            <li> Love these! True to color swatches in photo. Glides on easily, shipped quickly. Perfect for building a makeup collection. Two thumbs up</li>
            <li> These are the creamiest eyeliners I have ever used in my life. They&#x27;re absolutely amazing and incredibly pigmented. It comes with gold, silver, pink, black, and a light and dark blue, purple, green, and brown.</li>
            <li> 16 year old granddaughter loves the gift.</li>
            <li> Cheap, don&#x27;t last on eyes, poor quality, step done from drug store</li>
            <li> These eye liners are by far the best quality.lasts all day.outlasts all the other brands that I buy. I also purchased the lip liners and eye shadow matte from italia. The packaging was secure and were in perfect condition. Love the colors I can mix and blend these liners with ease. The pencils are strong and tips do not break off.</li>
            <li> Nice colors, stay on easy application. Great dral</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t receive the same color eyeliner as pictured.</li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to make up. These eyeliners are amazing! Several colors, goes on very easily. I love these!</li>
            <li> delivery fast!!! The color is so nice they are smooth and nice..... stay on more time with premier but I love it</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of cheap makeup...I mean come on I can buy more of it and really don&#x27;t lose too much quality. These eyeliner pencils are fantastic! They came before expected with a sharpener, they go on smooth, and are surprisingly pigmented. I am very very happy since I enjoy using a color liner above my usual black liner..and now I have 12! SO happy and would definitely recommend these to any beauty freak on a budget.</li>
            <li> They arrived early and I am so happy with this product and service. They go on very smooth and are vibrant. A variety of colors and very long pencils so they will last long! :) Thank you!</li>
            <li> product is great, very bright! there is def a smell to them but it doesnt smell bad, kinda sweet.. very happy with product</li>
            <li> all the colors are fun... but at least 3 or 4 are 2 light to be of much use (they don&#x27;t really show up...)  They aren&#x27;t quite fine enough a tip for a crisp eyeliner, and almost too fine a tip for an eyeshadow.  But I blend them and use a q tip to mix the shades  - so I am enjoying the Italia Eyeliners.  They don&#x27;t last quite a whole 9 hour work day - start looking pretty faded.  But, I&#x27;d still recommend.  Great price  And I love playing with makeup!</li>
            <li> i bought these for my makeup kit and i love them a lot they are very easy to apply</li>
            <li> Requested by and purchased for my teenager. She loves them.</li>
            <li> great quality and price!</li>
            <li> THESE EYELINERS ARE AWESOME!!!!!!! THE ARE SO PIGMENTED AND THEY GO ON LIKE A GEL! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure about these. The colors are kind of our there for me. But, I guess once I try the different colors I will probably be happy with them.</li>
            <li> If you love lots of color choices this is a great buy. Also since using have had No smudging or running, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Def worth the buy!</li>
            <li> they are not of the best quality but the price was right. need to soften them with match but be careful not to melt</li>
            <li> I think I got all the best colors. Super happy.</li>
            <li> I got these for Xmas gifts and knone liked them they don&#x27;t set and smear all over I&#x27;m not happy with this item</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t wear make up, but I started experimenting with my &amp;#34;inner girl&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m loving these creamy eyeliner pencils in every color under the rainbow!  Great price and quality product. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This item came super fast which is awesome. I just need an eyeliner for my waterline so I was going to try these out. They did not work for me but I use them as lip liner!!</li>
            <li> Received this eyeliner set only 2 days after I ordered it...surprised to see it had shipped so quickly. Given the extremely low cost of this eye pencil set, I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting dinner quality; these pencils are fabulous! The colors are absolutely gorgeous and payoff is comparable to high-end pencils I&#x27;ve reluctantly purchased. They have a great gel consistency that allows them to glide easily across the skin without tugging or pulling the dedicate skin surrounding the eye. The intense shades last the day without needing to reapply the product despite temps in the high 90&#x27;s. Overall this is an amazing product that&#x27;s shockingly inexpensive for it&#x27;s quality. Have already recommended it to several clients and friends.</li>
            <li> they are great! they go on smooth the only thing is I wish black would have came with them in this package</li>
            <li> Oddly this kit does not include a black, but that&#x27;s the only negative I can find with these beauties.&lt;br /&gt;The colors I recieved resemble the hand with swatches pic. I got a white, which is important to me.&lt;br /&gt;They are very creamy, but hold well with a powder eyeshadow applied over. The colors are rich, saturated &amp; true. They do not oxidize. For the price these babies can not be beat! I am delighted!</li>
            <li> I really really love these!!! All go on really smooth and the colors are so in depth!!! I was like omg omg omg !!</li>
            <li> The pencils were great quality! They were soft enough so that it didn&#x27;t peek your eye out but hard enough to be put on well and not fall apart. The colors are bright and gorgeous and they don&#x27;t smear or smudge like a lot of eyeliners do. They didn&#x27;t smudge at all and I have really oily eyelids. I read some reviews that people were having issues with smudging and I was skeptical but I am very happy to have these and I am very pleased with them!</li>
            <li> if you have oily skin these kind of eyeliner pencils are not for you. It ends up looking like you smudge eyeliner all over your eye.</li>
            <li> I just got my italia eyeliner 12 pack in the mail. I have to say I am impressed with the product this far. The colors are great and go on very easily. They are &amp;#34;creamier&amp;#34; than most eyeliners I have used and I absolutely love that. It seems they are much easier to &amp;#34;play with&amp;#34; and apply than others. They also arrived earlier than I expected. (I have had allergic reactions to some eyeliners but no swelling or burning with this product so far ) :)</li>
            <li> strange colors in this lot...not impressed</li>
            <li> I can not express how much I love this product. They are great. Colors are perfect an they last all day when you put them on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these!!!!!</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly... I got a nice variety of colors, including white, black, and a few metallic ones. Depending on where I put it, I don&#x27;t have to reapply it... I&#x27;d buy this again or for a friend or whatever. It was like eight bucks, and I&#x27;m perfectly happy to pay that price for [much better] quality [than I thought I&#x27;d get] eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with these, the colors are almost the same ones pictured, go on smooth, nice bold colors, worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> The colors are great, just like the picture :)</li>
            <li> I received a set of 12 different colors as pictured. They are vivid, glide on smoothly and last long. Works well on lashline and waterline.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy</li>
            <li> Great price for so many!</li>
            <li> received super fast in the mail with standard shipping and absolutely love the product!!</li>
            <li> It comes out very vibrantly and it smells like bubblegum!</li>
            <li> these are so amazing and I&#x27;m so happy I bought them. such a great buy</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price, going to be ordering another one  for a friend of mine she was here when they came in! AWESOME product and AWESOME Price thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Loveeeeee. Got all the colours in the pic :P</li>
            <li> Just got mine in the mail. I love all the colors. I didn&#x27;t get all the ones in the photo but I&#x27;m not picky and love them all. They are long So I no I will be using theses for awhile. I had a pproblem with my tracking but the seller fixed it all. I&#x27;m a Very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Excellent. My wife loves the product. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Love these! They are so creamy! Colors are brilliant and beautiful!</li>
            <li> They are super pigmented and creamy!&lt;br /&gt;There arrive like 2 weeks before expected! I got 3 differents shades of brown and I did not get any purple one as the picture shows but they still being really nice eyeliners and for a very good price !</li>
            <li> The best lip liners and eyeliner I have</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, I have super super amounts of fun with these colors.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, been having fun using them as lipliners. Great price.</li>
            <li> They are extremely dry ... My eyes itch when I use them and the color isn&#x27;t strong. Yes they are cheap but they don&#x27;t worth it. At least not for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get a white, but I did get a silver color along with all the other colors. The color payoff is good. It smells like bubblegum to me but hey. My pencils are soft and glide easy. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see the color very strong around the eye....not sure if it was the set I got or if this is how the color wears on the skin.  I&#x27;m used to Estee Lauder, MaryKay or MAC eyeliners that you SEE and so can others when applied.</li>
            <li> These were amazing I loved the creamy consents</li>
            <li> These are a great buy.  Nice and creamy, goes on smooth!! What a fantastic deal!</li>
            <li> I ordered these Monday they arrived on Wednesday I could not be more happy highly pigmented creamy colors are great!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews on here, terrible I know, but as soon as I received this and tried it out I fell in love! I&#x27;m African American and these colors pop so well! I feel like a lot of colored eye liners aren&#x27;t as vibrant against my skin but these are fantastic. Great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> All the eyeliner I would Buy smudged easily but these eyeliners are pretty and they don&#x27;t come off easy. I love them</li>
            <li> I loved this eyeliner!! Very good quality, nice colors. Except for the light purple and the light brown they were too light. The brown looked more gold. And the purple looked more silver. Other than that it was great, would reccomend to anyone :)</li>
            <li> Great eyeliner.  I absolutely recommend this.  Not waterproof though.</li>
            <li> These pencils work well on my skin and go on smoothly.  The colors are nice also.</li>
            <li> For the price these are AMAZING. They are creamy, which is generally nice, but they do smudge easily. If they don&#x27;t get smudged though they seem to last all day nicely. The colors you get are not the ones shown necessarily. You get a random assortment of 12. I have pale skin and I found the metallic lavender and light green I got do not show up, but I&#x27;m sure on someone with more tan they&#x27;d look nice. The dark purple and teal though are gorgeous though. The darker colors are nicely pigmented. Totally worth $8 if you aren&#x27;t looking for a specific color.</li>
            <li> Soooo soft and creamy and I don&#x27;t really need to buy a special sharpener for it. My son&#x27;s basic pencil sharpener will do the trick just fine.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting these to be so pigmented and smooth. as soon as I swatched, I was impressed.</li>
            <li> Awesome liners, creamy and vibrant. I got a white. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> excellent quality, but for some reason, the colors have changed.  I ordered this for the first time a few weeks ago and the set included grey color. I ordered again this week for my sister, but the set no longer includes grey color and has some additional colors, etc.</li>
            <li> I honestly feel like this is the best deal I have ever gotten on Amazon! I just took a chance by getting these. I read some of the previous reviews and was very unsure about them... WOW! I heard that these were good but I wasn&#x27;t expecting great! They came in every color displayed in the picture and all of them were brand new, in perfect condition. It almost seemed like as soon as I ordered them, they appeared on my door step. Of course, as soon as I received them I swatched every single one onto my forearm. I was not disappointed at all. It absolutely exceeded my expectations. All of them are very pigmented, and the pencil glided very smoothly onto my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are all matte colors except for three of them. I believe it&#x27;s the gold, light purple, and dark green that are shimmery. I love every single one of the colors. I just wish the set had included a nude or peach shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these for my makeup kit as I am a free lancing makeup artist and I am so excited to use these on my next clients! It&#x27;s definitely a must-have!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using make-up, so I don&#x27;t have any experience to compare these against, but the colors are nice and bright and lasted most of my shift (8 hours) in a fairly physical job, so they get a thumbs up from me!</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner set by far the best I&#x27;ve used yet! The colors are bright very pretty applies and removes easily I highly recommend this eyeliner set and will definitely purchase again!! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Love love love the colors they go on soft and last a long time. They were wealth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy more of these even before I run out</li>
            <li> Received these exact colors except for the orange unless it&#x27;s the gold I have and just looks different in the picture.  The colors are super vibrant and look awesome on. The quality of these pencils is also amazing.  I was shocked over the quality because I have bought cheap pencils before and know what they can be like when applying to the eyes or lips.....not these, I was very impressed.</li>
            <li> Good price. Purchased for teen daughter. She loves the colors and likes them somewhat. She has to reapply several times a day because it doesn&#x27;t last very long. Big con- the smell Shen she first opened them was nasty!! Let them open on her dresser for about a week and then the nasty smell was gone. Ok but would not purchase anything that brand again.</li>
            <li> I  am not a make up person. But I do wear eyeliner, which my husband loves. When I came across this set of 12 colors I had to have them. They came in a matter of a few days, and they did not disappoint. Great  set would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> These liners are vibrant and glide on so easily and smoothly. They remind me of my 20 dollar liners by Urban Decay. Just as long as they last, I&#x27;ll give them a 5! For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> At first I was a bit skeptical on the quality of these since they were so cheap, but when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised! They were easy to put on, looked great, and the price was perfect! The only gripe I had was that they wiped off fairly quickly (like after a few rubs) so don&#x27;t touch your eye a lot once you have it on! But I seriously love the colors and for the price, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it if you&#x27;re looking to experiment with makeup. The pigments are great, and will last all day. Its almost overwhelming how many new color eyeliners you have. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Its really soft and awesome... love the colors...</li>
            <li> It was not the same brand... NOT ITALIA</li>
            <li> Pretty good eyeliners. Wish they came in other colors.they apply smoothly. Would be nice to have a set with more vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are wonderful, but these smudge too easily on my eyes, even with an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Packaged exactly as shown! Love them, vivid and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Wonderful set colors are superb</li>
            <li> arrived on time I bought this for my niece she loves It.  Stays on all day.</li>
            <li> So smooth and fantastic colors. They are bright and stay on nicely. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The colors are great. Very vivid. Shipping was timely and packaged well.amazing buy for the price. Very happy, I&#x27;d recommend. :)</li>
            <li> For the price, these eyeliners are pretty great. Bold colors and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase of the Italia Eyeliners set of 12. For less than $8, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I read a bunch of the reviews which seemed good and thought I&#x27;d go ahead and purchase them. I am very pleased. I own brands such as Urban Decay 24/7 and Smashbox Limitless eyeliners and I actually like these better. Very creamy, glides on pretty easily and highly pigmented. I always set my eyeliner with a matching eyeshadow and these liners last all day for me and don&#x27;t smudge. Love the colors too.</li>
            <li> Beautiful Colors and Works Great,Glides on my eyelid and is perfect for cosplay and Halloween and everyday wear! Great at blending and Yes it smudges but what eyeliner doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> The colors were vibrant and beautiful. It glides on easily and so smooth. I don&#x27;t like lining my eyes so I used it for my lips instead. The only reason I didn&#x27;t rate 5 stars, I was missing 4 of the liners. My set only had 8 when it should of had 12. I guess it happens now and then, production malfunctions, but the colors really are fabulous. I would recommend, just with more of a caution. ;) (I lined and filled with these liners, eyeliner is perfectly safe for lips!)</li>
            <li> The pencils are easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Some colors are more vibrant than others.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m wearing neon green in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;It is very pretty and glides on easily, however the metallic colors (like the shimmery copper) barely show up.&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise the colors lasted almost all day(without a primer) with occasional touch ups throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for 3 stars is the color selection.&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping to get more of an experimental rainbow set with reds, yellows, and oranges...but most of the colors I received were variation of blue and green.</li>
            <li> I love these!! They are amazing! So creamy! Not gritty at all like some eyeliners! The colors are assorted so its kinda fun to see what you will get. I just got these in the mail today and immediately placed an order for more. Be careful because they do smudge a bit, so try to set it with some powder. For the price of these, this is the best deal ever!</li>
            <li> Crappy eyeliner . Don&#x27;t even think it&#x27;s eyeliner ... Waste of money .</li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors, glide on easily. Excellent price too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these as eye liners I use them as lip liners and they&#x27;re excellent</li>
            <li> pretty colors and very nice</li>
            <li> My expectations were higher. I read the reviews saying the pencils didn&#x27;t stay on. Primer potion and setting powder should be able to fix that, but they don&#x27;t, and I don&#x27;t have oily eyelids, either. The pencils are creamy-- not as creamy as high end brands like Urban Decay, Nars, Mac, and surprisingly, not as creamy as drugstore brands like NYX, Rimmel, L&#x27;Oreal, or Wet n&#x27; Wild. These are pretty low-end. The colors are nice, good color pay-off and pigmentation. Nice selection of colors, too. The thing that gets me the most though-- the smell! I can&#x27;t get over it! The second I opened the package I noticed this weird, chemical-ly smell. On closer [sniffing] examination, I noticed the smell was exponentially worse when I uncapped them. It&#x27;s the cream pigment itself! On the other hand, my mother was nonplussed by the smell, and took them when I said I wouldn&#x27;t use them. Maybe they are rancid? Not sure. Even if they didn&#x27;t have a smell, I would not repurchase. Drugstore brands are creamier, scentless, and stay on better.</li>
            <li> I wish the color center were a bit softer.  Maybe I am just more sensitive to things on my eyes, but most of the &amp;#34;pencil&amp;#34; type of eyeliners seem to be too hard the effectively transfer to the eyelid.  The colors are nice and varied.  Probably a lifetime supply!</li>
            <li> Very smooth! The black one is SUPER smudgy, but I haven&#x27;t had that problem with the other colors. Dedicate the black one to smoky eye days!</li>
            <li> Gift for grand daughters.  They loved this set more than anything else!</li>
            <li> these are great colors and slide on with out smearing or fading love them highly recommend for anyone who likes to chages their eyeliner color</li>
            <li> I love them! They are soft and worth every penny :) technically there are 11 Eye pencils and one lip pencil (its the pink one) liners come in bubble rap and an extra clear plastic lining inside ! Lip (soft pink), eye liners (royal blue) ,( purple), ( violet), (satin blue), (white), (green), (sky teal) , (gold), (light brown) , (green forest) and (BLACK) !!!!!!! I will be purchasing more in the future !!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors (white is not in the kit).  Goes on so smooth with no tugging on the eye.  I did not experience any running on the eye after having on for the day.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> I got these hoping I would like them, and I love them! Great selection of colors, and they last through sweat, tears, it doesn&#x27;t matter!</li>
            <li> The color of these liners is much more vivid than I expected. They are creamy and easy to apply. I wish there was a red one, but other than that I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> I love them  they are amazing I use them for everything won&#x27;t be disappointed if u bye these</li>
            <li> Smooth, glide right on, great colors these are great will purchase more in the near future</li>
            <li> Cute colors, goes on easily, great price. However, they smudge so easily. Even with eye shadow primer, there is noticeable smudging in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Great product, I got them for my mom and she uses them all the time and wants me to find her some lip liners like these :)</li>
            <li> These are perfect they go on smooth and great for lips as well as eyes...</li>
            <li> Great buy at a great price. Will buy again &amp; it shipped in two days</li>
            <li> BOUGHT FOR MY DAUGHTER.  SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL AND DECLARES UNDYING LOVE OF ME AND THE PENCILS SO I AM GUESSING THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented, can&#x27;t beat them for the price.  Worth much more given the number of color choices and the quality.  Not Urban Decay quality, but still well worth it for the bargain shopper.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by this purchase.  I bought it based on other positive reviews and am so happy I did.  Creamy eyeliners and beautiful assortment of color !</li>
            <li> Requires at least 2-3 repeated stokes to make the color visible on the skin. On top of that it smudges. Nice set of colors though!!</li>
            <li> Colors are true to the photos they are easy to put on and are amazing quality especially for their price I  got the package in two days very please with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> Best price for 12 eyeliners ever! I loved this product. It was very cheap and they did what they were supposed to! I loved all of the different colors!</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners. I used the pink and brown to contour my lips LOL. They are all wonderful. I do love the smell of these liners. They smell awesome LOL. Good quality and well packaged. I will definitely buy again for my bff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful, all of the pencils came in beautiful colors with a great constancy. Would highly recommend these, they last very long and you are definitely given more than your moneys worth!</li>
            <li> I rarely rate any product five stars but I can&#x27;t find anything bad to say about this set of pencils, especially for the price. I received a variety of colors, including white, black, several shades of blue and green, purple, lavender, pink, brown, and gold. Some of the colors are more intense than others - I find the lavender and gold, for example, a little light, but they all go on smoothly and most of them have very good color. They do wear off after several hours and can smudge -- but I don&#x27;t think any more than most drug-store brands costing $5-$10 each, and even some premium brands that cost $20. I use a primer, which helps. After application, I use a q-tip with one end dipped in a bit of moisturizer to remove smudging underneath the eyes. Applying a little powder or light eye shadow also helps the colors stay put.</li>
            <li> Great for this price!!! They r nice unique colors... Love it!!</li>
            <li> I did not get all the colors in the picture. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> these eyeliners are great. they stay on all day. love the colors. you could mix and match.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal, Awesome colors. Great price, quality product, goes on smooth and bright, this is coming from a die-hard MAC fan/user.  My profession is Makeup Artist and face painter and this is a great addition for professional &amp; non-professional use.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this purchase! All the colors are beautiful and application glides on silky smooth. Stays put also, no smudging.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much,&lt;br /&gt;Debra</li>
            <li> So I ordered the liners on Sep 19. I got them on sep. 22! That was some fast shipping.  I did some swatches and they mark like butter. Very smooth and creamy.the colors are so bright! Thank u!</li>
            <li> good deal with not much money, shipping fast and good condition. though this product need sharpening when you use it for a certain amount of time, it looks good!</li>
            <li> Live the variety of colors you get in this package for such a great price. They go on smooth without hassle and are very true to color.</li>
            <li> i wanted matte finish liners and they are shimmer toned.... but they are good for a slight under eyes glow</li>
            <li> The colors do not show up on my skin at all I have tried it as a top, bottom and lip liner does not show on either</li>
            <li> They came in a nice plastic bag that is easy to carry around in my bag. They glide on easily and I use them all of the time. I love these eyelines and would recomend my friends get these as well.</li>
            <li> I didnt receive the black color :(</li>
            <li> i love them all well most of the like only one of the colors did not work for me but other then that there are nice they go on smoothly the wont stab you eye and the can also be used a lip liner because they are so soft the color are pretty</li>
            <li> Great experience with these, They stay on your eyes for most of the day. I&#x27;m Mexican and didn&#x27;t think some of the colors would show, but that are perfect. I received them in a timely manner and got exactly what I was expecting. Great deal for gifts or yourself!</li>
            <li> If your looking for colors besides black to put on your eyes this is the s***!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> liners are too stiff; drag eyelid along with tip, and leave no color unless you hold eyelid with fingertip, and then eyelid is painful</li>
            <li> For the price, a great product.  Nice color selection and easy to apply.  Great for experimenting with colors and looks.</li>
            <li> A variety o colors! Just used a bit but for the price i guess is worth it.. It does has alot pigmentation</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, I am just bad at applying makeup so it ends up looking a bit clowny ;)&lt;br /&gt;All of the colors shown arrived! I use the white and purple the most.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how pigmented and soft these liners are! At this price point, I highly recommend this set. Every color is bright and luxurious. These are some of the best liners I&#x27;ve ever owned. Stayed on from 5pm to midnight, outdoors, flawlessly. It stayed longer than my eyeshadow. Setting the liner with a powder would make it stay for days. Some are more metallic than others when applied, but only slightly. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The pink shown is brighter in real life; my camera is not very good.</li>
            <li> Good color payoff but it does crease/fade.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners leave a strip of color that can sort of fall off your eyelids and leave droopy color under your eyes. Some colors are better than others.</li>
            <li> Nice set for the price. Goes on very smooth and colors look nice and bright. The black and silver are my favorite colors out of the bunch.&lt;br /&gt;Will most likely order again.</li>
            <li> These are Real nice colors and great deal, but they run under my eyes. Oh well, I&#x27;ll give them away.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are every bit as good, if not better, than some other expensive brands that I have tried in the past.  They are good quality and do not bother my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> Older wrinkly lids love the  ease of application. Thank you folks. I&#x27;m loving them.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU FOR THE EYELINERS AND FOR THE FAST SHIPPING. LOVE THE LINERS VERY NICE PRODUCT GO&#x27;S ON VERY NICE. GLAD I BOUGHT TWO ONE FOR ME AND ONE AS A GIFT THANK YOU</li>
            <li> i bought these to have cool new liner looks, they were such a great but at first i was iffy about them but they came in pretty fast and when i opened the package and they were such amazing colors and i thought i was going to get a white but i didn&#x27;t i immedetly emailed the seller and they sent me the white pencil free i was in love with set!</li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and in good condition. My only gripe is that they&#x27;re not the colors shown in the image. No pink, lavender, purple or sky blue. I guess that it&#x27;s not the end of the world, but if you&#x27;ve got your heart set on one of the colors, you might want to order another product.</li>
            <li> They took a while to be delivered but they were worth the wait. High pigmented, goes on smooth, and so many colors you can wear with anything.</li>
            <li> Are perfect, there were asked what good would sort . I am so happy i sent. I recommend that you ask will Not regret</li>
            <li> I love all of the beautiful colors they really stand out bold. They are creamy so they roll on pretty easy! I will recommend this product to someone else. They came earlier than what I expected!! I was happy about that and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li> The product is of very good quality, arrived at the indicated time !! excellent thanks.</li>
            <li> I have not used them yet but I&#x27;ll rate on the time it took me to get them, they came in the time alotted.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a variety of colors and was happy to find this one.  Lots to choose from, and the price was right.  Shipped on time and in good condition when arrived.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are amazing, so creamy and the value of color and intensity is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everybody, in fact most of my friends have been ordering them online :)</li>
            <li> Love love love love love these!!!! I really didn&#x27;t expect anything good from them but honestly these are the best inexpensive eyeliners I habe ever tried!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Some of these colors are nice and vibrant and bright and smooth just like I wanted but a couple are just eh not much pigment. I do love the good ones tho. :) they do last all day on my lower lash line.</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality eye liners for a fabulous price.  Love this!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter for Christmas. As a teen, she loves to try out new looks and experiment with makeup. She loved ow these look, and how they glide on smoothly with nice coverage, not too much, not too light. Would definitely recommend these, great value.</li>
            <li> Added  new colors to my eyeliner game 👌 applys nice</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are amazing! I love the colors, they&#x27;re bright and shiny, some have glitter and some are matte. However... They smell really gross! It&#x27;s like they were painted with a nasty smelling chemical paint. I do think, however, that if they are kept out of the original packaging for long enough the smell will probably go away. They&#x27;re very beautiful; they tie almost any look together perfectly! The colors are royal blue, electric blue, chocolate, green, purple, black, white, lavender, gold (more of a bronze), sky blue, hot pink, and silver. I would definitely recommend this purchase, even considering the smell. I love them, and the actual makeup is scentless... just the outside of the pencils.</li>
            <li> No repeat colours,  no black (got enough of those,  thank you)  just nice pencils that actually stay on for hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again,  no problem.</li>
            <li> Colors did not come as pictured.  I ordered for specific colors.</li>
            <li> They came very promptly (within a week or so) and have fabulous staying power. They do smudge slightly (especially when you&#x27;re wearing which can be a drag because concealer combining with black eyeliner combines to make a very dirty eye look) but this can be fixed if you swipe a brush right under the liner to form it in the shape you want it to be. Setting powder is recommended. The colors are also very nice, though I usually like to use the purple, black, brown, and indigo. Gold is gorgeous though because it has a very metallic shine to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with the eyeliners,they are so creamy.</li>
            <li> I love it!.. Highly recommended.. Fast delivery, good packaging. No complaints whatsoever for this product. I will definitely be ordering some more for my collection. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These were great to use in a bridemaid&#x27;s gift bag. The price on these 12 made it really cheap per piece to add to a gift bag.</li>
            <li> These are so worth the price. From other reviews you can see the colors. They are vibrant and don&#x27;t run or bleed.</li>
            <li> love it!!!! very soft and glide-able great colors perfect for face art</li>
            <li> I just received my order, and was a bit worried that I was not going to receive the liners intended, but to my surprise I received every color! I was looking for something that had a pop of color, and these beauties were exactly what I was looking for.....intense color, ease application, and very pigmented!  The only con is they will smudge if not set properly...keeping that in mind I am very pleased with my order, and glad that I took the risk! Try to go with a seller that have high ratings (recently) and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be as pleased as I was</li>
            <li> Very impressed! Esspecially bc they were very reasonably priced!!! The pigmentation is amazing and sooo easy to appy!!!</li>
            <li> great price and good product.</li>
            <li> I love these liners. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Love these liners. They line so smoothly! ❤. Someone suggested these liners on Instagram so I ordered and tried them out myself and they are great!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the variety of these rich colors. Looks amazing and accents my eyes brilliantly. Wonderful product. Would definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> awesome product at great price!! i got all the exact colors as shown. they are smooth and easy to use. will definitely recommend it to friends! still can&#x27;t believe i could get twelve fab pencils at such a low price!!</li>
            <li> these colours are so pigmented for liners.... gosh I love them.. definitely a very good purchase for the price... I will definitely be ordering this again.... I will recommend this to anyone and I am dark skinned</li>
            <li> Love this product great pigment!!!!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliners and at great price. Im very happy.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;m not the most girly girl &amp; do bare minimum makeup for work. These are perfect! Easy to use, lasts long &amp; bery beautiful colors! Definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> i ordered these eyeliners just a few days ago and i must say i am super happy they are here! i received them super fast and the colors are AMAZING! they are very pigmented and apply on super smoothly. im really happy with my purchase and will be purchasing them again! 5 stars to this seller! &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> OMG! They are REALLY good!!!! 5 stars! And it&#x27;s so cheap! I&#x27;ll buy them again, for sure!</li>
            <li> Nice and unique colors, the lighter ones need to be applied thicker to be seen, but over all very nice</li>
            <li> These are great! The price is unbeatable for what you get. They glide on smoothly and last all day. The colors are very vivid. I have very fair skin and I&#x27;ve had to tone down a few of the darker colors to keep them from looking too gawdy. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with them and will likely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> the item is adentical to the photo shown.however,some color does not have a great color payoff  when used or it fades away very fast</li>
            <li> Love these! Fun and easy! I usually don&#x27;t even wear eyeliner but I had to try these! Compliments everywhere I went and it&#x27;s fun to experiment with different colors</li>
            <li> I bought these and was hoping that I would like a few of them. They were not expensive so even if a few were blah it would still be worth it. I am so shocked and pleasantly surprised. They are very creamy and glide on smoothly. They also blend easily because the texture is so smooth. Now let me tell you about the colors. They are stunningly bright and beautiful. There are a few metallics like bronze, silver and gold. There are a few pastels like lilac, baby blue and baby pink. Then the rest are bold and bright colors like hot pink and teal. Also the set comes with a white pencil that is the same quality as NXY jumbo pencil in Milk. I can&#x27;t tell you how pleased i am that I ordered these. My only con, which really isn&#x27;t much of a con because I usually do this anyways, but you should set the color with the same or similar color shadow because they will smudge. Once set they have great staying power.</li>
            <li> I love them! Too bad my all my make up got stolen lol</li>
            <li> Beautiful vivid colors that go on smoothly. Great price. I wear my eyeliner rather thick and this brand tends to smudge easily but I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> The colors come out vary good on your eye. But as 10mins go by you see it smuggled other places. I burned the tips of mine and they work alittle better.  I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> They are good and last long but i expected a black liner to be there too which was not the case.</li>
            <li> Love them colors are bright was fast shipping and mine were all there diff buying again ☺️😁😘</li>
            <li> I bought these when I decided I was going to start getting &amp;#34;more serious&amp;#34; about makeup. For the price, these really make a great beginner set. Even now that I&#x27;ve started building a better and more expensive makeup collection, I would still recommend these. The price is unbeatable for the quality. They&#x27;re vibrant with smooth and silky application that lasts for awhile. My only tiny gripe is that the caps on mine tended to come off rather easily which lead to some messy moments in my makeup bag. Other than that these are a steal that you shouldn&#x27;t pass up!</li>
            <li> I have this product . I love all of the colors that they give you .I have used all of the colors.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners! They blend smoothly with other colours or sit well by themselves. They last long. Great colours. Not cheaply made. You can tell by sharpening when the wood doesn&#x27;t splinter. Happy with my purchase. 😊</li>
            <li> Arrived early in the delivery timeframe given.  Happy to see they are of such excellent quality.  Have paid much more for much less, that ended up in the trash.  Caps make a click-sound that seals so pencils won&#x27;t dry out, and get hard.  Made in China, and done well this time.  Pencil material is of proper consistency for a change.  Navy, Olive and Maroon or Rose wd be better color choices than sky blue and grass green, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind.  Wd gladly pay double if colors were all cosmetically useful.  Gold and White were good modern choices.  Black, charcoal, browns all good too.  Excellent overall purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price, and a nice variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I love these liner pencils. They glide on great. If you have greasy eyelids I recommend the Italian liquid liner instead of the pencils. Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but they aren&#x27;t as vibrant as it shows in the picture. But still are very pretty colors and the pencils are very smooth to apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love !! Who ever said affordable makeup doesn&#x27;t work as good as expensive makeup hasn&#x27;t tried these eyeliners.. I&#x27;m gonna order this brands eyeshadow next :) very pleased !</li>
            <li> Great price for great quality eyeliners. My package arrived on time, nothing was broken and, the colors look exactly like they do on the bottom of the eyeliner. Amazing!</li>
            <li> As it is written! excellent .... thanks!</li>
            <li> They are made in the US not Italy. Any way I was expecting to see silver but no such luck. Some of the pencils are soft like the black, others - not so soft. I guess for the prize it&#x27;s ok but ok is not really enough for me - I would have preferred to be happier with the color selection.</li>
            <li> another gift for my daughter, she liked it</li>
            <li> soft application, bold colors, perfect white....each eyeliner is gorgeous and the BEST I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> love them I would buy from them again</li>
            <li> Good eyeliners, and as an Italian I was pleasantly surprised by the non greasy and hairness of the set.  Colors are nice, no repeats, and they go on smooth and easy like Sunday morning.</li>
            <li> For the price? This is quite the bargain to stumble upon. The color caps in the photo to this product are light so in person the product colors are darker and much more suitable for use. Upon swatching I found that the metallic colors (green, dark and light purple, blue,  green, brown, copper toned gold) were still creamy enough but not as much as the solid colors. The lip liner is this red toned hot pink that glides on. The smell of this product reminds me of a mix of wax, wood blocks and like a new building. For those who were wondering I&#x27;ll put down the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cera Alba, Carnauba, Ceresine Wax, Petrolatum, Castor Oil, Methyl Paraben, Proryl Paraben,&lt;br /&gt;May contain: Mica, Red iron oxide, Yellow iron oxide, Black iron oxide, Titanium oxide, Ultra marine blue, Hydrated chrome oxide green, D&amp;C red no.7 Ca.lake, Food red 17.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in China.</li>
            <li> As far as eyeliners go, this is one of the better sets I&#x27;ve seen.  The color options are widely variable, but not ostentatious.  The colors are all fairly simple and enjoyable and I haven&#x27;t seen any that make me think &amp;#34;God I would never wear that&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also easy to apply and the color comes out clean and easy.</li>
            <li> poor selection goes on with difficulty</li>
            <li> I love these liners. They do tend to smear a little and fade throughout the day so be sure to do at least one check up every eight or so hours, if you don&#x27;t already. The colors are bold and vibrant and they go on so smooth. I wish the pink was a little stronger and the gold a little brighter but other than that the colors are true to the picture.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see this at such a low price and have such great ratings. I bought these and got them 2 days later, way before when it said I was going to get them. The colours are so strong! Someone mentioned the colour gold, which I never got, and also the colour white, which I never received either. I&#x27;m assuming they have a bunch of different packs that are sent out, but it doesn&#x27;t bug me. I&#x27;m happy with all of the colours I received, and yes, they are a little tougher to remove manually than other eyeliners. Even so, after more use, I noticed that the colours also fade sooner than liked, and you may have to apply it 2 or 3 times a day if you intend to have it all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Just O.K .... I got in a great time frame I thought was nice, I did not get all of the colors in the photo, I got doubles of the darker colors.... I used two different colors and both was bright colors, creamy to apply and did not cause any eye irritation.</li>
            <li> For this price, yes they are going to get runny after wearing them, but they are still very nice colors and look great! I wore the dark purple liner over my eyeshadow (which was a lighter purple), and you couldn&#x27;t even tell that it got a little runny. I would definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipping also came sooner than predicted which was a plus!</li>
            <li> I am so picky when it comes to make-up but I saw the price on these and thought why not try them. I am so thrilled I did! They are so smooth and full of pigment. They stay on all day and blend so perfectly. The colors are so beautiful. I am so impressed with these eyeliners. If u are thinking about ordering these just do it for the price u get hi end</li>
            <li> This a wonderful deal.  I received my eyeliners intact and well package for the heat in Texas.  Plus, arrived befor the expected date.  Thanks a million! Will order again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing this product and it is great! I love to use these with my normal makeup. I also received super fast shipping. I would highly recommend this product to all women! Glides on very smooth with no need to light it with a lighter for it to stay on.</li>
            <li> I received these pencils in good time and I was happy with the colors.  They are soft and glide on well.  I would order them again.</li>
            <li> Got here on time and they work well.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are amazing! The colors I received are Silver, Rosa, Light Brown, White, Gold, Cafe, Neon Blue, Pearl Pink, Royal Blue, Black, Green, and Lavender. They are incredibly creamy and could easily be dupes for Urban Decay. I&#x27;m in love with the Silver and Pearl Pink!</li>
            <li> Pleasantly pleased that i got exactly what i ordered, and before the estimated date. I like them, and they do have potential. I just wont be able to enjoy them all like the browns and lavender as they don&#x27;t show on me, but isn&#x27;t the sellers fault. Love the Blue &amp; Silver</li>
            <li> These are AMAZING. Glide on like butter. Bright colors, does smudge as the day goes but I set it with transparent powder, totally worth a few seconds of extra work for the price and color and ease of application (smooth and soft on the skin)</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are great! They stay on for hours and hours and rarely any smearing. The colors are strong and bold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smashing a bit but I like it</li>
            <li> these wer so smooth and intense in color im ordering another pack they are superior qaulity im suprised by they are only 4 dollars for 12 but that steal just makes them better i also recieved them way earlier then the ship date</li>
            <li> I love this products. The colors are vibrant and very useful. Although I haven&#x27;t tried  them all since getting this product I do intend to mix and wear them all.</li>
            <li> i love these, all the pretty colors and they go on smoothly since i&#x27;m an older lady its hard to find pencils that don&#x27;t tug your eyelids and these didn&#x27;t tug or burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like them. After 1/2-1 hr, bottom of my eyes were black. I haven&#x27;t used any other than black one, however. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but the quality of these pencils are great. I have really watery eyes when I yawn or laugh..so when I purchased these I assumed they would be very smudgy but actually aren&#x27;t. Pigment is great and is very smooth to apply on. I don&#x27;t know how other people didn&#x27;t get all the colors but I did. I guess its a risk in that sense but overall I like it!</li>
            <li> I got my eye liners delivered today and I&#x27;m really happy with my order. I&#x27;ve initially found this brand in Mexico and I was extra happy to have seen it for sale on here. They are a great quality and they are rich in color. I just wish this set included orange and silver instead of the violate which it looks more like black. However I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love the colors; they&#x27;re absolutely gorgeous! The pencil glides on very smoothly and has a silky texture. They&#x27;re also quite large, so for the price, these eyeliners are definitely worth it. My only issue is that the color loses its vibrancy on your eyes after awhile. I don&#x27;t use eye primer though (which I plan to buy), so maybe that would be an easy solution.</li>
            <li> They go on smooth and last all day. Perfect for makeup junkies like me who enjoy experimenting.</li>
            <li> Fun and long wearing ...can not beat the price</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter for christmas after she said she wanted a blue eyeliner. I saw the set of 12 of all colors and read the reviews and then made my purchase. I text my daughter today to ask if any gifts showed up for her and this was her response, &amp;#34;Got eyeliners and OMG I&#x27;m in love&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with the fast shipment and quality :)</li>
            <li> This is a great deal and these come in great colors. My only complaint is, like others said, these smudge very easily which is good for blending but annoying for me when I just want to wear it as eyeliner. But for the price, these are a steal and I still recommend them. I love the creamy texture and the brightness of the colors.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are great! They show up as the are marked.and even show up on darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> They work great but they are a little light kind of creamy,  but I will use them daily and recommend them highly!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are nie..i get compliments everywhere i go especally wen i wear the aqua coloer with glitter over it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go that smooth on the eye, but the colors are as described.</li>
            <li> They were good and met my expectations, but not great! The black liner is nice, but the other colors do not really show.</li>
            <li> I was planning on making a video, but the vibrancy of these beautiful colors would not show! I completely love these colors, and they beautifully coincide with eyeshadow. I am of a darker skin tone (a chocolate tone) and I believe that anyone can rock these colors, because they are just so beautiful! I recommend to anyone who wants some vibrant eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> I wanted a set of different colors of eyeliners for bottom eye lid. Love this set a bunch of different colors. Colors that I wanted and need it for when I do my make up. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These were bought as a Christmas present for a young girl to practice with.  They applied smooth and did not irritate her skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, but this product made my eye lids itch and felt irritated.  And nothing irritates me skin.  So that was weird.  I had to throw them away. I really wanted them to work.  I&#x27;ve never written a bad review and this isn&#x27;t really bad, it just made my skin weird.  :(  Otherwise, the colors were as expected.  very very pretty.  This might not happen to anyone else.  idk.  thanks</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and pretty. They have a perfect texture and just glide. The last all day for me and ill definatley be buying these again</li>
            <li> the colors smudge easily &amp; kind of break at the tip but for what i paid they were pretty good</li>
            <li> because the eyeliner stays on longer n works beautifully on my skin to make my eyes pop. they are wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love these. They came quickly, the colors are great and very pigmented. They go on smoothly and look great. Also you can&#x27;t best the price!</li>
            <li> Great set but it&#x27;s a stretch to call it 12. It&#x27;s really 11. You&#x27;ll never use the white one. Very unique variations and  I love them all. Even ones I thought I wouldn&#x27;t. They look better on than the color indicator on the end one have you believe so give them all a chance.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are of great quality.  The colors are vibrant and the set has a great variety.  I highly recommend these :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on getting these since it was a brand I never heard of and it was so cheap.I gave in and ordered them. Best decision ever! These pencils are smooth and the color payoff is awesome! They have good staying powder. I used them on my water line and they were pretty good! I am pleasantly surprised to say the least. And the pencils are long so I wont finish them so quickly which is good cause I can really abuse eyeliners. No rashes or breakouts and no weird smells. They smell like standard pencils. And I got great colors in my lot which included 2 blues and purples, but different hues. Love them! Get them, they&#x27;re only 8 bucks and you will love them. I am not one to buy &amp;#34;cheap cosmetics&amp;#34; but I will order these again for sure!</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of these eyeliners to do runway work for a charity fashion show.  They worked wonderfully.  Went on smoothly and colors were very bright.  Amazing quality, especially for the price.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for great makeup at a great price.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised at how soft these pencils were, and the quality of the color given the incredibly inexpensive price tag.  They really are nice eye pencils.</li>
            <li> viberant colors thatk you</li>
            <li> Hi I have received this beautiful pencils and it&#x27;s very pigmented and shipping is very fast.im basically from India purchased this item from my personal debit card and shipped to usa illinois addressed on exact time . I will definitely  recommend</li>
            <li> I bought this set late Tuesday night and they were delivered early Friday morning. I got 12 different colors with no repeats. The price comes out to almost $0.58 per pencil. VERY good price! The eyeliner goes on smooth and the color is vibrant. I would definitely buy from them again!</li>
            <li> this is so good! it came in 2 days! it have a really nice &amp; creamy liner! ive been waiting for this liner a long time ago &amp; couldnt find it! they also gave me a tracking # .</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and the selection is nice.  They&#x27;re pretty smudge-prone, but I guess that could just be me being spoiled by gel eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Colors are great and they go on smoothly. BUT, they DO NOT STAY ON!! even with powder shadow underneath, they smear and smudge. You end up with &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34;.  I wanted to like these. What a deal!!! But they simply will not work for me. (Not to leave the house anyway!!)</li>
            <li> Nice colors, but they run easy.  They are okay, but not my cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> The eyeliners go on smoothly. Great product for price. Love the colors, especially for my summer wardrobe.</li>
            <li> great price great quality great packaging great shipping &amp; delivery i absolutely love these pencils. smooth silk finish very long so they last quality is great colors are very pigmented</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as pigmented as I&#x27;d like and doesn&#x27;t glide on very smoothly, but it&#x27;s OK. I like their black look a lot.</li>
            <li> I love it they are so pigmented and stays on. I love all the colors endless options I added swatches of all the colors. They are AWESOME!!!</li>
            <li> Applies smoothly, no irritation and vibrant colors.  Sharpening can be a hassle but all eyeliner pencils are from my experience a pain to sharpen.  (makes a gooey mess when sharpening)</li>
            <li> Great product, color are bold and plentiful. Good for mixing and matching for girls who like to make their eye makup pop.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these and loves them easy to apply great price very happy with them.</li>
            <li> Great colors but only stays on for 20 minutes and it&#x27;s gone. I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality liner set. Nice and easy glide on and bold. Only downfall was the picture shows a couple of colors that I did not receive and some that I did receive. But I received all 12. Just not every color pictured.</li>
            <li> WOW are these a hidden gem. I bought them on a whim because the price was so low, figuring even if they were not great they would be good for costume makeup and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really pleasantly surprised. while not as creamy as some of the higher end brands, they aren&#x27;t hard and don&#x27;t drag on the skin at all. They are all very pigmented. It seems (from other reviews) that the color selection can be a bit random, I recieved pearl pink, rosa, lavender, gold, silver, black, brown, light brown, neon blue, satin blue, royal blue, and green. They also sharpen very, very well. Never any sharp bits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one *tiny* complaint is that some colors (the neon blue especially) smudge a bit so they have to be set with a powder. Considering I&#x27;ve spent much more on eyeliner that smudged MUCH worse... I am not taking a star off for that.</li>
            <li> Great item! Was exactly what I wanted! Arrived quickly! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love these pencils and they work really great. They are soft and glide on easily to the eyelid. Love all of the colors.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner because it is soft and is to apply.and the many colors it comes in.  The price right.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Exactly what I wanted. The colors are just as described, they stand out, unique, &amp; stays on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pencils they go on so smooth and the colors are so vibrant. They work so well for ombre lips and ombre liner really makes your look come alive will be ordering more products and colors by Italian.</li>
            <li> My 20 year old daughter loves experimenting with all the colors. I love how smooth they go on and how long it stays on!</li>
            <li> I ordered this set because it was very reasonably priced and I love using fun colors to highlight my eyes and match my outfits. My set came with black, white, light brown, lavender, violet, royal blue, electric blue, neon blue, green, turquoise, rosa (pink), and gold. They glide on very smooth and are long lasting. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Liners were smooth. Colors were good too!</li>
            <li> these eyeliners are very pigmented and the colors are great! they glide on smoothly and I could never find these eyeliners anywhere except in mexico im glad I found them. they last forever as well.</li>
            <li> They glide on smooth and I love them.  I am picky about my eyeliner</li>
            <li> Good quality for any makeup lover. would def reccomend to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive group of great color eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Comparable to Urban Decay. More color. Go on and blend VERY smoothly. Super cheap but they last a while. No complaints and I got them two days after I ordered them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews I read!  I must say these are pretty decent liners and the pigment are good! goes on smooth and creamy. last pretty good will buy again.  has very pretty colors!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these eyeliners! they are so creamy and pigmented its unbelievable. i tend to set them with eyeshadow just based on the other reviews i have seen and to smoke it out a bit, but when i don&#x27;t they don&#x27;t budge! i have worn them on my upper eye line and i haven&#x27;t had any problems with them rubbing off onto my eyelid throughout the day. they are also great to expand your makeup collection and experiment with color!</li>
            <li> price is great and the product quality is amazing</li>
            <li> Pretty good quality for such inexpensive eyeliners! Glad I purchase and pretty quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought these mostly for the white, and the brown.  The rest of them were just &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; for the price.  I thought most of the other colors were a little intense/immature, but they are delightfully soft and easy to blend, so they can be much more subtle.  I find myself using them instead of eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> in spite that I read a few bad reviews I still went ahead a purchase them and I am glad I did. very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li> I like these eyeliner. A good assortment of colors for the price, but they do wear off kind of quick, so bring it with you to freshen up.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these. Best eyeliners I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li> Hi I&#x27;m Miguel&#x27;s wife, I got the eye liners two days ago the shipping was fast. I already tried them, the colors are brilliant, beautiful they look amazing, creamy texture which make it easy to used them, and they are durable on your eyes. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> the pencils are very soft, and I like that a lot.  however, the colors are not as deep as I would like, and are too pale in providing color.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money I think I only use three of the colors</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are very creamy and glide on very easily.  They do not fade quickly, they are high quality and worth far more than the price on amazon.  In short, they are some of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever owned and the colors are beautiful!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with these eyeliners!</li>
            <li> I enjoyed all these!  I will definitely be getting them again after I run out》great quality,  neatly packaged and shipped,  amazing colors!</li>
            <li> Great colors! Awesome eyeliners!!! Smooth/soft. Unfortunately, I am allergic to these I guess. So just be cautious when applying. I&#x27;ve had 3 eye infections since ordering these....only on the days when wearing these.</li>
            <li> I love these! They are not like the pencils that you have to press down on to show up. They glide effortlessly and I found that the color stays on all day without smudging!</li>
            <li> These are a great set. I use them all the time, goes on smooth and lasts all day. I am so happy.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how great these were. Usually you get what you pay for,  but not with these. They go on real smooth and stay on for hours. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with smearing or anything along those lines.</li>
            <li> These go on easily and have great colors and a variety.</li>
            <li> these are very smooth and dont have that hard drag alot of pencils have. i havent had to sharpen them yet but im hoping this holds true once i do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of this brand before prior to purchase, and I was a tiny bit skeptical, but these eyeliners are very smooth and creamy. I loved how bold the colors are, and really for the price you can&#x27;t beat this deal.</li>
            <li> This was a christmas gift, so unless my friend tells me something else I&#x27;ll believe that they are working very well&lt;br /&gt;for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please  tell me this has not been sent a second time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They look like a nice soft liner, and I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem letting someone know where I got them.</li>
            <li> I did not expect much because they were so cheap in price, but they came in and I love them! Beautiful colors, plenty to choose from...they all go on smoothly and stay on! 5 star rating for sure.</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners! They are so vivid and also a little bit creamy. They are very easy to apply and the price is great. The only issue is, that i diddnt get the colors in the picture, i diddnt get the white or the orange color, i got mostly greens and purples.</li>
            <li> Great for the price! They are bright and you can tell that you are wearing a colorful eyeliner. It does smear after a while though.</li>
            <li> These are soft enough that I can use them to draw a design on my daughters faces and then I fill the design in with face glitter that we have.  Such a great assortment of colors and a great price!  I have stocked up on them!!</li>
            <li> This is a fast delivery!  The company seems very focused on making its customers happy.  I think the price and the quality are fantastic.  The eyeliners are waxy enough that they do not smear on your eyes, and the amount of colors you get for the price is unheard of in this day and age!  Definitely worth the money!  I also purchased the false eyelashes, and they are wonderful and fast delivery as well!  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many colors that you can make yourself look 80&#x27;s to present day!</li>
            <li> I love the different colors that were included in the packet.  Blue is my favorite color , it was at least 3-4 different blues included.</li>
            <li> I received all earth colors. I was hoping to get a pink, or light purple. Disappointed but the colors weren&#x27;t that bad to work with.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set of 12 Italia eyeliners from \\&quot;Mighty Gadget(USA Merchant)\\&quot; based on the positive reviews of these eyeliners and because I wanted to try pastel &amp; vivid eyeliner colors from a \\&quot;new\\&quot; brand that I&#x27;ve never tried before for this Spring-Summer. I also chose this seller because they had the lowest price for this brand that I don&#x27;t know anything about and there was NO MENTION of any possible substitutions in their listing as there was in TWO OTHER sellers descriptions that stated up-front the exact colors they will be switching out if you purchase from them. Those were my 3 biggest reasons for choosing this item from this seller..(lots of pastel/bright colors~low price~no subs)..but when I received my package, \\&quot;lots of pastels &amp; brights\\&quot; is NOT what was delivered. I wanted the EXACT colors of the 12 pencils shown in the pictures,otherwise I would have chosen a different listing of Italia eyeliners from the several on Amazon! The pictures clearly show that this set is suppose to include THREE different shades of purple/lavender/lilac--TWO different shades of blue--and TWO different shades of green. Instead of sending these exact colors to me that are pictured, this seller pulled a bait &amp; switch without warning or consultation of any substitutions and sent BLACK,TEAL,WHITE &amp; another PINK (rose) pencils...FOUR colors that are NOT supposed to be in this set (nor was wanted)!! No brief email to ASK if these color subs would be acceptable after they had taken my money..nothing! I already have NINE different shades/textures/brands of black pencils (not counting the several different brands each of gels &amp; liquids &amp; felt-tip pens) and had I wanted any more blacks..then I would have purchased from my usual TRUSTED brands of blacks. I also already have plenty of shades white (and nude/beige) eyeliners and of pink LIP liners and had I wanted more, then I would have chosen to purchase from my usual trusted brands for those,too.  Had I also known that this seller would substitute colors w/o asking or consultation...I would have chosen a different seller to purchase from~~just as I avoided the OTHER 2 sellers that stated up-front in their listings the exact colors that will be switched out if one orders from them. In the seller listings for this item are the sellers \\&quot;MissPinkCat\\&quot; and \\&quot;Kolorize Me\\&quot; and I have previously purchased from both those sellers with no problems at all...and I would recommend to future buyers of this item to spend the few cents more and choose either one of them to purchase from if you want to receive EXACTLY the colors of eyeliners that are shown in the pictures.  As for the Italia eyeliners...most of them bleed-smear if not set with a matching color eyeshadow,same goes for the waterline. These are hit &amp; miss which color \\&quot;sets\\&quot; as a stand alone product. The black,navy, &amp; browns will smear and then the teal,green,gold etc..will \\&quot;set\\&quot; just fine..so it&#x27;s not based on \\&quot;lighter/darker\\&quot; colors at all, it&#x27;s very random. However, ALL the colors are very pigmented and go on well with only 1-3 strokes depending on the thickness of the line you want..so that&#x27;s a plus. If set with eyeshadow they last for at least 9 hrs and didn&#x27;t need a touch-up before I removed them. I haven&#x27;t yet tried them longer than that so I can&#x27;t say what the true wear time can be. All in all...these are great for a fun &amp; playful pop of color and the price point is really low so that it&#x27;s no big loss if you don&#x27;t like them or won&#x27;t use them very much. They&#x27;re worth the price just to have the lighter colors to experiment with and you can always use them as a base for eyeshadows to extend the life of your more expensive eye primers/bases, if nothing else. Both the lighter colors and especially the darker ones for a smoky eye look...they work great for that!</li>
            <li> these are great colors and are going to look amazing under my sparkely glitter eyeliners, these colors are really going to pop under the barely tinted glittery liquid liner.</li>
            <li> These just glide on. I didn&#x27;t have smudging issues and they wash off easily. Such lovely colors and this set will last forever! $8-really ?!?!?!  where have you been all my life.</li>
            <li> use them everyday great deal only wish I had more colors to choose from&lt;br /&gt;.But beggers cant choosers maybe next time</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t take too long to reach me after purchase, about a week, week and a half. The quality is good, the pencils are soft enough to smudge nicely but not so creamy that the pigment won&#x27;t stay put. The colors are rich and dense, and most of them have noticeable shimmer, so they may not be for everyone. Just make sure that the caps are on well, they can come off easily, and I&#x27;m sure nobody wants dirty eyeliner and/or makeup cases! I have fun playing around with these, trying new colorful eye looks. Great bargain for the price!</li>
            <li> Tips not soft nor easy to put on , more like colored pencils than make up. Disappointed , change needed</li>
            <li> I bought these because of the reviews and the price, and I expected them to be like any other inexpensive eyeliner, dry, but they were not! The colors are true and they glide on nicely. I am really happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> These are affordable and fun, not to mention easy to apply.  There are enough colors for every mood and I will definitely buy these again.</li>
            <li> As a beginner makeup artist on a budget, it&#x27;s always great to come across an awesome deal like this. It took a little over a week for it to be delivered and they were packaged perfectly. I love all of the colors, they are very pigmented, and glide on smoothly. The only problems I have had with this product is that it breaks and smears easily. I would recommend this product to anyone who loves makeup and wants an inexpensive, well-made product.</li>
            <li> Um can i just say i wasn&#x27;t expecting these eyeliners to be so amazing!! I thought they were going to be super waxie &amp; not worth it at all but i was wrong. They&#x27;re completely smooth &amp; creamy they just glide right on like butter in a stick. The colors are REALLY pigmented &amp; stay on my waterline all day.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time choosing what to rate this , but in the end I went off of what I felt when I swatches them. They go on super nice and smooth and are super pigmented, there&#x27;s one downside though. They really don&#x27;t say on even with primer, I&#x27;m going to try to set them next time but I wish they stayed on better!💋</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. The color ran under and over my eyes immediately after I applied it.  The black liner looked like I had two black eyes.  Not happy with them at all</li>
            <li> Great value. Nice colors.</li>
            <li> colors are beautiful they are soft sharpen well cant go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHt this with the lipstick......will be buying this again and again for gifts...etc...i love it ..i get compliments</li>
            <li> Omg, came in today and I absolutely  love them, will order again!! :)</li>
            <li> Amazing I recommend them to everyone</li>
            <li> Really amazing set of eyeliners. They are super creamy and the colors are really bold and vibrant. It advertises as a set of 12 metallic colors, but only about half of them were really metallic. They do have a tendency to smudge a bit, as well. Aside from that, they were exactly what I was hoping for. 4 out of 5 stars from me. I&#x27;d definitely recommend them, especially considering the amazing price.</li>
            <li> Much better quality than expected. The potent colors are vivid with full color adhesion. These pencils are long rather than the midget sized you might pay a whole lot for in brand names. They apply very smoothly and the range is amazing for a variety of choices. There is one fuchsia lip pencil that is also very pretty. Clear Winner!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, smooth and easy to apply.  Nice to have a variety of colors, and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and they go on great!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great product!!</li>
            <li> Great coverage, goes on smooth, and all the colors are very bright. Would definitely buy again. I would have paid this price for just 2 of these colors and got the whole rainbow instead.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are amazing and the colors are very vibrant. They are a must have if your a makeup junkie like me.</li>
            <li> (thumbs up) they came in good condition and the colors are really pretty they&#x27;re thick too so thats always a plus</li>
            <li> -they are not smudge free&lt;br /&gt;- literally wore them for 3 minutes and they were already coming off of seeping into my skin&lt;br /&gt;-overall bad quality</li>
            <li> The color was non existent and the application was not smooth at all. Shipping was fast though. Still would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was originally only looking for a black pencil for daily wear and found this set; it is cheap so I figured why not. They are very smooth and offer a variety of colors which I like to use on my lower lash line. I like them a lot.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors- but they ran within an hour of applying it to my lower lash and waterline. Even when I used a setting spray. -Angie</li>
            <li> this product was great for gifts as well as for collection for my wife! if you females needs some eyeliners then this is it!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous when I bought this eyeliner because I thought it might be cheap quality and smudge easily. No reasons to worry. The eyeliner is great quality and I haven&#x27;t had any complaints about it. The colors are bright and fun. The only thing is, the silver pencil doesn&#x27;t show up very well.</li>
            <li> It does not say that color will vary... this is a total rip off..</li>
            <li> I have to say, at first I thought with the price of these eyeliners, the quality probably isn&#x27;t that great. Boy was I wrong! I originally intended them for use with the halloween makeup kit, not anymore, these babies are mine. muahahahaha The colors are so bold, so bright, so gorgeously created. The liner applies very well, it doesn&#x27;t skip across the fine wrinkles in eyelids as mush as most other liners I have used. They sharpen well, they don&#x27;t fall apart at the end like other brands do. I am so proud of my new liner collection I have shown it off to four separate people and now they ALL want a set of their own! Buy them, buy them now. You will not regret it. You will love yourself for it, when they arrive, you will realize what a gift you bought for yourself.</li>
            <li> Im not big on writing reviews but I have to tell you......I received these eyeliner pencils very quickly and I tried the white eyeliner pencil the same day. I was pleased at how smooth theses pencils are and there very soft and vibrant so far so good</li>
            <li> Every woman should have a set of these!</li>
            <li> Great color divergence! Now that I know the hairdryer trick on 2 second warmup to make them not so pointy hard the first time I use them, I&#x27;m even happier!</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product but it was a waste of $7. The colors smear easily and didn&#x27;t hold up well through out the day. I&#x27;m just going to let my nieces have this and let them use it as play makeup.</li>
            <li> Best eye liner ever! will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Every color in the picture, I received.  They are really smooth, and the color shows really well. I will get them again because you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would purchase these again.  As an eyeliner I found them to be quite difficult to use.  I felt like I would have to burn them like I watched my mother do in the eighties so that they would come out softer.</li>
            <li> Colors are very bright and beautiful !</li>
            <li> I used them for my Halloween make up. They are very creamy so it worked very nice for me. I guess you can use them both for your eyes and lips, but I&#x27;m not a makeup guru, LOL )</li>
            <li> I DID NOT get a purple or an orange...I just got my order as I am writing...!&lt;br /&gt;I was really hoping for those colors too...!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, the only problem is it hard to put on.. but it beautiful.. I love them.. will buy again</li>
            <li> These are really great eyeliners, especially considering the price. I was not expecting much in way of pigment or texture since they were so cheap, but they are extremely pigmented and they go on super creamy. Because of their creaminess these eyeliners do need frequent sharpener in order o retain clean lines, but I didn&#x27;t really see that a huge problem for me.</li>
            <li> I expected them to be kind of cheap, but they were amazing. They&#x27;re my favourite liners now, actually. I find myself having trouble deciding which colour to use in the morning!</li>
            <li> i read the reviews, for the price, you get what you pay for, the colors are nice, but they smudge a lot, and they are very hard when&lt;br /&gt;putting them on, they are not creamy, they are dry, and smudge within a few hours....if you are looking for waterproof or smudgeproof, do NOT by these, the colors are nice, but do not stay on long enough. Giving mine to salvation army for someone else to use.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, but lighter colors aren&#x27;t easily applied over dark eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I usually use gel or liquid eyeliners but I decided to try these and they go on very easy with little to no pressure... My only con is it smudges easily but they are very good for the price</li>
            <li> I got these for free (had an app that paid me an Amazon gift card). I fell in love with these. I use them all the time. The color pigment is amazing, they go on super easy and you won&#x27;t regret getting them.</li>
            <li> Good quality , smear easily , recommended that you use a primer and then makeup setting spray  for best results I like urban decays</li>
            <li> Color is bright. Glides on smoothly. Doesn&#x27;t run. no repeated colors. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  UPDATE: still love this product! Decided to order a set for a friend, no black. The colors were almost all different that my set.... Set 2 contained 4 colors from set 1. I decided to keep them and order a 3rd set!!!! The colors are all so bright and fun. Really good quality too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely Love these!  The colors show up very well and easily!!  Great product!  Great colors!  I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them, way better than what i used to use Rimmel NOT ANY MORE. They smudge sure but tell me what eye pencil doesnt. great pkging, great deal. WILL BUY AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> This item is perfect! It came earlier than I expected and glides on really smooth. The colors are really bright and stay on. As far as other people complaining about a smell I didn&#x27;t notice any smell. All in all a good product</li>
            <li> I love them. Vibrant colors. They do have a strong chemical smell. But, no issues with my eyes at all. Love the colors!!!!</li>
            <li> bought it while i was out at work and my wife emailed me and told me that she loved it and it was very helpful being that she is a makeup artist the only complaint was that she wish it had more colors to choose from so when she gets clients that want that outrageous look well i say outrageous she says it&#x27;s fashion but what do i know im a man lol</li>
            <li> It goes on nice but be careful it smudges easy!</li>
            <li> I like all the colors that came but there aren&#x27;t any pinks or oranges or well, light colors aside from white and gold. There are a lot of blues and greens that almost look the same. Maybe they had run out when I ordered them but they&#x27;re still really nice colors. they are so vibrant and they last a really long time also. The product came super quick and I would definitely purchase more from this seller.</li>
            <li> So Amazed On How The Color Stays On &amp; The Bightness .</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...glides on smoothly and very easy to apply. Will be ordering more of these in the future. Great eyeliner!</li>
            <li> These are some nice eyeliners, but beware they are not water proof and they tend to bleed by the end of they day and you end upo with raccoon eyes</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are so creamy and pigmented&lt;br /&gt;They glide on so smoothly&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is they left my eye itching but that May or may not be the products fault because I do have seasonal allergies&lt;br /&gt;They also hold rather well ,really have to scrub to get these off&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice too much smudging&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> the eyeliner set definitely met all my expectations. The set was reasonably priced, the colors are vibrant and beautiful . I enjoy using my new eyelinets!</li>
            <li> I am totally impressed.  I love the huge selection and great quality.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase, it is the best.</li>
            <li> Love them. They are beautiful colors. Definitely got what I paid for!</li>
            <li> Werent as quality and don&#x27;t come off without scrubbing in a harsh manner. but the colors were bright</li>
            <li> Worked well in my opinion. Some colors worked better than others but it was a good variety for me and for daily wear and use.</li>
            <li> what a great buy!!! great price for a great set! they go on easily... dont smudge... and the colors have so far stayed in place all day for me every time !!! i am very pleased. :)</li>
            <li> So many beautiful colors</li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t say that I purchased this because my mom bought them for me on her account. Anyways, on to the review (: I love these! Each one is insanely pigmented, and I got all of the colors pictured. The shipping was so fast and arrived a day before the estimated delivery date. I can&#x27;t speak too much for the staying power on all of these, only for two of them, (Black and Light Brown) but the two I tried stayed all day! No smudging or anything in this awful Arizona weather. Totally recommend them if you&#x27;re looking to expand your collection and get some pretty colors!</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are creamy/soft and really vibrant and pretty.:) I got every eyeliner showed above.Id say this is a really good buy!</li>
            <li> Colors are a little too dull for what I wanted but they are still cute</li>
            <li> nice and creamy... colors are very pigmented... love the assortment of colors...</li>
            <li> They work well and there are lots of colors.</li>
            <li> amazingly soft and amazing color!</li>
            <li> A pop of color on the eye (or even the lip from time to time). These go on very smoothly and last a long time without needing to reapply. Love them!</li>
            <li> These eye liners are amazing!&lt;br /&gt;They go on so easy and look fabulous!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth it just glides on for the price you can&#x27;t beat it I also use them as lip liners.</li>
            <li> For this price, I was expecting nothing special.  Surprise!  These eyeliners glide on easy, and stay on ALL DAY.  Beautiful vibrant colors.  A WIN WIN purchase.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> i give this product 5 stars since i love the colors and the i also love how smooth it applies. i would recommend to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I will not hesitate  to order for another  when this&#x27;s  finish. Thank u so much for good quality!</li>
            <li> Love it, I wish the eyeliners where more brighter, but I like what I got. And I will be buying again</li>
            <li> I love the quality the only thing is that I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the black liner Tip was cut in half not sure why but all the other liners were perfect.</li>
            <li> love them. couldn&#x27;t be happier :) they are beautiful and amazing quality</li>
            <li> Love theses liners....they&#x27;re smooth and creamy and matte....the seller is wonderful as well....beautiful experience worth the purchase...</li>
            <li> AMAZING COLORS! really pretty and love the way they look on my skin.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it and she really likes them.</li>
            <li> Great on top eye lid. Shipping time great!</li>
            <li> I love these as they are soft and easy to use on the sensitive eye lids and under the bottom lashes.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of color around my eyes; however these are subtle and very pretty, and I get compliments when I do use the color.  They are creamy and the darker colors smudge easily, so go lightly, and you will be happy...so pretty.</li>
            <li> So many colors, and for such little money! I was very pleased with the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The liners do smudge a bit, so watch out for that. (Or use appropriate makeup primer / setter.)&lt;br /&gt;The only potential issue (which is why I&#x27;m rating this 4.0/5.0, instead of the full 5.0/5.0 stars) is that the colors are chosen at random and sent to your door. I was able to get the cool gold color, white, and black - which I consider to be kind of essential for any eyeliner 12 pack - but we did get like, three different shades of purple and three shades of green. (They were &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; colors, yes, but strikingly similar.) Just be wary of this before you buy. :)</li>
            <li> I like this set..really nice colors..</li>
            <li> Vibrant, rich colours. very striking. Great quality. I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on these.</li>
            <li> Wow. I cannot believe the quality of these eyeliners. I have paid upwards of $20 a piece for comparable quality eyeliners (i.e. Urban Decay). The colors are very vivid and they go on so smoothly. I was seriously not expecting much for the price, but they have far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Color selection is not what&#x27;s n the photo, and some colors aren&#x27;t as appealing as it should b....plus to many Brown&#x27;s I received Whn I gotten it</li>
            <li> these eyeliners are AWESOME</li>
            <li> I was very surprised when I got them. I received all colors as avertised. They are very pigmented but I love them. They are matte pencils so the will smudge but they last</li>
            <li> Good, my wife loves them.</li>
            <li> These are smooth eyeliners. Beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> They do smudge a lot but 0.70 each!!! This a great deal!!! The colors are beautiful! They glide on so smooth too!!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are nice but even with eyelid primer the eyeliner smudges easily and does not stay in place. Pretty low quality but I didn&#x27;t pay much for them.</li>
            <li> These are really cheap for their pigmentation and the number that you get, but they don&#x27;t last long on oily lids like mine (even with primer and setting it with powder).  They go on really smooth and creamy like others have mentioned and I really liked all the colors so I might used them as eyeshadow or something else.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of the pencils. they glide on easily and stay in place all day. the colors are vibrant without being gaudy. even a beginner can use these. the yare awesome. I need more colors</li>
            <li> When I came across the colors of the liners I was happy cause I was looking for all the bright liners, but when I received them they were all the wrong colors that were not pictured In the add. They were dark and not one of the colors I wanted were in the set. So I was going to return and exchange but I don&#x27;t have the time so I have just decided to keep them so make sure you know that you may not get one ones in the pictures.</li>
            <li> I got this because it has a lot of the colors I need for when I cosplay. It came on time and the colors are very bright and go on smooth. I love them, but it&#x27;s a set of 11 eyeliners and a lip liner. I was disappointed  that the pink was a lip liner and not an eye liner they don&#x27;t have that on the product  description and they really should but other then that I am very happy and suggest this to any one looking at them.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever bought I use urban decay on a day to day basic and, now I catch myself reaching for these more than my expensive high end brand theses are amazing!! Will be buying again soon!!!</li>
            <li> Creamy, not much tugging which Im grateful for! The color choice was just like what is pictured. These pencils are also very long!</li>
            <li> Great eyeliners! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Worth the Money!!! I&#x27;ve only used 1 as of now but I&#x27;m not disappointed...Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> These pencils are horrible!!! It&#x27;s smudges first 2 seconds after I applied it on! I had to wash my face w/ soap and redo my entire make up over again. Left my eyes black! Wish I could give it 0 stars. This product is nasty!!!!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly good. Very bold bright colors and I love all of them. Sadly, I didn&#x27;t get white, but I did get a nice array of colors. Perfect pigment. I&#x27;m in love with these! They smudge, but they don&#x27;t lose their color easily. Very quality and very colorful.</li>
            <li> very creamy love them glides on nicely</li>
            <li> Love them I used them all the time I only wished I brought them in only light brown and dark brown there great for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> Very creamy highly pigmented prompt arrival overall would recommend</li>
            <li> What can I say about this deal?? IT IS AWSOME!!!!! I bought two of them. These are good quality FULL SIZE liners with a lot of fun colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips: Keep them sharp to get a fine line. Warm them up by drawing a very short line between the thumb and index finger, or like seen in the pic above. This will make the liner last longer and keep it from clumping or breaking.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For fun: If you don&#x27;t usually wear the &amp;#34;colorful&amp;#34; eyeliners, don&#x27;t waste them or be afraid of them. They are great! Use your darker color (Black or Brown) on the bottom part of the eye - from the outside to the center. Then use a fun - lighter color that matches your outfit (or eye shadow) half way from the inside out. You can also blend the lighter color directly under the dark all the way across the bottom, or use a light eyeshadow to do the same thing. This will bring your eyes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more: For day: It&#x27;s also cool to use the color that matches your eyes all the way across the bottom. It gives a great look and brings the focus to your eyes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy color playing.</li>
            <li> They came quickly and I love them.  They go on really smooth but  the thing is,  the colors were not the same colors, they came in all diffrent colors and I was extremely dissapointed in that.</li>
            <li> Fantastic eyeliners. i will be reordering soon, i go through makeup pretty fast. the colors i received were the same as the picture of the pencils not the picture of the hand. which is fine with me, i had no expectation as far as what colors to expect i was just excited about trying something new. these will smudge without a finishing powder (or like product). I use ben nye finishing powder and with it i have had no problems with smudging. i hope you enjoy them too. :)</li>
            <li> I adore this eyeliner set! i just bought them because i love using random colors when i go to work or go out with the husband. You dont need much to make the color pop. I will order these again. I love them so much :D</li>
            <li> The quality of the eyeliners were good, they were creamy and went on easy. However, I am very disappointed because I did not get the colours that were advertised and I only bought this product because of the advertised colours!&lt;br /&gt;Prospective customers beware since you may not receive the colours you may want or as advertised. But on the positive side given the price, I think they are a deal....Still sad about the false advertising!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love these eyeliners. Beautiful vibrant colors and glides on so smooth. I&#x27;m excited to use them all but the Avocado and Neon Purple so far are my favorite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Italia Eyeliner set! Beautiful colors and they glide on smooth! A great buy!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE SO MUCH! They go on so easy and the colors are so bright! I&#x27;m so glad I bought these! I highly recommend buying these!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful bright colors... worth it.</li>
            <li> I loveeeee these colours. Very vibrant and go on smoothly</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I came across these beautiful vibrant colors at this price.  Nice and pigmented.  The seller was very informative after placing my order with my email confirmation, to notify me that the darker shade of blue was replaced by black.  And every girl needs a black liner, so I was happy the seller set my expectations instead of being surprised when package arrived.</li>
            <li> These are Ultra Fine.Goes on smooth and precise. Fabulous colors!!</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented. Good for the price. A bit smudgy when applied in warm climate! other wise a great buy.</li>
            <li> OMG, This is exactly what I want!!! Especially the pink one, I went to Sephora, MAC, NARS and could not find what I want. I was just trying to buy the product, because the price for 12 eyeliners is a real bargain. BUT!!! This is totally worth it, and I found the dark blue, pink, green to be my favorite!!! Strongly recommended to whomever loved color eyeliners!!!</li>
            <li> Its so buttery!!!... Worth every penny :)</li>
            <li> Great and easy to apply. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Bought them for a friend for her birthday and she says they glide on very easy and smooth. She loves their brightness</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are fantastic. I would buy again for sure. Great quality. I noticed no smell thevolors are bright go on smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented. Great product.</li>
            <li> The headline speaks for itself...</li>
            <li> These got to my house sooner than i expected which surprised me. A lot of reviews said they smudged. They stayed on all day and pretty much all night. I applyed a primer and set it with a translucent powder and ta-da. All day pretty</li>
            <li> Love the colors. They are very true to color they show up very well. Just had a problem with packaging! Looks like someone poked a hole in it to get a glimpse! Smh</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the variety of colors.  However make sure you decide your shade for the day and be sure of it - very hard to wash off as it smudges and smears all over your face.  Have the make up remover ready!  Once applied it holds up well and requires little maintenance.</li>
            <li> I got a bunch of nice matte colors including: Lilac (pink), royal blue, &amp;#34;neon green&amp;#34; (more of a grass green, not neon at all), turqouise, and violet (dark purple). I got a few chrome-y sparkly colors: gold, satin blue, sky teal (more blue than green, close to turqoiuse), and lavender. Though I got some lame colors which were: black (I really don&#x27;t need anymore black eyeliner), white, and brown. Goes on eyes pretty easily, but since it goes on easily, it also smudges easily so make sure to apply a solid coat so it lasts through the day.</li>
            <li> These are some amazing colors here! I can&#x27;t believe that I thought I could go my whole life with only black eyeliner. These are phenomenal, but if you sweat a little, it spreads.</li>
            <li> I bought these to experiment with different color eye liners. They are very soft and glide on but that was the problem - the softness. I wore the purple to work and within one hour I noticed I had purple &amp;#34;Racoon Eyes&amp;#34; - very embarrassing. The next day I only applied it to my upper lid and I had a similar problem. I am using the pink one as a lip liner and have used the brown as an eyebrow pencil. I do not regret buying these since the price is still less than purchasing one quality liner.</li>
            <li> When purchasing products for my initial makeup pro kit, I knew that I couldn&#x27;t buy EVERYTHING from the MAC store and other &#x27;pro&#x27; shop places. I had to invest in SO many products, so I opted for this set since it received good reviews and the price was right. I made the right choice. They are highly pigmented, glide smoothly without clumps, smearing or dryness. They will be perfect for an all over lid smudge/ base for a similar color to go on top instead of just as a basic &#x27;eyeliner line&#x27; on the lid. Can&#x27;t wait to use them all!</li>
            <li> Very bright and bold in metallics and flats. These will last me forever but I do not wear eye makeup all the time. WHen I do wear the makeup it goes on smooth and bold, lasts a long while, sometimes even to the next day when the faded look is more appealing. Love all the options, I wear the blue, green, turquoise, brown, gold, copper and violet most and use the pinks for lips with a natural lip color gloss for blending.</li>
            <li> loved them all they were so cute and worked well I just wish some of the colors were more soft and easier to put on</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! I love the variety of colors and they are very pigmented. They apply smoothly, last a long time, and don&#x27;t irritate my eyes or skin. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Very creamy and blendable. I do find I absolutely need primer to keep this in place for an all-day wear but that may just be me and my oily eyelids. Overall, worth it!</li>
            <li> Lovely colors n doesn&#x27;t smudge</li>
            <li> The the product could have had better color choices</li>
            <li> These are fantastic eye and lip pencils. I love them. Great quality, great price and quick delivery. I will order again through Italia. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Colors are bright, they last all day!&lt;br /&gt;After nights of drinking n passing out when I wake up my make up still in tact! I thought these would be decent pencils but there fricken amazing! Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Gggrrreeaatt...tell me where to get additional colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t liquify with humidity and swet, acording to my wife, it&#x27;s amaizing and comparing to the price, it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
            <li> Great color payoff, smooth application. Lasts ok on the lash line, but definitely not for the water line unless you have a super heavy duty sealer. Like prime your eyes, line them, use powder and sealer.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> Great colors, nice soft application. Almost too cheap to believe.  Just wonder exactly what is in them though.</li>
            <li> to use these as an eye liner stinks, the color is great going on but runs and bleeds.  On the eyelid is fine since it&#x27;s ok if it smudges there.  It&#x27;s too bad to because the colors are beautiful but they need to fix the staying power.  Needs much improvement!!</li>
            <li> Very nice! The set is as described and the colors are vivid And long lasting. Love them!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love! They go on so smoothly! I love the color variety too! Very happy!</li>
            <li> The colors are quality, they last a long time, and its fantastic to have so many choices to change your look!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for the white one. And there wasn&#x27;t one :( they gave me silver instead. But the colors are nice and glide well and it&#x27;s worth buying...if your not wanting a white!!</li>
            <li> great eye liner. the colors are great and last a reasonable amount of time. I recommend</li>
            <li> I bought two sets of these pencils, one for my daughter and one for me. The colors are beautiful and bright. They colors stay on better and brighter if you use an eyelid primer first. Some colors are flat some are shimmery, not glittery. They sharpen well and draw on the delicate eye area skin without pulling. These did ship from China I believe but arried ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> The pencils are great! I am a professional visagist and I have already used all of them. The quality is much higher than we could expect for this price!&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant colors, attractive and very clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received all the colors shown very fast and they&#x27;re very pigmented. I first used them as a regular eyeliner (above the eye) but it didn&#x27;t work out so great, the colors looked too bright. However, when I used them on my waterline (under the eye) and put a coat of mascara, that did the job. It gave me jus the &amp;#34;pop of color&amp;#34; I was looking for. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> These were not for me. They made my eyes burn and water had to get rid of all of them. Very dissapointeed loved all the colors that they came in. Wish they had worked but what can you do.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented love the product, I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have been using these pencils for months now and I love them. They glide on nice and creamy. The colours are bright and make sure you purchase 2 sets because the colours offered change sometime when processing a purchase.</li>
            <li> The quality is great however I wish the other colors showed up. I currently only use the brown and black because none of the other colors show up. I use the pink as a lip liner sometimes. It would be great if the blues and purples showed up because they are pretty. The white is great for opening the eyes but seems to fade fast.</li>
            <li> Breaks off easily, and overall cheap quality. But for face coloring for a Halloween style, it works just fine. Color doesn&#x27;t stay so buyer beware</li>
            <li> Bought these because the reviews were amazing. I LOVE the white eyeliner, it works amazing. I use several of the other colors to line my lower lid without any allergy or &amp;#34;crying&amp;#34; issues. They also work fabulous for face painting (I do a lot of bright DAVID BOWIE things to my face). They work as lip liners too which is awesome, but the only reason I took a star off, was for the Black liner which is what i bought the set for. It for some reason just seems to bleed with the eye-juices and sweat produced through the day (I live in a HUMID ATX) that make me look like a raccoon by the end of the night. I recommend using a black eye shadow and angled brush to &amp;#34;seal&amp;#34; the black liner on your upper/lower lid.</li>
            <li> I still have these in the original packing, but have used the teal liner. Great product for the price. I&#x27;d recommend buying the lip liners of the same company with these.</li>
            <li> Fun, beautiful colors to play around with!</li>
            <li> Very smooth eyeliner. They smudge a bit and some of them where hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors. I will try them all!</li>
            <li> Nice colors and great deal</li>
            <li> fantastic for the price</li>
            <li> These eyeliners are very nice. They are easy to apply and they go on smoothly. They are super pigmented. They kind of remind me of MAC eyeliners. I am not a big fan of shimmery eyeliners but I love the shimmer ones in this set. The matte ones are beautiful as well. I am definitely going to reorder these again. Love them.</li>
            <li> Every colour just glides on and is so bold.. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price but I was pleasantly surprised and have recommended them to a few other people.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear make-up so these were a gift to a friend that&#x27;s obsessed with the stuff. She was thrilled and said she&#x27;d heard of them but never actually bought herself any. SCORE :)</li>
            <li> Love the colors! I was skeptical due to the low cost, but they&#x27;re surprisingly nice. Only complaint is they bleed once worn for an extended period. For the cost, it&#x27;s an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Great colors and very soft. With barely any pressure the pencils draw a line. Good for eye shadow or eye liner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised they are actually good! They&#x27;re sooo easy to glide on and the colors are bright! Great for use on kids or stage plays/costumes where make up should be exaggerated.</li>
            <li> These came the next day after i ordered them.  I love them they glide on smoothly and stay on all day! I was disappointed that there was no black or silver, instead i received two purples and two violets.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s really smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They are not very good quality and they break so beyond easy. It wasnt really worth the energy to send them back... i threw them away and wont order them again.</li>
            <li> These are great colors, go on easily and fun to use! Just something I bought for a different look and I am happy with them. I would definitely purchase again because they are a great value. Doesn&#x27;t come with a sharpener, so I had to figure out which one of mine to use, but it all worked out.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty and i have one for each occasion.&lt;br /&gt;the quality looks good an the size is ok</li>
            <li> I really like the color selection that they send. I got all of the colors pictured.  The colors are bright and vibrant, perfect for those days you are not feeling up to putting on full makeup. A quick run along your lashes with one of the brighter colors and a coat of mascara and Viola you look like you have put some effort into your appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally oily eyelids and always have to use a primer to keep most eyeliner and eyeshadows from sliding off midday, while these are not waterproof, they do have great staying power.  I can put it on in the morning sans primer and the eyeliner stays put, all while washing off with just warm water and soap!</li>
            <li> I love the colors and if i am feeling lazy i just slide a line of color on my eye lids instead of full eye shadow.</li>
            <li> so beautiful! the metalic colors are amazing. Goes on real smooth, but it runs out real quick too! Will definately buy again! I got a wonderful set of colors, all of them are amazing, can also be used as an eyeshadow since it is spreadable, but also stable enough to stay on as liner. Oh and some of the colors smell like bubblegum, yum!&lt;br /&gt;The pencil color is exactly as the end color tip. Not professional though, if you want a really sleek look you are better off with the liquid version of these.</li>
            <li> These colors are very nice brings out the eye color and shape nicely</li>
            <li> I love the colors I would definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliners they are vibrant and colorful,  they glide on the skin, work great as lip liners also,  and they arrived early! Very happy with these</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Vibrant colors. Good price for the product, besides that brings lots of eyeliner. What would buy. the texture is creamy and serve for smoky eyes.</li>
            <li> Some colors show up, some doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Wonderful set ESPECIALLY for only six dollars, and no SHIPPING! I got MOST of the colors listed. I got two different browns and a bit more blue but that&#x27;s alright, I wasn&#x27;t particular about the colors anyway as long as I got at least one pink and a black. As for quality, they&#x27;re great. Thick, smooth colors with staying power and lots of options. They do stick for some time though not waterproof. The best way to remove them, and any eye makeup is with eye makeup remover or if you dont have that, some sort of mineral or baby oil will work just as well. Great product, super fast shipping and I love these. At fifty cents a stick, you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner set I wanted to experiment with make up so I got these They go on very smooth and last. They also have a sweet smell to them.</li>
            <li> They work so we&#x27;ll lasted all day for me! 😊</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this italia eyeliners I feel more beautiful!!!!</li>
            <li> SHARP PENCILS TO PUT AGAINST EYELIDS</li>
            <li> Awesome! Colors are vibrant and adds a nice touch on top of my regular eye liner. Stay put all day and washed off well. Very pleased with the different colors.</li>
            <li> I Love all the different colors in this set. The color goes on very smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> We bought these for my daughter&#x27;s birthday party. The colors are very bold and versatile and easy to apply (our test subjects were five-year-olds). The liner colors lasted the good part of the day despite heavy activity, and more importantly the girls love the variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very pleased with the color, performance and durability of these eyeliners.</li>
            <li> Very Nice colors! In good condition. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I received my set of 12 Italia eyeliner pencils on time and in perfect shape. They were packed appropriately and undamaged, I had one of each color, no duplicates. However, the colors are not as vivid and bright as many of the reviews I read seemed to state. In fact, the only ones I am using at all are the black, dark blue and sometimes the purple and the brown. If I use the purple or brown I have to really pile it on thick for it to show up at all which is a first, those colors in any other eyeliner I have ever tried have always shown up well and looked good on me. I haven&#x27;t tried the light purple yet but the light blue, light green, regular green and gold I gave to a friend who has a much fairer complexion than I do, they don&#x27;t show up on my eyes at all so I hope they will work for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain, I got 2 eyeliners I will use a lot and two I can use somewhat for only $6, that&#x27;s less than half what I would usually spend on two eyeliners. There are still some I have left to try, maybe at least one of them will work well. I guess you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered a set of these eyeliners for my sister and she loves them. She is blonde &amp; blue-eyed and I have dark eyes and slightly darker skin so maybe these eyeliners just work better for people with really fair complexions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish the colors were really as vivid as so many said in their reviews but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I shared this set.  The eyeliner is easy to apply, and a long pencil so it will last a while, too.</li>
            <li> Buttery texture, absolutely wonderful pigmentation, not scratchy at all, the color picks up amazingly against eyeshadow and the colors are brilliant.  I love these.</li>
            <li> OMG !!! these colors are super rich and very pigmented I will be buying this set for all my girlfriends as gifts ... definately buy 2 to keep on hand !</li>
            <li> Beautiful viberant colors that stay on! I get complements everywhere I go with all of the different colors. I even went into MAC one night after 13 hours of wear and one of the staff members asked me about it! I have told several of my friends and they have all been happy! You can&#x27;t beat it especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Great. It slid right on my eyes and has beautiful colors! 🎀🎀🎀</li>
            <li> For the price these are great. They go on great, very smooth, very easy which isn&#x27;t always the case for some pencil eyeliners. They do smug as the day goes on but considering you get 12 for the price of one in stores I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!  I only use 4 colors...Soft...much better than I expected.  Ordering more.  They smudge way less than expensive brands!</li>
            <li> ordered one for myself and my daughter - would order again.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price</li>
            <li> These are really good eye liner pencils with beautiful colors that glide on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love them they go on very smooth and for the price they are a total bargain</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly nice colors , I like them !</li>
            <li> I love the colors I hate that they run and smug easily</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners. I got all the colors shown but no black which I&#x27;m ok with. just wish there was a better brown color not just gold.</li>
            <li> Super awesome color collection.</li>
            <li> Recieved it today and love them all ready..thank you</li>
            <li> great colors, very easy application, no pressure needed, glides on easily</li>
            <li> All the colors are GREAT! I also received a pink lip liner which I&#x27;m not thrilled about because I havent worn lip liner since the 90&#x27;s. I would have rather gotten another eyeliner instead. But as far as the eyeliners go I love the colors and have used all of the even the pink eyeliner. This was one of my favorite purchases.</li>
            <li> They came in 4 days which is perfect . they&#x27;re really creamy . super pigmented . I was really surprised how low maintenance they are . you don&#x27;t have to sharpen them a lot because the least amount of pressure will give off opac color.</li>
            <li> These are perfect will definetly buy again!</li>
            <li> Just the gift my granddaughter wanted</li>
            <li> They glide on easy with nice color pigmentation. The glittery brown one is really beautiful!</li>
            <li> First of all , I did get a white eye pencil , I&#x27;m sorry for the customers&#x27; who didn&#x27;t receive a white one. These pencils are very smooth, no tugging against your eyes at all. Some of the colors just weren&#x27;t me , so they were wonderful stocking stuffers for my daughter in law and granddaughter.  I do  have to say, the rose and the pearl pink that I received in the dozen , both colors make a beautiful lip pencil, and the colors lasted on my lips all day , I just sealed the color with some lip balm. The colors on my eyes lasted  all day as well. These would make a wonderful gift for young girls starting to wear makeup , because the ease in which to apply them. As well as even very nice and inexpensive bridesmaids gifts , birthdays , office party, whatever, keep some handy , the price allows you to have them always available.  I plan to buy a couple more to put in eadter baskets for my granddaughters.  THANKS FOR READING, BYE👌</li>
            <li> The colors are nice ! But some of them are hard to notice when you apply them</li>
            <li> I love these eyeliners! The price is right and they are a good size. It goes on easy and the colors end up looking very vibrant! They do take some setting powder or something like that. Either way they are totally worth it for the price!</li>
            <li> These are such fun.  For the low cost I expected they would dry out quickly - but they don&#x27;t.  They go on smoothly and it&#x27;s fun matching my outfits with my liner.</li>
            <li> I love the the colors and it was what it said it would be, very nice to start a new makeup trunk.</li>
            <li> beautiful vibrant colors. smooth application. does smudge. but what eyeliner pencil doesn&#x27;t? would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These are awesome; my younger sister took 6 of them and she too likes them. These eyeliner stays on all day, and they don&#x27;t run. Just fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I would have liked them better if the pencils were fatter and smoother to use in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are beautiful!</li>
            <li> Beautiful and really good quality! No complaints with these eyeliners!</li>
            <li> REALLY, really nice eyeliners for a very good price!! There are so many colors to match any eye color type, and the liners go on smoothly and easily! I&#x27;ve been in a sling for 5 weeks after right rotator cuff surgery (of course, I&#x27;m right-handed), but I&#x27;m able to use these liners easily with my non-dominant hand! That impressed me!!!!</li>
            <li> This set of pencils surprised me big time. The colors are all quite bright and amazing. Not sure how I&#x27;ll use most of these colors, but I&#x27;m still glad I bought them!</li>
            <li> Love love these liners. They come on dark and smooth. I would recommend this product for sure. Shipping was fast as well.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic. Super smooth, many colors, wear all day - 10hrs +</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged good quality thx</li>
            <li> They good Bt doesn&#x27;t work on lips to good</li>
            <li> They are too soft. You shouldn&#x27;t touch your eyes.</li>
            <li> Probably the best eye liners I have every used. They are brightly colored and glide on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works well, arrived super fast.  Wipes off pretty easily though</li>
            <li> Pleased with color selection. Color liner will bleed onto your eyelids though. But the greatest thing....each has its own top!</li>
            <li> some colors are nice.. and it does smudge</li>
            <li> So easy to glide on and use, pigments are bold and beautiful!</li>
            <li> Only 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t last as long as I expected it to.  I would say it lasts about 3 hours, then you have to reapply.</li>
            <li> I really like these products. they go on really smooth and this company is really nice. I happen to get two of the same colors when I got the package and so I wrote them telling what happen and we talked for a couple of days though email and they ended up sending me the two I didn&#x27;t have. but the best part is I got to keep the ones I had extras of and I had one extra of the color they didn&#x27;t have in the package and when we were talking so they sent me out what was supposed to be in there so I ended up getting 15 for the price of 12 and on top of that they sent me a sharpener for my pencils. I want to thank you so much and if you wanna see swatches and my haul on these I have them on my youtube channel. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;TaAgz4OMF5M and the redo http://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;E5wZdLowWec. thank you to the company for working with me and for all you&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a week now, and like how ealily they go on my eyes. I keep them upside down in a low jar so I can see the colors easily. I have had to sharpen a couple of them and they did ok. Great value and a nice product.</li>
