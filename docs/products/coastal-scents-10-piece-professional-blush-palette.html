            <li>I so love this palette!</li>
            <li>I love my purchase, 10 to 1 any day!</li>
            <li>The color selection is amazing</li>
            <li>The company&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Everyone should have one of their own.</li>
            <li>I really liked the palette.</li>
            <li>I used nice brushes and I can&#x27;t get these to work for me.</li>
            <li>Nice purchase i think</li>
            <li>some of them are kind of orangy tho.</li>
            <li>liked the product but the case and the box</li>
            <li>colors are nice but feels</li>
            <li>Very good quality, I like it very much  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li>It ends up pretty streaky throughout the day so the staying power isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and i love that it&#x27;s easy to pick up on my brush</li>
            <li>I was looking for a warm palette of eye shadows but couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t include a lot of very light \\&quot;highlighter\\&quot; colors, which I also don&#x27;t use, and a lot of blues...</li>
            <li>I am okay with this product because the colors are nice, but the quality is not there.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nicely pigmented and I love the colors for my pro makeup kit.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m fine with it!</li>
            <li>I have very light skin</li>
            <li>Also the color variations are amazing s its easy to change up your style.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great packaging!</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, and the colors are really nice!</li>
            <li>Im now a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li>The palette is huge!  </li>
            <li>I love this palette..</li>
            <li>and I totally love it.</li>
            <li>most of the color don&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li>They really go on smooth and stay put! -</li>
            <li>I love my brush pallete</li>
            <li>YOU WONT REGRET IT. :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE them.</li>
            <li>However it´s okay to use this palette from time to time,</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>

            <li>it is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love Coastal Scents anything.</li>
            <li>More for your money.</li>
            <li>I love having all of my blushes in one place.</li>
            <li>the color palette works better for her tone.</li>
            <li>I love all Coastal Scent products, and this one was no exception.  </li>
            <li>, I think I could be better</li>
            <li>I am enjoying this palette and being able to create so many looks.</li>
            <li>The blushes are ok</li>
            <li>, they also send me a free pallet which I thought was amazing</li>
            <li>There are some blushes that cost more than this one palette</li>
            <li>I love this palette</li>
            <li>Pigment is awsome love the colors</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t know what else to say other than this was and excellently wonderful purchase for me.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented and great quality.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and a tad more vibrant than the photos, but I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li>I really like this pallet price is great and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that there aren&#x27;t huge chunks of glitter or sparkle in any of the blushes.  </li>
            <li>I love the variety and the quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to carry around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The packaging is no fuss and easy to store.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin that tans rather easily.</li>
            <li>long-lasting beautiful colors, super soft texture and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>The colors are all beautiful in the pans, but on your skin turn out somewhat different.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have purchased so far from this line.</li>
            <li>and I feel I can use most of the shades in this palette so its definetely worth getting.</li>
            <li>blendable and smooth</li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for great makeup and colors for a low price.</li>
            <li>the palette is nice and compact: great for personal use, just ok for professional use.</li>
            <li>and they did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li>I have tried two colors so far and loved them.  </li>
            <li>I use this mainly on women of color and brown skin tones and all the colors look nice and show well.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive my blush pallet today.  </li>
            <li>its a great palette for someone just starting out, variety of colors and good for various skintones</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with 7 of the 10 shadows, so it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved makeup, but never have really had much of it.</li>
            <li>Can probably use as eyeshadow but only the bright pinks show up on darker complexions.  </li>
            <li>Overall good service.</li>
            <li>I love the peachy-pink shades, and there is a good mix of matte and slightly shimmery blushes.  </li>
            <li>I have 2 Coastal Scents eyeshadow palettes and have been quite happy with those, but reading the other reviews on this product, it seemed like the blushes might not be as pigmented as the shadows.  </li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful on dark skin and stays where it lays ladies!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good quality blush palette for so long and kept coming across Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite go to blushes.</li>
            <li>it gives you so many different shades of pink blushes and their a good size so it will last and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Has many different color choices, and mixing colors is quick and easy with one palette.  </li>
            <li>Obviously higher end brands are going to be better but for a starter makeup it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>You can mix the colors to make them more intense or more neutral, so you get many more colors than only ten.</li>
            <li>I wanted the make-up geek set but decided id try these first!</li>
            <li>this is great for beginners, i looked into buy from amazon because it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li>I find this blush palette to be very shimmery, cheap lookin (when applied) and non compatible with darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>very pigmented so  light hand in needed.</li>
            <li>that is even worth</li>
            <li>, IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li>The colors look nice on white skin, but are not recommanded for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>me using is the one in the top far right corner.</li>
            <li>love the pigmentation has matte and shimmery colors, looks gorgeous doesn&#x27;t last for much long, would last for a night out, works better for girls with paler skin, specially if you like experimenting with colors, for those of you with darker tones not all the colors will suit you.</li>
            <li>Good colors to use on a special occassion, not for everyday makeup because of breakouts.</li>
            <li>right there in my makeup bag..</li>
            <li>Smooth, easy application and on my dry skin</li>
            <li>I first saw a review of this blush palette on youtube</li>
            <li>Since first getting it, I have used it a ton</li>
            <li>I first learned about this makeup line on YouTube, and decided I was gonna Check it out for myself.</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>many to choose from to go with different makeup looks.  </li>
            <li>Its good fr people that are starers or people that don&#x27;t do makeup everyday and also people that are makeup addicts.</li>
            <li>(Just felt I should put that since other reviews state what kind of complexion they have.)</li>
            <li>My biggest mistake was that the first time I got these, I used too much of it.</li>
            <li>They are a large size as well.</li>
            <li>you can achieve such a natural look, and another great thing, the colors stay on all day long!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care too much for this blush</li>
            <li>The order came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been much fan of blush until I got this palette...</li>
            <li>VERY PIGMENTED.</li>
            <li>I really like this pallette</li>
            <li>But I really like all the colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented so its something you&#x27;d need to build up.</li>
            <li>when I received the product I was so happy until I saw that the colors were broken.</li>
            <li>While Amazon did their best to cushion original packaging by wrapping tightly in bubble, the inside package was still cracked, broken, and pulverized when received -</li>
            <li>They are as wonderful (if not better) than some of the more expensive brands out there in my opinion.</li>
            <li>In order to get a desirable look you have to pack on alot and blend 2 or more colors together for it to look half decent.</li>
            <li>So my cheeks ended up looking super red.</li>
            <li>Color tins are big and colors are very pretty.  </li>
            <li>I also did not expect them to be so highly pigmented, but that&#x27;s a plus if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented blushes..pleasently suprised on how well they go on.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>I should be honest and say that I do not use rogue everyday, Mostly because I&#x27;m still young (not trying to brag, just saying), so I don&#x27;t need colour everyday.</li>
            <li>so idk what I&#x27;m going to do with the browns maybe just for a little Color on days that I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup even as an eyeshadow maybe love packaging</li>
            <li>I have all the colors that I normally wear in one set.</li>
            <li>Pretty sheer for a medium tanned face; you would have to pile it on in order to see something, but overall, not bad.  </li>
            <li>It has so many colors and is inexpensive will last me a very long time</li>
            <li>well, this palette git a very nice variety of colors , but the quality is not good enough,</li>
            <li>I live in Southern California so most days my cheeks are red from just being outside.</li>
            <li>As a professional make up artist I stronlgy recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually invest in rogue, but I&#x27;m glad for spending money on this.</li>
            <li>and this is exactly the same as the one from coastal scents that my friend has.</li>
            <li>i say just ok for professional use, because the paler (not bright) blushes are very chalky.</li>
            <li>it doesnt give the face a glow or a natural look.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and I use this on practically all of my clients.</li>
            <li>They are natural and stayed.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just about every color you&#x27;d need for a natural look.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant,they last and they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>overall, the palette is very affordable for 10 blushes inside sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li>However, I received my palette today and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Colors can be blended and are natural..</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, I have to say that I was surprised how vibrant the colors actually were.</li>
            <li>Okay, I was skeptical at first...</li>
            <li>product was not what i expected and it is not pigmented enough but it is ok for now- have not gotten response back to return back</li>
            <li>The blushes dry out my skin and don&#x27;t really match my completion.</li>
            <li>Your money is WAY better spent getting few Nyx blushes from Ulta.</li>
            <li>I advise that people build the color because when I 1st used the light pink I put on entirely too much and as my little sister put it,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will last me a long time, since I only need a little bit to add the desired color</li>
            <li>I love all of the blushes, but when it was shipped one color was broken although it was wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>You really get a wide variety in this palette!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice amount of product that will last you for a while &amp; can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either.</li>
            <li>Since its build-able it works very well from anyone, if your look is either less noticeable or more dramatic.</li>

            <li> and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> Also, is fairly sweat-proof for stage make-up.  </li>

            <li> I so love this palette!</li>
            <li> I love my purchase, 10 to 1 any day!</li>
            <li> The color selection is amazing</li>
            <li> The company&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of their own.</li>
            <li> I really liked the palette.</li>
            <li> I used nice brushes and I can&#x27;t get these to work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice purchase i think</li>
            <li> some of them are kind of orangy tho.</li>
            <li> liked the product but the case and the box</li>
            <li> colors are nice but feels</li>
            <li> Very good quality, I like it very much  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li> It ends up pretty streaky throughout the day so the staying power isn&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and i love that it&#x27;s easy to pick up on my brush</li>
            <li> I was looking for a warm palette of eye shadows but couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t include a lot of very light \\&quot;highlighter\\&quot; colors, which I also don&#x27;t use, and a lot of blues...</li>
            <li> I am okay with this product because the colors are nice, but the quality is not there.  </li>
            <li> The colors are nicely pigmented and I love the colors for my pro makeup kit.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m fine with it!</li>
            <li> I have very light skin</li>
            <li> Also the color variations are amazing s its easy to change up your style.  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great packaging!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, and the colors are really nice!</li>
            <li> Im now a HUGE fan!</li>
            <li> The palette is huge!  </li>
            <li> I love this palette..</li>
            <li> and I totally love it.</li>
            <li> most of the color don&#x27;t show up.</li>
            <li> They really go on smooth and stay put! -</li>
            <li> I love my brush pallete</li>
            <li> YOU WONT REGRET IT. :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> However it´s okay to use this palette from time to time,</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> :)  :)</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> it is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love Coastal Scents anything.</li>
            <li> More for your money.</li>
            <li> I love having all of my blushes in one place.</li>
            <li> the color palette works better for her tone.</li>
            <li> I love all Coastal Scent products, and this one was no exception.  </li>
            <li> , I think I could be better</li>
            <li> I am enjoying this palette and being able to create so many looks.</li>
            <li> The blushes are ok</li>
            <li> , they also send me a free pallet which I thought was amazing</li>
            <li> There are some blushes that cost more than this one palette</li>
            <li> I love this palette</li>
            <li> Pigment is awsome love the colors</li>
            <li> and I honestly don&#x27;t know what else to say other than this was and excellently wonderful purchase for me.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented and great quality.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and a tad more vibrant than the photos, but I am very impressed.  </li>
            <li> I really like this pallet price is great and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that there aren&#x27;t huge chunks of glitter or sparkle in any of the blushes.  </li>
            <li> I love the variety and the quality is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so easy to carry around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The packaging is no fuss and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin that tans rather easily.</li>
            <li> long-lasting beautiful colors, super soft texture and easy to blend.</li>
            <li> The colors are all beautiful in the pans, but on your skin turn out somewhat different.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have purchased so far from this line.</li>
            <li> and I feel I can use most of the shades in this palette so its definetely worth getting.</li>
            <li> blendable and smooth</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for great makeup and colors for a low price.</li>
            <li> the palette is nice and compact: great for personal use, just ok for professional use.</li>
            <li> and they did a fantastic job.</li>
            <li> I have tried two colors so far and loved them.  </li>
            <li> I use this mainly on women of color and brown skin tones and all the colors look nice and show well.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my blush pallet today.  </li>
            <li> its a great palette for someone just starting out, variety of colors and good for various skintones</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with 7 of the 10 shadows, so it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved makeup, but never have really had much of it.</li>
            <li> Can probably use as eyeshadow but only the bright pinks show up on darker complexions.  </li>
            <li> Overall good service.</li>
            <li> I love the peachy-pink shades, and there is a good mix of matte and slightly shimmery blushes.  </li>
            <li> I have 2 Coastal Scents eyeshadow palettes and have been quite happy with those, but reading the other reviews on this product, it seemed like the blushes might not be as pigmented as the shadows.  </li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful on dark skin and stays where it lays ladies!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality blush palette for so long and kept coming across Coastal Scents.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite go to blushes.</li>
            <li> it gives you so many different shades of pink blushes and their a good size so it will last and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Has many different color choices, and mixing colors is quick and easy with one palette.  </li>
            <li> Obviously higher end brands are going to be better but for a starter makeup it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> You can mix the colors to make them more intense or more neutral, so you get many more colors than only ten.</li>
            <li> I wanted the make-up geek set but decided id try these first!</li>
            <li> this is great for beginners, i looked into buy from amazon because it was a little cheaper</li>
            <li> I find this blush palette to be very shimmery, cheap lookin (when applied) and non compatible with darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> very pigmented so  light hand in needed.</li>
            <li> that is even worth</li>
            <li> , IT IS SO WORTH</li>
            <li> The colors look nice on white skin, but are not recommanded for darker skin tones.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> me using is the one in the top far right corner.</li>
            <li> love the pigmentation has matte and shimmery colors, looks gorgeous doesn&#x27;t last for much long, would last for a night out, works better for girls with paler skin, specially if you like experimenting with colors, for those of you with darker tones not all the colors will suit you.</li>
            <li> Good colors to use on a special occassion, not for everyday makeup because of breakouts.</li>
            <li> right there in my makeup bag..</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy application and on my dry skin</li>
            <li> I first saw a review of this blush palette on youtube</li>
            <li> Since first getting it, I have used it a ton</li>
            <li> I first learned about this makeup line on YouTube, and decided I was gonna Check it out for myself.</li>
            <li> the colors are pretty.</li>
            <li> many to choose from to go with different makeup looks.  </li>
            <li> Its good fr people that are starers or people that don&#x27;t do makeup everyday and also people that are makeup addicts.</li>
            <li> (Just felt I should put that since other reviews state what kind of complexion they have.)</li>
            <li> My biggest mistake was that the first time I got these, I used too much of it.</li>
            <li> They are a large size as well.</li>
            <li> you can achieve such a natural look, and another great thing, the colors stay on all day long!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care too much for this blush</li>
            <li> The order came in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much fan of blush until I got this palette...</li>
            <li> VERY PIGMENTED.</li>
            <li> I really like this pallette</li>
            <li> But I really like all the colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented so its something you&#x27;d need to build up.</li>
            <li> when I received the product I was so happy until I saw that the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> While Amazon did their best to cushion original packaging by wrapping tightly in bubble, the inside package was still cracked, broken, and pulverized when received -</li>
            <li> They are as wonderful (if not better) than some of the more expensive brands out there in my opinion.</li>
            <li> In order to get a desirable look you have to pack on alot and blend 2 or more colors together for it to look half decent.</li>
            <li> So my cheeks ended up looking super red.</li>
            <li> Color tins are big and colors are very pretty.  </li>
            <li> I also did not expect them to be so highly pigmented, but that&#x27;s a plus if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented blushes..pleasently suprised on how well they go on.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> I should be honest and say that I do not use rogue everyday, Mostly because I&#x27;m still young (not trying to brag, just saying), so I don&#x27;t need colour everyday.</li>
            <li> so idk what I&#x27;m going to do with the browns maybe just for a little Color on days that I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup even as an eyeshadow maybe love packaging</li>
            <li> I have all the colors that I normally wear in one set.</li>
            <li> Pretty sheer for a medium tanned face; you would have to pile it on in order to see something, but overall, not bad.  </li>
            <li> It has so many colors and is inexpensive will last me a very long time</li>
            <li> well, this palette git a very nice variety of colors , but the quality is not good enough,</li>
            <li> I live in Southern California so most days my cheeks are red from just being outside.</li>
            <li> As a professional make up artist I stronlgy recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually invest in rogue, but I&#x27;m glad for spending money on this.</li>
            <li> and this is exactly the same as the one from coastal scents that my friend has.</li>
            <li> i say just ok for professional use, because the paler (not bright) blushes are very chalky.</li>
            <li> it doesnt give the face a glow or a natural look.</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist and I use this on practically all of my clients.</li>
            <li> They are natural and stayed.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just about every color you&#x27;d need for a natural look.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant,they last and they are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> overall, the palette is very affordable for 10 blushes inside sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li> However, I received my palette today and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Colors can be blended and are natural..</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, I have to say that I was surprised how vibrant the colors actually were.</li>
            <li> Okay, I was skeptical at first...</li>
            <li> product was not what i expected and it is not pigmented enough but it is ok for now- have not gotten response back to return back</li>
            <li> The blushes dry out my skin and don&#x27;t really match my completion.</li>
            <li> Your money is WAY better spent getting few Nyx blushes from Ulta.</li>
            <li> I advise that people build the color because when I 1st used the light pink I put on entirely too much and as my little sister put it,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they will last me a long time, since I only need a little bit to add the desired color</li>
            <li> I love all of the blushes, but when it was shipped one color was broken although it was wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> You really get a wide variety in this palette!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice amount of product that will last you for a while &amp; can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either.</li>
            <li> Since its build-able it works very well from anyone, if your look is either less noticeable or more dramatic.</li>
            <li> some of them are chalky, and if they&#x27;re not chalky their stiff, and if they&#x27;re not stiff they are way too powder-y and drying (made my light-medium skin look ashy!!!).</li>
            <li> This palette is highly pigmented which surprised me because I was expecting it to be a little harder to sweep up on my brush</li>
            <li> The only down side is the colors don&#x27;t really pop on dark skin, I usually use another blush on dark skin since these don&#x27;t really show up much, that is why I give this 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Just watch how much you put on the brush a little goes a long way with this brand!</li>
            <li> As stated in other reviews, apply lightly at first and add a little at a time to get the shade you want.</li>
            <li> Long lasting blush</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> Just tap lightly and build slowly because a little does a lot with this set.</li>
            <li> This is money well spent because when you think about it, you&#x27;re getting 10 awesome colors for this price its insane.</li>
            <li> The pink in the bottom left corner broke apart after about 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have a medium complexion (NC35) and found that a few of these shades barely show up on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid of the dark/bright colors, just use a light hand.  </li>
            <li> this is by far one of my least fave product by coastel scents.</li>
            <li> In a variety of pink shades.</li>
            <li> This blush set was not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> the colors are also not right for dark skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pale and the colors are way too dark for me.</li>
            <li> if your someone with a medium to a dark complexion this is definitley not the blush for you!</li>
            <li> I recommend to start with a little bit of blush and build it up because these are so pigmented that if you use a heavy hand you will end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday</li>
            <li> heavy handed&#x3D;clown makeup.</li>
            <li> The colors can be quite stark if you apply heavily.  </li>
            <li> the size is small compared to the contour &amp; blusher palette it is about half size</li>
            <li> away,,i say it shoeld cost atleast $10 or less!</li>
            <li> very little pigment with little to no longevity.</li>
            <li> I use the blush everyday!  </li>
            <li> but the blendability sucks, they&#x27;re also a bit chalky.</li>
            <li> Not a good vendor</li>
            <li> Poorly pigmented, doesn&#x27;t apply well.</li>
            <li> but it cannot compare to the expensive makeup brands.</li>
            <li> I became addicted to it!</li>
            <li> it has mineral oil, I got pimples like crazy.  </li>
            <li> all of the blushes are inconsistent in texture and they are all bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and will be returning this.</li>
            <li> i hate this palette with a passion.</li>
            <li> -i was very disappointed with the condition to which the item arrived:(</li>
            <li> I did and I am no way in any shape or form disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very unhappy with this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this palette.. I was never into blush and recently started liking it... this palette covers all colors... and it&#x27;s so easy to carry around!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no complaints.. right there in my makeup bag.. blush palette of every color I need</li>
            <li> I find this blush palette to be very shimmery, cheap lookin (when applied) and non compatible with darker skin tones. it doesnt give the face a glow or a natural look. In order to get a desirable look you have to pack on alot and blend 2 or more colors together for it to look half decent. this is by far one of my least fave product by coastel scents. if your someone with a medium to a dark complexion this is definitley not the blush for you!</li>
            <li> I first saw a review of this blush palette on youtube and I was convinced I had to get one for myself. I have always loved makeup, but never have really had much of it. Anyway, I figure this palette would be a great start into building up my makeup collection. Since first getting it, I have used it a ton and I totally love it.Everyone should have one of their own. My skintone is medium/olive and I feel I can use most of the shades in this palette so its definetely worth getting. The packaging is no fuss and easy to store. In all, this palette is a must-have for all!</li>
            <li> I really liked the palette. It has so many colors and is inexpensive will last me a very long time</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive my blush pallet today.  Color tins are big and colors are very pretty.  They go on smooth and look flawless.  I really like this pallet price is great and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I found the application to be below expectations- the colors are also not right for dark skin.  Can probably use as eyeshadow but only the bright pinks show up on darker complexions.  A good buy if you don&#x27;t mind having to use a lot of dust on the brush or have a fair complexion.  I would not recommend otherwise.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care too much for this blush most of the color don&#x27;t show up. I am a caramel color as I have a tan and only blush that is even worth me using is the one in the top far right corner.</li>
            <li> Okay, I was skeptical at first... but these are great! I love the variety and the quality is fantastic. They are as wonderful (if not better) than some of the more expensive brands out there in my opinion. They really go on smooth and stay put! - would definitely recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I love my brush pallete this is the 1st item I&#x27;ve purchased from Coastal Scents and I will def. buy more makeup from this line!  I advise that people build the color because when I 1st used the light pink I put on entirely too much and as my little sister put it, \\&quot;Looked like I&#x27;d been slapped in both cheecks\\&quot; LOL!   I like how there&#x27;s glittery and matte colors that&#x27;s a plus and the price, under $20, is also a plus!  I like how there are many differn tones and no matter what your coor all tones look good!  I have very light skin and I tried all the tones on myself and they all look great when used in moderation!</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast, and the colors are really nice! you can achieve such a natural look, and another great thing, the colors stay on all day long! I&#x27;m sure they will last me a long time, since I only need a little bit to add the desired color/look to my face. I am really happy with the purchase. I definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> This palette is awesome! I am a professional makeup artist and I use this on practically all of my clients. The only down side is the colors don&#x27;t really pop on dark skin, I usually use another blush on dark skin since these don&#x27;t really show up much, that is why I give this 4 stars. Great for medium to fair skin though, great color choices and a lot of options!</li>
            <li> The order came in a very timely manner. My wife was ecstatic when she got the item. Overall good service.</li>
            <li> I love this blush palette! Great contour colors and great pigmented blushes. Use this everyday and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I JUST RECEIVED THE PACKAGE TODAY AND COULD NOT WAIT TO OPEN IT. WHEN I OPENED IT OH MY GOSH WERE THE COLORS SO BEAUTIFUL AND THE PANS ARE SO BIG, IT IS SO WORTH THE MONEY. I MUST SAY THIS IS A MUST HAVE...I LOOK SO FOWARD TO TRYING ALL THE COLORS  AND I WOULD SAY THIS IS A MUST HAVE....SO BUY ONE AND BELIEVE ME YOU WONT REGRET IT. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried two colors so far and loved them.  They are natural and stayed.  They have also seemed to give my complexion a flawlessness I have never seen.  Definitely will order this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item with another account.&lt;br /&gt;I love the pigmentation has matte and shimmery colors, looks gorgeous doesn&#x27;t last for much long, would last for a night out, works better for girls with paler skin, specially if you like experimenting with colors, for those of you with darker tones not all the colors will suit you.</li>
            <li> The BEST blush kit on the market! The finishes are outstanding and the pigment is perfect. There&#x27;s just about every color you&#x27;d need for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have a olive skin tone complexion and i just loved the colors and how it fits perfect with my skin tone.All in all I LOVED IT!!! I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE them. I wanted the make-up geek set but decided id try these first! very pigmented so  light hand in needed. heavy handed&#x3D;clown makeup. lots of variety!. I do side jobs for proms/weddings and this palate gives me the ability to match any skin tone! I would say this set is great for darker skinned girls but I have fair skin and I use it daily. blendable and smooth</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have purchased so far from this line. The colors look nice on white skin, but are not recommanded for darker skin tones. However it´s okay to use this palette from time to time, but it cannot compare to the expensive makeup brands.</li>
            <li> This  blush is terrific!  The colors are beautiful, goes on smoothly. As stated in other reviews, apply lightly at first and add a little at a time to get the shade you want. The colors can be quite stark if you apply heavily.  Nice case and a great deal for the price.  You won&#x27;t regret your purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The colors are awesome and I honestly don&#x27;t know what else to say other than this was and excellently wonderful purchase for me.</li>
            <li> This palette is highly pigmented which surprised me because I was expecting it to be a little harder to sweep up on my brush but I only needed to tap my brush into any color to get a big amount of product on it. The colors are great and i love that it&#x27;s easy to pick up on my brush so I don&#x27;t have to dig into it. Just tap lightly and build slowly because a little does a lot with this set.</li>
            <li> I loved it! Long lasting blush In a variety of pink shades. I Definitely recommend to purchase&lt;br /&gt;- very happy customer</li>
            <li> I first learned about this makeup line on YouTube, and decided I was gonna Check it out for myself. I did and I am no way in any shape or form disappointed! The colors are vibrant,they last and they are reasonably priced. For one eye shadow from mack I could get multiple colors from coastal scents! Im now a HUGE fan! I would definitely recommend this product to allll makeup lovers.</li>
            <li> didnt like the colors way to pigmented</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been much fan of blush until I got this palette... I became addicted to it! I just love it! long-lasting beautiful colors, super soft texture and easy to blend. As a professional make up artist I stronlgy recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My wife likes the blushes. She can put one on different days and even blend them together.</li>
            <li> I am okay with this product because the colors are nice, but the quality is not there.  Pretty sheer for a medium tanned face; you would have to pile it on in order to see something, but overall, not bad.  The problem may be because i have mac blushes, this product can&#x27;t come close to.</li>
            <li> Great product!  The colors are very pigmented and a tad more vibrant than the photos, but I am very impressed.  Smooth, easy application and on my dry skin, the staying power is very good. Them palette exceeded my expectations.  :)  :)</li>
            <li> I feel like I can only use a couple of colors out of this palette. I&#x27;m really pale and the colors are way too dark for me. They don&#x27;t blend well at all. I used nice brushes and I can&#x27;t get these to work for me.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of colors that it has so you can match the perfect blush to whatever occasion. It is great quality, it lasts all day. It also works for different skin tones as well.</li>
            <li> VERY PIGMENTED. Definitely worth the money. I like the different choices in colors, but for some reason, I feel like when they&#x27;re on your face..they look similar. Great purchase! You get some bang for your buck</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! The color selection is amazing and so is the pigmentation of the blushes! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I love all of the blushes, but when it was shipped one color was broken although it was wrapped in bubble wrap. I would buy this pallet again.</li>
            <li> The palette is huge!  I ended up buying something else because this palette is just way too big to keep in my makeup bag and it is way too big to take on a trip.</li>
            <li> i love it. it is wonderfull. it is my favorite. i use it every day. it is excelllent. i recommend it</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Super fast shipping and great packaging!</li>
            <li> I love these blushes they are so beautiful. The colors are fantastic. They last a long time. I recommend to start with a little bit of blush and build it up because these are so pigmented that if you use a heavy hand you will end up looking like a clown. I recommend these if you&#x27;re looking for great makeup and colors for a low price.</li>
            <li> the colors are pretty. but the blendability sucks, they&#x27;re also a bit chalky. If you&#x27;re looking for good quality look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This is a great palette and has beautiful colors. for the price this was a great purchase. Good for all makeup artists.</li>
            <li> This blush set was not really what I expected.  The blushes dry out my skin and don&#x27;t really match my completion.</li>
            <li> The colors are nicely pigmented and I love the colors for my pro makeup kit. I use this mainly on women of color and brown skin tones and all the colors look nice and show well.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and I love the quality, size, box type of the product, and even more it was received into a very good plastic bubble wrap packaging. NICE!!</li>
            <li> the size is small compared to the contour &amp; blusher palette it is about half size</li>
            <li> Love Coastal Scents anything. Highly pigmented and great quality.</li>
            <li> well, this palette git a very nice variety of colors , but the quality is not good enough, Nice purchase i think</li>
            <li> the palette is nice and compact: great for personal use, just ok for professional use. i say just ok for professional use, because the paler (not bright) blushes are very chalky. they basically have to be applied damp in order to increase the color payoff. the bright blushes, however are awesomely pigmented. overall, the palette is very affordable for 10 blushes inside sturdy packaging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using this palette. The pink in the bottom left corner broke apart after about 3 days. So I have the 9 others. I only use 4 or 5 of the others, but who knows!</li>
            <li> I love having all the options! The blush is of good quality too! Just watch how much you put on the brush a little goes a long way with this brand!</li>
            <li> Closer to 4.5, I suppose. I have olive skin that tans rather easily. (Just felt I should put that since other reviews state what kind of complexion they have.) My biggest mistake was that the first time I got these, I used too much of it. Because I was so used to inferior products, I used the same application techniques I had with them. So my cheeks ended up looking super red. Almost like a doll&#x27;s. I did not make that mistake ever again. I also did not expect them to be so highly pigmented, but that&#x27;s a plus if you ask me. More for your money. I should be honest and say that I do not use rogue everyday, Mostly because I&#x27;m still young (not trying to brag, just saying), so I don&#x27;t need colour everyday. I live in Southern California so most days my cheeks are red from just being outside. I don&#x27;t usually invest in rogue, but I&#x27;m glad for spending money on this.</li>
            <li> This blush palette is wonderful. I love having all of my blushes in one place. I have a deep skin tone, and there are only about 2 that i probably won&#x27;t use often. Must buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skinned so the fact the colors are a littler sheer/metallic it can make my appear ashy.   I gave it to my mom the color palette works better for her tone.</li>
            <li> this blush palette lasts forever because even the smallest amount is still enough. many to choose from to go with different makeup looks.  some of them are kind of orangy tho. i stick with the bronzes and pinks</li>
            <li> I love all Coastal Scent products, and this one was no exception.  Has many different color choices, and mixing colors is quick and easy with one palette.  The case is sturdy.  Before buying this, I had 3 different palettes that I would use.  Now, I only need this palette which saves a lot of space.  Get it; it won&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I use these as eye shadows.  I was looking for a warm palette of eye shadows but couldn&#x27;t find one that didn&#x27;t include a lot of very light \\&quot;highlighter\\&quot; colors, which I also don&#x27;t use, and a lot of blues...I don&#x27;t use those either. This is great. You can mix the colors to make them more intense or more neutral, so you get many more colors than only ten. They can of course also be used as blushes, contouring powder and bronzers, which they were intended for anyway.  They are a large size as well.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented blushes..pleasently suprised on how well they go on.</li>
            <li> While Amazon did their best to cushion original packaging by wrapping tightly in bubble, the inside package was still cracked, broken, and pulverized when received - I&#x27;m disappointed and will be returning this. Manufacturer needs to reformulate to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> LOVE this blush pallet! Colors are beautiful, goes on smooth and stays on all day! Buying another, for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this pallette, I think I could be better but I&#x27;m fine with it! I love Coastal Scents products!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, I like it very much  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..</li>
            <li> Yet again I never got the product. I&#x27;m very unhappy with this! This was the second time I tried to order. Not a good vendor</li>
            <li> i hate this palette with a passion. all of the blushes are inconsistent in texture and they are all bad. some of them are chalky, and if they&#x27;re not chalky their stiff, and if they&#x27;re not stiff they are way too powder-y and drying (made my light-medium skin look ashy!!!). very little pigment with little to no longevity. i had it sitting on my vanity collecting dust for a year and finally threw it away. felt so good.</li>
            <li> You really get a wide variety in this palette! I am enjoying this palette and being able to create so many looks. You do not need to pack on the color to get a good look. Highly suggest.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented assortment of colors. You literally need a dab of the powder to get the job done. I found this formula to be much different than a Coastal Scents trial I received from ipsy once (the reason I bought this palette). It ends up pretty streaky throughout the day so the staying power isn&#x27;t very good. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again or necessarily recommend.</li>
            <li> nice blush palette beautiful colors</li>
            <li> They only thing I would change about this set is I would have added a mirror to the lid! But I really like all the colors.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good quality blush palette for so long and kept coming across Coastal Scents. I was always a skeptic when reading the reviews and thought that they could be influenced by the actual company. However, I received my palette today and was pleasantly surprised. First off, the packaging was absolutely perfect. It came wrapped in bubble tape to ensure that the product would not get damaged en route through delivery and they did a fantastic job. As for the product itself, I have to say that I was surprised how vibrant the colors actually were. A variety of hues like pinks and bronze types make this the perfect must-have palette. It is the perfect buy so if you are thinking about it definitely go for it!</li>
            <li> I went back and forth about ordering this product.  I have 2 Coastal Scents eyeshadow palettes and have been quite happy with those, but reading the other reviews on this product, it seemed like the blushes might not be as pigmented as the shadows.  The colors are all beautiful in the pans, but on your skin turn out somewhat different.  I have a medium complexion (NC35) and found that a few of these shades barely show up on my skin tone.  I can&#x27;t imagine them showing up on a darker complexion at all.  I love the peachy-pink shades, and there is a good mix of matte and slightly shimmery blushes.  I&#x27;m glad that there aren&#x27;t huge chunks of glitter or sparkle in any of the blushes.  Overall I&#x27;m happy with 7 of the 10 shadows, so it&#x27;s definitely worth purchasing in my opinion.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with chalkiness, either, as some others may have experienced.  And: it&#x27;s perfect for travel!  I truly recommend this and use it almost every day now.</li>
            <li> I received this product on time and it was what I had actually ordered. The blushes are ok but I&#x27;m not a blush junkie yet so maybe if I keep working with it I like it more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it if you like blushes!!!</li>
            <li> this is great for beginners, i looked into buy from amazon because it was a little cheaper and this is exactly the same as the one from coastal scents that my friend has. its a great palette for someone just starting out, variety of colors and good for various skintones</li>
            <li> Great buy I use the blush everyday!  It works just as good as the products you get at the counter!</li>
            <li> The pigmentation on these are wonderful.  Don&#x27;t be afraid of the dark/bright colors, just use a light hand.  I bought this for my daughter and I will probably get one for myself!</li>
            <li> Great Gift!!&lt;br /&gt;CGrays</li>
            <li> Product is not the best quality, but you get what you pay for. I will never purchase this product again.  I will find a different brand.</li>
            <li> These colors look good on any skin tone/ face shape.  The colors are very pigmented so its something you&#x27;d need to build up. Since its build-able it works very well from anyone, if your look is either less noticeable or more dramatic. Also the color variations are amazing s its easy to change up your style.  These are my new favorite go to blushes. Its good fr people that are starers or people that don&#x27;t do makeup everyday and also people that are makeup addicts. This pallets AMAZING!! This is money well spent because when you think about it, you&#x27;re getting 10 awesome colors for this price its insane. The company&#x27;s amazing, they also send me a free pallet which I thought was amazing cause they value costumer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> when I received the product I was so happy until I saw that the colors were broken. 4 in total!!! I&#x27;m devastated!!!</li>
            <li> I so love this palette! I have all the colors that I normally wear in one set. The colors are beautiful on dark skin and stays where it lays ladies! They&#x27;re not thirsty looking, or cakey looking either. It&#x27;s a nice amount of product that will last you for a while &amp; can&#x27;t go wrong with the price either. There are some blushes that cost more than this one palette and you just get \\&quot;1\\&quot; blush; hell with that! I love my purchase, 10 to 1 any day!</li>
            <li> I love this palette it gives you so many different shades of pink blushes and their a good size so it will last and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Ugh, just skip it. Your money is WAY better spent getting few Nyx blushes from Ulta. Poorly pigmented, doesn&#x27;t apply well. Several of these aren&#x27;t even blush colors! Don&#x27;t call it blush if it&#x27;s not!</li>
            <li> product was not what i expected and it is not pigmented enough but it is ok for now- have not gotten response back to return back</li>
            <li> I was looking for a pallet with different colors, I like the colors in this and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> La mejoor paleta miy compacta ya tengo un año con ellas.</li>
            <li> liked the product but the case and the box came damaged-i was very disappointed with the condition to which the item arrived:(</li>
            <li> it has mineral oil, I got pimples like crazy.  Good colors to use on a special occassion, not for everyday makeup because of breakouts.</li>
            <li> colors are nice but feels n looks cheapy chalky ,,i just gave mine away,,i say it shoeld cost atleast $10 or less!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend recently requested this as a gift based on the recommendations of a friend. She loves it and appreciates the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Must have for every collection! Great for contouring also. Colors can be blended and are natural.. I recommend for every one.</li>
            <li> Blends well and has enough options for any skin types.  Also, is fairly sweat-proof for stage make-up.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> Coastal scents really is very good for the price. Obviously higher end brands are going to be better but for a starter makeup it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> that was not like my excpation</li>
            <li> Pigment is awsome love the colors however I&#x27;m a nc25 so idk what I&#x27;m going to do with the browns maybe just for a little Color on days that I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup even as an eyeshadow maybe love packaging</li>
