            <li>Amazing!  </li>
            <li>This is the most comforting and delicious fragrance to wear.</li>
            <li>This very true to scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great on its own</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m adding this happily to my oil warmers for the home instead of wearing as my own fragrance.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of the good reviews - what a mistake...</li>
            <li>Paste is a good description.</li>
            <li>While the name isn&#x27;t terribly attractive, the scent is deliciously warm and inviting.</li>
            <li>Smell so good.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!!</li>
            <li>Very nice but potent.  </li>
            <li>Great product and definately worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>that i have tried over the years, this is a close second best (the best hasn&#x27;t been produced in many years, so it&#x27;s a moot point).</li>
            <li>I LOVE this scent!</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Much MUCH more!  </li>
            <li>MORE BEING ORDERED!</li>
            <li>LOVE this!</li>
            <li>However, it was handy to be able to order it from Amazon and have it delivered without the 25 mile drive!.</li>
            <li>just pure delicious amber.</li>
            <li>Amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is nice and musky, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is a nice incense type of fragrance that even blending with Jasmine and anise I didn&#x27;t care for it on my skin.</li>
            <li>Nice scent but</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how many people love it!</li>
            <li>This product is almost as good as the one I use to buy, but I have not found any that is better (that is currently available).</li>
            <li>I love the warm amber top notes, but as it wears, it smells nothing like Amber.</li>
            <li>Makes a very fine aroma that I love.  </li>
            <li>Love this amber product.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Amber, I have tried the butter, oil, resin, etc.</li>
            <li>But, it grows on you :)</li>
            <li>Oh my, what a lovely sent.</li>
            <li>I love it and will order again and again :)</li>
            <li>just wish there was more in it.</li>
            <li>Fabulous scent!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like it smells better and better through out the day.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering (read:  Hoarding) more.  </li>
            <li>I received my order today and I am in love.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and the Egyptian musk, the Egyptian musk one smells Fantastic!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite Ambers  </li>
            <li>If you love amber, you must have Amber Paste in your repertoire.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely stunning.  </li>
            <li>I love amber oil as perfume</li>
            <li>That being said, I am a fragrance junky: I love perfume oils and hand-crafted scents.  </li>
            <li>It smells so wonderful to me, sweet, warm, exotic, slightly spicy.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the paste, I use it first on the inside of my wrists; rub it in, then apply the roll on of  &amp;#34;Auric Blends Fine Perfume Roll On Amber&amp;#34; on top of the paste and rub it in.  </li>
            <li>The paste is simply wonderful and all I expected.</li>
            <li>It is a strong Amber, but has the undertone of a smell like lead.  </li>
            <li>This also has strong hints of honey and 60% of my health &amp; beauty items are phone or beeswax but still I can&#x27;t wear this Amber paste.</li>
            <li>If you like true amber, you will love this.</li>
            <li>the perfect dark amber.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for a man or woman.  </li>
            <li>This was a little birthday indulgence for myself, and it&#x27;s awesome.  </li>
            <li>and this smells like really cheap candy - just</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>Not only do I smell wonderful, amber is a very grounding aroma, so it helps keep me settled and focused.</li>
            <li>It is different and way superior to most amber oils and perfumes..</li>
            <li>Also very pleased with the super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>is indeed a very powerful, rich smell.</li>
            <li>none of that powdery sweet cheap amber that you find everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I would like the amber sent originally because, I like every perfume with an amber scent.</li>
            <li>Love it so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Rich, Sweet, Intoxicating, Woodsy but not over powering.  </li>
            <li>When the container is full, removing the cap / stick pulls out a significant amount of the paste.  </li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>
            <li>This is sticky sweet vanilla-honey-amber-woods goodness.</li>
            <li>This Amber Paste is probably one of my favorite finds to date; I found it while sniffing around the perfume section of Whole Body.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet, earthy fragrance</li>
            <li>Kuumba Made procuces the BEST amber paste out there.&lt;br /&gt;After using this great amber past for a few months, it has been one of my holy&lt;br /&gt;grail</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great with other perfumes without amber or with it.</li>
            <li>but I mainly use it for making \\&quot;Egyptian Musk\\&quot; which smells even better.</li>
            <li>Extremely quick to ship, received about two days after I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d never be able to find this again but took a chance and ordered it, I was overjoyed when I opened the vial to discover the same exact product!!!</li>
            <li>Very nice; more like a thick oil.</li>
            <li>If you like a fairly strong, direct, and rich amber, this is for you.</li>
            <li>the company is mostly all natural as well.</li>
            <li>I am an amber lover, and prefer the more traditional, earthy ones to the light flowery ambers.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>very nice ,a little dot goes along way.</li>
            <li>small bottle for the price, though the quality seem to be great.</li>
            <li>Because the container is so small, the stick + paste barely fits unless you line it up perfectly, so you end up with paste all around the lip of the container, which is wasteful and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells very much like incense with a pungy musty smell...</li>
            <li>highly recommend Amber Paste for that true amber</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this amber paste to anyone seeking a true amber fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful scent and being a concentrated paste, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have owned this product many times over the years as it is sold in the next town.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the musky smell of it at first.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit is placed on the wrist, rub both wrists together and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>Once again, I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Its a nice strong, thick paste too.</li>
            <li>It also blends well with the other Kuumba oils, like Tunisian patchouli and Arabian rose.</li>
            <li>I also think the Amber Paste stands well on its own, or blended with other oils.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re a fan of rich, earthy, musky scents!  </li>
            <li>comes very close to the pure amber oil (now crystalised paste!)</li>
            <li>The tiniest dab on the wrist is enough to last a good 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Warm, beautiful, radiating, smooth, incensey, sweet, slightly woody, vanillic, resinous, earthy, a little cannabissy, uni-sexy,  comforting, thick, potent and addictive...</li>
            <li>Smells OK, but do not stay long.</li>
            <li>Recently, I was very tempted to buy a bottle of Tom Ford&#x27;s Amber Absolute, a stunning perfume.</li>
            <li>Well, I was worried because there was new packaging from the last time I bought it, but the stuff inside is lovely and just how I remember.  </li>
            <li>Very settle spice notes with just a bit of sweetens.</li>
            <li>For me, this is very alluring.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>the name is ABSOLUTELY correct.</li>
            <li>Use it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how else to dedescribe it, very overpowering and</li>
            <li>(Amber is one of those things, like sandalwood and patchouli, that can be really variable).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a stronger smell, but not overpowering, it&#x27;s very balanced.  </li>
            <li>Just remember that scent is a very personal thing and is entirely dependent on one&#x27;s own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li>A very deep and rich scent.</li>
            <li>I will be trying the other scents for sure.</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent, very thick, rich and resinous, a wonderful Amber!</li>
            <li>The Amber past is very nice and will probably last forever!</li>
            <li>Smells strong when you first put it on,but it calms down.</li>
            <li>The scent is musky and mysterious instead overwhelmingly sweet or flowery like some perfumes.</li>
            <li>It smells nice as expected, the only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that the applicator was this stick thing instead of a roller ball, Idk if I&#x27;d order again</li>
            <li>Over all I highly recommend this amber oil over any brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It was a little challenging to blend.  </li>
            <li>wish they could either send you a stick separate from the cap and just use a normal cap, or have some sort of retractable stick apparatus inside the cap.</li>
            <li>will admit that it lasts for ages which is good if you want to smell sugary and unappealing.</li>
            <li>Heavenly right from the bottle or mixed with a carrier oil or unscented lotion.</li>
            <li>Extremely strong (a little dot will do ya), but doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any of the chemical additives that make normal perfumes so toxic.  </li>
            <li>The other factor is if you just use the wand to put it on your wrists, you will be left with a very gooey shiny smudge on your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Other, than that, it lasts a long time, and gives a warm scent that stays all day.</li>
            <li>The smell is very too strong for my taste, but maybe it will be okay if just a slight bit is dabbed behind knees.</li>
            <li>It is not as strong as I thought it would be but maybe because I live in a cold area, Smells very nice like incense and a little woodsy and vanilla, it is what it says it is...</li>
            <li>I love you, Tom, but these are hard times and Amber Paste elevates my spirit without decimating my wallet.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li>Just WOW.</li>
            <li>This smells as good as the synthetic expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>The vial is not large but it will last many months using it daily.</li>
            <li>It is only slightly spicy, is very earthy and sweet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Big thing to note is that this smells just like Henri Bendel Amber candle which is a major plus!</li>
            <li>The smell is warm and fragrant, and I can catch a subtle whiff of it even at the end of a long day.  </li>
            <li>but because it is so strong, and so thick, the packaging is problematic.  </li>
            <li>I am sorry it is out of stock, I would buy more!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a fake hippie like me, you will love it!  </li>
            <li>You barely need to use any, and you will carry the scent for hours.  </li>
            <li>Then you have to apply it to yourself or some other object, which is a delicate operation because you don&#x27;t want to get a lot on you (strong!).  </li>
            <li>The name definitely suites it because it is super thick.</li>
            <li>This paste is very thick and kind of messy.  </li>

            <li> is indeed a very powerful, rich smell.</li>
            <li> none of that powdery sweet cheap amber that you find everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I would like the amber sent originally because, I like every perfume with an amber scent.</li>
            <li> Love it so much!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Rich, Sweet, Intoxicating, Woodsy but not over powering.  </li>
            <li> When the container is full, removing the cap / stick pulls out a significant amount of the paste.  </li>
            <li> Sweet.</li>
            <li> This is sticky sweet vanilla-honey-amber-woods goodness.</li>
            <li> This Amber Paste is probably one of my favorite finds to date; I found it while sniffing around the perfume section of Whole Body.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet, earthy fragrance</li>
            <li> Kuumba Made procuces the BEST amber paste out there.&lt;br /&gt;After using this great amber past for a few months, it has been one of my holy&lt;br /&gt;grail</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great with other perfumes without amber or with it.</li>
            <li> but I mainly use it for making \\&quot;Egyptian Musk\\&quot; which smells even better.</li>
            <li> Extremely quick to ship, received about two days after I ordered.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d never be able to find this again but took a chance and ordered it, I was overjoyed when I opened the vial to discover the same exact product!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice; more like a thick oil.</li>
            <li> If you like a fairly strong, direct, and rich amber, this is for you.</li>
            <li> the company is mostly all natural as well.</li>
            <li> I am an amber lover, and prefer the more traditional, earthy ones to the light flowery ambers.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> very nice ,a little dot goes along way.</li>
            <li> small bottle for the price, though the quality seem to be great.</li>
            <li> Because the container is so small, the stick + paste barely fits unless you line it up perfectly, so you end up with paste all around the lip of the container, which is wasteful and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells very much like incense with a pungy musty smell...</li>
            <li> highly recommend Amber Paste for that true amber</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this amber paste to anyone seeking a true amber fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful scent and being a concentrated paste, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product many times over the years as it is sold in the next town.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the musky smell of it at first.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit is placed on the wrist, rub both wrists together and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> Once again, I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Its a nice strong, thick paste too.</li>
            <li> It also blends well with the other Kuumba oils, like Tunisian patchouli and Arabian rose.</li>
            <li> I also think the Amber Paste stands well on its own, or blended with other oils.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re a fan of rich, earthy, musky scents!  </li>
            <li> comes very close to the pure amber oil (now crystalised paste!)</li>
            <li> The tiniest dab on the wrist is enough to last a good 24 hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Warm, beautiful, radiating, smooth, incensey, sweet, slightly woody, vanillic, resinous, earthy, a little cannabissy, uni-sexy,  comforting, thick, potent and addictive...</li>
            <li> Smells OK, but do not stay long.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was very tempted to buy a bottle of Tom Ford&#x27;s Amber Absolute, a stunning perfume.</li>
            <li> Well, I was worried because there was new packaging from the last time I bought it, but the stuff inside is lovely and just how I remember.  </li>
            <li> Very settle spice notes with just a bit of sweetens.</li>
            <li> For me, this is very alluring.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> the name is ABSOLUTELY correct.</li>
            <li> Use it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how else to dedescribe it, very overpowering and</li>
            <li> (Amber is one of those things, like sandalwood and patchouli, that can be really variable).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a stronger smell, but not overpowering, it&#x27;s very balanced.  </li>
            <li> Just remember that scent is a very personal thing and is entirely dependent on one&#x27;s own body chemistry.  </li>
            <li> A very deep and rich scent.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the other scents for sure.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent, very thick, rich and resinous, a wonderful Amber!</li>
            <li> The Amber past is very nice and will probably last forever!</li>
            <li> Smells strong when you first put it on,but it calms down.</li>
            <li> The scent is musky and mysterious instead overwhelmingly sweet or flowery like some perfumes.</li>
            <li> It smells nice as expected, the only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that the applicator was this stick thing instead of a roller ball, Idk if I&#x27;d order again</li>
            <li> Over all I highly recommend this amber oil over any brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It was a little challenging to blend.  </li>
            <li> wish they could either send you a stick separate from the cap and just use a normal cap, or have some sort of retractable stick apparatus inside the cap.</li>
            <li> will admit that it lasts for ages which is good if you want to smell sugary and unappealing.</li>
            <li> Heavenly right from the bottle or mixed with a carrier oil or unscented lotion.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong (a little dot will do ya), but doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any of the chemical additives that make normal perfumes so toxic.  </li>
            <li> The other factor is if you just use the wand to put it on your wrists, you will be left with a very gooey shiny smudge on your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Other, than that, it lasts a long time, and gives a warm scent that stays all day.</li>
            <li> The smell is very too strong for my taste, but maybe it will be okay if just a slight bit is dabbed behind knees.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as I thought it would be but maybe because I live in a cold area, Smells very nice like incense and a little woodsy and vanilla, it is what it says it is...</li>
            <li> I love you, Tom, but these are hard times and Amber Paste elevates my spirit without decimating my wallet.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW.</li>
            <li> Just WOW.</li>
            <li> This smells as good as the synthetic expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> The vial is not large but it will last many months using it daily.</li>
            <li> It is only slightly spicy, is very earthy and sweet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Big thing to note is that this smells just like Henri Bendel Amber candle which is a major plus!</li>
            <li> The smell is warm and fragrant, and I can catch a subtle whiff of it even at the end of a long day.  </li>
            <li> but because it is so strong, and so thick, the packaging is problematic.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry it is out of stock, I would buy more!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a fake hippie like me, you will love it!  </li>
            <li> You barely need to use any, and you will carry the scent for hours.  </li>
            <li> Then you have to apply it to yourself or some other object, which is a delicate operation because you don&#x27;t want to get a lot on you (strong!).  </li>
            <li> The name definitely suites it because it is super thick.</li>
            <li> This paste is very thick and kind of messy.  </li>
            <li> Years ago I bought some amber paste that I absolutely loved at a Renaissance Faire, and unfortunately the jar fell and broke a few years later.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful...and a very tiny bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This paste last a long time, And goes a long way</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s too strong for me and every time I put it on</li>
            <li> It is combined with rose oil (absolute), patchouli oil, cedar oil, frankincense oil, vanilla oil, myrrh oil and put into an almond oil base with a little vitamin E oil (tocopherol)</li>
            <li> Aroma stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> and this lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> If you waterboarded me and MADE me say what well-known fragrance it smells like I&#x27;d say Opium, but it is better and less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I like a deep earthy scent, and not the sharp citrusy scent that can sometimes overpower some amber products.</li>
            <li> And the scent lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> I will mix it with other oils to make another of my personal roll on fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Just a drop of this rich amber oil with its musky/earthy scent will have even shy people asking what you&#x27;re wearing.</li>
            <li> Made liquid scents to one wrist, (such as Vanilla Musk, or something else complementary to amber), and Amber Paste on the other wrist and then rub them together.  </li>
            <li> When mixed with other scents or solutions, it separates to the bottom of the mixture within minutes.</li>
            <li> Would need to dilute a small amount in a high quality vodka or carrier oil if you are wanting to blend it with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> It has a dark, deep scent that a perfume could never achieve.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very rich, thick scent and you only need a little dab of paste on your wrists and perhaps behind your ears.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that you need to rub it in well or it leaves a slight discoloration on your skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this product as I have a couple little bottles of different scents I bought 10-15 years ago!  </li>
            <li> Because it is thick,you only need to use a little.</li>
            <li> Amber Paste has an amazingly complex amber scent -- think major amber chord with minor grace notes of vanilla, leather, honey/beeswax and bezoin resin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it lasts.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> To make it easier to spread around on my skin, I apply one of my other Kuumba</li>
            <li> not a fancy amber perfume with other notes...</li>
            <li> texture is slightly like honey, minus the extreme stickiness.</li>
            <li> The local store that I use to buy my Amber Paste at closed down, and this product is hard to find.  </li>
            <li> This one is sweet, resiny, definitely a woodsy base note...love it.</li>
            <li> that you either love or hate, like patchouli or musk because a coworker told me that my office smelled like a 1970&#x27;s trailer.  </li>
            <li> Keeping down the price of the applicator keeps down the price of the paste.</li>
            <li> The cap has a stick that hangs down into the paste...</li>
            <li> My only suggestion is due to its very thick.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the little &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; applicator.</li>
            <li> If I blend this with orange oil it is a dead ringer for  their luxury candles which people rave about when they come to my home.</li>
            <li> the paste is too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It is thick, unlike the other oils.</li>
            <li> This smells like raw honey and incense to me.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THE SMALL BOTTLE 3 YEARS AGO, AND I HAVE USED IT LIBERALLY</li>
            <li> (3-5 SMALL SWIPES WITH THE WAND)</li>
            <li> , I also bought Black coconut and Vanilla musk and they were a hit with my girls, I am trying to steer away from misting perfumes, they are not good for your lungs.</li>
            <li> this is hard to pin-down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite negative reviews regarding stickiness, etc.</li>
            <li> Gave 4 stars because I think it is a bit too thick for some uses.</li>
            <li> It is thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> this just smells like amber resin in a thick liquid form.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t comprehend how someone could find something this self-explanatory and simple to be difficult or inconvenient..</li>
            <li> These reviewers seem to have a weak grasp of reality, in that they think that something that costs $9 should satisfy their perception of perfection.</li>
            <li> It is very thick which is why</li>
            <li> The amber colored vial contains a very thick sticky paste with a plastic applicator stick.</li>
            <li> I kept the broken pieces and even though I couldn&#x27;t use the paste, I had  reminder of the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very thick paste!</li>
            <li> This smells like dirty vanilla.  </li>
            <li> have no idea which base to used,  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for blending into lotions &amp; scrubs</li>
            <li> Not only do I smell wonderful, amber is a very grounding aroma, so it helps keep me settled and focused.</li>
            <li> Love this amber product. Have been wearing it for years.</li>
            <li> It is a strong Amber, but has the undertone of a smell like lead.  I will go back to Triloka.</li>
            <li> This is the most comforting and delicious fragrance to wear. I&#x27;ve had total strangers walk up and ask me what it was. A little goes a long way and it lasts.</li>
            <li> I can never get enough.</li>
            <li> Great Amber-- none of that powdery sweet cheap amber that you find everywhere.  I am sorry it is out of stock, I would buy more!</li>
            <li> Extremely strong (a little dot will do ya), but doesn&#x27;t seem to contain any of the chemical additives that make normal perfumes so toxic.  I can&#x27;t believe this could be a scent that might not kill me to actually wear.</li>
            <li> When it says paste, it is paste.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I found this product as I have a couple little bottles of different scents I bought 10-15 years ago!  I have carried amber in my purse as smelling it contributes to a calming, grounded state of mind.  The scent is musky and mysterious instead overwhelmingly sweet or flowery like some perfumes.</li>
            <li> If you like true amber, you will love this. It has a dark, deep scent that a perfume could never achieve. Of all the dozens of amber oils, pastes, perfumes, lotions, etc. that i have tried over the years, this is a close second best (the best hasn&#x27;t been produced in many years, so it&#x27;s a moot point). Some people don&#x27;t like the little &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; applicator. These reviewers seem to have a weak grasp of reality, in that they think that something that costs $9 should satisfy their perception of perfection. The &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; is perfectly serviceable and seems to me to be an uncomplicated, inexpensive solution to dispensing this stuff - I just don&#x27;t comprehend how someone could find something this self-explanatory and simple to be difficult or inconvenient.. Keeping down the price of the applicator keeps down the price of the paste. If the applicator were fancier (more expensive), those costs would be passed along, and these same reviewers would whine that the product was too pricey. Welcome to reality. If you like a fairly strong, direct, and rich amber, this is for you. If you prefer the sweeter, lighter type of amber, you&#x27;ll want to give this one a miss.</li>
            <li> This smells like raw honey and incense to me. Sometimes the scent seems to change to something like bavarian cream donuts. Its a nice strong, thick paste too.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great on its own but I mainly use it for making \\&quot;Egyptian Musk\\&quot; which smells even better. It is combined with rose oil (absolute), patchouli oil, cedar oil, frankincense oil, vanilla oil, myrrh oil and put into an almond oil base with a little vitamin E oil (tocopherol) added ad an antioxidant. The vitamin E can be squeezed from an oil-based vitamin E capsule.</li>
            <li> The local store that I use to buy my Amber Paste at closed down, and this product is hard to find.  It is different and way superior to most amber oils and perfumes.. it is heavenly!  This product is almost as good as the one I use to buy, but I have not found any that is better (that is currently available).</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Amber, I have tried the butter, oil, resin, etc. The Amber past is very nice and will probably last forever! The only thing is that you need to rub it in well or it leaves a slight discoloration on your skin.</li>
            <li> Kuumba Made procuces the BEST amber paste out there.&lt;br /&gt;After using this great amber past for a few months, it has been one of my holy&lt;br /&gt;grail items.&lt;br /&gt;Despite negative reviews regarding stickiness, etc. I just ordered back up bottle.&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what a great product it it is.&lt;br /&gt;The scent lasts for hours and by layering it with Amber Butter have come up with a blend&lt;br /&gt;that cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;A have also used it with Amber resin for that extra ambery goodness.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the richest blend I have created.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend Amber Paste for that true amber scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully some of you readers can help me out.&lt;br /&gt;I would like to make a LOTION version using an unscented base!&lt;br /&gt;But have no idea which base to used,  My attempts with shea oil have not been successful.&lt;br /&gt;Any suggestions are welcome!&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile I highly recommend this amber paste to anyone seeking a true amber fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;You just need a drop or two....</li>
            <li> This very true to scent is wonderful. My only suggestion is due to its very thick. gooey and pasty nature. The other factor is if you just use the wand to put it on your wrists, you will be left with a very gooey shiny smudge on your wrist.&lt;br /&gt;Other, than that, it lasts a long time, and gives a warm scent that stays all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fussy about amber. I like a deep earthy scent, and not the sharp citrusy scent that can sometimes overpower some amber products. This is nice and musky, which is what I wanted. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This was an experiment several years ago. Just try it and see if you like it. Just a dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> This is a nice incense type of fragrance that even blending with Jasmine and anise I didn&#x27;t care for it on my skin. This also has strong hints of honey and 60% of my health &amp; beauty items are phone or beeswax but still I can&#x27;t wear this Amber paste. To gauge what fragrances I do like, Escada Collection, Bath &amp; Body Works (discontinued!!!! ) Sensual Amber, Mayan Gold fragrance oil and Just Cavalli. I like chypre type scents that have note of cola, Amber, florals, musk, leather, Tonka, tobacco, citrus, coconut, cocoa, pie spices, fruits and vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big thing to note is that this smells just like Henri Bendel Amber candle which is a major plus! If I blend this with orange oil it is a dead ringer for  their luxury candles which people rave about when they come to my home. So I&#x27;m adding this happily to my oil warmers for the home instead of wearing as my own fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have owned this product many times over the years as it is sold in the next town. However, it was handy to be able to order it from Amazon and have it delivered without the 25 mile drive!. It has a wonderful scent and being a concentrated paste, a little goes a long way. The vial is not large but it will last many months using it daily.</li>
            <li> Smells OK, but do not stay long. Will not by again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the good reviews - what a mistake...&lt;br /&gt;I know what amber smells like and this smells like really cheap candy - just bad.&lt;br /&gt;I will admit that it lasts for ages which is good if you want to smell sugary and unappealing.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would like the amber sent originally because, I like every perfume with an amber scent. I didn&#x27;t like the musky smell of it at first. But, it grows on you :) it&#x27;s great with other perfumes without amber or with it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this scent! It is thick, unlike the other oils. A tiny bit is placed on the wrist, rub both wrists together and the fragrance is lovely. It also blends well with the other Kuumba oils, like Tunisian patchouli and Arabian rose.</li>
            <li> Oh my, what a lovely sent. Heavenly right from the bottle or mixed with a carrier oil or unscented lotion. I find myself wanting to wear this every day. Very settle spice notes with just a bit of sweetens. I love it and will order again and again :)</li>
            <li> The paste is simply wonderful and all I expected. just wish there was more in it.</li>
            <li> Because it is thick,you only need to use a little. Smells strong when you first put it on,but it calms down. And the scent lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> Fabulous scent! Very thick paste! Has multiple uses. Gave 4 stars because I think it is a bit too thick for some uses.</li>
            <li> This should be called Amber Honey! (But don&#x27;t let that scare you away!)&lt;br /&gt;The texture is slightly like honey, minus the extreme stickiness. For me, this is very alluring.&lt;br /&gt;This is indeed a very powerful, rich smell. Sweet. I wouldn&#x27;t call this scent powdery at all, nor musky necessarily.  It&#x27;s Rich, Sweet, Intoxicating, Woodsy but not over powering.  It&#x27;s almost like it smells better and better through out the day. A brilliant blend, and seems like it lasts for days to. I put a dab on my skin and even after I shower I still smell it lingering. Extremely quick to ship, received about two days after I ordered.  Over all I highly recommend this amber oil over any brand I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Reminds me a lot of a fragrance MAC Cosmetics used to carry in the 1990s but discontinued.  If you waterboarded me and MADE me say what well-known fragrance it smells like I&#x27;d say Opium, but it is better and less expensive.  I treasure it!!!  I will be ordering (read:  Hoarding) more.  I can&#x27;t be without this.  Unisex.  I would follow a man OR a woman around who was wearing this in the grocery store just to keep smelling it.  LOL</li>
            <li> This is sticky sweet vanilla-honey-amber-woods goodness. It lasts forever, has great staying power. I like the company is mostly all natural as well. This smells as good as the synthetic expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I received my order today and I am in love. This smell is so wonderful. The name definitely suites it because it is super thick. Also very pleased with the super fast shipping. Great product and definately worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love this!  The smell is warm and fragrant, and I can catch a subtle whiff of it even at the end of a long day.  Once again, I love this product and will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great. comes very close to the pure amber oil (now crystalised paste!) I found in india 25&lt;br /&gt;years ago!! I&#x27;ts clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ta&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
            <li> Very potent stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> Very nice; more like a thick oil. I will mix it with other oils to make another of my personal roll on fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Very small bottle for the price, though the quality seem to be great.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Every time I where it I have people say it smells like different things, such as cake, bear claw and that they could eat the air!?!</li>
            <li> very nice ,a little dot goes along way.</li>
            <li> It smells nice as expected, the only thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was that the applicator was this stick thing instead of a roller ball, Idk if I&#x27;d order again</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW. Just WOW. I am an amber lover, and prefer the more traditional, earthy ones to the light flowery ambers.  This is absolutely gorgeous!  It is only slightly spicy, is very earthy and sweet. A very deep and rich scent. I need more of this!! Much MUCH more!  EDITED TO ADD....the name is ABSOLUTELY correct. Paste is a good description. It is thick and sticky. A tiny drop is all that is needed!!  EDITED TO ADD AGAIN......I BOUGHT THE SMALL BOTTLE 3 YEARS AGO, AND I HAVE USED IT LIBERALLY (3-5 SMALL SWIPES WITH THE WAND) AND OFTEN (2-3 TIMES A WEEK)....AND I AM JUST GETTING LOW NOW. MORE BEING ORDERED!</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t want to use the resin,this works.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all.</li>
            <li> Warm, beautiful, radiating, smooth, incensey, sweet, slightly woody, vanillic, resinous, earthy, a little cannabissy, uni-sexy,  comforting, thick, potent and addictive... the perfect dark amber.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love it so much!</li>
            <li> This paste is very thick and kind of messy.  The smell is very too strong for my taste, but maybe it will be okay if just a slight bit is dabbed behind knees.</li>
            <li> Very nice but potent.  Use it very sparingly.  It is very thick which is why, I suppose it would be call it &#x27;paste&#x27;.  It was a little challenging to blend.  Would need to dilute a small amount in a high quality vodka or carrier oil if you are wanting to blend it with other fragrances.</li>
            <li> My fav scent.  Consistency is thicker than a traditional roll on.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love the warm amber top notes, but as it wears, it smells nothing like Amber. It could just be my chemistry but I won&#x27;t be wearing it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and the Egyptian musk, the Egyptian musk one smells Fantastic! I cannot tell you how many people love it! However the amber paste was very...strong? I don&#x27;t know how else to dedescribe it, very overpowering and just stunk...I used it once and everyone noticed! Just not in a good way! It smells very much like incense with a pungy musty smell...</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the paste, I use it first on the inside of my wrists; rub it in, then apply the roll on of  &amp;#34;Auric Blends Fine Perfume Roll On Amber&amp;#34; on top of the paste and rub it in.  Makes a very fine aroma that I love.  Aroma stays on all day long.</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought some amber paste that I absolutely loved at a Renaissance Faire, and unfortunately the jar fell and broke a few years later. I kept the broken pieces and even though I couldn&#x27;t use the paste, I had  reminder of the fragrance. I thought I&#x27;d never be able to find this again but took a chance and ordered it, I was overjoyed when I opened the vial to discover the same exact product!!! I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!! It smells so wonderful to me, sweet, warm, exotic, slightly spicy. The amber colored vial contains a very thick sticky paste with a plastic applicator stick. My only request would be that the applicator stick would be glass, but over all I am so very pleased!</li>
            <li> This smells like dirty vanilla.  If you&#x27;re a fake hippie like me, you will love it!  I really do enjoy the smell of it.  You barely need to use any, and you will carry the scent for hours.  It&#x27;s fine for a man or woman.  I think this is a great product but because it is so strong, and so thick, the packaging is problematic.  The cap has a stick that hangs down into the paste... When the container is full, removing the cap / stick pulls out a significant amount of the paste.  Then you have to apply it to yourself or some other object, which is a delicate operation because you don&#x27;t want to get a lot on you (strong!).  Once you&#x27;re done, you have to put the stick back into the container.  Because the container is so small, the stick + paste barely fits unless you line it up perfectly, so you end up with paste all around the lip of the container, which is wasteful and messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they could either send you a stick separate from the cap and just use a normal cap, or have some sort of retractable stick apparatus inside the cap.</li>
            <li> It is not as strong as I thought it would be but maybe because I live in a cold area, Smells very nice like incense and a little woodsy and vanilla, it is what it says it is...a paste, not a roll on, I also bought Black coconut and Vanilla musk and they were a hit with my girls, I am trying to steer away from misting perfumes, they are not good for your lungs. I will be trying the other scents for sure. Worth the money. To the one who clicked that my review was not helpful..Why? Or why bother? It is in my opinion and I described it, dahh.</li>
            <li> Just a drop of this rich amber oil with its musky/earthy scent will have even shy people asking what you&#x27;re wearing. While the name isn&#x27;t terribly attractive, the scent is deliciously warm and inviting.</li>
            <li> Well, I was worried because there was new packaging from the last time I bought it, but the stuff inside is lovely and just how I remember.  It&#x27;s one of my favorite Ambers  (Amber is one of those things, like sandalwood and patchouli, that can be really variable).  This one is sweet, resiny, definitely a woodsy base note...love it.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was very tempted to buy a bottle of Tom Ford&#x27;s Amber Absolute, a stunning perfume. However, Amber Paste is almost as glorious, and is one twentieth the price. Amber Paste has an amazingly complex amber scent -- think major amber chord with minor grace notes of vanilla, leather, honey/beeswax and bezoin resin. I love you, Tom, but these are hard times and Amber Paste elevates my spirit without decimating my wallet.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful...and a very tiny bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amber paste is just that, a oily sort of paste that melts into your skin. It&#x27;s applied with a dabber that is attached to the lid.  I think it&#x27;s one of those frangrances that you either love or hate, like patchouli or musk because a coworker told me that my office smelled like a 1970&#x27;s trailer.  I don&#x27;t think that was a compliment, lol.</li>
            <li> Amazing fragrance. The tiniest dab on the wrist is enough to last a good 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;My husband says the smell reminds him of leather, spices and cookies.</li>
            <li> In-love with this! Long lasting scent, very thick, rich and resinous, a wonderful Amber!</li>
            <li> If you love amber, you must have Amber Paste in your repertoire.  It&#x27;s absolutely stunning.  To make it easier to spread around on my skin, I apply one of my other Kuumba Made liquid scents to one wrist, (such as Vanilla Musk, or something else complementary to amber), and Amber Paste on the other wrist and then rub them together.  Heavenly.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is expect lots of compliments....Sometimes even from strangers. This paste last a long time, And goes a long way</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I&#x27;m picky about my scents, and only wear oils, no spray on perfume for me.  This was a little birthday indulgence for myself, and it&#x27;s awesome.  I got several compliments on it today.  It&#x27;s a stronger smell, but not overpowering, it&#x27;s very balanced.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I love amber oil as perfume and I was thinking this would be similar. Unfortunately it&#x27;s too strong for me and every time I put it on I end up feeling like a stick of incense.</li>
            <li> my second bottle. LOVE this! the best smelling amber i have ever had. this just smells like amber resin in a thick liquid form. not a fancy amber perfume with other notes...just pure delicious amber. and this lasts for a long time. i get a lot of compliments on this.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but the paste is too heavy.  When mixed with other scents or solutions, it separates to the bottom of the mixture within minutes.</li>
            <li> Just remember that scent is a very personal thing and is entirely dependent on one&#x27;s own body chemistry.  The way this smells on me may not be the same for you!  That being said, I am a fragrance junky: I love perfume oils and hand-crafted scents.  This Amber Paste is probably one of my favorite finds to date; I found it while sniffing around the perfume section of Whole Body.  It has a sweet, earthy fragrance this is hard to pin-down.  It&#x27;s a very rich, thick scent and you only need a little dab of paste on your wrists and perhaps behind your ears.  I would definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re a fan of rich, earthy, musky scents!  I also think the Amber Paste stands well on its own, or blended with other oils. It&#x27;s a steal for the price, too!</li>
            <li> Great product! it has a deep woodsy smell that will linger on the skin for hours.</li>
            <li> Smell so good.  Wonderful customer service</li>
