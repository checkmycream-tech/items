            <li>Always loved Old Spice...</li>
            <li>This is not the original scent sinnce they change their scent every decade or so</li>
            <li>Still has that clean rugged smell we remember.  </li>

            <li>I love this Classic Cologne.</li>
            <li>Be aware of that!</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift for my Dad&#x27;s 89th Birthday, as this is an old favorite of his.</li>
            <li>Nothing better on a man than Old Spice.</li>
            <li>BUT...this smells like the good old Old Spice I have used on and off throughout my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the original Old Spice cologne for over 6 years in the Los Angeles&#x27; area without success.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that AMAZON not only had the classic splash on, but had it in the economical large bottle.</li>
            <li>This bottle is a large 6.37 oz bottle, which came well packaged for in a box for gifting.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this for husbands birthday</li>
            <li>AGAIN, THANKS ED.</li>
            <li>As promised and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon</li>
            <li>This smells like a real man.</li>
            <li>At last I am able to find and purchase the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; scent of Old Spice&lt;br /&gt;Cologne</li>
            <li>From my younger years to my older years this is one cologne that I will never tire of and enjoy snuggling up to.</li>
            <li>Finally found the original cologne.</li>
            <li>Thank You Amazon for making available the long lasting smell of the original</li>
            <li>What can I say it is a classic.</li>
            <li>A classic fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Gift for a older gent.</li>
            <li>I ordered the classic cologne in a splash but got the spray.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Makes it seem a little cheap!...</li>
            <li>Old Spice is a classic, and was recommended by a friend, so I got some.</li>
            <li>Was interested to read in another customer review that the recipe had undergone a change of some sort - years earlier - when company was bought out.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t hardly find the cologne in the stores any more, just the after shave.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Old Spice Cologne for 30+ years.  </li>
            <li>Note to Old Spice:</li>
            <li>What can you say about Old Spice ??</li>
            <li>Not sure why old brands always feel a need to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on their product - Old Spice was fine in the old container.</li>
            <li>The cologne has a clean natural scent rather than some of the heavy perfume ones.</li>
            <li>Old Spice Classic cologne is very hard to fine in local stores.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Product was exactly as described very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I wanted what was pictured but actually received the spray bottle version. Still is the cologne I wanted so I kept it.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne...been using it since the &#x27;60s!  However, I liked it even better when it was $7 to $8 a bottle!</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my Dad&#x27;s 89th Birthday, as this is an old favorite of his. He didn&#x27;t complain, but I noticed that it&#x27;s a spray bottle and I thought it was going to be the splash-on type that he prefers. Not sure why old brands always feel a need to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; on their product - Old Spice was fine in the old container.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the original Old Spice cologne for over 6 years in the Los Angeles&#x27; area without success.

            <li> I love how my father smells with this. He used to let me touch his chin and neck when I was a kid. Very nostalgic scent. I still smell my childhood from this. Great job though delivery was a hassle they let me go through the post office just to claim the stuff. Anyway stuff was intact bought them for my tatay. Love it!</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding this product in stores. Happy I finally found it!! Great product!</li>
            <li> My grandfather loves this!</li>
            <li> My husband was very happy I found this product on line. He always uses this scent and we can no longer find it were we shop.  Plus he does not like the spray.</li>
            <li> A classic fragrance - not my style, but the perfect gift for my grandfather. This bottle is a large 6.37 oz bottle, which came well packaged for in a box for gifting.</li>
            <li> My husband must have gone to at least ten stores locally to find Old Spice Cologne and no one had any.  I said let me try Amazon.  It was a bit pricey but it lasts such a long time.  We will order again.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years, my favorite cologne, and also my wife loves it on me, that&#x60;s what counts.....</li>
            <li> It is what it is........I have been wearing Old Spice Cologne for 30+ years.  I still get great compliments from friends as to how good it smells.  If it ain&#x27;t broke?  Why fix it?</li>
            <li> I have returned this item its not what I ordered.I wanted the splash and they gave me the spray.the picture is not the spray.I really wanted this for husbands birthday but it didn&#x27;t happen</li>
            <li> Ordered  Cologne as shown in picture and received after shave.... they are not the same.</li>
            <li> Great gift.  My husband was very happy with it.  Still has that clean rugged smell we remember.  And it didn&#x27;t come in a plastic bottle.</li>
            <li> This smells great and is a very fair price.</li>
            <li> Took out a star since this is not a spray. Be aware of that!</li>
            <li> I knew what I was buying; I have been using it for more than 55 years.  It was also the scent worn by my late father.  I loved the price and the shipping to my door.</li>
            <li> NOW I&#x27;LL SMELL GOOD AGAIN, THANKS ED.</li>
            <li> NICE SMELL AND DOESN&#x27;T OFFEND ANYONE  PLEASANT</li>
            <li> have used it for 60 years</li>
            <li> A classic fragrance.  Sorry to see it looks like it may be soon unavailable.  Was interested to read in another customer review that the recipe had undergone a change of some sort - years earlier - when company was bought out.</li>
            <li> My favorite men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GETTING HARD TO FIND AND I WAS GLAD TO GET THIS.</li>
            <li> As promised and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is gouging at its finest--last time I bought this I paid $30 for two bottles--now it&#x27;s $40 a pop.  I&#x27;ve been using the product for forty years, but I&#x27;m damned if I&#x27;ll pay that price for it.  Note to Old Spice: You have some long-time customers who want your product in a splash bottle not a spray--get your head out of your rear end and bring back that packaging.</li>
            <li> woul&lt;br /&gt;d  of prefered the spray. its ok</li>
            <li> Still works best of all colognes.</li>
            <li> As described. Thanks.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT--NO PROBLEMS--THANKS</li>
            <li> This is not the original scent sinnce they change their scent every decade or so and it migrates into being something quite different after several decades, , it is gone and they won&#x27;t remake it.you can&#x27;t get the scent my Dad always wore. pity, cause it ....smelled....fantastic.  manly</li>
            <li> At last I am able to find and purchase the &amp;#34;true&amp;#34; scent of Old Spice&lt;br /&gt;Cologne as I remember it from the past.  Definitely will be purchasing this again in the future.  Thanks Amazon&lt;br /&gt;for having this Cologne in stock!</li>
            <li> I got this cologne because I hadn&#x27;t gotten any cologne for many years, and thought it would be nice to have some to wear. Old Spice is a classic, and was recommended by a friend, so I got some. I love it, and will get it again. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne for men and was so glad to be able to find it on line as I have not been able to find the original in the stores. From my younger years to my older years this is one cologne that I will never tire of and enjoy snuggling up to.</li>
            <li> Nothing better on a man than Old Spice. The newer fancy colognes can&#x27;t compete. This smells like a real man.</li>
            <li> Finally found the original cologne. Have searched the local stores but the best I could find was the after shave. The cologne has a clean natural scent rather than some of the heavy perfume ones.</li>
            <li> The cologne last longer than the atomized version. Has more \\&quot;Bite\\&quot; than the aftershave. Good Value as well as longer lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> My order came in the mail... I stink much less now.</li>
            <li> Gift for a older gent.</li>
            <li> Old Spice Classic cologne is very hard to fine in local stores.  I was pleased that AMAZON not only had the classic splash on, but had it in the economical large bottle.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t hardly find the cologne in the stores any more, just the after shave. Very happy with this item. Will definately purchase again.</li>
            <li> Always loved Old Spice...someone mentioned it a few days ago and I realized my bottle was empty so I signed on and ordered some!...I just wish it was still in a glass bottle rather than plastic.  Makes it seem a little cheap!...BUT...this smells like the good old Old Spice I have used on and off throughout my life.</li>
            <li> Good product same as in the store</li>
            <li> Great cologne. Would like to see price come down some.</li>
            <li> I love this Classic Cologne.</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied.  I ordered the classic cologne in a splash but got the spray.  I couldn&#x27;&#x27;t return it because it was too close to Christmas.</li>
            <li> What can you say about Old Spice ?? It&#x27;s the standard for  all around Men&#x27;s cologne.  four more words required...</li>
