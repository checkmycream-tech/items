    <ol>
            <li>I will use either that one or continue to use the Olay Regenerist Derma-Pods, whichever works best.  </li>
            <li>My wife, who I ordered the product for, said it is wonderful and everything the commercials on TV said it would be.</li>
            <li>I ordered this with the olay regenerist eye serum, and im impressed with the result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
            <li>I purchased it for $17 at Walmart and think that&#x27;s a great price for 2 months of eye cream.  </li>
            <li>but i bought these and the eye serum, and happy with my results.</li>
            <li>i am happy with my eyes area and will continue using these the pods and serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Some products work great and others, not at all.</li>
            <li>I am buying it for sure !!</li>
            <li>My wife has used this product for years, very satisfied - The discounts are what satisfied me - very happy with transaction</li>
            <li>This product does a good job helping with fine wrinkles around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>These pods make me feel like I got a good night&#x27;s sleep, even if I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Works good, will buy again.</li>
            <li>I just love them!</li>
            <li>This eye cream is amazing.  </li>
            <li>mostly 5 stars, but to be fair</li>
            <li>Nice try Olay, but this product is beneath you.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>This Olay Regenerist line seems to be kind of hit and miss for me.</li>
            <li>but I feel more people are seeing good results instead of none at all.</li>
            <li>The product is ok but nothing exceptional.  </li>
            <li>I love the packaging, which keeps the product fresh and EFFECTIVE!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how removing the puffiness makes me feel more alert.</li>
            <li>Which makes me want to use it in the am tomorrow to see if the amazing results are better in the morning.    </li>
            <li>While it works, I would find it much more functional if you could just buy a tube of this and use your own applicator or finger.</li>
            <li>The massaging action by applying the pod in a circular motion makes my eyes feel wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not complaining about Olay products in general, because i do use them for lotions and feel they are great products for usually a good value.</li>
            <li>It was better than any eye system I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>(If you can get a better price jump on it.)    </li>
            <li>Most of the money seems to go to the elaborate packaging, sponge system to apply the serum.  </li>
            <li>This probably sounded a lot better than it turned out.</li>
            <li>You are paying for the packaging more than the product.  </li>
            <li>I think that Olay&#x27;s Regenerist under eye roller is a better product and more soothing and also reduces puffiness as well.</li>
            <li>While it moisturized around my eyes (as most moisturizers do)</li>
            <li>my eyes look more plumped up and</li>
            <li>any case, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements at all, so will not be purchasing any more of this product.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and buy \\&quot;The Perfect Sit Up\\&quot; or similar.  </li>
            <li>Olay Pro-X is the top of the line.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup look better</li>
            <li>The directions to this product are very easy, however the application is not as easy.</li>
            <li>I am always on the lookout for a great eye cream as I get older.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put one, effective and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Nothing short of amazing!!  </li>
            <li>If buying this product, I suggest BUY THE BOX OF 48 INSTEAD for significant savings!</li>
            <li>The applicator is very soft and feels great when I stroke it over my eye.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my eyes feel rested and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have not noticed any improvement in the puffiness under my eyes, nor in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>This is actually one of their products that I felt just wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay!!!  </li>
            <li>happen to like the \\&quot;pod\\&quot; because application is quick and easy and even.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed significant changes.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this to get rid of puffiness and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I never use makeup but had a special occasion.</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay :)</li>
            <li>applicator is okay, but seems to be a real gimmick to me.</li>
            <li>I use this with a mens science eye creme and it&#x27;s made the circles disappear quickly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it has given my eyes a more youthful appearance.  </li>
            <li>Very light eye moisturizer in small compact dispensers good for travel.  </li>
            <li>My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) has used Olay products for years and will use no other.</li>
            <li>That was after the first use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to many products and medications but no ill effects from this one at all.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for what you get.  </li>
            <li>The cream itself is wonderful and you will notice a small difference even after only one use.</li>
            <li>This is the first product that has reduced the bags under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>After the first week, my eyes look refreshed and revived.  </li>
            <li>I noticed from the first use that I can see better and my eyes open wider!</li>
            <li>I typically don&#x27;t review products but can&#x27;t say enough good things about this one!</li>
            <li>others this clever little \\&quot;eye pod\\&quot;, actually felt like it was doing more harm than good when applied.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle on the area around the eyes, I get allergic to some products.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me, and I never saw any real difference.  </li>
            <li>The sponge applicator was really scratchy.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>The whole system is a bit scratchy.</li>
            <li>have used these, per instructions, about 3 times a week and have gone through almost the whole box.</li>
            <li>It says to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; the eye area to help reduce the puffiness, but this is contrary to every other thing you read which tells you never to tug or pull on the delicate skin around your eyes, and despite my best attempts, there is no way to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; with this product without tugging and pulling the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks, every other night and love it.  </li>
            <li>Like my experience with other products, this does not make any notable change.    </li>
            <li>This product is nothing special and it seems that for the money Olay should have put the product in a tube instead of the individual Derma Pods.  </li>
            <li>I do see a noticable affect, and figure that for a normal body without much of a problem it may be all that is required.  </li>
            <li>Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li>i also need to mention that i am 20 years old, so what worked for me, may not work for someone who is probably older than me, since my skin hasn&#x27;t really started aging...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this whole idea was thought completely through.  </li>
            <li>My puffiness was actually worse than normal, and my wrinkles weren&#x27;t anymore minimized than a good moisturizer provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype or the price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually realize until I read the information in the box a little more closely that there&#x27;s nothing in the ingredients to eliminate puffiness.</li>
            <li>They said I look much less tired and my makeup looks really good!</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t even tell how much gets on because so much is left in the sponge.</li>
            <li>The sponge is really soft in my opinion and I felt no burning or stinging.</li>
            <li>This is over-priced for what it delivers, which is basic moisturizer in fancy, clever packaging.</li>
            <li>The faint lines I had near my eyes have filled in and they aren&#x27;t as noticeable when I smile.  </li>
            <li>I spent too much time in the sun in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>eye area had gotten more firmer than it was, my lids, are not droppy and thin anymore, but a lot firmer.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m very careful about not getting too much sun and always wear sunglasses and a hat.  </li>
            <li>I hope a serum or cream based on the same ingredients will be developed for the entire face.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant at purchasing these the first time.</li>
            <li>For those of you who inherited puffy eyes or dark circles, please disregard any positive reviews above.  </li>
            <li>just dab the sponge around your eyes, I repeat the whole eye, socket and whatever other area next to the eye you&#x27;d like it to work</li>
            <li>/&gt;You simply squeeze the applicator and it oozes into the sponge top, I like to close it sideways and do 360 degree round closes to get the creme even on the sponge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This item, while it probably is a decent moisturizer, does not improve or remove the puffy or dark area below the eyes.    </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Why has this been discontinued? It was better than any eye system I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay!!!  I love the packaging, which keeps the product fresh and EFFECTIVE!!  This eye cream is amazing.  The application pad does not scratch the delicate eye area, and it \\&quot;decongests\\&quot; the eye area!  Nothing short of amazing!!  I have NEVER found a product like this and I am 45 years old and have had eye puffiness since I was 15 years old, but it has only gotten worse with age.    These pods make me feel like I got a good night&#x27;s sleep, even if I didn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s amazing how removing the puffiness makes me feel more alert. Almost as if the puffiness drags your eyes down.  I have been using it for 3 weeks, every other night and love it.  Which makes me want to use it in the am tomorrow to see if the amazing results are better in the morning.    The price is very reasonable for what you get.  (24 eye pods, and if you use it as directed,  2-3 times a week, you would get 9 weeks of product, 2+ months).    I purchased it for $17 at Walmart and think that&#x27;s a great price for 2 months of eye cream.  (If you can get a better price jump on it.)    I could not be without this product and will stock up!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what all it is supposed to do but when I use this product my skin is tighter, smoother, and younger looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My make up is easier to apply and looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happen to like the \\&quot;pod\\&quot; because application is quick and easy and even.  There is just enough in the pods for an application.</li>
            <li> No improvement at all using this product. I&#x27;d expected some reduction of under eye puffiness or less visible lines, but there was no difference after 8 weeks. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant at purchasing these the first time. I really enjoy this product. The only thing I do not like is the delivery system. While it works, I would find it much more functional if you could just buy a tube of this and use your own applicator or finger. The cream itself is wonderful and you will notice a small difference even after only one use. When used over time with proper skincare it definitely makes a larger impact. I would recommend these to anyone looking to find an affordable way to tighten up the eye area. Thanks Olay :)</li>
            <li> This seems to be the same type of serum often sold in tiny tubes.  For the money, I&#x27;d rather have the tube.  I can figure out how to put a drop or two on my skin without the expensive \\&quot;delivery system\\&quot;.  Most of the money seems to go to the elaborate packaging, sponge system to apply the serum.  What a waste!  You can&#x27;t even tell how much gets on because so much is left in the sponge. Plus, the sponge is quite rough for the eye area.  I don&#x27;t think this whole idea was thought completely through.  Spend your money on the tiny tubes made for the eye area.  This probably sounded a lot better than it turned out.</li>
            <li> I give it a 3 although I was pleasantly surprised that it does work - a little.  I do see a noticable affect, and figure that for a normal body without much of a problem it may be all that is required.  However, I have had lymphatic issues for a long time, plus at this point, I may have a little inflammation.  Lately I have not taken mullein, lobelia and chickweed herbs for the problem, so I plan to order that plus another triple-action product from [...] that another comment mentioned.  I will use either that one or continue to use the Olay Regenerist Derma-Pods, whichever works best.  If buying this product, I suggest BUY THE BOX OF 48 INSTEAD for significant savings!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed significant changes. It is gentle on the area around the eyes, I get allergic to some products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Olay Pro-X user, and from time to time, I try some of Olay&#x27;s other products.  This is actually one of their products that I felt just wasn&#x27;t that great. I gave it 2 stars for effort only.  My reviews on other Olay Products are usually rated 4 to 5 stars...mostly 5 stars, but to be fair I just could not give this product a good-rating.  It really didn&#x27;t do anything for me, and I never saw any real difference.  I like my Olay Pro-X line, and that product line-up is 5 stars +!!!  Nice try Olay, but this product is beneath you.  Maybe it will work differently for someone else, but it didn&#x27;t do me justice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed no difference at all.  Since I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s, I&#x27;m very careful about not getting too much sun and always wear sunglasses and a hat.  This product didn&#x27;t seem to help my wrinkles at all.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job helping with fine wrinkles around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that has reduced the bags under my eyes.  You only have to use it three days a week, leaving the rest of the week to use my usual eye moisturizing lotions.  I hope Oil of Olay never stops selling it.[[ASIN:B001AROTLS Olay Regenerist Eye Derma-Pod System - 24-pk.]]</li>
            <li> I am always on the lookout for a great eye cream as I get older.  This product is nothing special and it seems that for the money Olay should have put the product in a tube instead of the individual Derma Pods.  You are paying for the packaging more than the product.  The product is ok but nothing exceptional.  I think that Olay&#x27;s Regenerist under eye roller is a better product and more soothing and also reduces puffiness as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as it has given my eyes a more youthful appearance.  After the first week, my eyes look refreshed and revived.  The faint lines I had near my eyes have filled in and they aren&#x27;t as noticeable when I smile.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with puffy eyes, so there wasn&#x27;t any noticeable improvement I could see.  However, the few small lines I had around my eyes has dramatically improved, which is the reason I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all. The sponge applicator was really scratchy. The sponge felt like it was leaving microscopic scratches on my skin which was probably why the eye area had a burning/stinging sensation after the application of the cream. I don&#x27;t think that the thin skin under the eye should be rubbed anyway. I saw no difference in the puffiness or brightness in the under-eye area. At a buck a pod this was a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The directions to this product are very easy, however the application is not as easy. Squirting the product out of it&#x27;s container went well and then you apply it to your eyelids w/ a massaging technique. The edges that you hold onto scraches my eyelids making this an uncomfortable process. I&#x27;m not using excesive force. I&#x27;ve tried ripping off that part but was just left w/ an evil mess. I still use the product but use my finger to rub it in, which i believe for the price, is not worth it. I&#x27;ll just buy an eye serum instead. I&#x27;m not complaining about Olay products in general, because i do use them for lotions and feel they are great products for usually a good value. This one isn&#x27;t though.</li>
            <li> I use this with a mens science eye creme and it&#x27;s made the circles disappear quickly. I had some dark raccoon circles all of a sudden and the combo cleared it up in two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poke a hole through the package the size of the individual applicators and slide them out one at a time like that to not make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply squeeze the applicator and it oozes into the sponge top, I like to close it sideways and do 360 degree round closes to get the creme even on the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then just dab the sponge around your eyes, I repeat the whole eye, socket and whatever other area next to the eye you&#x27;d like it to work on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use them before I go to sleep and just sleep with them on. Works good, will buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this product for years, very satisfied - The discounts are what satisfied me - very happy with transaction</li>
            <li> I got a sample for this product and used it on some lines I have on my forehead. The lines almost disappeared the second day of using it. I really liked this product. I am buying it for sure !!</li>
            <li> I never use makeup but had a special occasion. I got these on a whim because they were selling them at Costco. I have terrible allergies. I noticed from the first use that I can see better and my eyes open wider! I thought I was just doomed to having puffy eyes. My eyes are so puffy that they ooze all summer.This is fanatastic, never mind the cosmetic effcts! I wish I knew how they worked. The pods are pricy but then they help you to use just the tiny drop that you need instead of wasting. The applicator is very soft and feels great when I stroke it over my eye. I just love them!</li>
            <li> My wife, who I ordered the product for, said it is wonderful and everything the commercials on TV said it would be. She really likes it.</li>
            <li> They no longer sell these in stores, which is the saddest thing ever as these travel well and produce results.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this to get rid of puffiness and wrinkles.  I didn&#x27;t actually realize until I read the information in the box a little more closely that there&#x27;s nothing in the ingredients to eliminate puffiness. They claim the way it reduces puffiness instead is that since you are massaging around your eye it moves the fluid around and that massage is a proven way to reduce puffiness.  In other words, no need to buy the product - just massage with a moisturizer of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others this clever little \\&quot;eye pod\\&quot;, actually felt like it was doing more harm than good when applied.  The whole system is a bit scratchy. While it moisturized around my eyes (as most moisturizers do) it didn&#x27;t live up to the hype or the price. My puffiness was actually worse than normal, and my wrinkles weren&#x27;t anymore minimized than a good moisturizer provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: This is over-priced for what it delivers, which is basic moisturizer in fancy, clever packaging. I have since found one that actuallty does work for me to reduce puffiness, lines and circles which I recommend: [[ASIN:B000IOOLYO Revision Teamine Eye Complex .5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my eyes feel rested and smooth.  I have noticed crows feet wrinkles are less pronounced and my dark circles are lighter. The massaging action by applying the pod in a circular motion makes my eyes feel wonderful. I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this with the olay regenerist eye serum, and im impressed with the result. I started seeing my eye area looking a little gross, its was thin looking, and a little saggy, not to mention my lids were getting some what droopy..... but i bought these and the eye serum, and happy with my results. my eyes look more plumped up and not so thin.&lt;br /&gt;my eye area had gotten more firmer than it was, my lids, are not droppy and thin anymore, but a lot firmer. yes i may have a little slight droppiness in them but its not as bad as it was before. i am happy with my eyes area and will continue using these the pods and serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i do admit that the pods are a little to difficult to work with, i have to squeeze real hard to get the cream out, or poke  whole in the pods, but im willing to do it. i also need to mention that i am 20 years old, so what worked for me, may not work for someone who is probably older than me, since my skin hasn&#x27;t really started aging...lol</li>
            <li> Easy to put one, effective and comfortable.  I&#x27;ll use again.</li>
            <li> This Olay Regenerist line seems to be kind of hit and miss for me. Some products work great and others, not at all. Unfortunately, this one is in the \\&quot;not at all\\&quot; group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used these, per instructions, about 3 times a week and have gone through almost the whole box. I have not noticed any improvement in the puffiness under my eyes, nor in the fine lines around my eyes. Frankly, I can&#x27;t see any change at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator is okay, but seems to be a real gimmick to me. It says to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; the eye area to help reduce the puffiness, but this is contrary to every other thing you read which tells you never to tug or pull on the delicate skin around your eyes, and despite my best attempts, there is no way to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; with this product without tugging and pulling the skin. So, I now just dab it on and forget about the massaging idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements at all, so will not be purchasing any more of this product.</li>
            <li> For those of you who inherited puffy eyes or dark circles, please disregard any positive reviews above.  This item, while it probably is a decent moisturizer, does not improve or remove the puffy or dark area below the eyes.    Every now and again, I get the wild idea to buy one of these products with hopes that it will improve the appearance of the puffy dark area under my eyes.  Like my experience with other products, this does not make any notable change.    Do yourself a favor and buy \\&quot;The Perfect Sit Up\\&quot; or similar.  Place your focus on another part of your body.  We&#x27;re stuck with these eyes.</li>
            <li> Very light eye moisturizer in small compact dispensers good for travel.  Minimal cream in each container</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say that I have seen any difference, but I have not used it regularly</li>
            <li> My most beautiful wife (59 years old but looks 35 years old) has used Olay products for years and will use no other. Olay Pro-X is the top of the line. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> I figured this would be like any other over-the-counter eye product but I was wrong. I immediately noticed the puffiness was gone after only a few minutes of applying. That was after the first use! I followed the directions and it worked just like it said it would. I noticed there was some left over cream after I used this on my eyes. I used the \\&quot;left over\\&quot; cream around my cheek and forehead area and I noticed a difference in those areas too! I spent too much time in the sun in my 20&#x27;s (I just turned 42) and this is the only product that I&#x27;ve tried that actually has shown some reversal of aging, puffiness and lines around my eyes. It makes my makeup look better and I&#x27;ve even had coworkers comment on the change in my eye area. They said I look much less tired and my makeup looks really good! I&#x27;ve seen some negative reviews of this product but I feel more people are seeing good results instead of none at all. I can&#x27;t imagine why someone would find the sponge \\&quot;scratchy\\&quot;. Probably an allergic reaction? The sponge is really soft in my opinion and I felt no burning or stinging. I&#x27;m VERY sensitive to many products and medications but no ill effects from this one at all. I&#x27;m going to keep using it! I hope a serum or cream based on the same ingredients will be developed for the entire face. I typically don&#x27;t review products but can&#x27;t say enough good things about this one! I&#x27;m really happy with it!</li>
