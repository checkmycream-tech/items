            <li>when I take the wonderful price out of the equation, I like this soap for its merits.</li>

            <li>My husband is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I received my purchase as promised and found the service very good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s designed for shaving (very very good lathering when i use my stiffer synthetic brush..</li>
            <li>They are not treating customers fairly!</li>
            <li>Williams has always made the best shaving soap, unless you know how to make your own!</li>
            <li>These shaving soaps smell so good!  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and manly, we don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li>Used with plenty of water, I&#x27;ve found that Williams fluffs up beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to call Williams Mug Shaving Soap my starter soap.</li>
            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>it will leave you felling great.  </li>
            <li>, you get a great shave and it leaves you with</li>
            <li>both of which, are great soaps.  </li>
            <li>This soap is really a great soap.</li>
            <li>Others seem to have great things to say about it, but I will not be buying this soap again.</li>
            <li>This soap is great.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers up,smells great and protects the skin.</li>
            <li>also have Prorasso and Vanderhagen soaps and honestly it&#x27;s a tossup as to which is best.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, but not all perfume like, and it makes great lather in the mug.</li>
            <li>That is not to say that it is the best shave soap I own but if given the choice I would choose Van Der Hagen every time.</li>
            <li>Great price, great size</li>
            <li>He was happy with it.</li>
            <li>As for foaming it up, the best way to get a nice lather is to soak the soap puck every time.</li>
            <li>This was a great bargain.  </li>
            <li>Great brush, great value, works well with the Williams soap.  </li>
            <li>Great shaving soap at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great cost saving soap.</li>
            <li>and I experienced that at the beginning</li>
            <li>This helps to get a great lather.</li>
            <li>This is really great for the price.</li>
            <li>Great deal.  </li>
            <li>Great combo.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>Actually, I liked Noxema&#x27;s tube soap best, but it was discontinued</li>
            <li>This is the best soap for making your own shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Great item and service</li>
            <li>been using this for years, great product.</li>
            <li>My husband has a great deal of allergies, this product does not seem to bother him and that is a plus for us.</li>
            <li>Great shaving soap that&#x27;s uncomplicated and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The lather of this soap smells and feels great</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and wait until Williams decides to resurrect and originally great soap.</li>
            <li>After all the others, this remains my favorite shaving soap!!</li>
            <li>In all, it&#x27;s a very nice soap, and for the price, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li>but this soap is very nice</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice addition the the Ceramic shaving mug.  </li>
            <li>Very nice shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I create a very warm lather, this helps with any shave.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li>Using a badger brush on this with good technique gives a great shave.</li>
            <li>This lathers on so much better, is warmer going on, and when combined with a feather blade has been my best shave ever in my life.</li>
            <li>You will pay much more for them but this is not the greatest shaving soap on the market.</li>
            <li>Nice soap!</li>
            <li>It is a good product and the price is great.</li>
            <li>Not the best lather in the world, but is ok in a pinch.</li>
            <li>An excellent shave cream is Gillette Foamy, better than this soap.</li>
            <li>This may not be the best shaving soap you can buy, but it is certainly the best value!</li>
            <li>Using it is a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>great lather, great smell and at the price I can&#x27;t think of a better product to get.</li>
            <li>My husbands face is softer after shaving, and he smells so good ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>I tried the Conk&#x27;s but this was just as good and even washes off without any residue.  </li>
            <li>Good product and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>the lather isnt that good</li>
            <li>However, shaving in the shower takes care of those problems really good.    </li>
            <li>I think you could use a bar soap and get just as good of results probably.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s a good product and would buy again when I&#x27;m on a budget.</li>
            <li>Good price - Good product.....</li>
            <li>I read some good reviews on this and decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Makes a good lather.</li>
            <li>It makes a nice lather and is great if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li>and I get good shaves with this.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, but it is a good workhorse soap.</li>
            <li>A wonderful light and airy lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff for a buck</li>
            <li>soap is good though</li>
            <li>Makes a good lather if you work on it.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for my grandson, his grandpa used it for years before he passed away, My grandson found his shaving mug with a bit of soap and tried it, loved it.</li>
            <li>For the price is good and it does the job.</li>
            <li>I find that my shaves with this soap are markedly superior to any of the aerosol shave creams, even the well-marketed premium shave gels, that i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this one time didn&#x27;t get a good lather.</li>
            <li>Amazon has a good number of these in stock as well</li>
            <li>If you want a good shave with all the nostalgia, I recommend Proraso tube shaving cream.</li>
            <li>With a good shave soap, you don&#x27;t have to do any pre-lather prep, and no after-shave lotions or balms, either.}    </li>
            <li>Lather is good.</li>
            <li>I will stick to Col Conk, might try Van der Hagen since it gets good reviews on here.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>I found that to get good coverage</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good reliable soap to shave with.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to shave with and the soap smells great!</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li>However the good ends there.</li>
            <li>The soap did not make a good lather.</li>
            <li>then you need a good soap and a good brush.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good buy (plus its so inexpensive).</li>
            <li>A good way, along with the right&lt;br /&gt;mug and brush of saving 10 or 12 cans a year.</li>
            <li>This soap works good, for me.</li>
            <li>It smells good...</li>
            <li>The price was certainly fair</li>
            <li>my husband loved this</li>
            <li>Not a bad scent, fits in the Marvy shaving mug perfectly.</li>
            <li>This is a great working shaving soap at an even better price.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and smells great, smells better than Van Der Hagen.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell it feels like a good shave to me.</li>
            <li>good lather and a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Made a nice, super slippery lather perfect for shaving.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best to put a bit of water on it first to soften it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also admit that I might not have the best technique, and that someone more skilled with a shaving brush could probably do better with it.</li>
            <li>Love this mug shaving soap!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with williams shaving soap - and a very great one at that.</li>
            <li>This Williams Soap Puck is great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great scent and works up a good quality lather fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>I now get an amazing shave with this soap every time.</li>
            <li>This soap is truly amazing in its lathering abilities.</li>
            <li>&gt; Want a great, cheap shaving soap?</li>
            <li>a Nice Close Shave</li>
            <li>The advantage is in water retention and softess, but if I am exfoliating, I wouldn&#x27;t use rose petals.  </li>
            <li>My husband likes it, and I used it on my legs once and liked it too.</li>
            <li>Sure you can keep it in the box and lather in your hands but the box will eventually fall apart and it won&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li>tried prorsoa soap and clonal conk and they lathered up nice</li>
            <li>and it smells really nice</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>I can seal the containers preserving their smells and the containers stack nicely in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>So, in went the puck into one of my lovingly used mugs.</li>
            <li>This soap has a nice citrusy scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>The price savings and good results I have gotten from the soap has been satisfying for all this time.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Also if you are going to use this exclusively be sure to do some searching since you can get really good deals.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to soak the soap along with your brush in warm water for about a minute before shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it anymore except in some kind of no-other-shave-soap-available emergency.</li>
            <li>but to each his own:  Years ago, I used the cheapest, poorest quality brush but still got acceptable results.  </li>
            <li>If you have invested in a nice razor and quality brush, this is not the item to cut corners and save money on.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>Many people complain that they don&#x27;t get a good lather</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t mind that, it smells OK, lathers well, and does a good job on the shaving front.</li>
            <li>the soap smells nice</li>
            <li>but i would probably think twice about getting it again because it doesn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s own container.  </li>
            <li>It does lather up really nice</li>
            <li>and I get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>and it makes your face feel and smell nice</li>
            <li>It makes a nice lather with a brush, and I have used a brush since 1960.  </li>
            <li>This soap creates a perfect gliding surface for a safety razor or a straight razor blade.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, I used mine for hand soap after three shaves with it.</li>
            <li>And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li>I also use a GT scuttle to keep my brush warm, but prefer to build lather on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Excellent stuff, goes to prove the you don&#x27;t need to spend an arm and a leg to get something decent.</li>
            <li>I have very easily nicked and cut skin.</li>
            <li>That said, the lather I do get from Williams soap is pretty good!</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than others and does a very good job.</li>
            <li>good, cheap shaving soap...</li>
            <li>Best price I&#x27;ve found for a shave soap with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>This was the best progress I had so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d go so far as to say that it was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Of the 3 I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>So cheap and so good.</li>
            <li>And by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used is the inexpensive Arkko shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>When the soap arrived I was really impressed by the masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>Good smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It foams up pretty good and smells good.</li>
            <li>This is good soap, it has good smooth characteristics that allow the blade to glide smoothly over your face.  </li>
            <li>Soap quickly works up a good, nice smelling lather.  </li>
            <li>Smells clean and good.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, when I lather up, and apply to face, the smell is mild, pleasant, and manly.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, when I lather up, and apply to face, the smell is mild, pleasant, and manly.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers well and has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Awesome lather, classic sent, easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>Best there is! :O)</li>
            <li>and this is a very cheap soap..</li>
            <li>(this is very important).  </li>
            <li>A quick splash of aftershave, and my girlfriend was delighted at the smoothness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The soap itself is very good, lathers nicely and is easy to apply, however the smell isn&#x27;t that good (airplane soap) and it leaves a residue on everything it touches and once you wipe off your face your skin it very dry.  </li>
            <li>LOve</li>
            <li>When it came time to buy more, the stores around here in TX did not carry it and we found it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam.</li>
            <li>However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam.</li>
            <li>My favorite- including creams.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re a fool if you pay more than $1.50 for a puck.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a terrible smell</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I started with Williams.</li>
            <li>more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>This soap performs as well or better than many I have tried.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;ll be clearing our more soap bubbles than lather for a bit.</li>
            <li>You could spend more for a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; soap, but why?</li>
            <li>love his manly shave with a brush shave thx</li>
            <li>I love to shave with it.  </li>
            <li>I have many soaps.</li>
            <li>I love a challenge, so I decided to give this soap one more try.  </li>
            <li>I love that old-fashioned smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have tried it again.</li>
            <li>Got a better shave using a bottle of conditioner.   </li>
            <li>There are better soaps out there.</li>
            <li>It is a much more thirsty soap than most will be used to.</li>
            <li>Of all the soaps I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>more money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they confirmed that I try something else and that Williams mug soap doesn&#x27;t give a nice</li>
            <li>and I could not find any place to purchase more.  </li>
            <li>I am now almost 55 and for most if not all of those years, I have used Williams brand.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad to find it online at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love Williams Soap.</li>
            <li>Depends more on the mood</li>
            <li>: Someone wanted my review on the soap - I give it an, OKAY in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>shipping was the price of almost 3 more of these...  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even have to soak it for 30 minutes (as many insist).</li>
            <li>Love Williams mug soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Williams soap for many years.</li>
            <li>Cost me an arm and a leg to mail to Thailand but the soap was cheap!</li>
            <li>However, if you do love smelling like a garden in spring this stuff is not for you.  </li>
            <li>more I started thinking about it the more</li>
            <li>The soap softens my beard so much better than the canned foam,</li>
            <li>I am now even more satisfied with this soap now that I can use it</li>
            <li>They will provide better lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a safe place to start -</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth my skin feels when I&#x27;m done!  </li>

            <li>HEY IT&#x27;S OK TO HOP ON THE TIME TRAVEL EXPRESS.</li>
            <li>but i tihnk for waht most peopel are looing for this is more a 3</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s where i LOVE</li>
            <li>I use this with Derby Extra blades and get a superb shave.</li>
            <li>It was priced ok</li>
            <li>it by itself with shipping, but it is still my favorite shaving soap</li>
            <li>this will make you smell like a man&amp;#34; :-)  </li>
            <li>Hope you enjoy!</li>
            <li>I got this on a recommendation, but didn&#x27;t consider that most soaps are made from animals, which is a feature I don&#x27;t find desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>VDH feels better to me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the shaving soap I purchased at Walmart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many mug soaps and those that come in a tube.  </li>
            <li>-- second best is Williams.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad one of the better ones, Williams, is still putting it out.  </li>
            <li>Others say &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll smell like a man&amp;#34; with this soap, but it&#x27;s more like you smell like you&#x27;ve been bathing in citronella oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s the fragrance that kills the deal, otherwise this would be a top pick for me.</li>
            <li>It is much better than wasting can after can of</li>
            <li>Yes some soaps are way better than others</li>
            <li>You also can&#x27;t beat the price, over all satisfied with this soap.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave sope.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I think this gives me a better shave than the canned soap does.</li>
            <li>Plus, I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a bit concerned about purchasing such a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; soap; but it has proven to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and provides a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I love this soap and have no issues with it.</li>
            <li>- I am looking for something else that smells a bit better.</li>
            <li>but if dad likes it, it&#x27;s okay with me</li>
            <li>Just be nice to get a good straight razor to go with it.</li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of old-fashioned barber shops, which are very rare now in Virginia.  </li>
            <li>but you have to get the right combination of water to soap in your mug and a good badger brush</li>
            <li>The soap fits in very nicely and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent of this soap, it has a nice, clean scent to it that won&#x27;t cloy the scent of your aftershave or cologne.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering and leans more towards a &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; smell and definitely not a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>a nice, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes a decent lather and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>it does smell nice and clean and rinses off well.  </li>
            <li>While there are many fine soaps that will get the job done, you won&#x27;t find any better soap at this price point that will give you a better shave.  </li>
            <li>It also offers adequate, but not the best shave protection.    </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling very clean, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed was the good smell, yet it lacked everywhere else.</li>
            <li>Williams shaving soap with a good brush and reasonable blade will give you the best shave possible</li>
            <li>It will create the lather you desire if you use hot water + time + a good brush.  </li>
            <li>It lathers and works pretty well and carries a good price to boot.  </li>
            <li>I soak my boar brush in hot water while showering then give the brush one good shake.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, I noticed it had a very strong smell that, honestly, was a bit off-putting.</li>
            <li>Lathers  nicely and quickly softens my whiskers.</li>
            <li>Williams soap is mild on the skin (the &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; of shaving soaps) and has a pleasant mild scent.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t argue with the price, lasts a while and, even better, locally available.</li>
            <li>Most of us are here for one thing a cheap soap.</li>
            <li>, I use this with a wet/dry electric razor &amp; it makes for the closest &amp; most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>Sure it was cheap...</li>
            <li>Once I knew that, I could build up a good dense lather that holds very well in</li>
            <li>It has a very basic/clean smell (think Hilton shower soap that smells good).  </li>
            <li>Their are some cheaper soaps, they go fast, don&#x27;t give your beard a good soak like Williams.</li>
            <li>Good soap feels good and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li>he gets a better, smoother shave with it than the cans and it smells so clean and good, really don&#x27;t need aftershave.  </li>
            <li>It is a tricky animal but once tamed it offers a very nice shave.</li>
            <li>I had tried 2 other products and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about 2 years before trying the more moisture rich creams by Proraso, Erasmic, Speick and the like.</li>
            <li>Van der Hagen is a lot more user friendly in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK shaving soap, but the cost of shipping was 3 times what the soap was worth!</li>
            <li>It applies easily</li>
            <li>This stuff smells light, fresh and amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Could be slippery for those using a DE razor, but this could easily eliminate the lathering quality it has.  </li>
            <li>Clear any remaining soap with your nice warm washcloth and apply aftershave of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a good soap, it lathers on good and stays wet.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it when applied with a good brush.</li>
            <li>First off, I will say that this product does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give it three stars because the smell is pretty nice</li>
            <li>It smells nice - just a clean, fresh smell, not too fragrant.</li>
            <li>I found my best shave was by using less water to get a thicker lather, which clogged the razor somewhat.</li>
            <li>I was researching for a quality soap that is cheap and effective for my first time experience.</li>
            <li>Last night for example I let is soak in hot water for 20 minutes while I showered and got my best lather yet.</li>
            <li>(If you are a value shaver, the boar brush WILL work just fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of williams could be better for sure, but a lot of people really like it and for the price, it doesn&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li>When this box was in production it was a fine soap.</li>
            <li>Using that method, it lathers just as easy as anything and provides a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The shave was fine</li>
            <li>To me that&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li>It lathers fairly quickly, LOVES water, that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li>How lucky can we be!</li>
            <li>The lack of the super luxurious and frills may make most turn away from this soap.</li>
            <li>Yesterday I had my first shave with Arko, and that soap performed like a decent shaving soap should -- excellent lather, excellent cushion, and a seriously close shave with no cuts or irritation.</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the smell is nice.</li>
            <li>It lathers up nicely, smells good, and is a slick soap that gives a nice cushion.</li>
            <li>Very good shaving soap, very thick lather and smell good too.</li>
            <li>On my quest to find the best shaving soap for my DE safety shaving routine I came across this little drug store gem.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite soap so far, but definitely good and usable and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>as good as, say, proraso or Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps would, but that doesn&#x27;t matter because it lubricates my face just fine and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Lasts forever and is ridiculously cheap, which makes it very cost effective.</li>
            <li>With this soap and the cheap Burma Shave brush you&#x27;ll be all set to go.</li>
            <li>Shaves smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, its dirt cheap and lasts forever.</li>
            <li>It was cheap.</li>
            <li>this is a great basic choice!</li>
            <li>I just switched to a safety razor and now enjoy shaving using my Mercur razor, my badger brush and Williams soap.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy my shave now.</li>
            <li>If I can make a great lather with this, anyone can!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of with this soap</li>
            <li>Williams Mug Shaving Soap 1.75 oz  - Great lasting lather.  </li>
            <li>The soap lathered great with my water all I needed to do was soak the puck for about the same as the brush and lather.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and gets the job done, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering this as part of a free shipping order would not have&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li>Now rotate your brush around the bottom for about a minute while using light pressure.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>This is the primary reason I&#x27;m not going to use it:  </li>
            <li>The soap lathers nicely without the need for adding too much water.</li>
            <li>Same stuff, great shave.  </li>
            <li>I just simply could not get good lather, so I gave up after many attempts.</li>
            <li>I gave it a good old college try.</li>
            <li>Good thick slickery lather that feels great.</li>
            <li>My husband was used to using a shaving brush and soap (Williams particularly) for  many, many years.</li>
            <li>It is easy to find, very inexpensive and is a great soap for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>super cheap price of William&#x27;s definitely makes it a Great Buy.</li>
            <li>does take a little more hot water and work to get a good lather, but I get a great straight razor shave with it</li>
            <li>This product is very inexpensive, but unfortunately it is not too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Then  I use the brush to apply it, being sure to dip the brush in the hot water, and also dip the razor itself.</li>
            <li>I originally tried this to hone my lathering technique, but this did nothing but damage my skill and brush.</li>
            <li>I was excited by the rave reviews this soap got when I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to locate this again online as a gift, as he has wanted to return to brush/mug/soap shaving.</li>
            <li>It will build a decent lather and in turn give you a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li>Switched to Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap which is cheaper, get a much better shave and blades last two months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of a clean, old-time soapy smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower my after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is somewhat soapy and will leave you smelling clean and won&#x27;t interfere with your aftershave.</li>
            <li>Its manly yet clean.</li>
            <li>and if you want some of that clean manly goodness then just take some of the un-lathered soap and massage it into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I run the water real hot and stir up a very hot comfortable lather.  </li>
            <li>Clean soapy smell (like Ivory soap).  </li>
            <li>The scent is just a clean smell , no flowers.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d smell it all day; it is just one of those subtle but pleasant aromas that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li>For the very modest price, though, you do get a pretty good soap.</li>
            <li>Good, lasting lather that is complection friendly, non-drying, and no petro-chemical or alcohol (no-no&#x27;s) ingredients.</li>
            <li>I found myself using far more water to get a good lather than with any other soap I own.</li>
            <li>It took me 4 or 5 tries to figure it all out, but I&#x27;ve happily been using williams since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very Creamy Lather,Nice Fragrance,Lathers up quickly,gives a Much Better  </li>
            <li>The lather rinsed off cleanly and with no effort at all- a quick splash of water and there was no residue.</li>
            <li>so far im loving it.</li>
            <li>Many people pinch their badger brushes when lathering onto the face, but you don&#x27;t really need to do so w. a boar.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several shaving soaps and creams from well known internationals and Williams gives as good a shave as any at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>make sure you don&#x27;t put too much water in there</li>
            <li>This shaving soap is good quality, and low price.  </li>
            <li>Only good thing is there is no soap ring around the sink, since the lather will evaporate.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good shaving soap especially for the money</li>
            <li>Like the smell, it builds good lather, and can be purchased at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li>I squeeze the brush of excess water, drain the mug, swirl the brush into the soap firmly till the bristles are coated with semi-wet soap, and then lather my face -- in under two minutes I have incredible lather with Williams.</li>
            <li>This soap actually does produce a good lather.</li>
            <li>Though I love the softer, easy-to-lather soaps of modern creation, I am no disillusioned wimp when it comes to the task of taking the time to work an old-fashioned mug soap.  </li>
            <li>I say okay because i really have no opinion</li>
            <li>it went with his cup and razor, the old timey kind.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product off and on for many years and found it adequate for the task and certainly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>The soap brushes up best with hot water an a somewhat stiff brush.  </li>
            <li>First of all, the soap smells like really strong bug spray.</li>
            <li>Gave me a nice clean shave for the cheap price would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>that super close shave some of us struggle</li>
            <li>The problem is that it dries too quickly after applying.</li>
            <li>you are out shopping and get lucky.</li>
            <li>Compared to the ones I have been using (Col Conks and Van De Hagen), I noticed a remarkably quick drying up of the lather.</li>
            <li>It works OK, but requires an inordinate amount of time to get a decent lather.  </li>
            <li>It is okay, not the best but does the job, not as moisturizing as other quality soaps, it does leave my face a bit on the dry side.</li>
            <li>Lather your face lightly then apply a hot washcloth to your face for 15 - 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>As to canned creams, I&#x27;ve also put them into my mug, which is in a bowl of very hot water.</li>
            <li>right out of the gate, first shave, I was able to build a HUGE, lasting lather that lubricated and conditioned my face better than any canned product I&#x27;ve used in over 21 years of shaving.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation for those who object to the product&#x27;s bouquet is to keep your nose out of the mug/bowl when using a new puck, and just enjoy the lather as it lubes your whiskers!    </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!  </li>
            <li>I kid you not, this soap smells EXACTLY like a mosquito candle!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what its supposed to do and does it well!</li>
            <li>Ok, if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>Lathers very well and gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>deff worth the buy</li>
            <li>None of the soaps I&#x27;ve tried so far do a better job of protecting your face or cushioning your blade.  </li>
            <li>I used a far more soap before and it was alright</li>
            <li>The soap is relatively odor-free and has a nice non-greasy lather.</li>
            <li>A nice and simple way to lather up with a brush.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>But, William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap lacks the one thing that makes a shave soap a success and that is glycerin.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a decent lather, however it takes longer to get a thicker air free lather and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The puck smells strongly of the classic soap scent that some people like.</li>
            <li>The soap does create a decent lather that is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Worth buying...</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I had given up hope for an enjoyable shave again until the resurgence in shaving goods and popped for a Weishi razor, dug out my old badger brush and mug, and ordered Williams Mug Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li>The brush then makes a great lather that is thick but light.</li>
            <li>soap lathers up nicely, has a nice fresh mild scent, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get a nice lather, stiff peaks.  </li>
            <li>It sometimes amazes me that the really good soaps are hard to find but the soaps that kind of suck are highly available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly use other brands just because they are more luxurious</li>
            <li>/&gt;Feel free to add any other tips and tricks you&#x27;ve learned from your own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A simple but very effective product- much better than most ridiculously priced soaps out</li>
            <li>Although I do not have other soap to compare to, Williams soap is certainly a good soap to start.</li>
            <li>Priced right..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just say it right off the bat.</li>
            <li>Williams is just right.</li>
            <li>so I would not forget the right product.</li>
            <li>Once upon a time I used Old Spice shaving soap (still have an Old Spice shaving mug in fact) but that product hasn&#x27;t been available for many years now.  </li>
            <li>I think I will be stuck with this kind of shaving soap for a long time.</li>
            <li>The most important things, at least in the beginning, are to use really hot water, LOTS of soap, a stiff boar brush, and it works best when you face lather rather than lathering it in a bowl.    </li>
            <li>I tried all the tricks and hacks to get the most out of this soap, because apparently it&#x27;s a water hog and won&#x27;t lather right unless you spoil it like a princess first.</li>
            <li>After 54 years of wet-shaving I am somewhat familiar with building a decent lather from a soap puck or cream.  </li>
            <li>My recommendation for those who object to the product&#x27;s bouquet is to keep your nose out of the mug/bowl when using a new puck, and just enjoy the lather as it lubes your whiskers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ok, maybe so... so lets swirl the brush on the puck for a few more seconds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, the soap smell is just classic clean.</li>
            <li>(My favorite shave soap is currently the Arko shave stick, which isn&#x27;t much more expensive, but offers excellent protection for a close shave.)    </li>
            <li>For the price, there are no complaints; it is certainly worth that amount, but I will probably invest in more quality soap next time.</li>
            <li>simple, nice smell, very inexpensive</li>
            <li>, I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how Williams requires a little more hot water than most soaps.</li>
            <li>The Williams soap has a fresh smell, works up a good lather with little soap and brush dipped in hot water.</li>
            <li>Smells okay (a little bit &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not wild about), but produces a great lather.</li>
            <li>get the full experience, I&#x27;ve learned to follow an old technique and soak the puck in a mug full of steaming hot water along with my brush while I do my pre-shave prep.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft, not dry and lather up very very quickly and well as very cleanly.</li>
            <li>Go ahead if you don&#x27;t believe me and try William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap, but I guarantee that you will find plenty of other shave soaps out there that will give you a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>but for me.. the most important thing is perfofrmance and how t helps when you&#x27;re running a clinically sharp razor along your skin.  </li>
            <li>Willians Mug Shaving Soap can be gotten at most local pharmacies, so try looking around before you pay shipping.</li>
            <li>my first effort</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shave soap and given the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare it to because I&#x27;m a newbie at the traditional ways, but I do know there&#x27;s better out there.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience using a shaving soap bar</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to overspend on some of the higher priced ones, so I picked Williams.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this one, but the first two pucks I purchased ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li>Spend a couple of extra dollars for a better shaving soap.</li>
            <li>first time I used the soap</li>
            <li>I began to believe that William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap belonged in exactly what the name states, a mug.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried a different soap, one that is a bit softer but way more stinky.</li>
            <li>Because this is also a thicker shaving soap I would suggest a boar hair shaving brush over the badger hair as the bristles are a bit more coarse.</li>
            <li>Then I thought to try the Internet and found exactly what he wanted from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>DO follow the advice of others here and wet your brush well and add a bit of water (warm or not according to preference) to the top of the puck and pour off any excess prior to lathering.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly waht i&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wont&#x27; necessairly feel as luxurious or creamy as other soaps, or lather up impressively like other soaps.  </li>
            <li>Williams was the first shaving soap I ever tried.</li>
            <li>When the time came for my first soap shave, it didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with the results of this soap and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>And I took the time to lather it up pretty well</li>
            <li>You MUST have hot water - if not then use an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, Amazon had it listed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>) Splash hot water on your face before applying the lather.  </li>
            <li>THAT&#x27;S when it became a tallow second soap and ceased to become the iconic product it was for over 160 years.  </li>
            <li>and i will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>While placed in my ancient shaving mug and using a durable badger shaving brush with a reknowned double edged blade, I experience a shave comparable to that obtained in a competent barber shop.</li>
            <li>advice given to me by my barber for using Williams...soak the disk and brush in HOT water for the time it takes you to shower.  </li>
            <li>It was most likely in your father or grandfathers mug.</li>
            <li>No fancy oils or perfumes, and a great lather that lasts long enough for 1-2 pass shavers.</li>
            <li>The soap has a old school citronella smell, which I personally enjoy.</li>
            <li>It is pretty hydrophilic(loves water).</li>
            <li>I switched to Williams Mug Shaving Soap when Old Spice was no longer available</li>
            <li>Will definitely be using it and ordering more.</li>
            <li>That was my impression at first.  </li>
            <li>I soak the brush for about one minute in hot water and soak the soap in my mug with about a 1/4 inch of water.</li>
            <li>This was one of the first soaps I tried when I started using a shaving brush, and I did not like it.</li>
            <li>I found that many others had the same difficulty.</li>
            <li>Very good soap, very simple and subtle, and an excellent soap to begin the traditional wet shave.  </li>
            <li>My favorite so far has been from the Tonsorial Shaving Cream from The New York Shaving Company.</li>
            <li>As long as I reapply every quarter of my face before shaving or more frequently reapplying, the soap works fine.</li>
            <li>Love that smell, old fashioned, clean, and simple.    </li>
            <li>(Or add a few drops of shaving oil, glycerin, and oatmeal powder, as I suggested above, for creamier, more moisturizing shave; lather a bit more, apply to face, and enjoy even more!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DE shaving takes longer (probably because I am still very new to it) but it is well worth it</li>
            <li>I wear friendly mutton chops, so all I shave is my chin and throat, but for that I use shave soap and an old safety razor.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive, lubricates and conditions extremely well and has a nice but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li>As far as the smell goes, you&#x27;re not going to smell like you just jumped out of a rose bush while burning incense, but at the same time it&#x27;s not offensive to me either.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used shaving soap and a brush pretty much ever since I first started shaving.  </li>
            <li>, I would not buy this again unless I ran out of the good stuff and this was the only one I could get on a last minute thing.</li>
            <li>, it takes a little longer to lather but other than that is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I normally lather the right side of my face first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>I keep coming back to it as my day-to-day standby as I venture out to explore other soaps with more exotic ingredients and scents.</li>
            <li>This is a great soap to use, the only reason it is getting four stars instead of five is because a facial moisturizer a necessity with it other wise your skin can get really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the classic scent and form of this product, but I&#x27;m guessing that the original formulation of decades past is far superior to that of this modern incarnation.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously this comes in a box and requires either a shaving mug, bowl, or a sufficiently large cup to keep it in.</li>
            <li>I certainly wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells like citronella and the large bubbles never went away</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase another bar when this one is gone.</li>
            <li>It lathers pretty easy but despite what it says on the box about not drying, it does dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li>First, if you&#x27;re upset that you&#x27;re not getting enough lather, you only have your own ignorance to blame.  </li>
            <li>I was reviewing a new disposable during my initial shave on top of being unfamiliar with the method.</li>
            <li>, I may have one or two more shaves left and its time to start a new bar.</li>
            <li>The lather worked up easily and like most tallow based soaps produced a thick, creamy lather.</li>
            <li>The price is right and as long as this is so ready available</li>
            <li>I do the latter and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It barely has a smell to it, and what there is just smells clean.  </li>
            <li>Amazing little soap.</li>
            <li>A little warm water was added and I began whipping up the lather.</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving soap and I&#x27;m very happy with it - would not hesitate to buy again, but will probably want to at least try some of the other</li>
            <li>Williams shaving soap is a bit hard to work into a good lather</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller in diameter than some shaving soaps and really fits best in a mug, not the wooden bowls made for shaving soap....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t create much lather.</li>
            <li>,I would recommend  this  Shaving Soap to anyone that wants</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not what I expected I both the razor at magic mart thinking</li>
            <li>Has a real \\&quot;He</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much else to say:  it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care much for the smell.  </li>
            <li>It is indeed a very soapy smell much like Ivory bar soap I think.  </li>
            <li>The soap is available at CVS stores and online for $1.50 only.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, keep an open mind and enjoy this right-priced shaving soap.</li>
            <li>It can get very bubbly if you use too much water.</li>
            <li>As you see here, there&#x27;s a whole lot of discussion and opinions about it.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t really cling to your face so it won&#x27;t conflict with any cologne</li>
            <li>The soap itself is extremely gentle</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care too much for the fragrance, though.</li>
            <li>But you have to either shave fast or lather one side of your face at a time or the lather will be gone.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather well no matter how much water I use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very off-putting.</li>
            <li>Planning to buy this shave soap again very soon. . . .</li>
            <li>Very &amp;#34;citrusy,&amp;#34; leaning towards lemon.  </li>
            <li>and you should be able to start wet shaving for about $25 US including the safety razor.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the fast shipping,can now include with the shaver and cup.my brother will&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an absolute 4.5 to 5).</li>
            <li>The Williams mug shaving soap really foams well and improves my shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I have been using Col Conk but ran out and picked this up cheap at the local CVS.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t mind the smell and never got any comments from the wife or kids on that</li>
            <li>It is soap how much can one really say about soap?</li>
            <li>This softens your beard and makes shaving MUCH easier.  </li>
            <li>process takes me about 5 minutes, I NEVER cut myself and with practice you will have similar results not to mention that your face will be smooth as silk with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>After having used Williams Mug Shaving Soap off and on for a few years, I find that I always come back to it when I tire of more exotic shave soaps.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very nature</li>
            <li>Much better than what I had expected.</li>
            <li>This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s what this soap really is.</li>
            <li>Not much competition any more.</li>
            <li>The product arrived fast and works very well.</li>
            <li>and I knew if I didn&#x27;t like it it would not be too much of a loss.  </li>
            <li>But I cannot recommend a soap that I feel is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>This soap puts together a nice lather that allows the blade to slide across your skin, without catching and cutting you.  </li>
            <li>I just ordered 3 more bars, so I hope I live that long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, when I first switched from Mach 3 cartridges and Gillette Sensitive Skin Shaving Gel, I only did it to try to save some money on my regular shaving needs.</li>
            <li>Maybe you will stay with it forever like many of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>I have two other, pricier soaps in my rotation, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Almost any other product will serve you better.</li>
            <li>If you want a simple, clean smelling soap for under $3 this is it.</li>
            <li>it was light and not very slipery no matter the water amount if you want cheap shaving soap spend an extra 1 dollar and get van der hagen your face will appreciate it</li>
            <li>This soap is very concentrated and thus needs to be mixed with a few dashes of water to develop a good lather.</li>
            <li>I still don&#x27;t really have an answer to that, but needless to say, this soap has lasted me for about 6 months of 2-3 times per week shaving, and I think that it&#x27;s one of the best products related to shaving that I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly new at straight razor shaving and bought Williams mug to try out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regarding the smell of the product:  When I stick my nose over the puck when it&#x27;s new - never care much for the smell.  </li>
            <li>I stick my nose over the puck when it&#x27;s new - never care much for the smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I get less cuts / nicks using a better soap or even shave cream.</li>
            <li>That will soften up the soap and allow you to get more soap off of the bar with less effort once you get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better and less costly than it&#x27;s Aerosol Counterpart.</li>
            <li>I still built up a lather to equal or beat anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a can, although it wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as a good lather should be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to obtain my Merkur Classic 34C, but it&#x27;s on the way</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a classic.  </li>
            <li>Those three words sum up the main feature of the product.  </li>
            <li>This shave soap is mainly soap without the lubricating properties the glycerin provides.</li>
            <li>and it smells like Ivory soap, which is always a classic scent.</li>
            <li>I use a regular coffee mug to get the soap on my brush, then I transfer the brush to a regular cereal bowl I also bought from Wal-Mart for under $3 to whip it up, the bowl gives me more room to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly use this soap over the more expensive stuff any day.</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s a bar of soap, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, does it well, it&#x27;s locally available, and cheap.     </li>
            <li>With the very tip of the brush, I dip it in the hot water and add a couple of drops from the sink into the lather on my hand and keep swirling to further mix it into the soap until the mixture gets very foamy and then apply it to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to shavers of all experience levels.</li>
            <li>Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.the method.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to shavers of all experience levels.</li>
            <li>Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations based on some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product highly as it was  part of a Christmas gift for my grandson</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I used the Williams Mug Shaving Soap for about a month or so after reading all of the high reviews here.</li>
            <li>$4 for a cake of this soap is too high.  </li>
            <li>The lather is rich, creamy, peaky and lasting.</li>
            <li>A 1.75 ounce puck will last me about a month and a half, and it has a pretty good grade on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to boot.</li>
            <li>It could make a thicker lather, however and I feel that would make it a little better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;s a little better on a face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it&#x27;s not difficult to use, this product does require a tiny bit more effort and technique than the other types of shaving soap out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high density and lack of glycerin (which aids in the other shave soaps easily melting)</li>
            <li>In a 2 year period I have used less than half of the bar making this a great money saving item.</li>
            <li>is not as easy as the other types of soap.  </li>
            <li>For most of my soaps, they melt from a puck into a puddle and cool back into being hard as rock in a couple of hours ready to use.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to classic shaving, this soap might tempt you.</li>
            <li>I use the Semogue 830, and this brush eats away this soap and creates 3x as much as lather made by a soft silver-tip.</li>
            <li>This is one of the few times I have not found a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>this soap is not a negative factor in that regard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought a few of them.</li>
            <li>For a few bucks more I&#x27;d go with something else, this soap just didn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li>I found this soaps lather to be &#x27;thin&#x27;, without the richer more full felling of others.</li>
            <li>For anyone considering going back old school for shaving as I did i would suggest this soap and also be carefull when shaving and only use a light later of soap and light pressure wity the razor.</li>
            <li>Foams up fast and thick and leaves a nice, unscented, soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>Relather - this time nice and thick - then shave.  </li>
            <li>The shaving soap is fine, though there are other creams I prefer.</li>
            <li>Right there is enough reason to get this.</li>
            <li>Long live Williams!!!!</li>
            <li>I can find this locally for about a dollar and at that price you get a pretty decent soap.</li>
            <li>At first I thought that I had just done something wrong (even though I&#x27;m an experienced shaver), and so I waited to write this review until I could try again with a different soap.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely cheap compared to other shaving soaps.</li>
            <li>After having problems with a credit card that was being tried to use fraudently, we canceled credit card and reordered with new one.  </li>
            <li>This is what I do on the weekends when I know I need new puck.</li>
            <li>and if you follow these instructions you won&#x27;t have any issues with it even as a new user of mug soap.  </li>
            <li>Saturday Night Live had a Triple Trac Razor parodyâ€“ &amp;</li>
            <li>I am 57 yrs and the soap takes me back to the days when stick and cup soaps were the only ones available.  </li>
            <li>So a winter-shave routine involving washing my face with soap, then lathering and shaving with Williams shave soap, leaves some areas of my face so dry that no after-shave balm or skin moisturizer can seem to quickly fix.</li>
            <li>I realized after I bought this that the same soap is available at my local grocery store for 1/3 the cost.  </li>
            <li>My husband only likes this kind and was having trouble finding in store...</li>
            <li>I like the soap and the smell, but for me it seems to dry to quickly on the face, even if I just do one side of the face at a time.</li>
            <li>read a few reviews which seemed favorable to this, maybe these wet shavers remarked so favorably because they haven&#x27;t tried the really good soaps?</li>
            <li>live in a hard-water area, meaning that soaps don&#x27;t lather/foam as well to begin with, yet I have done the following (which is very little) to achieve quick, easy, luxurious foam with Williams shaving soap:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d pay double or triple if Combe were willing to restore the old classic product.</li>
            <li>To me this product feels like nothing more than plain old soap lathered on the face.   </li>
            <li>My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come.</li>
            <li>Pretty basic</li>
            <li>so I can now shave daily for the first time</li>
            <li>Firstly a shaving soap bar like this will last you a while, I&#x27;m talking months to a year(if</li>
            <li>a hot lather makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>#34;a razor with three blades because the consumer is gullible enough to believe what he sees on TV commercials&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li>I used to only be able to shave twice a week due to irritation, but this has helped complete things</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the expensive boutique soaps and can&#x27;t find a good reason why I should spend several times more for, technically, the same thing.</li>
            <li>Either way, it dries a little too quickly and regardless of how you use it, it just doesn&#x27;t provide much glide for the razor as it goes over your skin.</li>
            <li>Once done showering, dump out the water, but still leave enough of the original hot water that so that it is one half the depth of the soap disk.  </li>
            <li>I was completely dumbfounded, because how can a pretty generic looking shaving soap out-perform a gel specifically designed for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li>If I was trying to get somebody into wet shaving, I would get them the starter pack by Van Der Hagen, that shave soap smells absolutely fantastic and also will not dry up and contains like 40% moisturizers, shea butter and aloe vera, not to mention it is hypoallergenic</li>
            <li>It is also fast to dry and doesn&#x27;t provide much cushion during the shave.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably my hard water, but I have others that did much better.</li>
            <li>My beard is so tough that even the best multi-blade razors with lubricant strips dont last a few days.</li>
            <li>I have hard water, so getting a good lather seems to be more difficult to me.</li>
            <li>However, maybe I got a bad piece of soap or maybe I just straight up don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff, but it smells intense, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li>, the old time barbers used to use it to condition their leather strops too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget</li>
            <li>This is the &amp;#34;slickest&amp;#34; soap I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;ve purchased a straight razor and it has been my daily shaver!  </li>
            <li>I am using a mach 3 for the moment, but practicing technique early.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp;</li>
            <li>Prior to my daily shave, I fill the mug with hot water (I heat up the water if my tap water isn&#x27;t hot enough) and leave my brush soaking in it while I shower.</li>
            <li>It helps with a close shave and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I just bought it a few hours ago - because I have a trip and wanted something cheap to travel with.  </li>
            <li>Out of the two so far I would use the van der hagen.</li>
            <li>(But he uses Old Spice, just like pappaw)  </li>
            <li>No fancy perfumes here, I really like the simple smell of this soap.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell of the puck itself seems to mellow considerably with use.  </li>

            <li>my soft silvertip it would lather..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>which IMHO is one of life&#x27;s small pleasures, not to mention that your significant other will appreciate a smooth face to embrace.  </li>
            <li>Old School shaving is the way to go.</li>
            <li>The lather is not meant to be applied directly to your skin.  </li>
            <li>I used it as a young man learning to shave.</li>
            <li>This required for me to disassemble my razor twice, in order to complete my shave.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li>complete this review</li>
            <li>After 9 shaves, I am noticing a marked improvement in my razor burn issues, and have zero irritation.  </li>
            <li>Must be old fashion but</li>
            <li>I went old school and used this and an old Ever-Ready single-edge razor.</li>
            <li>Does not bother sensitive skin - and leaves you with a cool/refreshing feel afterword.</li>
            <li>The soap was just as I remembered from when I was young</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used shaving soap in 20 years and was pleasantly surprised with the smoothness of the shave, not to mention the softness of the skin days after using it.  </li>
            <li>I have no problem building a nice thick peaking lather from this soap, so don&#x27;t understand why others are having such difficulty doing so.  </li>
            <li>Give it a good soak before you use it and don&#x27;t be shy adding water to your lather</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>It has a classic scent, I&#x27;d liken it to being very similar to IVORY soap, but with a hint of masculinity to it.  </li>
            <li>but after the barber cut my hair he&#x27;d spread hot lather and shave above my ears and the back of my neck</li>
            <li>I soak the soap in hot water for 2 minutes prior to shaving and then drain the water just prior to my shave.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The soap was inexpensive and easy to obtain, I didn&#x27;t have to order it online, and based on how little it wore after several shaves</li>
            <li>I experimented with shipping to see if what the other reviewer said was right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old and new to DE shaving, so not a veteran like some of the reviewers who have posted.  </li>
            <li>always use this soap while traveling because it is small and light weight.</li>
            <li>The William soap is inexpensive and light enough to minimize cuts other, heavier soaps tend to sometimes provide due to overwhelming the shave stroke with heavy lather.</li>
            <li>By the time I had finished the left side, and before lathering my neck, the right side was almost completely dry.</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant but a little</li>
            <li>Plus it won&#x27;t dry out and it lubricates your face very well.</li>
            <li>I say this is a gateway soap because it can quite possibly the most common soap found almost anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, I found it difficult to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time with super fancy scented import soaps.  </li>
            <li>If only soaking the soap for less than 5 minutes leaves the soap super soft, I can only imagine that the puck would be completely dissolved after 30 minutes!</li>
            <li>I know how to lather and have used other soaps that I liked very much, and even usually re-lather half way through shaving.</li>
            <li>I first got the product I attempted to melt it into a 250ml mason jar which I use to store all my other shave soaps.</li>
            <li>Follow the tips on other reviews of soaking the bar in hot water then ditch the water</li>
            <li>I tried using different amounts of water, wetting the soap first, wetting my face or leaving it dry but nothing made any difference.</li>
            <li>It has 2 minor issues: It takes a bit longer to lather and you may need to reapply a bit more often than other soaps, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>I have used the Van Der Hagen cake soap &amp; Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender Shaving Cream ... until I found Williams mug soap in a local CVS Pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smelled like a citronella candle apparently to my girl.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that dries out easily -- especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>VERY &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; not much lather &amp; smells &amp;#34;old mannish&amp;#34; not for me.</li>
            <li>I left the new puck in the mug saturating with plenty of water overnight and drained the excess water the next day.</li>
            <li>This soap is not very easy to lather at first</li>
            <li>Got to me very late, but the product is hard to find, and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Despite what the manufacturer and other reviewers have stated, in my experience, this soap dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li>It makes a rich, thick lather and helps me shave.</li>
            <li>What you might not read in other reviews is that the soap, razor, etc. is perhaps less important than how you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently noticed however this specific brand is carried by some of my local big box and drug stores, so if you&#x27;re really concerned you might swing by the shaving aisle next time</li>
            <li>I have recently went back old school when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>Since I have gone back to the double edge razor I believe my shaving cost has dropped considerably.</li>
            <li>It does not dry on your face.</li>
            <li>There are worse out there - but definitely not the best/my favorite.</li>
            <li>Lather up moving the brush around the bowl a few times, then reverse direction a few times, continue this until you get the lather you desire, then enjoy!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone looking for a unique shaving experience that is sick of paying so much for canned and brand named shaving creams that do not even work nearly as well as this classic cake of soap.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried one other brand, but this one works very well.  </li>
            <li>The puck will last you quite a long time, and will lather nicely on your face, but does not hold as thick a lather as other shaving soaps I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I started DE shaving less than two weeks ago, so I am certainly a new-bee to all this.  </li>
            <li>The men would lay back in the green trimmed leather barber&#x27;s chairs with hot towels wrapped on their faces,  an occasional toot of steam came up as they made small talk with the barber about fish or local happenings while the barber in his white smock whipped up a hot mug of Williams shaving soap into a high peak froth before dotting it all over their faces.  </li>
            <li>I was very let down.  </li>
            <li>Because the Williams puck is so hard, even after the puck has softened with a use or two and has been pressed into the bowl (after the puck has been wet and softened) like a suction cup, it tends to slide in the bottom of the bowl as I swirl my brush;  so this can be remedied by using a bit of coarse sandpaper to slightly rough up the center of the bowl bottom, which gives the puck a good surface to which it can adhere.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t dry out in the time it takes me to complete a shaving pass</li>
            <li>One of the disadvantages of living in a relatively small town is that many things are not available.</li>
            <li>I only add water to the puck for the first few shaves out of the box; after that, I don&#x27;t find it necessary.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was my first foray into the world of shaving soap as opposed to shaving cream or oil which i&#x27;ve used for the last few years.  </li>
            <li>no matter how much or little water I used, and no matter how much time I spent, I simply can&#x27;t get a decent lather from this soap.  </li>
            <li>It produces lots of lather and does it quickly, quicker than any other shave soap I&#x27;ve used, with less time swirling with the brush.</li>
            <li>all over.the shave was close,but no cushion at all, ive gotten one of the most irritating shaves ever in 25 years,it also may be due to my sensitive skin and logically,its not meant for everybody.so ill stick to my favorite proraso and art of shaving...</li>
            <li>Lathers very well- use a little extra water on the brush.  </li>
            <li>but i have found it a little difficult to get up the lather i need to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li>Giving a product a bad review simply because you can&#x27;t figure it out, isn&#x27;t fair to the manufacturer of the product and actually misleads potential future consumers, so before criticizing williams, please read this and try the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> when I take the wonderful price out of the equation, I like this soap for its merits.</li>

            <li> My husband is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase as promised and found the service very good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s designed for shaving (very very good lathering when i use my stiffer synthetic brush..</li>
            <li> They are not treating customers fairly!</li>
            <li> Williams has always made the best shaving soap, unless you know how to make your own!</li>
            <li> These shaving soaps smell so good!  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and manly, we don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Used with plenty of water, I&#x27;ve found that Williams fluffs up beautifully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to call Williams Mug Shaving Soap my starter soap.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  </li>
            <li> it will leave you felling great.  </li>
            <li> , you get a great shave and it leaves you with</li>
            <li> both of which, are great soaps.  </li>
            <li> This soap is really a great soap.</li>
            <li> Others seem to have great things to say about it, but I will not be buying this soap again.</li>
            <li> This soap is great.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up,smells great and protects the skin.</li>
            <li> also have Prorasso and Vanderhagen soaps and honestly it&#x27;s a tossup as to which is best.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell, but not all perfume like, and it makes great lather in the mug.</li>
            <li> That is not to say that it is the best shave soap I own but if given the choice I would choose Van Der Hagen every time.</li>
            <li> Great price, great size</li>
            <li> He was happy with it.</li>
            <li> As for foaming it up, the best way to get a nice lather is to soak the soap puck every time.</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain.  </li>
            <li> Great brush, great value, works well with the Williams soap.  </li>
            <li> Great shaving soap at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great cost saving soap.</li>
            <li> and I experienced that at the beginning</li>
            <li> This helps to get a great lather.</li>
            <li> This is really great for the price.</li>
            <li> Great deal.  </li>
            <li> Great combo.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> Actually, I liked Noxema&#x27;s tube soap best, but it was discontinued</li>
            <li> This is the best soap for making your own shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Great item and service</li>
            <li> been using this for years, great product.</li>
            <li> My husband has a great deal of allergies, this product does not seem to bother him and that is a plus for us.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap that&#x27;s uncomplicated and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The lather of this soap smells and feels great</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and wait until Williams decides to resurrect and originally great soap.</li>
            <li> After all the others, this remains my favorite shaving soap!!</li>
            <li> In all, it&#x27;s a very nice soap, and for the price, it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> but this soap is very nice</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice addition the the Ceramic shaving mug.  </li>
            <li> Very nice shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I create a very warm lather, this helps with any shave.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell and provides a great shave.</li>
            <li> Using a badger brush on this with good technique gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> This lathers on so much better, is warmer going on, and when combined with a feather blade has been my best shave ever in my life.</li>
            <li> You will pay much more for them but this is not the greatest shaving soap on the market.</li>
            <li> Nice soap!</li>
            <li> It is a good product and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Not the best lather in the world, but is ok in a pinch.</li>
            <li> An excellent shave cream is Gillette Foamy, better than this soap.</li>
            <li> This may not be the best shaving soap you can buy, but it is certainly the best value!</li>
            <li> Using it is a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> great lather, great smell and at the price I can&#x27;t think of a better product to get.</li>
            <li> My husbands face is softer after shaving, and he smells so good ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> I tried the Conk&#x27;s but this was just as good and even washes off without any residue.  </li>
            <li> Good product and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> the lather isnt that good</li>
            <li> However, shaving in the shower takes care of those problems really good.    </li>
            <li> I think you could use a bar soap and get just as good of results probably.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s a good product and would buy again when I&#x27;m on a budget.</li>
            <li> Good price - Good product.....</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews on this and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Makes a good lather.</li>
            <li> It makes a nice lather and is great if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> and I get good shaves with this.</li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, but it is a good workhorse soap.</li>
            <li> A wonderful light and airy lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff for a buck</li>
            <li> soap is good though</li>
            <li> Makes a good lather if you work on it.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it for my grandson, his grandpa used it for years before he passed away, My grandson found his shaving mug with a bit of soap and tried it, loved it.</li>
            <li> For the price is good and it does the job.</li>
            <li> I find that my shaves with this soap are markedly superior to any of the aerosol shave creams, even the well-marketed premium shave gels, that i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this one time didn&#x27;t get a good lather.</li>
            <li> Amazon has a good number of these in stock as well</li>
            <li> If you want a good shave with all the nostalgia, I recommend Proraso tube shaving cream.</li>
            <li> With a good shave soap, you don&#x27;t have to do any pre-lather prep, and no after-shave lotions or balms, either.}    </li>
            <li> Lather is good.</li>
            <li> I will stick to Col Conk, might try Van der Hagen since it gets good reviews on here.</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> I found that to get good coverage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good reliable soap to shave with.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to shave with and the soap smells great!</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li> However the good ends there.</li>
            <li> The soap did not make a good lather.</li>
            <li> then you need a good soap and a good brush.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good buy (plus its so inexpensive).</li>
            <li> A good way, along with the right&lt;br /&gt;mug and brush of saving 10 or 12 cans a year.</li>
            <li> This soap works good, for me.</li>
            <li> It smells good...</li>
            <li> The price was certainly fair</li>
            <li> my husband loved this</li>
            <li> Not a bad scent, fits in the Marvy shaving mug perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a great working shaving soap at an even better price.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and smells great, smells better than Van Der Hagen.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell it feels like a good shave to me.</li>
            <li> good lather and a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> Made a nice, super slippery lather perfect for shaving.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best to put a bit of water on it first to soften it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also admit that I might not have the best technique, and that someone more skilled with a shaving brush could probably do better with it.</li>
            <li> Love this mug shaving soap!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with williams shaving soap - and a very great one at that.</li>
            <li> This Williams Soap Puck is great product and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great scent and works up a good quality lather fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> I now get an amazing shave with this soap every time.</li>
            <li> This soap is truly amazing in its lathering abilities.</li>
            <li> &gt; Want a great, cheap shaving soap?</li>
            <li> a Nice Close Shave</li>
            <li> The advantage is in water retention and softess, but if I am exfoliating, I wouldn&#x27;t use rose petals.  </li>
            <li> My husband likes it, and I used it on my legs once and liked it too.</li>
            <li> Sure you can keep it in the box and lather in your hands but the box will eventually fall apart and it won&#x27;t look as good.</li>
            <li> tried prorsoa soap and clonal conk and they lathered up nice</li>
            <li> and it smells really nice</li>
            <li> It smells nice</li>
            <li> I can seal the containers preserving their smells and the containers stack nicely in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> So, in went the puck into one of my lovingly used mugs.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice citrusy scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> The price savings and good results I have gotten from the soap has been satisfying for all this time.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Also if you are going to use this exclusively be sure to do some searching since you can get really good deals.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to soak the soap along with your brush in warm water for about a minute before shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it anymore except in some kind of no-other-shave-soap-available emergency.</li>
            <li> but to each his own:  Years ago, I used the cheapest, poorest quality brush but still got acceptable results.  </li>
            <li> If you have invested in a nice razor and quality brush, this is not the item to cut corners and save money on.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> Many people complain that they don&#x27;t get a good lather</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t mind that, it smells OK, lathers well, and does a good job on the shaving front.</li>
            <li> the soap smells nice</li>
            <li> but i would probably think twice about getting it again because it doesn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s own container.  </li>
            <li> It does lather up really nice</li>
            <li> and I get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> and it makes your face feel and smell nice</li>
            <li> It makes a nice lather with a brush, and I have used a brush since 1960.  </li>
            <li> This soap creates a perfect gliding surface for a safety razor or a straight razor blade.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, I used mine for hand soap after three shaves with it.</li>
            <li> And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> I also use a GT scuttle to keep my brush warm, but prefer to build lather on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, goes to prove the you don&#x27;t need to spend an arm and a leg to get something decent.</li>
            <li> I have very easily nicked and cut skin.</li>
            <li> That said, the lather I do get from Williams soap is pretty good!</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than others and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> good, cheap shaving soap...</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found for a shave soap with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This was the best progress I had so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go so far as to say that it was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Of the 3 I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> So cheap and so good.</li>
            <li> And by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used is the inexpensive Arkko shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> When the soap arrived I was really impressed by the masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> Good smooth shave.</li>
            <li> It foams up pretty good and smells good.</li>
            <li> This is good soap, it has good smooth characteristics that allow the blade to glide smoothly over your face.  </li>
            <li> Soap quickly works up a good, nice smelling lather.  </li>
            <li> Smells clean and good.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when I lather up, and apply to face, the smell is mild, pleasant, and manly.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, when I lather up, and apply to face, the smell is mild, pleasant, and manly.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome lather, classic sent, easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> Best there is! :O)</li>
            <li> and this is a very cheap soap..</li>
            <li> (this is very important).  </li>
            <li> A quick splash of aftershave, and my girlfriend was delighted at the smoothness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The soap itself is very good, lathers nicely and is easy to apply, however the smell isn&#x27;t that good (airplane soap) and it leaves a residue on everything it touches and once you wipe off your face your skin it very dry.  </li>
            <li> LOve</li>
            <li> When it came time to buy more, the stores around here in TX did not carry it and we found it on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam.</li>
            <li> However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam.</li>
            <li> My favorite- including creams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re a fool if you pay more than $1.50 for a puck.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a terrible smell</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I started with Williams.</li>
            <li> more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> This soap performs as well or better than many I have tried.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;ll be clearing our more soap bubbles than lather for a bit.</li>
            <li> You could spend more for a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; soap, but why?</li>
            <li> love his manly shave with a brush shave thx</li>
            <li> I love to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> I have many soaps.</li>
            <li> I love a challenge, so I decided to give this soap one more try.  </li>
            <li> I love that old-fashioned smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have tried it again.</li>
            <li> Got a better shave using a bottle of conditioner.   </li>
            <li> There are better soaps out there.</li>
            <li> It is a much more thirsty soap than most will be used to.</li>
            <li> Of all the soaps I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> more money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they confirmed that I try something else and that Williams mug soap doesn&#x27;t give a nice</li>
            <li> and I could not find any place to purchase more.  </li>
            <li> I am now almost 55 and for most if not all of those years, I have used Williams brand.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad to find it online at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love Williams Soap.</li>
            <li> Depends more on the mood</li>
            <li> : Someone wanted my review on the soap - I give it an, OKAY in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> shipping was the price of almost 3 more of these...  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even have to soak it for 30 minutes (as many insist).</li>
            <li> Love Williams mug soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Williams soap for many years.</li>
            <li> Cost me an arm and a leg to mail to Thailand but the soap was cheap!</li>
            <li> However, if you do love smelling like a garden in spring this stuff is not for you.  </li>
            <li> more I started thinking about it the more</li>
            <li> The soap softens my beard so much better than the canned foam,</li>
            <li> I am now even more satisfied with this soap now that I can use it</li>
            <li> They will provide better lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a safe place to start -</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth my skin feels when I&#x27;m done!  </li>

            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t think much of this product, there are a great many people who have shaved with it for years and seem to approve.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> AND YOU WILL SWEAR YOU WHERE A KID AGAIN WATCHING YOUR GRAND DAD</li>
            <li> HEY IT&#x27;S OK TO HOP ON THE TIME TRAVEL EXPRESS.</li>
            <li> but i tihnk for waht most peopel are looing for this is more a 3</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s where i LOVE</li>
            <li> I use this with Derby Extra blades and get a superb shave.</li>
            <li> It was priced ok</li>
            <li> it by itself with shipping, but it is still my favorite shaving soap</li>
            <li> this will make you smell like a man&amp;#34; :-)  </li>
            <li> Hope you enjoy!</li>
            <li> I got this on a recommendation, but didn&#x27;t consider that most soaps are made from animals, which is a feature I don&#x27;t find desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VDH feels better to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the shaving soap I purchased at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many mug soaps and those that come in a tube.  </li>
            <li> -- second best is Williams.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad one of the better ones, Williams, is still putting it out.  </li>
            <li> Others say &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll smell like a man&amp;#34; with this soap, but it&#x27;s more like you smell like you&#x27;ve been bathing in citronella oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s the fragrance that kills the deal, otherwise this would be a top pick for me.</li>
            <li> It is much better than wasting can after can of</li>
            <li> Yes some soaps are way better than others</li>
            <li> You also can&#x27;t beat the price, over all satisfied with this soap.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave sope.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I think this gives me a better shave than the canned soap does.</li>
            <li> Plus, I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about purchasing such a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; soap; but it has proven to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and provides a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and have no issues with it.</li>
            <li> - I am looking for something else that smells a bit better.</li>
            <li> but if dad likes it, it&#x27;s okay with me</li>
            <li> Just be nice to get a good straight razor to go with it.</li>
            <li> Kind of reminds me of old-fashioned barber shops, which are very rare now in Virginia.  </li>
            <li> but you have to get the right combination of water to soap in your mug and a good badger brush</li>
            <li> The soap fits in very nicely and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> I also love the scent of this soap, it has a nice, clean scent to it that won&#x27;t cloy the scent of your aftershave or cologne.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering and leans more towards a &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; smell and definitely not a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> a nice, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes a decent lather and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> it does smell nice and clean and rinses off well.  </li>
            <li> While there are many fine soaps that will get the job done, you won&#x27;t find any better soap at this price point that will give you a better shave.  </li>
            <li> It also offers adequate, but not the best shave protection.    </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling very clean, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> The first thing i noticed was the good smell, yet it lacked everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Williams shaving soap with a good brush and reasonable blade will give you the best shave possible</li>
            <li> It will create the lather you desire if you use hot water + time + a good brush.  </li>
            <li> It lathers and works pretty well and carries a good price to boot.  </li>
            <li> I soak my boar brush in hot water while showering then give the brush one good shake.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I noticed it had a very strong smell that, honestly, was a bit off-putting.</li>
            <li> Lathers  nicely and quickly softens my whiskers.</li>
            <li> Williams soap is mild on the skin (the &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; of shaving soaps) and has a pleasant mild scent.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t argue with the price, lasts a while and, even better, locally available.</li>
            <li> Most of us are here for one thing a cheap soap.</li>
            <li> , I use this with a wet/dry electric razor &amp; it makes for the closest &amp; most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> Sure it was cheap...</li>
            <li> Once I knew that, I could build up a good dense lather that holds very well in</li>
            <li> It has a very basic/clean smell (think Hilton shower soap that smells good).  </li>
            <li> Their are some cheaper soaps, they go fast, don&#x27;t give your beard a good soak like Williams.</li>
            <li> Good soap feels good and doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> he gets a better, smoother shave with it than the cans and it smells so clean and good, really don&#x27;t need aftershave.  </li>
            <li> It is a tricky animal but once tamed it offers a very nice shave.</li>
            <li> I had tried 2 other products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 years before trying the more moisture rich creams by Proraso, Erasmic, Speick and the like.</li>
            <li> Van der Hagen is a lot more user friendly in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK shaving soap, but the cost of shipping was 3 times what the soap was worth!</li>
            <li> It applies easily</li>
            <li> This stuff smells light, fresh and amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Could be slippery for those using a DE razor, but this could easily eliminate the lathering quality it has.  </li>
            <li> Clear any remaining soap with your nice warm washcloth and apply aftershave of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a good soap, it lathers on good and stays wet.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it when applied with a good brush.</li>
            <li> First off, I will say that this product does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it three stars because the smell is pretty nice</li>
            <li> It smells nice - just a clean, fresh smell, not too fragrant.</li>
            <li> I found my best shave was by using less water to get a thicker lather, which clogged the razor somewhat.</li>
            <li> I was researching for a quality soap that is cheap and effective for my first time experience.</li>
            <li> Last night for example I let is soak in hot water for 20 minutes while I showered and got my best lather yet.</li>
            <li> (If you are a value shaver, the boar brush WILL work just fine.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of williams could be better for sure, but a lot of people really like it and for the price, it doesn&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> When this box was in production it was a fine soap.</li>
            <li> Using that method, it lathers just as easy as anything and provides a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The shave was fine</li>
            <li> To me that&#x27;s just fine</li>
            <li> It lathers fairly quickly, LOVES water, that&#x27;s for sure</li>
            <li> How lucky can we be!</li>
            <li> The lack of the super luxurious and frills may make most turn away from this soap.</li>
            <li> Yesterday I had my first shave with Arko, and that soap performed like a decent shaving soap should -- excellent lather, excellent cushion, and a seriously close shave with no cuts or irritation.</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> It lathers up nicely, smells good, and is a slick soap that gives a nice cushion.</li>
            <li> Very good shaving soap, very thick lather and smell good too.</li>
            <li> On my quest to find the best shaving soap for my DE safety shaving routine I came across this little drug store gem.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite soap so far, but definitely good and usable and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> as good as, say, proraso or Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps would, but that doesn&#x27;t matter because it lubricates my face just fine and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever and is ridiculously cheap, which makes it very cost effective.</li>
            <li> With this soap and the cheap Burma Shave brush you&#x27;ll be all set to go.</li>
            <li> Shaves smooth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, its dirt cheap and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It was cheap.</li>
            <li> this is a great basic choice!</li>
            <li> I just switched to a safety razor and now enjoy shaving using my Mercur razor, my badger brush and Williams soap.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy my shave now.</li>
            <li> If I can make a great lather with this, anyone can!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of with this soap</li>
            <li> Williams Mug Shaving Soap 1.75 oz  - Great lasting lather.  </li>
            <li> The soap lathered great with my water all I needed to do was soak the puck for about the same as the brush and lather.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and gets the job done, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering this as part of a free shipping order would not have&lt;br /&gt;got</li>
            <li> Now rotate your brush around the bottom for about a minute while using light pressure.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> This is the primary reason I&#x27;m not going to use it:  </li>
            <li> The soap lathers nicely without the need for adding too much water.</li>
            <li> Same stuff, great shave.  </li>
            <li> I just simply could not get good lather, so I gave up after many attempts.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good old college try.</li>
            <li> Good thick slickery lather that feels great.</li>
            <li> My husband was used to using a shaving brush and soap (Williams particularly) for  many, many years.</li>
            <li> It is easy to find, very inexpensive and is a great soap for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> super cheap price of William&#x27;s definitely makes it a Great Buy.</li>
            <li> does take a little more hot water and work to get a good lather, but I get a great straight razor shave with it</li>
            <li> This product is very inexpensive, but unfortunately it is not too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Then  I use the brush to apply it, being sure to dip the brush in the hot water, and also dip the razor itself.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this to hone my lathering technique, but this did nothing but damage my skill and brush.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the rave reviews this soap got when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to locate this again online as a gift, as he has wanted to return to brush/mug/soap shaving.</li>
            <li> It will build a decent lather and in turn give you a pretty good shave.  </li>
            <li> Switched to Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap which is cheaper, get a much better shave and blades last two months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sort of a clean, old-time soapy smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower my after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is somewhat soapy and will leave you smelling clean and won&#x27;t interfere with your aftershave.</li>
            <li> Its manly yet clean.</li>
            <li> and if you want some of that clean manly goodness then just take some of the un-lathered soap and massage it into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I run the water real hot and stir up a very hot comfortable lather.  </li>
            <li> Clean soapy smell (like Ivory soap).  </li>
            <li> The scent is just a clean smell , no flowers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d smell it all day; it is just one of those subtle but pleasant aromas that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> For the very modest price, though, you do get a pretty good soap.</li>
            <li> Good, lasting lather that is complection friendly, non-drying, and no petro-chemical or alcohol (no-no&#x27;s) ingredients.</li>
            <li> I found myself using far more water to get a good lather than with any other soap I own.</li>
            <li> It took me 4 or 5 tries to figure it all out, but I&#x27;ve happily been using williams since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very Creamy Lather,Nice Fragrance,Lathers up quickly,gives a Much Better  </li>
            <li> The lather rinsed off cleanly and with no effort at all- a quick splash of water and there was no residue.</li>
            <li> so far im loving it.</li>
            <li> Many people pinch their badger brushes when lathering onto the face, but you don&#x27;t really need to do so w. a boar.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several shaving soaps and creams from well known internationals and Williams gives as good a shave as any at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> make sure you don&#x27;t put too much water in there</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is good quality, and low price.  </li>
            <li> Only good thing is there is no soap ring around the sink, since the lather will evaporate.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good shaving soap especially for the money</li>
            <li> Like the smell, it builds good lather, and can be purchased at my local drug store.  </li>
            <li> I squeeze the brush of excess water, drain the mug, swirl the brush into the soap firmly till the bristles are coated with semi-wet soap, and then lather my face -- in under two minutes I have incredible lather with Williams.</li>
            <li> This soap actually does produce a good lather.</li>
            <li> Though I love the softer, easy-to-lather soaps of modern creation, I am no disillusioned wimp when it comes to the task of taking the time to work an old-fashioned mug soap.  </li>
            <li> I say okay because i really have no opinion</li>
            <li> it went with his cup and razor, the old timey kind.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product off and on for many years and found it adequate for the task and certainly inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> The soap brushes up best with hot water an a somewhat stiff brush.  </li>
            <li> First of all, the soap smells like really strong bug spray.</li>
            <li> Gave me a nice clean shave for the cheap price would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> that super close shave some of us struggle</li>
            <li> The problem is that it dries too quickly after applying.</li>
            <li> you are out shopping and get lucky.</li>
            <li> Compared to the ones I have been using (Col Conks and Van De Hagen), I noticed a remarkably quick drying up of the lather.</li>
            <li> It works OK, but requires an inordinate amount of time to get a decent lather.  </li>
            <li> It is okay, not the best but does the job, not as moisturizing as other quality soaps, it does leave my face a bit on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Lather your face lightly then apply a hot washcloth to your face for 15 - 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> As to canned creams, I&#x27;ve also put them into my mug, which is in a bowl of very hot water.</li>
            <li> right out of the gate, first shave, I was able to build a HUGE, lasting lather that lubricated and conditioned my face better than any canned product I&#x27;ve used in over 21 years of shaving.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation for those who object to the product&#x27;s bouquet is to keep your nose out of the mug/bowl when using a new puck, and just enjoy the lather as it lubes your whiskers!    </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!  </li>
            <li> I kid you not, this soap smells EXACTLY like a mosquito candle!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what its supposed to do and does it well!</li>
            <li> Ok, if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well and gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> deff worth the buy</li>
            <li> None of the soaps I&#x27;ve tried so far do a better job of protecting your face or cushioning your blade.  </li>
            <li> I used a far more soap before and it was alright</li>
            <li> The soap is relatively odor-free and has a nice non-greasy lather.</li>
            <li> A nice and simple way to lather up with a brush.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> But, William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap lacks the one thing that makes a shave soap a success and that is glycerin.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a decent lather, however it takes longer to get a thicker air free lather and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The puck smells strongly of the classic soap scent that some people like.</li>
            <li> The soap does create a decent lather that is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Worth buying...</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I had given up hope for an enjoyable shave again until the resurgence in shaving goods and popped for a Weishi razor, dug out my old badger brush and mug, and ordered Williams Mug Shaving Soap.</li>
            <li> The brush then makes a great lather that is thick but light.</li>
            <li> soap lathers up nicely, has a nice fresh mild scent, and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a nice lather, stiff peaks.  </li>
            <li> It sometimes amazes me that the really good soaps are hard to find but the soaps that kind of suck are highly available.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly use other brands just because they are more luxurious</li>
            <li> /&gt;Feel free to add any other tips and tricks you&#x27;ve learned from your own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A simple but very effective product- much better than most ridiculously priced soaps out</li>
            <li> Although I do not have other soap to compare to, Williams soap is certainly a good soap to start.</li>
            <li> Priced right..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say it right off the bat.</li>
            <li> Williams is just right.</li>
            <li> so I would not forget the right product.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time I used Old Spice shaving soap (still have an Old Spice shaving mug in fact) but that product hasn&#x27;t been available for many years now.  </li>
            <li> I think I will be stuck with this kind of shaving soap for a long time.</li>
            <li> The most important things, at least in the beginning, are to use really hot water, LOTS of soap, a stiff boar brush, and it works best when you face lather rather than lathering it in a bowl.    </li>
            <li> I tried all the tricks and hacks to get the most out of this soap, because apparently it&#x27;s a water hog and won&#x27;t lather right unless you spoil it like a princess first.</li>
            <li> After 54 years of wet-shaving I am somewhat familiar with building a decent lather from a soap puck or cream.  </li>
            <li> My recommendation for those who object to the product&#x27;s bouquet is to keep your nose out of the mug/bowl when using a new puck, and just enjoy the lather as it lubes your whiskers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ok, maybe so... so lets swirl the brush on the puck for a few more seconds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, the soap smell is just classic clean.</li>
            <li> (My favorite shave soap is currently the Arko shave stick, which isn&#x27;t much more expensive, but offers excellent protection for a close shave.)    </li>
            <li> For the price, there are no complaints; it is certainly worth that amount, but I will probably invest in more quality soap next time.</li>
            <li> simple, nice smell, very inexpensive</li>
            <li> , I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how Williams requires a little more hot water than most soaps.</li>
            <li> The Williams soap has a fresh smell, works up a good lather with little soap and brush dipped in hot water.</li>
            <li> Smells okay (a little bit &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not wild about), but produces a great lather.</li>
            <li> get the full experience, I&#x27;ve learned to follow an old technique and soak the puck in a mug full of steaming hot water along with my brush while I do my pre-shave prep.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft, not dry and lather up very very quickly and well as very cleanly.</li>
            <li> Go ahead if you don&#x27;t believe me and try William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap, but I guarantee that you will find plenty of other shave soaps out there that will give you a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> but for me.. the most important thing is perfofrmance and how t helps when you&#x27;re running a clinically sharp razor along your skin.  </li>
            <li> Willians Mug Shaving Soap can be gotten at most local pharmacies, so try looking around before you pay shipping.</li>
            <li> my first effort</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shave soap and given the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare it to because I&#x27;m a newbie at the traditional ways, but I do know there&#x27;s better out there.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a shaving soap bar</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to overspend on some of the higher priced ones, so I picked Williams.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this one, but the first two pucks I purchased ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> Spend a couple of extra dollars for a better shaving soap.</li>
            <li> first time I used the soap</li>
            <li> I began to believe that William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap belonged in exactly what the name states, a mug.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried a different soap, one that is a bit softer but way more stinky.</li>
            <li> Because this is also a thicker shaving soap I would suggest a boar hair shaving brush over the badger hair as the bristles are a bit more coarse.</li>
            <li> Then I thought to try the Internet and found exactly what he wanted from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> DO follow the advice of others here and wet your brush well and add a bit of water (warm or not according to preference) to the top of the puck and pour off any excess prior to lathering.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly waht i&#x27;m looking for</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wont&#x27; necessairly feel as luxurious or creamy as other soaps, or lather up impressively like other soaps.  </li>
            <li> Williams was the first shaving soap I ever tried.</li>
            <li> When the time came for my first soap shave, it didn&#x27;t go well.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with the results of this soap and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> And I took the time to lather it up pretty well</li>
            <li> You MUST have hot water - if not then use an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, Amazon had it listed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> ) Splash hot water on your face before applying the lather.  </li>
            <li> THAT&#x27;S when it became a tallow second soap and ceased to become the iconic product it was for over 160 years.  </li>
            <li> and i will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> While placed in my ancient shaving mug and using a durable badger shaving brush with a reknowned double edged blade, I experience a shave comparable to that obtained in a competent barber shop.</li>
            <li> advice given to me by my barber for using Williams...soak the disk and brush in HOT water for the time it takes you to shower.  </li>
            <li> It was most likely in your father or grandfathers mug.</li>
            <li> No fancy oils or perfumes, and a great lather that lasts long enough for 1-2 pass shavers.</li>
            <li> The soap has a old school citronella smell, which I personally enjoy.</li>
            <li> It is pretty hydrophilic(loves water).</li>
            <li> I switched to Williams Mug Shaving Soap when Old Spice was no longer available</li>
            <li> Will definitely be using it and ordering more.</li>
            <li> That was my impression at first.  </li>
            <li> I soak the brush for about one minute in hot water and soak the soap in my mug with about a 1/4 inch of water.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first soaps I tried when I started using a shaving brush, and I did not like it.</li>
            <li> I found that many others had the same difficulty.</li>
            <li> Very good soap, very simple and subtle, and an excellent soap to begin the traditional wet shave.  </li>
            <li> My favorite so far has been from the Tonsorial Shaving Cream from The New York Shaving Company.</li>
            <li> As long as I reapply every quarter of my face before shaving or more frequently reapplying, the soap works fine.</li>
            <li> Love that smell, old fashioned, clean, and simple.    </li>
            <li> (Or add a few drops of shaving oil, glycerin, and oatmeal powder, as I suggested above, for creamier, more moisturizing shave; lather a bit more, apply to face, and enjoy even more!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DE shaving takes longer (probably because I am still very new to it) but it is well worth it</li>
            <li> I wear friendly mutton chops, so all I shave is my chin and throat, but for that I use shave soap and an old safety razor.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, lubricates and conditions extremely well and has a nice but not overpowering scent.  </li>
            <li> As far as the smell goes, you&#x27;re not going to smell like you just jumped out of a rose bush while burning incense, but at the same time it&#x27;s not offensive to me either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shaving soap and a brush pretty much ever since I first started shaving.  </li>
            <li> , I would not buy this again unless I ran out of the good stuff and this was the only one I could get on a last minute thing.</li>
            <li> , it takes a little longer to lather but other than that is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I normally lather the right side of my face first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> I keep coming back to it as my day-to-day standby as I venture out to explore other soaps with more exotic ingredients and scents.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap to use, the only reason it is getting four stars instead of five is because a facial moisturizer a necessity with it other wise your skin can get really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the classic scent and form of this product, but I&#x27;m guessing that the original formulation of decades past is far superior to that of this modern incarnation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously this comes in a box and requires either a shaving mug, bowl, or a sufficiently large cup to keep it in.</li>
            <li> I certainly wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells like citronella and the large bubbles never went away</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase another bar when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> It lathers pretty easy but despite what it says on the box about not drying, it does dry pretty fast.</li>
            <li> First, if you&#x27;re upset that you&#x27;re not getting enough lather, you only have your own ignorance to blame.  </li>
            <li> I was reviewing a new disposable during my initial shave on top of being unfamiliar with the method.</li>
            <li> , I may have one or two more shaves left and its time to start a new bar.</li>
            <li> The lather worked up easily and like most tallow based soaps produced a thick, creamy lather.</li>
            <li> The price is right and as long as this is so ready available</li>
            <li> I do the latter and it works fine.</li>
            <li> It barely has a smell to it, and what there is just smells clean.  </li>
            <li> Amazing little soap.</li>
            <li> A little warm water was added and I began whipping up the lather.</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving soap and I&#x27;m very happy with it - would not hesitate to buy again, but will probably want to at least try some of the other</li>
            <li> Williams shaving soap is a bit hard to work into a good lather</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller in diameter than some shaving soaps and really fits best in a mug, not the wooden bowls made for shaving soap....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create much lather.</li>
            <li> ,I would recommend  this  Shaving Soap to anyone that wants</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not what I expected I both the razor at magic mart thinking</li>
            <li> Has a real \\&quot;He</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much else to say:  it&#x27;s inexpensive</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care much for the smell.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed a very soapy smell much like Ivory bar soap I think.  </li>
            <li> The soap is available at CVS stores and online for $1.50 only.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, keep an open mind and enjoy this right-priced shaving soap.</li>
            <li> It can get very bubbly if you use too much water.</li>
            <li> As you see here, there&#x27;s a whole lot of discussion and opinions about it.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t really cling to your face so it won&#x27;t conflict with any cologne</li>
            <li> The soap itself is extremely gentle</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care too much for the fragrance, though.</li>
            <li> But you have to either shave fast or lather one side of your face at a time or the lather will be gone.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather well no matter how much water I use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very off-putting.</li>
            <li> Planning to buy this shave soap again very soon. . . .</li>
            <li> Very &amp;#34;citrusy,&amp;#34; leaning towards lemon.  </li>
            <li> and you should be able to start wet shaving for about $25 US including the safety razor.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping,can now include with the shaver and cup.my brother will&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an absolute 4.5 to 5).</li>
            <li> The Williams mug shaving soap really foams well and improves my shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have been using Col Conk but ran out and picked this up cheap at the local CVS.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t mind the smell and never got any comments from the wife or kids on that</li>
            <li> It is soap how much can one really say about soap?</li>
            <li> This softens your beard and makes shaving MUCH easier.  </li>
            <li> process takes me about 5 minutes, I NEVER cut myself and with practice you will have similar results not to mention that your face will be smooth as silk with no irritation.  </li>
            <li> After having used Williams Mug Shaving Soap off and on for a few years, I find that I always come back to it when I tire of more exotic shave soaps.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very nature</li>
            <li> Much better than what I had expected.</li>
            <li> This is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s what this soap really is.</li>
            <li> Not much competition any more.</li>
            <li> The product arrived fast and works very well.</li>
            <li> and I knew if I didn&#x27;t like it it would not be too much of a loss.  </li>
            <li> But I cannot recommend a soap that I feel is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This soap puts together a nice lather that allows the blade to slide across your skin, without catching and cutting you.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered 3 more bars, so I hope I live that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I first switched from Mach 3 cartridges and Gillette Sensitive Skin Shaving Gel, I only did it to try to save some money on my regular shaving needs.</li>
            <li> Maybe you will stay with it forever like many of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have two other, pricier soaps in my rotation, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Almost any other product will serve you better.</li>
            <li> If you want a simple, clean smelling soap for under $3 this is it.</li>
            <li> it was light and not very slipery no matter the water amount if you want cheap shaving soap spend an extra 1 dollar and get van der hagen your face will appreciate it</li>
            <li> This soap is very concentrated and thus needs to be mixed with a few dashes of water to develop a good lather.</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t really have an answer to that, but needless to say, this soap has lasted me for about 6 months of 2-3 times per week shaving, and I think that it&#x27;s one of the best products related to shaving that I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new at straight razor shaving and bought Williams mug to try out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regarding the smell of the product:  When I stick my nose over the puck when it&#x27;s new - never care much for the smell.  </li>
            <li> I stick my nose over the puck when it&#x27;s new - never care much for the smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I get less cuts / nicks using a better soap or even shave cream.</li>
            <li> That will soften up the soap and allow you to get more soap off of the bar with less effort once you get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better and less costly than it&#x27;s Aerosol Counterpart.</li>
            <li> I still built up a lather to equal or beat anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a can, although it wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as a good lather should be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to obtain my Merkur Classic 34C, but it&#x27;s on the way</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a classic.  </li>
            <li> Those three words sum up the main feature of the product.  </li>
            <li> This shave soap is mainly soap without the lubricating properties the glycerin provides.</li>
            <li> and it smells like Ivory soap, which is always a classic scent.</li>
            <li> I use a regular coffee mug to get the soap on my brush, then I transfer the brush to a regular cereal bowl I also bought from Wal-Mart for under $3 to whip it up, the bowl gives me more room to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll gladly use this soap over the more expensive stuff any day.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s a bar of soap, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, does it well, it&#x27;s locally available, and cheap.     </li>
            <li> With the very tip of the brush, I dip it in the hot water and add a couple of drops from the sink into the lather on my hand and keep swirling to further mix it into the soap until the mixture gets very foamy and then apply it to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to shavers of all experience levels.</li>
            <li> Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.the method.</li>

            <li> Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations based on some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product highly as it was  part of a Christmas gift for my grandson</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I used the Williams Mug Shaving Soap for about a month or so after reading all of the high reviews here.</li>
            <li> $4 for a cake of this soap is too high.  </li>
            <li> The lather is rich, creamy, peaky and lasting.</li>
            <li> A 1.75 ounce puck will last me about a month and a half, and it has a pretty good grade on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to boot.</li>
            <li> It could make a thicker lather, however and I feel that would make it a little better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;s a little better on a face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s not difficult to use, this product does require a tiny bit more effort and technique than the other types of shaving soap out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high density and lack of glycerin (which aids in the other shave soaps easily melting)</li>
            <li> In a 2 year period I have used less than half of the bar making this a great money saving item.</li>
            <li> is not as easy as the other types of soap.  </li>
            <li> For most of my soaps, they melt from a puck into a puddle and cool back into being hard as rock in a couple of hours ready to use.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to classic shaving, this soap might tempt you.</li>
            <li> I use the Semogue 830, and this brush eats away this soap and creates 3x as much as lather made by a soft silver-tip.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few times I have not found a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this soap is not a negative factor in that regard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought a few of them.</li>
            <li> For a few bucks more I&#x27;d go with something else, this soap just didn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li> I found this soaps lather to be &#x27;thin&#x27;, without the richer more full felling of others.</li>
            <li> For anyone considering going back old school for shaving as I did i would suggest this soap and also be carefull when shaving and only use a light later of soap and light pressure wity the razor.</li>
            <li> Foams up fast and thick and leaves a nice, unscented, soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> Relather - this time nice and thick - then shave.  </li>
            <li> The shaving soap is fine, though there are other creams I prefer.</li>
            <li> Right there is enough reason to get this.</li>
            <li> Long live Williams!!!!</li>
            <li> I can find this locally for about a dollar and at that price you get a pretty decent soap.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that I had just done something wrong (even though I&#x27;m an experienced shaver), and so I waited to write this review until I could try again with a different soap.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely cheap compared to other shaving soaps.</li>
            <li> After having problems with a credit card that was being tried to use fraudently, we canceled credit card and reordered with new one.  </li>
            <li> This is what I do on the weekends when I know I need new puck.</li>
            <li> and if you follow these instructions you won&#x27;t have any issues with it even as a new user of mug soap.  </li>
            <li> Saturday Night Live had a Triple Trac Razor parodyâ€“ &amp;</li>
            <li> I am 57 yrs and the soap takes me back to the days when stick and cup soaps were the only ones available.  </li>
            <li> So a winter-shave routine involving washing my face with soap, then lathering and shaving with Williams shave soap, leaves some areas of my face so dry that no after-shave balm or skin moisturizer can seem to quickly fix.</li>
            <li> I realized after I bought this that the same soap is available at my local grocery store for 1/3 the cost.  </li>
            <li> My husband only likes this kind and was having trouble finding in store...</li>
            <li> I like the soap and the smell, but for me it seems to dry to quickly on the face, even if I just do one side of the face at a time.</li>
            <li> read a few reviews which seemed favorable to this, maybe these wet shavers remarked so favorably because they haven&#x27;t tried the really good soaps?</li>
            <li> live in a hard-water area, meaning that soaps don&#x27;t lather/foam as well to begin with, yet I have done the following (which is very little) to achieve quick, easy, luxurious foam with Williams shaving soap:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d pay double or triple if Combe were willing to restore the old classic product.</li>
            <li> To me this product feels like nothing more than plain old soap lathered on the face.   </li>
            <li> My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic</li>
            <li> so I can now shave daily for the first time</li>
            <li> Firstly a shaving soap bar like this will last you a while, I&#x27;m talking months to a year(if</li>
            <li> a hot lather makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> #34;a razor with three blades because the consumer is gullible enough to believe what he sees on TV commercials&amp;#34;).</li>
            <li> I used to only be able to shave twice a week due to irritation, but this has helped complete things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the expensive boutique soaps and can&#x27;t find a good reason why I should spend several times more for, technically, the same thing.</li>
            <li> Either way, it dries a little too quickly and regardless of how you use it, it just doesn&#x27;t provide much glide for the razor as it goes over your skin.</li>
            <li> Once done showering, dump out the water, but still leave enough of the original hot water that so that it is one half the depth of the soap disk.  </li>
            <li> I was completely dumbfounded, because how can a pretty generic looking shaving soap out-perform a gel specifically designed for sensitive skin?</li>
            <li> If I was trying to get somebody into wet shaving, I would get them the starter pack by Van Der Hagen, that shave soap smells absolutely fantastic and also will not dry up and contains like 40% moisturizers, shea butter and aloe vera, not to mention it is hypoallergenic</li>
            <li> It is also fast to dry and doesn&#x27;t provide much cushion during the shave.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my hard water, but I have others that did much better.</li>
            <li> My beard is so tough that even the best multi-blade razors with lubricant strips dont last a few days.</li>
            <li> I have hard water, so getting a good lather seems to be more difficult to me.</li>
            <li> However, maybe I got a bad piece of soap or maybe I just straight up don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff, but it smells intense, and not in a good way.</li>
            <li> , the old time barbers used to use it to condition their leather strops too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget</li>
            <li> This is the &amp;#34;slickest&amp;#34; soap I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;ve purchased a straight razor and it has been my daily shaver!  </li>
            <li> I am using a mach 3 for the moment, but practicing technique early.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp;</li>
            <li> Prior to my daily shave, I fill the mug with hot water (I heat up the water if my tap water isn&#x27;t hot enough) and leave my brush soaking in it while I shower.</li>
            <li> It helps with a close shave and leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I just bought it a few hours ago - because I have a trip and wanted something cheap to travel with.  </li>
            <li> Out of the two so far I would use the van der hagen.</li>
            <li> (But he uses Old Spice, just like pappaw)  </li>
            <li> No fancy perfumes here, I really like the simple smell of this soap.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell of the puck itself seems to mellow considerably with use.  </li>
            <li> Also, the smell of the puck itself seems to mellow considerably with use.  </li>
            <li> my soft silvertip it would lather..</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> which IMHO is one of life&#x27;s small pleasures, not to mention that your significant other will appreciate a smooth face to embrace.  </li>
            <li> Old School shaving is the way to go.</li>
            <li> The lather is not meant to be applied directly to your skin.  </li>
            <li> I used it as a young man learning to shave.</li>
            <li> This required for me to disassemble my razor twice, in order to complete my shave.&lt;br /&gt;To</li>
            <li> complete this review</li>
            <li> After 9 shaves, I am noticing a marked improvement in my razor burn issues, and have zero irritation.  </li>
            <li> Must be old fashion but</li>
            <li> I went old school and used this and an old Ever-Ready single-edge razor.</li>
            <li> Does not bother sensitive skin - and leaves you with a cool/refreshing feel afterword.</li>
            <li> The soap was just as I remembered from when I was young</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used shaving soap in 20 years and was pleasantly surprised with the smoothness of the shave, not to mention the softness of the skin days after using it.  </li>
            <li> I have no problem building a nice thick peaking lather from this soap, so don&#x27;t understand why others are having such difficulty doing so.  </li>
            <li> Give it a good soak before you use it and don&#x27;t be shy adding water to your lather</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> It has a classic scent, I&#x27;d liken it to being very similar to IVORY soap, but with a hint of masculinity to it.  </li>
            <li> but after the barber cut my hair he&#x27;d spread hot lather and shave above my ears and the back of my neck</li>
            <li> I soak the soap in hot water for 2 minutes prior to shaving and then drain the water just prior to my shave.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The soap was inexpensive and easy to obtain, I didn&#x27;t have to order it online, and based on how little it wore after several shaves</li>
            <li> I experimented with shipping to see if what the other reviewer said was right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and new to DE shaving, so not a veteran like some of the reviewers who have posted.  </li>
            <li> always use this soap while traveling because it is small and light weight.</li>
            <li> The William soap is inexpensive and light enough to minimize cuts other, heavier soaps tend to sometimes provide due to overwhelming the shave stroke with heavy lather.</li>
            <li> By the time I had finished the left side, and before lathering my neck, the right side was almost completely dry.</li>
            <li> Not unpleasant but a little</li>
            <li> Plus it won&#x27;t dry out and it lubricates your face very well.</li>
            <li> I say this is a gateway soap because it can quite possibly the most common soap found almost anywhere.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, I found it difficult to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with super fancy scented import soaps.  </li>
            <li> If only soaking the soap for less than 5 minutes leaves the soap super soft, I can only imagine that the puck would be completely dissolved after 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> I know how to lather and have used other soaps that I liked very much, and even usually re-lather half way through shaving.</li>
            <li> I first got the product I attempted to melt it into a 250ml mason jar which I use to store all my other shave soaps.</li>
            <li> Follow the tips on other reviews of soaking the bar in hot water then ditch the water</li>
            <li> I tried using different amounts of water, wetting the soap first, wetting my face or leaving it dry but nothing made any difference.</li>
            <li> It has 2 minor issues: It takes a bit longer to lather and you may need to reapply a bit more often than other soaps, especially during the dry winter months.</li>
            <li> I have used the Van Der Hagen cake soap &amp; Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender Shaving Cream ... until I found Williams mug soap in a local CVS Pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I smelled like a citronella candle apparently to my girl.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that dries out easily -- especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> VERY &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; not much lather &amp; smells &amp;#34;old mannish&amp;#34; not for me.</li>
            <li> I left the new puck in the mug saturating with plenty of water overnight and drained the excess water the next day.</li>
            <li> This soap is not very easy to lather at first</li>
            <li> Got to me very late, but the product is hard to find, and it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Despite what the manufacturer and other reviewers have stated, in my experience, this soap dries extremely fast.</li>
            <li> It makes a rich, thick lather and helps me shave.</li>
            <li> What you might not read in other reviews is that the soap, razor, etc. is perhaps less important than how you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently noticed however this specific brand is carried by some of my local big box and drug stores, so if you&#x27;re really concerned you might swing by the shaving aisle next time</li>
            <li> I have recently went back old school when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> Since I have gone back to the double edge razor I believe my shaving cost has dropped considerably.</li>
            <li> It does not dry on your face.</li>
            <li> There are worse out there - but definitely not the best/my favorite.</li>
            <li> Lather up moving the brush around the bowl a few times, then reverse direction a few times, continue this until you get the lather you desire, then enjoy!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone looking for a unique shaving experience that is sick of paying so much for canned and brand named shaving creams that do not even work nearly as well as this classic cake of soap.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried one other brand, but this one works very well.  </li>
            <li> The puck will last you quite a long time, and will lather nicely on your face, but does not hold as thick a lather as other shaving soaps I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I started DE shaving less than two weeks ago, so I am certainly a new-bee to all this.  </li>
            <li> The men would lay back in the green trimmed leather barber&#x27;s chairs with hot towels wrapped on their faces,  an occasional toot of steam came up as they made small talk with the barber about fish or local happenings while the barber in his white smock whipped up a hot mug of Williams shaving soap into a high peak froth before dotting it all over their faces.  </li>
            <li> I was very let down.  </li>
            <li> Because the Williams puck is so hard, even after the puck has softened with a use or two and has been pressed into the bowl (after the puck has been wet and softened) like a suction cup, it tends to slide in the bottom of the bowl as I swirl my brush;  so this can be remedied by using a bit of coarse sandpaper to slightly rough up the center of the bowl bottom, which gives the puck a good surface to which it can adhere.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry out in the time it takes me to complete a shaving pass</li>
            <li> One of the disadvantages of living in a relatively small town is that many things are not available.</li>
            <li> I only add water to the puck for the first few shaves out of the box; after that, I don&#x27;t find it necessary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was my first foray into the world of shaving soap as opposed to shaving cream or oil which i&#x27;ve used for the last few years.  </li>
            <li> no matter how much or little water I used, and no matter how much time I spent, I simply can&#x27;t get a decent lather from this soap.  </li>
            <li> It produces lots of lather and does it quickly, quicker than any other shave soap I&#x27;ve used, with less time swirling with the brush.</li>
            <li> all over.the shave was close,but no cushion at all, ive gotten one of the most irritating shaves ever in 25 years,it also may be due to my sensitive skin and logically,its not meant for everybody.so ill stick to my favorite proraso and art of shaving...</li>
            <li> Lathers very well- use a little extra water on the brush.  </li>
            <li> but i have found it a little difficult to get up the lather i need to get a good shave.  </li>
            <li> Giving a product a bad review simply because you can&#x27;t figure it out, isn&#x27;t fair to the manufacturer of the product and actually misleads potential future consumers, so before criticizing williams, please read this and try the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has an OK lather, not very dense, not altogether slick, but a descent lather none the less.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars for quality, minus one star as the small size and need for water lead to relatively quick replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> 5 stars for quality, minus one star as the small size and need for water lead to relatively quick replacements.    </li>
            <li> So I have rated Williams three stars because of the inherent drying quality of soap and its adequate but not superior lather.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin folks I would try other products.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy like some other soaps or creams.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of shaving soap for a good fifty years and was recently disappointed to find it was no longer stocked locally.</li>
            <li> it tightens the skin a little bit, but that is normal makes shaving easier.</li>
            <li> One suggestion I have found helpful by reading other reviews it to add a little hot water in you</li>
            <li> For crying out loud!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple.. 3 small triple-milled pucks.. with a small downcline to its logo (cute.. also VERY VERY functional as loading brushes up the stuff doesn&#x27;t get as messy as other soaps.. it stays contained in the center of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> -4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly this is real old-fashioned, small, triple-milled soap.  </li>
            <li> The big pluses for this product are the price and the fact that it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Seems like it is also long lasting.</li>
            <li> I think a cake would last a long time.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t lather up and stay long enough for me to finish a shave.</li>
            <li> If your skin is sensitive or dry, you may want to look at pre-shave balms or other soaps that are glyerin-based.</li>
            <li> The cake will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I saw this soap marked at $4 and change on amazon, and again for less than a buck.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry your face no matter if you only shave once or 3 times(for</li>
            <li> Having tried multiple methods of lathering, including soaking the puck in water, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t provide a very smooth lather, and takes a long time to build anything other than a thin, bubbly mess.</li>
            <li> Took one star away because the bar was a little smaller than other brands we&#x27;ve used, so the cheaper price didn&#x27;t feel like as much of a steel as expected.</li>
            <li> Left skin very dry &amp; irritated.  </li>
            <li> Also, it does not dry my skin like other soaps do.    </li>
            <li> The only way Williams will dry on your face is if it takes you fifteen minutes to make a single pass.  </li>
            <li> It dried on my face too fast and left little cushion for the blade to glide.</li>
            <li> I mean no disrespect, but life is too short to not have a decent, luxurious shave in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Again, I find that you get what you pay for in life and this was lousy but cheap.</li>
            <li> found this wording on an old J.B. Williams ad : &amp;#34;The use of soap in shaving is to penetrate, moisten, and soften the beard that it may present the least possible resistance to the keen edge of the razor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has a smaller diameter than my Old Spice mug.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 3-pass wet shaver and have no problem creating enough lather to get the job done.</li>
            <li> but whats expected with a low price.</li>
            <li> If the lather is drying on your face, you&#x27;re either taking too long to shave (&amp;#62;5 minutes a pass) or you&#x27;re not splashing water on your face before applying the lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different shaving soaps, some of them very, very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I do appreciate your new policy of allowing add-on purchases of small, single item products.</li>
            <li> I could sharpen it and use it but can&#x27;t get it sharp enough.</li>
            <li> In the meantime, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try other soaps such as Col. Conks, Proraso and the RazoRock line.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap at a local Hy-Vee after my other soap ran out.</li>
            <li> I had to keep applying it during the course of my shave which I don&#x27;t have to do with the other above</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t wreck it during a shave that won&#x27;t dry out your face or your wallet, nor overpower your cologne.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it smells manly.</li>
            <li> Instead mill it by using a grater/zester, pouring water in the container of the milled soap and smoothing it in, pouring the water out, and letting it dry over night.</li>
            <li> Might as well shave dry.  </li>
            <li> I am relatively new to wet shaving deciding six months ago to give it a try because I was spending a small fortune on razor blades.</li>
            <li> Some might love this smell, but to me it&#x27;s unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Not highly scented but functions as soap should.</li>
            <li> I will  be buying more as it is almost impossible to find in stores</li>
            <li> As I mentioned earlier, I use a small plastic bowl (5\\&quot; diameter, 2\\&quot; deep), not a mug.  </li>
            <li> I use a $2 black plastic salsa bowl that I picked up at a big box store</li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like is the slight residue it leave on my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> BUT this soap is just average as a shaving soap due the fact that the lather does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Lubricates the skin and stand and softens any thick facial hair, long and or short growth.</li>
            <li> However, I was shocked when I saw this same exact product at my local CVS for $1.79 last night.</li>
            <li> I then apply the wet brush to the dry puck and within a few minutes have enough thick, creamy lather to complete a three pass shave.</li>
            <li> , does well with a wet brush.  </li>
            <li> wet shaving is a hobby for me, and I try lots of soaps...</li>
            <li> This soap is a tallow based soap so it will be finicky to lather with harder water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really want a bunch of perfume in my lather, it&#x27;s really unnecessary because I use a shave lotion afterward anyway.</li>
            <li> You would have to be mentally impaired to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> harder to get going).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Produces a generous lather with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> Been wet shaving about a year now and like it.</li>
            <li> The lather itself wasn&#x27;t the longest lasting, it dried faster than Arko and Proraso, but did outlast the glycerin based Col. Conks.</li>
            <li> wet the puck and let soak for a couple of minutes, pour out the excess water, then take a damp brush to it.</li>
            <li> You will end up with a lather that is thick and will last you an hour if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have always gotten pretty bad razor burn from this product regardless of blade types used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy with the classic unfortunate combination of sensitive skin and a relatively thick beard growth, for whom it may concern.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- dirty cheap, can&#x27;t mess that up</li>
            <li> You get a small (1.75oz) shaving puck in a simple cardboard pack, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Save your money for other things.</li>
            <li> P.S. Be careful with shipping!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say this contributes to the quality of the shave other than the fact that I am using a brush.  </li>
            <li> Then I drain the water from the mug, shake off the excess water from the brush and proceed to shave like I do with any other soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other shaving soaps, and none seem to do as well as Williams.</li>
            <li> I like the other reviewer&#x27;s disclaimer - &amp;#34;beware</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works well and lasts longer other shaving soaps I have tried</li>
            <li> Was looking into DE shaving due to continual irritation and razor burn issues with cartridge shavers.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and could not find it at the local stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the key is letting a small amount of water soak in to soften up the soap.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t totally wasted the money and had at least gotten a few decent showers with the pucks I had purchased.  </li>
            <li> There was little to no cushion which made for a rough glide.</li>
            <li> My face felt a little dry and tight, but that could be my fault as I&#x27;m still learning.</li>
            <li> It lathers easier and with less soap than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The lather that your brush creates on your face stays thick waiting for your blade to be wet unlike other brands which either never developed a head or thinned out as soon as you put the brush down.</li>
            <li> but the lather was different, not nearly as effective..</li>
            <li> I shave about one-two times per week on average and this soap has hasted me since January</li>
            <li> It will take you a few tries to learn how to use it, but once you do you will be rewarded.</li>
            <li> I finally had a thick lather in the bristles of my brush.</li>
            <li> and I had no problem getting a good lather, but even after a month I just couldn&#x27;t get past smelling like mosquito repellent.</li>
            <li> I have a Van Der Hagen shave soap I got from Walmart for 2 bucks that trumps this product hands down.</li>
            <li> Finally...but...the shave was no less irritating.</li>
            <li> As other comments state, a few drops of water before you shower will prep the soap for lather.</li>
            <li> and you will probably find this soap for $1.50 or less.</li>
            <li> I use this to make a uber lather typically.</li>
            <li> Work hard to lather and it will dry up before you can pick up your razor and go to it.</li>
            <li> Because I was new and thought i was doing something wrong</li>
            <li> a little over a month ago.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey for the size, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Too little on the brush you say?</li>
            <li> After I was all done, my face felt a little itchy, and my chest skin feels a little itchy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little brown poison lizard hiding at the end of a store shelf, daring you to nibble it with its price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take a little practice working up a lather</li>
            <li> It has a distinctive \\&quot;man-smell\\&quot;, a little bit like medicine.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for mug and brush shaving for a few months.</li>
            <li> It as well feels like it dried out my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it dried out in record time.</li>
            <li> But this soap dried out before I even finished one section of my face.</li>
            <li> I asked a few guys</li>
            <li> The blade still found a way to irritate my skin and leave my face feeling dried and burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It became unavailable on shelves for shaving products so he had to go to aerosol cans with soap and disliked them.</li>
            <li> Reading a few reviews today on a shaving forum, I discovered that others who have found this soap to be inadequate to shave with, have used it as a soap bar in the shower.  </li>
            <li> at soften the soap a bit a few minutes before you shave.</li>
            <li> , the suds definitely dried out after about 1 minute on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Put a few drops of water on the soap before you get into the shower.  </li>
            <li> But you will soon curse your wasted dollar for even being subjected to this hockey puck.</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought a few of this product for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this and gave it a whirl a few nights ago.</li>
            <li> Only the cheapest of bargain motels provide soap this poor for shaving.  </li>
            <li> It does leave behind slick skin for second pass</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting a lather built up with this soap in the past.</li>
            <li> HERE IS WHEN YOU WILL REMEMBER TIME SLOW DOWN</li>
            <li> All of the negative reviews on this product boil down to operator error.</li>
            <li> Previously, I attributed it to the hard water in my area.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been unable to get this as any of the drug or grocery stores near me.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving with blades for longer than I care to remember; first with double-edged razors, then Pal injectors, then with stupid Trac razors (never progressing past twin blades cause anything after that is a marketing rip-off -- back in the day</li>
            <li> The soap rinses off my skin with very little effort.  </li>
            <li> There were a few people who had a hard time with the smell</li>
            <li> The value is lessened a bit when you combine the small puck and the water-soak method, but you still get a lot of bang for your buck (</li>
            <li> This soap is unbelievable....</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> After trying multiple shaves with the same result I got disgusted and threw what was left away.</li>
            <li> THEN after the puck has softened, press it into place and let it set overnight -- no more</li>
            <li> Lots of slick lather that lasts.</li>
            <li> My personal experience is that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to lather well.</li>
            <li> Williams adopted this talent from small reptiles:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small for my mug too.  </li>
            <li> Besides look at the price, I do not understand why people are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and shave daily.</li>
            <li> The difference between badger and boar is very small in my experience, probably not significant to any</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell bad and ive been using this same bar for the past 2 months shaving with it every other day, and i still should get another month out of it.</li>
            <li> You eventually might not love it, but at least you&#x27;ll have a functional soap when you decide it&#x27;s not for you.</li>
            <li> deb hard to get here</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this is a hard cake soap</li>
            <li> Hard to beat.</li>
            <li> it stayed hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard bar of soap which by</li>
            <li> Hard</li>
            <li> and this was hard to lather up</li>
            <li> It does not give a very thick lather and what does come up dried on my face before I had finished shaving one side.</li>
            <li> Never have I worked so hard to form such a disappointing lather.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been around for ages, and for that reason alone I at least give it some respect.</li>
            <li> Too tiny and innocuous to defend themselves and yet dangerous to even bite once.</li>
            <li> Some hate the smell, I happen to really like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very slick and protects my face.</li>
            <li> Small cake, poor lubrication.  </li>
            <li> I want to begin saying that this product,while for others may be suitable,for me has been a bad experience,after only 2 shaves with this soap,my face burns with redness</li>
            <li> It dried on my face, made strokes uncomfortable and ended up tearing up my neck.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really pleasant either.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a small thing but makes it difficult to store and travel with it.</li>
            <li> The icing on this steaming pile is the weak lemon-afterthought smell it puts off like a warning.</li>
            <li> Also, time and time again the lather was weak and thin.</li>
            <li> The lather was thick, and smelled faintly of citronella and bar soap.</li>
            <li> A world of difference from poor canned substitutes.</li>
            <li> But you could do much worse.</li>
            <li> The lather is still thin and the shave irritating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no great mystery to it</li>
            <li> I also found the smell Irritating.  </li>
            <li> That other soap comes in a plastic tub which is way worse for the environment (like the aerosol cans, also really bad for the environment).</li>
            <li> I got the WORST razor burn using this shaving soap (using a new blade)!   </li>
            <li> That seems awfully ridiculous!</li>
            <li> The lather on Williams is just plain bad.</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive imported stuff online.    </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it took for ever to get to my mail box.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to be a bit difficult to lather as well.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used it 5 times and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is difficult to describe.</li>
            <li> Sorry to those of you who prefer to smell like roses.</li>
            <li> I even like the vaguely citrus scent that it leaves on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have since found that it was my technique that was flawed.</li>
            <li> Either way, once again, you&#x27;re doing it wrong if you have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other stuff is terrible.  </li>
            <li> Work well in cold water too.</li>
            <li> This stuff lathers like crazy and is a lot simpler to lather than a lot of the tutorials I see online.</li>
            <li> NO MORE CANNED CRAP FOR ME, ANYMORE!!!!</li>
            <li> Not at all unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> But Amazon advertising this at $4.00 a cake is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Now on to the bad...</li>
            <li> Even then, I ended up with a bad shave and cuts everywhere, and a lot of blood (that&#x27;s where the title of my review came from, haw haw).</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t say that it smells bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been disappointed after each test.</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!!!</li>
            <li> The soap took and inordinate amount of time to lather, an annoyingly inordinate amount of time to lather.</li>
            <li> If you hate the stick, cut the thing up and mold it into a puck.</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I hate it</li>
            <li> I hate it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re rubbing your face with insect repellent.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it smells terrible (to me).</li>
            <li> This is, without any doubt, the world&#x27;s worst soap.  </li>
            <li> It is drying, it smells terrible, and it doesn&#x27;t lubricate.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in a mug, and it does not get smelly or nasty.</li>
            <li> I had the worst razor burn of my life and it felt as if i used lye soap to do the job.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> , the scent is god awful.</li>

            <li> This stuff is great! My husbands face is softer after shaving, and he smells so good ðŸ˜˜</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t create much lather. It does leave behind slick skin for second pass</li>
            <li> Very Creamy Lather,Nice Fragrance,Lathers up quickly,gives a Much Better  Shave,,I LOve the Smoothness it gives my Parker Safety Razor Model 99a,I would recommend  this  Shaving Soap to anyone that wants a Nice Close Shave</li>
            <li> It is good. Priced right..</li>
            <li> Good. Just be nice to get a good straight razor to go with it. Have one but it&#x27;s not what I expected I both the razor at magic mart thinking I could sharpen it and use it but can&#x27;t get it sharp enough.</li>
            <li> Clogs multi-blade razors such as Fusion. I had to throw the blades away after two shaves. Switched to Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap which is cheaper, get a much better shave and blades last two months.</li>
            <li> The shaving soap is fine, though there are other creams I prefer. However, I was shocked when I saw this same exact product at my local CVS for $1.79 last night. This is one of the few times I have not found a better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only shaving soap my husband uses.  When it came time to buy more, the stores around here in TX did not carry it and we found it on Amazon.com.  He says the closest, smoothest shave is with soap and brush and I agree.</li>
            <li> simple product filling simple need at low cost; what else is there to say ?</li>
            <li> What a rip-off!!! I ordered 10 bars and was too hasty to \\&quot;order\\&quot; --the shipping on about 1 lb is $40?!!!!! For crying out loud!! Boycot this company. They are not treating customers fairly!</li>
            <li> Willians Mug Shaving Soap can be gotten at most local pharmacies, so try looking around before you pay shipping. The product just broadcasts tradition, with no-nonsense packaging. You get a small (1.75oz) shaving puck in a simple cardboard pack, and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m just begining to learn \\&quot;real\\&quot; shaving with a shave soap, and I started out practicing my lathering technique using a disposable razor and a [[ASIN:B000G647Y8 Tweezerman Men&#x27;s Shaving Brush]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first effort, I hadn&#x27;t yet learned how Williams requires a little more hot water than most soaps. I still built up a lather to equal or beat anything I&#x27;ve ever gotten out of a can, although it wasn&#x27;t as fluffy as a good lather should be. The lather was thick, and smelled faintly of citronella and bar soap. My face was well-protected, and there was plenty of foam left for multiple lathers. The lather rinsed off cleanly and with no effort at all- a quick splash of water and there was no residue. My face felt a little dry and tight, but that could be my fault as I&#x27;m still learning. A quick splash of aftershave, and my girlfriend was delighted at the smoothness of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the full experience, I&#x27;ve learned to follow an old technique and soak the puck in a mug full of steaming hot water along with my brush while I do my pre-shave prep. Pour out the mug into the rinse water, and then build lather on the softened puck. This leads to a shorter life for the pick, but since Williams is dirt-cheap, that&#x27;s not a big concern. Used with plenty of water, I&#x27;ve found that Williams fluffs up beautifully. The value is lessened a bit when you combine the small puck and the water-soak method, but you still get a lot of bang for your buck (almost literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to call Williams Mug Shaving Soap my starter soap. I got the closest shave of my life, and the bulk of the cutting and irritation that I got is surely my own fault. I was reviewing a new disposable during my initial shave on top of being unfamiliar with the method. My face feels fresher and cleaner than it has in a long time, and although I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll purchase more expensive soaps for special occasions, I can see Williams being my mainstay soap for a long time to come. It&#x27;s hard to believe there&#x27;s such a perfect soap for such a small price. Highly recommended to shavers of all experience levels. 5 stars for quality, minus one star as the small size and need for water lead to relatively quick replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: It&#x27;s been over a month since I started with Williams, and I&#x27;m still working on the same puck of soap despite using the soak method and shaving pretty much daily. However, I still feel like Williams doesn&#x27;t tend to give the most luxurious foam. Again, great workhorse, but I&#x27;ll definitely be getting a more expensive model in my cabinet as an occasional treat.the method.

            <li> I tried the Conk&#x27;s but this was just as good and even washes off without any residue.  Has a real \\&quot;He Man\\&quot; smell to it too. With this soap and the cheap Burma Shave brush you&#x27;ll be all set to go. Save your money for other things.</li>
            <li> Lathers very well- use a little extra water on the brush.  Shaves smooth.  Smells great.  A simple but very effective product- much better than most ridiculously priced soaps out there- it will leave you felling great.  My favorite- including creams.  Do yourself a favor though- check out a local drugstore and you will probably find this soap for $1.50 or less.</li>
            <li> Good product and prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. It has not scent and lathers well. I had tried 2 other products and this is the best. I just ordered 3 more bars, so I hope I live that long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap.  it smells like a cross between a urinal cake and lemon pez.  the lather isnt that good but it&#x27;s usable.</li>
            <li> I have used the Van Der Hagen cake soap &amp; Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender Shaving Cream ... until I found Williams mug soap in a local CVS Pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I&#x27;ve come to prefer Williams and have switched to it exclusively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I does take a little more hot water and work to get a good lather, but I get a great straight razor shave with it, it doesn&#x27;t dry out in the time it takes me to complete a shaving pass and I really like the smell.  It&#x27;s sort of a clean, old-time soapy smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower my after shave balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say:  it&#x27;s inexpensive, it works well, you get a great shave and it leaves you with a nice, clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the old time barbers used to use it to condition their leather strops too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget all the pricey, fancy creams ... this is all you need!!</li>
            <li> Makes a decent lather and has a great smell.</li>
            <li> so far im loving it. deff worth the buy however i found this at local drug stores for $.99 so look around before you buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old and new to DE shaving, so not a veteran like some of the reviewers who have posted.  I&#x27;ve tried TOBS and Van Der Hagen soaps, both of which, are great soaps.  While I was in the local drug store I saw this product sitting the the shelf and thought, &amp;#34;What the heck, give it a try!&amp;#34;  What a great soap!  This is the &amp;#34;slickest&amp;#34; soap I&#x27;ve used so far.  I have no problem building a nice thick peaking lather from this soap, so don&#x27;t understand why others are having such difficulty doing so.  As far as the smell goes, you&#x27;re not going to smell like you just jumped out of a rose bush while burning incense, but at the same time it&#x27;s not offensive to me either.  The soap rinses off my skin with very little effort.  This is an excellent shave soap and given the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I will definitely be buying more!  Update -- It&#x27;s been a couple of years since my prior comments on this soap.  Since then I&#x27;ve purchased a straight razor and it has been my daily shaver!  I still use my Merkur 34C DE razor for touch-ups.  In the meantime, I&#x27;ve had the opportunity to try other soaps such as Col. Conks, Proraso and the RazoRock line.  While there are many fine soaps that will get the job done, you won&#x27;t find any better soap at this price point that will give you a better shave.  None of the soaps I&#x27;ve tried so far do a better job of protecting your face or cushioning your blade.  After all the others, this remains my favorite shaving soap!!</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 years before trying the more moisture rich creams by Proraso, Erasmic, Speick and the like. I have very sensitive skin and have always gotten pretty bad razor burn from this product regardless of blade types used. To me this product feels like nothing more than plain old soap lathered on the face.   For sensitive skin folks I would try other products.    For folks with non-sensitive skin this product may work well for you. The big pluses for this product are the price and the fact that it lasts a long time. In a 2 year period I have used less than half of the bar making this a great money saving item.</li>
            <li> Excellent stuff, goes to prove the you don&#x27;t need to spend an arm and a leg to get something decent. You can&#x27;t argue with the price, lasts a while and, even better, locally available. The scent is somewhat soapy and will leave you smelling clean and won&#x27;t interfere with your aftershave. Also, it does not dry my skin like other soaps do.    It has 2 minor issues: It takes a bit longer to lather and you may need to reapply a bit more often than other soaps, especially during the dry winter months. However, shaving in the shower takes care of those problems really good.    I&#x27;ve tried the expensive boutique soaps and can&#x27;t find a good reason why I should spend several times more for, technically, the same thing. I mean, it&#x27;s a bar of soap, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, does it well, it&#x27;s locally available, and cheap.     It will take you a few tries to learn how to use it, but once you do you will be rewarded. No need to buy expensive imported stuff online.    The most important things, at least in the beginning, are to use really hot water, LOTS of soap, a stiff boar brush, and it works best when you face lather rather than lathering it in a bowl.    P.S. Be careful with shipping! I experimented with shipping to see if what the other reviewer said was right and they want to charge you 40 bucks to ship 10 bars. You can find this locally.</li>
            <li> I say this is a gateway soap because it can quite possibly the most common soap found almost anywhere.  I made the switch from aerosol to brush &amp; mug a little over a month ago.  It has an OK lather, not very dense, not altogether slick, but a descent lather none the less.  It has a classic scent, I&#x27;d liken it to being very similar to IVORY soap, but with a hint of masculinity to it.  It lathers fairly quickly, LOVES water, that&#x27;s for sure, does well with a wet brush.  Leaves my face feeling very clean, and refreshed.  I can&#x27;t say this contributes to the quality of the shave other than the fact that I am using a brush.  I&#x27;ve yet to obtain my Merkur Classic 34C, but it&#x27;s on the way, I can&#x27;t wait to try it.  I am using a mach 3 for the moment, but practicing technique early.  I lather once, and go with the grain, then once again against.  I have gotten the closest shave I have ever had doing it this way.  The brush I use is a run of the mill boar brush which I prefer because of its exfoliating properties.  Many people pinch their badger brushes when lathering onto the face, but you don&#x27;t really need to do so w. a boar.  The advantage is in water retention and softess, but if I am exfoliating, I wouldn&#x27;t use rose petals.  In all, it&#x27;s a very nice soap, and for the price, it&#x27;s a keeper. I saw this soap marked at $4 and change on amazon, and again for less than a buck.  I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re a fool if you pay more than $1.50 for a puck.  Very good soap, very simple and subtle, and an excellent soap to begin the traditional wet shave.  I have nothing to compare it to because I&#x27;m a newbie at the traditional ways, but I do know there&#x27;s better out there.  In the end, this soap won&#x27;t disappoint.  I have sensitive skin &amp; this soap is not a negative factor in that regard.  I gave it 4 stars out of respect for its longevity in the market and as a thank you for being out there as the last bastian of mug &amp; brush shaving it seems.</li>
            <li> Pretty basic but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I think this shave soap works ok but I don&#x27;t really care much for the smell.  It&#x27;s not a terrible smell but it&#x27;s not really pleasant either.  It is indeed a very soapy smell much like Ivory bar soap I think.  It will build a decent lather and in turn give you a pretty good shave.  I think you could use a bar soap and get just as good of results probably.</li>
            <li> After having problems with a credit card that was being tried to use fraudently, we canceled credit card and reordered with new one.  After that no problem with delivery and my husband is very happy to find a supplier for the soap.</li>
            <li> I have a very tough beard and shave daily. I have tried several shaving soaps and creams from well known internationals and Williams gives as good a shave as any at a fraction of the cost. My beard is so tough that even the best multi-blade razors with lubricant strips dont last a few days. The Williams soap has a fresh smell, works up a good lather with little soap and brush dipped in hot water. I am 57 yrs and the soap takes me back to the days when stick and cup soaps were the only ones available.  The soap is available at CVS stores and online for $1.50 only. WIll be taking back some with me to India.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and the recipient said it works well. Not highly scented but functions as soap should.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience using a shaving soap bar and I&#x27;m glad I started with Williams. I didn&#x27;t want to overspend on some of the higher priced ones, so I picked Williams. They have make a quality product since 1840. Although the J.B. Williams Company was sold to Nabisco in 1971, they still make this historic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this wording on an old J.B. Williams ad : &amp;#34;The use of soap in shaving is to penetrate, moisten, and soften the beard that it may present the least possible resistance to the keen edge of the razor&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> The scent of Williams shaving soap conjures memories of going to the barbershop with my Dad back in the 60&#x27;s; there were 4 or 5 chairs lined up in a row each having a razor strop used to hone the strait blades to a surgical edge.  The men would lay back in the green trimmed leather barber&#x27;s chairs with hot towels wrapped on their faces,  an occasional toot of steam came up as they made small talk with the barber about fish or local happenings while the barber in his white smock whipped up a hot mug of Williams shaving soap into a high peak froth before dotting it all over their faces.  I didn&#x27;t shave my face then but after the barber cut my hair he&#x27;d spread hot lather and shave above my ears and the back of my neck and I&#x27;d smell it all day; it is just one of those subtle but pleasant aromas that makes you feel good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for mug and brush shaving for a few months. This soap performs as well or better than many I have tried. This is my regular shaving soap now. Using a badger brush on this with good technique gives a great shave. I have used this in both cartridge and safety razor shaving and have no complaints. Do yourself a favor, keep an open mind and enjoy this right-priced shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I moved to trying this out from the Omega shaving cream in a bowl. This lathers on so much better, is warmer going on, and when combined with a feather blade has been my best shave ever in my life. I used to only be able to shave twice a week due to irritation, but this has helped complete things so I can now shave daily for the first time ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much water in there or you&#x27;ll be clearing our more soap bubbles than lather for a bit.</li>
            <li> A world of difference from poor canned substitutes. Good, lasting lather that is complection friendly, non-drying, and no petro-chemical or alcohol (no-no&#x27;s) ingredients. Only 4 out of five for no fancy-schmanzy sandal wood oil frangrance. At this price i&#x27;ll take it.</li>
            <li> This may not be the best shaving soap you can buy, but it is certainly the best value! I&#x27;m a 3-pass wet shaver and have no problem creating enough lather to get the job done. This soap provides plent of cushion and slickness to protect my skin. You could spend more for a &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; soap, but why?</li>
            <li> This Williams Soap Puck is great product and easy to use. Lathers  nicely and quickly softens my whiskers. I&#x27;m glad I bought a few of them. Unfortunately it took for ever to get to my mail box.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations based on some of the reviews. Ultimately, I found it difficult to get a good lather. It can get very bubbly if you use too much water. I found my best shave was by using less water to get a thicker lather, which clogged the razor somewhat. Either way, it dries a little too quickly and regardless of how you use it, it just doesn&#x27;t provide much glide for the razor as it goes over your skin. On the plus side, its dirt cheap and lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have to say that Williams is a wonderful soap to shave with.  I used a far more soap before and it was alright but this soap is very nice, it takes a little longer to lather but other than that is awesome.  It is easy to find, very inexpensive and is a great soap for sensitive skin.  I also love the scent of this soap, it has a nice, clean scent to it that won&#x27;t cloy the scent of your aftershave or cologne.  Plus it won&#x27;t dry out and it lubricates your face very well.</li>
            <li> love his manly shave with a brush shave thx deb hard to get here</li>
            <li> This soap is unbelievable.... I love to shave with it.  I have many soaps. I decided to try this one, but the first two pucks I purchased ended up in the trash. I just simply could not get good lather, so I gave up after many attempts. But Williams soap pops up every time you&#x27;d do a search online for shaving soaps. As you see here, there&#x27;s a whole lot of discussion and opinions about it. I love a challenge, so I decided to give this soap one more try.  This soap takes a lot of water. I left the new puck in the mug saturating with plenty of water overnight and drained the excess water the next day. Prior to my daily shave, I fill the mug with hot water (I heat up the water if my tap water isn&#x27;t hot enough) and leave my brush soaking in it while I shower. Then I drain the water from the mug, shake off the excess water from the brush and proceed to shave like I do with any other soap. I now get an amazing shave with this soap every time. The lather is rich, creamy, peaky and lasting. It&#x27;s very slick and protects my face. It gives me enough lather for 3, 4, and even 5 passes if I wanted to. I love that old-fashioned smell. This soap is really a great soap. I&#x27;m so glad to have tried it again.</li>
            <li> I gave it a good old college try. The smell although; I couldn&#x27;t get over the smell. I smelled like a citronella candle apparently to my girl. It also seemed to be a bit difficult to lather as well. It as well feels like it dried out my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it. It was cheap. I didn&#x27;t like it. Oh well. Trash it went.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;^ Awesome 12:15AM review.</li>
            <li> This shaving soap is good quality, and low price.  It could make a thicker lather, however and I feel that would make it a little better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at a local Hy-Vee after my other soap ran out. This soap does not have a lasting lather as it boasts. It does not give a very thick lather and what does come up dried on my face before I had finished shaving one side. Others seem to have great things to say about it, but I will not be buying this soap again. On the positive side, the smell is nice. It&#x27;s not overly flowery and perfume laden.</li>
            <li> I got the WORST razor burn using this shaving soap (using a new blade)!   Got a better shave using a bottle of conditioner.   I shave with a Merkur de safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just say it right off the bat. There are better soaps out there. You will pay much more for them but this is not the greatest shaving soap on the market. For the very modest price, though, you do get a pretty good soap. It is a tricky animal but once tamed it offers a very nice shave. It is a much more thirsty soap than most will be used to. I found myself using far more water to get a good lather than with any other soap I own. Give it a good soak before you use it and don&#x27;t be shy adding water to your lather and you&#x27;ll be rewarded with a very nice shave. I can find this locally for about a dollar and at that price you get a pretty decent soap. Isn&#x27;t the best out there? No. But you could do much worse.</li>
            <li> I was researching for a quality soap that is cheap and effective for my first time experience. Although I do not have other soap to compare to, Williams soap is certainly a good soap to start. Maybe you will stay with it forever like many of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand of shaving soap for a good fifty years and was recently disappointed to find it was no longer stocked locally. The soap is relatively odor-free and has a nice non-greasy lather. Of all the soaps I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> good, cheap shaving soap...wet shaving is a hobby for me, and I try lots of soaps...this is a great basic choice!</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found for a shave soap with natural ingredients. It helps with a close shave and leaves skin feeling soft. My husband likes it, and I used it on my legs once and liked it too. It smells nice - just a clean, fresh smell, not too fragrant. Took one star away because the bar was a little smaller than other brands we&#x27;ve used, so the cheaper price didn&#x27;t feel like as much of a steel as expected. That said, it&#x27;s a good product and would buy again when I&#x27;m on a budget.</li>
            <li> Good price - Good product.....</li>
            <li> This soap is great. I just switched to a safety razor and now enjoy shaving using my Mercur razor, my badger brush and Williams soap.This soap lathers up,smells great and protects the skin. Seems like it is also long lasting. Buy this soap.</li>
            <li> I read some good reviews on this and decided to try it. I was pretty disappointed. First of all, the soap smells like really strong bug spray. I hoped that it would smell different after I lathered up, but it just made my face smell like bug spray. Also, it dried out in record time. I know how to lather and have used other soaps that I liked very much, and even usually re-lather half way through shaving. But this soap dried out before I even finished one section of my face. This product is very inexpensive, but unfortunately it is not too good to be true. Spend a couple of extra dollars for a better shaving soap. When you&#x27;re putting a blade across your skin, you need something of quality to lubricate and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Smells clean and good. Makes a good lather. My husband really likes this. I would recommend. It is a little smaller in diameter than some shaving soaps and really fits best in a mug, not the wooden bowls made for shaving soap....</li>
            <li> Firstly a shaving soap bar like this will last you a while, I&#x27;m talking months to a year(if you don&#x27;t shave every day). Right there is enough reason to get this. Compared to a shaving cream, those foam cans or anything else out there, you will not find anything besides not shaving that will save you more money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell it has can be described as the smell you would expect from a well groomed and dressed man in the 1920&#x27;s. Its manly yet clean. The scent doesn&#x27;t really cling to your face so it won&#x27;t conflict with any cologne and if you want some of that clean manly goodness then just take some of the un-lathered soap and massage it into your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this comes in a box and requires either a shaving mug, bowl, or a sufficiently large cup to keep it in. Sure you can keep it in the box and lather in your hands but the box will eventually fall apart and it won&#x27;t look as good. The soap itself is extremely gentle and I could see myself using this into infinity, it doesn&#x27;t dry your face no matter if you only shave once or 3 times(for that super close shave some of us struggle with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Get this if you want something to put on your face so you don&#x27;t wreck it during a shave that won&#x27;t dry out your face or your wallet, nor overpower your cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly new at straight razor shaving and bought Williams mug to try out.&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather well and dries on my face, I&#x27;ve used it 5 times and was not impressed. Because I was new and thought i was doing something wrong I asked a few guys I know who use safety/straight razors and they confirmed that I try something else and that Williams mug soap doesn&#x27;t give a nice lather.&lt;br /&gt;I tried prorsoa soap and clonal conk and they lathered up nice and I enjoy my shave now. For a few bucks more I&#x27;d go with something else, this soap just didn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li> I have hard water, so getting a good lather seems to be more difficult to me. That said, the lather I do get from Williams soap is pretty good! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it smells manly.</li>
            <li> A nice and simple way to lather up with a brush. It makes a nice lather and is great if you are in a hurry. The cake will last a very long time. I use it when I don&#x27;t have time to fuss with lathering up a cream. I don&#x27;t care too much for the fragrance, though.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and I get good shaves with this. But you have to either shave fast or lather one side of your face at a time or the lather will be gone. I do the latter and it works fine.</li>
            <li> My husband uses a shaving mug with soap to shave.  He was out of the soap and I could not find any place to purchase more.  Found it on AMAZON!!  He was happy to get it!</li>
            <li> My dad introduced me to blade shaving using a mug and horse hair brush when I was 15... I am now almost 55 and for most if not all of those years, I have used Williams brand.  It&#x27;s great!&lt;BR&gt;I am so glad to find it online at Amazon. I bought 20 cakes when the only store I knew of that carried it was closing it out.  I wanted enough to get me through to retirement...I hope never to shave thereafter.</li>
            <li> It does not dry on your face. A little pricey for the size, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna preface this by saying that the soap does it&#x27;s job. It makes a rich, thick lather and helps me shave. In that regard, it does it&#x27;s job. However, maybe I got a bad piece of soap or maybe I just straight up don&#x27;t like the smell of this stuff, but it smells intense, and not in a good way. It&#x27;s the smell of mint and soap mixed together. While it does it&#x27;s job, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again because it smells terrible (to me).</li>
            <li> I love Williams Soap. It is inexpensive, but it is a good workhorse soap. It lathers up nicely, smells good, and is a slick soap that gives a nice cushion. I have two other, pricier soaps in my rotation, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> As others have noted, this is a hard cake soap so it&#x27;s best to put a bit of water on it first to soften it up.&lt;br /&gt;Then swirl your badger brush for a bit and taddaa! A wonderful light and airy lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have Prorasso and Vanderhagen soaps and honestly it&#x27;s a tossup as to which is best. Depends more on the mood I&#x27;m in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The super cheap price of William&#x27;s definitely makes it a Great Buy.</li>
            <li> I am not commenting on the quality of the soap. I just bought it a few hours ago - because I have a trip and wanted something cheap to travel with.  Well it was $1.75 at CVS for the penny pinchers out there...this might not be the deal you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Someone wanted my review on the soap - I give it an, OKAY in a pinch.  There are worse out there - but definitely not the best/my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is, without any doubt, the world&#x27;s worst soap.  It is drying, it smells terrible, and it doesn&#x27;t lubricate.  Life is too short to shave with this atrocity of a soap.  Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> One of the disadvantages of living in a relatively small town is that many things are not available. I had read about this soap on Amazon so when I saw it at a local store for $.98 I certainly wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is difficult to describe. I would say it&#x27;s sort of a hospital-like/disinfectant smell. Not unpleasant but a little sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used the soap I was encouraged. It produces lots of lather and does it quickly, quicker than any other shave soap I&#x27;ve used, with less time swirling with the brush. Then the problems began. Despite what the manufacturer and other reviewers have stated, in my experience, this soap dries extremely fast. I normally lather the right side of my face first (you have to start somewhere) then move to the left. By the time I had finished the left side, and before lathering my neck, the right side was almost completely dry. This rapid drying required reapplying the lather several times while shaving. I tried using different amounts of water, wetting the soap first, wetting my face or leaving it dry but nothing made any difference. After trying multiple shaves with the same result I got disgusted and threw what was left away. I was very disappointed. The soap was inexpensive and easy to obtain, I didn&#x27;t have to order it online, and based on how little it wore after several shaves I think a cake would last a long time. I really wanted it to work. Based on my experience, however, I couldn&#x27;t recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> I get it at Fred&#x27;s for $1. I wear friendly mutton chops, so all I shave is my chin and throat, but for that I use shave soap and an old safety razor. Good stuff for a buck and it smells really nice</li>
            <li> I was very let down.  It doesn&#x27;t lather well no matter how much water I use and it dries before I can finish one side.  It smells nice but it just doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> What  can a person say about a chunk of soap? It has a great smell, but not all perfume like, and it makes great lather in the mug. Good thick slickery lather that feels great. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> by at walgreens or CVS.  shipping was the price of almost 3 more of these...  soap is good though</li>
            <li> I started using Williams shaving soap when I began shaving at 15. My father used Williams, and so I followed suit. I&#x27;ve tried other shaving soaps, and none seem to do as well as Williams. For dedicated mug-and-brush shavers, this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this soap and the van der hagen. Out of the two so far I would use the van der hagen. This soap works and I picked it up at a local store. I can get it to lather alright. The problem is that it dries too quickly after applying. It seems like it has about 15 seconds, after using my brush, to shave with and then reapply. Otherwise I get razor burn. I just recently discovered that this is my problem with razor burn. As long as I reapply every quarter of my face before shaving or more frequently reapplying, the soap works fine. I would prefer a soap I can put on once or twice and shave my entire face though, so I will continue to look for something else.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase as promised and found the service very good. I will use this purchase again in the future when needed.</li>
            <li> Nice soap! Had no problem what so ever lathering it up. Didn&#x27;t even have to soak it for 30 minutes (as many insist). That seems awfully ridiculous! If only soaking the soap for less than 5 minutes leaves the soap super soft, I can only imagine that the puck would be completely dissolved after 30 minutes! Made a nice, super slippery lather perfect for shaving. If I can make a great lather with this, anyone can!&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of with this soap is the smell. I kid you not, this soap smells EXACTLY like a mosquito candle! It&#x27;s very off-putting. But it&#x27;s not going to keep me from getting this soap again!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a classic.  Makes a good lather if you work on it.  Lasts forever and is ridiculously cheap, which makes it very cost effective.</li>
            <li> Those three words sum up the main feature of the product.  It applies easily and I highly recommend it when applied with a good brush.</li>
            <li> Love Williams mug soap.  Use an Edwin Jagger, and an Escaline Badger brush.  Soap quickly works up a good, nice smelling lather.  I leave it in a mug, and it does not get smelly or nasty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Williams soap for many years. Hard to beat. Work well in cold water too. Cost me an arm and a leg to mail to Thailand but the soap was cheap! Recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time with super fancy scented import soaps.  The only way Williams will dry on your face is if it takes you fifteen minutes to make a single pass.  However, if you do love smelling like a garden in spring this stuff is not for you.  Warning though, after you use this shaving soap you will smell like a man.  Sorry to those of you who prefer to smell like roses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Good soap feels good and doesn&#x27;t dry out. Planning to buy this shave soap again very soon. . . .</li>
            <li> This is a very nice addition the the Ceramic shaving mug.  The soap fits in very nicely and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done quite a bit of testing with this product since I bought it and I&#x27;ve been disappointed after each test. First off, I will say that this product does have a nice smell. Reminds me a lot of ironing starch. Some hate the smell, I happen to really like it. Now on to the bad...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got the product I attempted to melt it into a 250ml mason jar which I use to store all my other shave soaps. I take the soaps out of their packaging (if it isn&#x27;t in a fancy dish already) place it in the mason jar, and microwave them for 30 seconds. For most of my soaps, they melt from a puck into a puddle and cool back into being hard as rock in a couple of hours ready to use. It&#x27;s quite convenient if I do say so myself. I can seal the containers preserving their smells and the containers stack nicely in my bathroom cabinet. However, Williams Mug Shaving Soap did not do this...it stayed hard as a rock. It&#x27;s high density and lack of glycerin (which aids in the other shave soaps easily melting) only caused problems from there forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial attempts to use the soap were in the the traditional sense where I run my damp boars brush along the surface and build the lather in my glazed ceramic bowl. The soap took and inordinate amount of time to lather, an annoyingly inordinate amount of time to lather. Also, time and time again the lather was weak and thin. It dried on my face too fast and left little cushion for the blade to glide. Too little on the brush you say? Ok, maybe so... so lets swirl the brush on the puck for a few more seconds. Nope, that didn&#x27;t work. The lather is still thin and the shave irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more I started thinking about it the more I began to believe that William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap belonged in exactly what the name states, a mug. So, in went the puck into one of my lovingly used mugs. A little warm water was added and I began whipping up the lather. This was the best progress I had so far. I finally had a thick lather in the bristles of my brush. Finally...but...the shave was no less irritating. The blade still found a way to irritate my skin and leave my face feeling dried and burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat. But, William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap lacks the one thing that makes a shave soap a success and that is glycerin. This shave soap is mainly soap without the lubricating properties the glycerin provides. I have a Van Der Hagen shave soap I got from Walmart for 2 bucks that trumps this product hands down. That is not to say that it is the best shave soap I own but if given the choice I would choose Van Der Hagen every time. Go ahead if you don&#x27;t believe me and try William&#x27;s Mug Shaving Soap, but I guarantee that you will find plenty of other shave soaps out there that will give you a much more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I run the water real hot and stir up a very hot comfortable lather.  The soap softens my beard so much better than the canned foam,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying out single-blade shaving as an alternative to cartridges.  This soap has a nice citrusy scent and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Found Williams shaving soap again.  I purchased it for my grandson, his grandpa used it for years before he passed away, My grandson found his shaving mug with a bit of soap and tried it, loved it. So I searched and found williams again on line. He has used it constantly since, sys he gets a better, smoother shave with it than the cans and it smells so clean and good, really don&#x27;t need aftershave.  (But he uses Old Spice, just like pappaw)  THank you for still being in business.</li>
            <li> Williams Mug Shaving Soap 1.75 oz  - Great lasting lather.  Clean soapy smell (like Ivory soap).  Does not strip my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price, great size and it smells like Ivory soap, which is always a classic scent. Leaves your skin soft, not dry and lather up very very quickly and well as very cleanly. Lubricates the skin and stand and softens any thick facial hair, long and or short growth. Long live Williams!!!!</li>
            <li> It is okay, not the best but does the job, not as moisturizing as other quality soaps, it does leave my face a bit on the dry side. Follow the tips on other reviews of soaking the bar in hot water then ditch the water and you&#x27;ll get a decent lather, however it takes longer to get a thicker air free lather and it dries quickly.For the price is good and it does the job.</li>
            <li> great lather, great smell and at the price I can&#x27;t think of a better product to get. I will  be buying more as it is almost impossible to find in stores</li>
            <li> I have used Williams soap almost exclusively since i made the transisiton from canned aerosol gels 5 years ago. The price savings and good results I have gotten from the soap has been satisfying for all this time. I even like the vaguely citrus scent that it leaves on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even when I take the wonderful price out of the equation, I like this soap for its merits. I find that my shaves with this soap are markedly superior to any of the aerosol shave creams, even the well-marketed premium shave gels, that i have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I had trouble getting a lather built up with this soap in the past. Previously, I attributed it to the hard water in my area. I have since found that it was my technique that was flawed. This soap is very concentrated and thus needs to be mixed with a few dashes of water to develop a good lather. Once I knew that, I could build up a good dense lather that holds very well in about 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how:&lt;br /&gt; A. I soak the soap in hot water for 2 minutes prior to shaving and then drain the water just prior to my shave.&lt;br /&gt; B. I apply some soap to the tip my brush and then start to build a lather by swirling the soap in my hand.&lt;br /&gt; C. With the very tip of the brush, I dip it in the hot water and add a couple of drops from the sink into the lather on my hand and keep swirling to further mix it into the soap until the mixture gets very foamy and then apply it to my face.&lt;br /&gt; D. I am now even more satisfied with this soap now that I can use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Some people complain about the drying effect that this soap has upon your face. I have not had a problem with it, but I also have oily skin. If your skin is sensitive or dry, you may want to look at pre-shave balms or other soaps that are glyerin-based. They will provide better lubrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, I like this product. I like what it does to my face, and for the price, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and the price is great. I wanted to order 10 bars but almost fell off my chair when I saw the shipping, $40!! Talk about a bait and switch.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  I purchased the soap at the same time I purchased the Shaving set with Mach 3 handle for my dad.  He was happy with it.</li>
            <li> Most of us are here for one thing a cheap soap. This soap is a tallow based soap so it will be finicky to lather with harder water. The soap lathered great with my water all I needed to do was soak the puck for about the same as the brush and lather. The puck smells strongly of the classic soap scent that some people like. The soap it&#x27;s self came in the box witch is about a 2x2x1 inch cardboard box with the puck in side that fits in just about any mug/bowl as the name implies. Gave me a nice clean shave for the cheap price would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used this one time didn&#x27;t get a good lather. Against my better judgment I shaved with it, and it looked like i went to war with the razor and came out with a L. Sorry to all the shave nuts out there but this one was not it for me</li>
            <li> I recently started using shaving soap and a brush instead of the goo in a can. I started off with this soap only because it was the only soap at Wal-Mart. BTW it&#x27;s cheaper there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, the soap smell is just classic clean. No fancy perfumes here, I really like the simple smell of this soap. As for foaming it up, the best way to get a nice lather is to soak the soap puck every time. Last night for example I let is soak in hot water for 20 minutes while I showered and got my best lather yet. I use a regular coffee mug to get the soap on my brush, then I transfer the brush to a regular cereal bowl I also bought from Wal-Mart for under $3 to whip it up, the bowl gives me more room to work with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried a different soap, one that is a bit softer but way more stinky. I don&#x27;t really want a bunch of perfume in my lather, it&#x27;s really unnecessary because I use a shave lotion afterward anyway. That other soap comes in a plastic tub which is way worse for the environment (like the aerosol cans, also really bad for the environment).</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving soap and I&#x27;m very happy with it - would not hesitate to buy again, but will probably want to at least try some of the other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not offensive at all in my opinion.  Very &amp;#34;citrusy,&amp;#34; leaning towards lemon.  If you blindfolded me I might guess this is garnier fructese shampoo or something along those lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price it&#x27;s a safe place to start - I recently noticed however this specific brand is carried by some of my local big box and drug stores, so if you&#x27;re really concerned you might swing by the shaving aisle next time you are out shopping and get lucky.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap to use, the only reason it is getting four stars instead of five is because a facial moisturizer a necessity with it other wise your skin can get really dry and flaky. This is a rookie mistake of mine, do not try an melt this if you want do not want to deal with the puck in a bowl/mug. Instead mill it by using a grater/zester, pouring water in the container of the milled soap and smoothing it in, pouring the water out, and letting it dry over night. This is what I do on the weekends when I know I need new puck. Also if you are going to use this exclusively be sure to do some searching since you can get really good deals. Under a $1/item with shipping.</li>
            <li> Get a shaving brush and then get this. Then shave hair off your face.</li>
            <li> Ok, if you&#x27;re new to wet shaving this is a good place to start. Williams shaving soap is a bit hard to work into a good lather but practice makes perfect. My suggestion is to soak the soap along with your brush in warm water for about a minute before shaving. This allows the shaving soap to soften a bit. Because this is also a thicker shaving soap I would suggest a boar hair shaving brush over the badger hair as the bristles are a bit more coarse. Amazon has a good number of these in stock as well and you should be able to start wet shaving for about $25 US including the safety razor.</li>
            <li> My husband was used to using a shaving brush and soap (Williams particularly) for  many, many years. It became unavailable on shelves for shaving products so he had to go to aerosol cans with soap and disliked them. Then I thought to try the Internet and found exactly what he wanted from Amazon.com. How lucky can we be!</li>
            <li> You would have to be mentally impaired to purchase this item. I used it with a badger brush, a merkur razor, and a personna blade. The first thing i noticed was the good smell, yet it lacked everywhere else. It dried on my face, made strokes uncomfortable and ended up tearing up my neck. I had the worst razor burn of my life and it felt as if i used lye soap to do the job. If you want a good shave with all the nostalgia, I recommend Proraso tube shaving cream. It lathers, cools, and doesn&#x27;t turn your face into chalky leather.</li>
            <li> This was a great bargain.  The soap brushes up best with hot water an a somewhat stiff brush.  Work up the foam.  It has a nice smell it feels like a good shave to me.</li>
            <li> I received it in a timely fashion.  I use this every day I shave and I love how smooth my skin feels when I&#x27;m done!  This is the ONLY shaving soap that I use!</li>
            <li> {UPDATE: Check out my article at http://shavelikegrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com/2014/08/williams-shave-soap-instead-of-ss10a-uh[dot]html but substitute periods for the three [dot]s. With a good shave soap, you don&#x27;t have to do any pre-lather prep, and no after-shave lotions or balms, either.}    I have been using this product off and on for many years and found it adequate for the task and certainly inexpensive.  I don&#x27;t use it anymore except in some kind of no-other-shave-soap-available emergency. I have sensitive skin that dries out easily -- especially in the winter.  So a winter-shave routine involving washing my face with soap, then lathering and shaving with Williams shave soap, leaves some areas of my face so dry that no after-shave balm or skin moisturizer can seem to quickly fix. It also offers adequate, but not the best shave protection.    So I have rated Williams three stars because of the inherent drying quality of soap and its adequate but not superior lather. (My favorite shave soap is currently the Arko shave stick, which isn&#x27;t much more expensive, but offers excellent protection for a close shave.)    Regarding the smell of the product:  When I stick my nose over the puck when it&#x27;s new - never care much for the smell.  HOWEVER, when I lather up, and apply to face, the smell is mild, pleasant, and manly.  Also, the smell of the puck itself seems to mellow considerably with use.  My recommendation for those who object to the product&#x27;s bouquet is to keep your nose out of the mug/bowl when using a new puck, and just enjoy the lather as it lubes your whiskers!    For more DE and wet-shaving info, see ShaveLikeGrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com.sturizing layer on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding Williams&#x27; inherent lathering ability, a couple of comments in response to the several complaints I&#x27;ve read here:&lt;br /&gt;I live in a hard-water area, meaning that soaps don&#x27;t lather/foam as well to begin with, yet I have done the following (which is very little) to achieve quick, easy, luxurious foam with Williams shaving soap:&lt;br /&gt;a) DO follow the advice of others here and wet your brush well and add a bit of water (warm or not according to preference) to the top of the puck and pour off any excess prior to lathering.  I only add water to the puck for the first few shaves out of the box; after that, I don&#x27;t find it necessary.&lt;br /&gt;b)  As I mentioned earlier, I use a small plastic bowl (5\\&quot; diameter, 2\\&quot; deep), not a mug.  (Got it at the national dept store with the bulls-eye logo;  two bowls for $1)  Because the Williams puck is so hard, even after the puck has softened with a use or two and has been pressed into the bowl (after the puck has been wet and softened) like a suction cup, it tends to slide in the bottom of the bowl as I swirl my brush;  so this can be remedied by using a bit of coarse sandpaper to slightly rough up the center of the bowl bottom, which gives the puck a good surface to which it can adhere.  THEN after the puck has softened, press it into place and let it set overnight -- no more sliding.&lt;br /&gt;c)  Lather up moving the brush around the bowl a few times, then reverse direction a few times, continue this until you get the lather you desire, then enjoy!  (Or add a few drops of shaving oil, glycerin, and oatmeal powder, as I suggested above, for creamier, more moisturizing shave; lather a bit more, apply to face, and enjoy even more!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some say the brush makes a difference in lathering.  It does a bit, I suppose, but to each his own:  Years ago, I used the cheapest, poorest quality brush but still got acceptable results.  Today I have both an inexpensive Van Der Hagen boar brush, and a 3x-more-expensive badger brush (still relatively inexpensive).  I use both and like them.  In terms of function, comfort, and value, I never needed to go beyond the Van Der Hagen.  Great brush, great value, works well with the Williams soap.  (If you are a value shaver, the boar brush WILL work just fine.  The difference between badger and boar is very small in my experience, probably not significant to any but the most fussy afficionados.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the smell of the product:&lt;br /&gt;When I stick my nose over the puck when it&#x27;s new - never care much for the smell.  HOWEVER, when I lather up, and apply to face, the smell is mild, pleasant, and manly.  Also, the smell of the puck itself seems to mellow considerably with use.  My recommendation for those who object to the product&#x27;s bouquet is to keep your nose out of the mug/bowl when using a new puck, and just enjoy the lather as it lubes your whiskers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more DE and wet-shaving info, see ShaveLikeGrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com.</li>
            <li> If you have invested in a nice razor and quality brush, this is not the item to cut corners and save money on. Almost any other product will serve you better. After 54 years of wet-shaving I am somewhat familiar with building a decent lather from a soap puck or cream.  I have tried this soap on several occasions, each time thinking that it will be different but it never is.  I wound up throwing each puck away.  Reading a few reviews today on a shaving forum, I discovered that others who have found this soap to be inadequate to shave with, have used it as a soap bar in the shower.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t totally wasted the money and had at least gotten a few decent showers with the pucks I had purchased.  Even though I don&#x27;t think much of this product, there are a great many people who have shaved with it for years and seem to approve.  I mean no disrespect, but life is too short to not have a decent, luxurious shave in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Not a bad scent, fits in the Marvy shaving mug perfectly.</li>
            <li> I would have preffered Colgates, if it is still made.  It foams up pretty good and smells good.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the fast shipping,can now include with the shaver and cup.my brother will&lt;br /&gt;enjoy</li>
            <li> My favorite. No fragrance. My face never breaks out anymore since I&#x27;ve been using this product. NO MORE CANNED CRAP FOR ME, ANYMORE!!!!</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap at a great price. Individual packages are cheaper to buy than the 12 pack even with shipping included.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T FORGET THE REST OF THE TOOLS. HERE IS WHEN YOU WILL REMEMBER TIME SLOW DOWN AND YOU WILL SWEAR YOU WHERE A KID AGAIN WATCHING YOUR GRAND DAD AND MAYBE EVEN YOUR FATHER. HEY IT&#x27;S OK TO HOP ON THE TIME TRAVEL EXPRESS.</li>
            <li> for me.. i&#x27;d call this a 5.. but i tihnk for waht most peopel are looing for this is more a 3-4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly this is real old-fashioned, small, triple-milled soap.  It has a very basic/clean smell (think Hilton shower soap that smells good).  it&#x27;s designed for shaving (very very good lathering when i use my stiffer synthetic brush.. my soft silvertip it would lather.. but the lather was different, not nearly as effective.. harder to get going).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap basically is made to deliver one thing - slickness.  And it delivers.&lt;br /&gt;Re-activating the slickness is there too with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because that&#x27;s exactly waht i&#x27;m looking for and this is a very cheap soap.. GOLD!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wont&#x27; necessairly feel as luxurious or creamy as other soaps, or lather up impressively like other soaps.  but for me.. the most important thing is perfofrmance and how t helps when you&#x27;re running a clinically sharp razor along your skin.  And that&#x27;s where i LOVE this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple.. 3 small triple-milled pucks.. with a small downcline to its logo (cute.. also VERY VERY functional as loading brushes up the stuff doesn&#x27;t get as messy as other soaps.. it stays contained in the center of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not end up being my ultimate.. but (ust like somebody else said), its something i&#x27;ll always keep around and in fact may be my goto... but we&#x27;ll see.  The lack of the super luxurious and frills may make most turn away from this soap. (only reason i put 4.. again for me it&#x27;s an absolute 4.5 to 5).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this soap and will not be returning. The lather that your brush creates on your face stays thick waiting for your blade to be wet unlike other brands which either never developed a head or thinned out as soon as you put the brush down. I use this with Derby Extra blades and get a superb shave. The scent is nice and the price doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> It was priced ok but when I got it the lather didn&#x27;t hold it was basically a bar of soap but whats expected with a low price.</li>
            <li> Produces a generous lather with minimal effort.  Using it is a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Got to me very late, but the product is hard to find, and it&#x27;s a great product. I use it all the time, and so does my dad!</li>
            <li> would recommend this product highly as it was  part of a Christmas gift for my grandson and I knew about it from my husband using it.</li>
            <li> This soap is truly amazing in its lathering abilities. It lathers easier and with less soap than any other soap I&#x27;ve tried. And it works well at protecting your face. I mostly use other brands just because they are more luxurious but I keep Williams in my camper and my travel bag. I look forward to using it every time. Great cost saving soap.</li>
            <li> Williams was the first shaving soap I ever tried. I found some in another city on a holiday weekend, and bought three pucks to take home since I was running low on my Gillette cream and had recently switched to a double-edge blade. When the time came for my first soap shave, it didn&#x27;t go well. The lather on Williams is just plain bad. I tried all the tricks and hacks to get the most out of this soap, because apparently it&#x27;s a water hog and won&#x27;t lather right unless you spoil it like a princess first. Even then, I ended up with a bad shave and cuts everywhere, and a lot of blood (that&#x27;s where the title of my review came from, haw haw). There was little to no cushion which made for a rough glide. At first I thought that I had just done something wrong (even though I&#x27;m an experienced shaver), and so I waited to write this review until I could try again with a different soap. Yesterday I had my first shave with Arko, and that soap performed like a decent shaving soap should -- excellent lather, excellent cushion, and a seriously close shave with no cuts or irritation. I&#x27;d go so far as to say that it was the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had. So my recommendation is to go with Arko for an inexpensive soap and don&#x27;t bother with Williams unless you&#x27;re feeling masochistic. I rated Williams 2 stars instead of 1 because I know Williams has a market and it&#x27;s been around for ages, and for that reason alone I at least give it some respect. But I cannot recommend a soap that I feel is more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> This is a great working shaving soap at an even better price. I am relatively new to wet shaving deciding six months ago to give it a try because I was spending a small fortune on razor blades. I bought a Parker safety razor here on amazon and picked up some Williams mug shaving soap from my local grocery store. I shave about one-two times per week on average and this soap has hasted me since January, I may have one or two more shaves left and its time to start a new bar. Many people complain that they don&#x27;t get a good lather and I experienced that at the beginning but you have to get the right combination of water to soap in your mug and a good badger brush will help immensely. I have sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all. Overall I am pleased with the results of this soap and will continue using it. It does exactly what its supposed to do and does it well! One suggestion I have found helpful by reading other reviews it to add a little hot water in you mug at soften the soap a bit a few minutes before you shave. This helps to get a great lather.</li>
            <li> The only thing I changed in my shower / shave routine today was using Mug Shaving Soap for shaving.  After I was all done, my face felt a little itchy, and my chest skin feels a little itchy (I did get some of the soap onto my chest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the suds definitely dried out after about 1 minute on my skin.  And I took the time to lather it up pretty well actually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap and gets the job done, but I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering this as part of a free shipping order would not have&lt;br /&gt;got it by itself with shipping, but it is still my favorite shaving soap</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd different shaving soap to try. Of the 3 I&#x27;ve tried, this one is the best so far. Lots of slick lather that lasts. And can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Lather is good. This is really great for the price. I only give it a 4 because I wish the scent was not such a traditional &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells light, fresh and amazing.</li>
            <li> The Williams mug shaving soap really foams well and improves my shaving experience.  I use it daily in the shower and I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have only tried one other brand, but this one works very well.  I like the fragrance also.</li>
            <li> worked well.  Great deal.  Timely shipping.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Williams has always made the best shaving soap, unless you know how to make your own!</li>
            <li> Been wet shaving about a year now and like it. I have been using Col Conk but ran out and picked this up cheap at the local CVS. Again, I find that you get what you pay for in life and this was lousy but cheap. Work hard to lather and it will dry up before you can pick up your razor and go to it. Only good thing is there is no soap ring around the sink, since the lather will evaporate. It sizzles like alka-selzer in a glass of water! I will stick to Col Conk, might try Van der Hagen since it gets good reviews on here. I really didn&#x27;t mind the smell and never got any comments from the wife or kids on that, so I can&#x27;t say that it smells bad. That&#x27;s my advice.</li>
            <li> I realized after I bought this that the same soap is available at my local grocery store for 1/3 the cost.  Not the best lather in the world, but is ok in a pinch.</li>
            <li> Yep just what I needed</li>
            <li> It is soap how much can one really say about soap?</li>
            <li> Very nice shaving soap. Will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Williams shaving soap with a good brush and reasonable blade will give you the best shave possible which IMHO is one of life&#x27;s small pleasures, not to mention that your significant other will appreciate a smooth face to embrace.  Williams soap is mild on the skin (the &amp;#34;Dove&amp;#34; of shaving soaps) and has a pleasant mild scent.  It will create the lather you desire if you use hot water + time + a good brush.  I like the other reviewer&#x27;s disclaimer - &amp;#34;beware this will make you smell like a man&amp;#34; :-)  What you might not read in other reviews is that the soap, razor, etc. is perhaps less important than how you use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here is the technique that I wish to pass on to men of shaving age everywhere:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shave AFTER you shower if possible.  2) You MUST have hot water - if not then use an electric razor.  3) Lather your face lightly then apply a hot washcloth to your face for 15 - 30 seconds.  This softens your beard and makes shaving MUCH easier.  4) Relather - this time nice and thick - then shave.  5) Clear any remaining soap with your nice warm washcloth and apply aftershave of your choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process takes me about 5 minutes, I NEVER cut myself and with practice you will have similar results not to mention that your face will be smooth as silk with no irritation.  Hope you enjoy!</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I noticed it had a very strong smell that, honestly, was a bit off-putting. But after using it for about a week now, the smell isn&#x27;t an issue anymore. The soap does create a decent lather that is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> So cheap and so good. The scent is just a clean smell , no flowers. I use aftershave lotion &amp;#34;Clubman&amp;#34; to be specific. Great combo. Old School shaving is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Williams shaving soap for years.  Every store in my town stopped carrying it, so I decided to look on the internet.  Sure enough, Amazon had it listed.  I found the cheapest place to purchase it, and bought 10 cakes.  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> I got this on a recommendation, but didn&#x27;t consider that most soaps are made from animals, which is a feature I don&#x27;t find desirable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind that, it smells OK, lathers well, and does a good job on the shaving front.</li>
            <li> This is a basic no-frills shave soap. I&#x27;ve actually compared different soaps as well as shaving creams. This one will do the job, but I don&#x27;t prefer it compared to others. I have very easily nicked and cut skin. I&#x27;ve found that I get less cuts / nicks using a better soap or even shave cream. I create a very warm lather, this helps with any shave. I found this soaps lather to be &#x27;thin&#x27;, without the richer more full felling of others. VDH feels better to me. As to canned creams, I&#x27;ve also put them into my mug, which is in a bowl of very hot water. Then  I use the brush to apply it, being sure to dip the brush in the hot water, and also dip the razor itself. An excellent shave cream is Gillette Foamy, better than this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  I&#x27;ve used many different shaving soaps, some of them very, very expensive.  And by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used is the inexpensive Arkko shaving soap.  Once you&#x27;ve had Arkko you&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> The puck will last you quite a long time, and will lather nicely on your face, but does not hold as thick a lather as other shaving soaps I have tried.  For the price, there are no complaints; it is certainly worth that amount, but I will probably invest in more quality soap next time.</li>
            <li> I want to begin saying that this product,while for others may be suitable,for me has been a bad experience,after only 2 shaves with this soap,my face burns with redness all over.the shave was close,but no cushion at all, ive gotten one of the most irritating shaves ever in 25 years,it also may be due to my sensitive skin and logically,its not meant for everybody.so ill stick to my favorite proraso and art of shaving...good luck</li>
            <li> this was my first foray into the world of shaving soap as opposed to shaving cream or oil which i&#x27;ve used for the last few years.  the soap smells nice but i have found it a little difficult to get up the lather i need to get a good shave.  I found that to get good coverage i have to get soap off of the bar each time i need to apply as opposed to using a shaving bowl and creating enough lather to last throughout my entire shave.  I am using it to shave my legs so maybe it&#x27;s a little better on a face.  it does smell nice and clean and rinses off well.  it&#x27;s a good shaving soap especially for the money but i would probably think twice about getting it again because it doesn&#x27;t come in it&#x27;s own container.  it&#x27;s a small thing but makes it difficult to store and travel with it.</li>
            <li> After having used Williams Mug Shaving Soap off and on for a few years, I find that I always come back to it when I tire of more exotic shave soaps. The William soap is inexpensive and light enough to minimize cuts other, heavier soaps tend to sometimes provide due to overwhelming the shave stroke with heavy lather. Williams is just right. I keep coming back to it as my day-to-day standby as I venture out to explore other soaps with more exotic ingredients and scents.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to classic shaving, this soap might tempt you. It&#x27;s pretty much everywhere and it&#x27;s extremely cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to suggest looking elsewhere. My personal experience is that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to lather well. Having tried multiple methods of lathering, including soaking the puck in water, I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t provide a very smooth lather, and takes a long time to build anything other than a thin, bubbly mess. Van der Hagen is a lot more user friendly in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it three stars because the smell is pretty nice and it&#x27;s extremely cheap compared to other shaving soaps. I&#x27;ll also admit that I might not have the best technique, and that someone more skilled with a shaving brush could probably do better with it.</li>
            <li> First, if you&#x27;re upset that you&#x27;re not getting enough lather, you only have your own ignorance to blame.  It&#x27;s ok to not know and to seek answers, but I&#x27;ve seen quite a few negative reviews on this product because people simply can&#x27;t figure out how to use it.  Giving a product a bad review simply because you can&#x27;t figure it out, isn&#x27;t fair to the manufacturer of the product and actually misleads potential future consumers, so before criticizing williams, please read this and try the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s not difficult to use, this product does require a tiny bit more effort and technique than the other types of shaving soap out there.  It&#x27;s a hard bar of soap which by it&#x27;s very nature is not as easy as the other types of soap.  There is no great mystery to it and if you follow these instructions you won&#x27;t have any issues with it even as a new user of mug soap.  It took me 4 or 5 tries to figure it all out, but I&#x27;ve happily been using williams since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Put a few drops of water on the soap before you get into the shower.  That will soften up the soap and allow you to get more soap off of the bar with less effort once you get out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Don&#x27;t rely on the mug in order to build your lather.  The mug is there to hold the soap while you&#x27;re loading your brush.  Swirl your brush around for 30 seconds or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Use a shaving bowl (this is very important).  It needn&#x27;t be anything fancy, but you want the inside of the bowl to be as spherical as possible.  I use a $2 black plastic salsa bowl that I picked up at a big box store and it&#x27;s perfect for the task!  No need to drop $30 on a friggin bowl.  Anyway, put a tablespoon or two of water into the shaving bowl.  Now rotate your brush around the bottom for about a minute while using light pressure.  That&#x27;s all it takes.  You should have built enough lather to do 3 passes and still have some left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Splash hot water on your face before applying the lather.  The lather is not meant to be applied directly to your skin.  The water serves as an additional barrier and lubricant for the lather.  It also serves to keep the lather from drying out.  If the lather is drying on your face, you&#x27;re either taking too long to shave (&amp;#62;5 minutes a pass) or you&#x27;re not splashing water on your face before applying the lather.  Either way, once again, you&#x27;re doing it wrong if you have this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to add any other tips and tricks you&#x27;ve learned from your own experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of williams could be better for sure, but a lot of people really like it and for the price, it doesn&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good reliable soap to shave with.</li>
            <li> good lather and a nice smell.  works well and lasts longer other shaving soaps I have tried</li>
            <li> Much better than the shaving soap I purchased at Walmart.  The bar lasts about three times longer than the soap purchased at Walmart also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, when I first switched from Mach 3 cartridges and Gillette Sensitive Skin Shaving Gel, I only did it to try to save some money on my regular shaving needs. Imagine my surprise when I found that this shaving soap didn&#x27;t leave my face hurting at all, compared to the Gillette Gel. I was completely dumbfounded, because how can a pretty generic looking shaving soap out-perform a gel specifically designed for sensitive skin? I still don&#x27;t really have an answer to that, but needless to say, this soap has lasted me for about 6 months of 2-3 times per week shaving, and I think that it&#x27;s one of the best products related to shaving that I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to shave with and the soap smells great! I think I will be stuck with this kind of shaving soap for a long time.</li>
            <li> My father used this. I used it as a young man learning to shave. I still like the smell and it works great. Worth buying...</li>
            <li> Like the smell, it builds good lather, and can be purchased at my local drug store.  As other comments state, a few drops of water before you shower will prep the soap for lather.</li>
            <li> Much better than what I had expected. Much better and less costly than it&#x27;s Aerosol Counterpart. Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> These shaving soaps smell so good!  I swear if you didn&#x27;t use them for shaving - you could put them in a dresser drawer and it would make it smell yummy!</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been unable to get this as any of the drug or grocery stores near me.  They all seem to have switched to another brand (Cashmere?).  The other stuff is terrible.  This is the real thing.  I was delighted to find it.</li>
            <li> Awful. The person that recommends this soap to me will become my enemy. It produces a soapy film that I hesitate to call a lather. It is outperformed by hand soaps. I originally tried this to hone my lathering technique, but this did nothing but damage my skill and brush. This soap must be flogged like an oarsman on a prison ship to even pull enough soap off the puck to be useable. I resorted to shaving the thing with a knife. For the price it seems harmless enough, I know. But you will soon curse your wasted dollar for even being subjected to this hockey puck. Some people swear by this soap; they are masochists. The icing on this steaming pile is the weak lemon-afterthought smell it puts off like a warning. Williams adopted this talent from small reptiles: Too tiny and innocuous to defend themselves and yet dangerous to even bite once. And that&#x27;s what this soap really is. It&#x27;s the little brown poison lizard hiding at the end of a store shelf, daring you to nibble it with its price tag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Want a great, cheap shaving soap? Go buy an Arko stick. If you hate the stick, cut the thing up and mold it into a puck. You eventually might not love it, but at least you&#x27;ll have a functional soap when you decide it&#x27;s not for you. When you give up on the Williams you&#x27;ll just have a lemon-scented doorstop.</li>
            <li> I was excited by the rave reviews this soap got when I ordered it. When the soap arrived I was really impressed by the masculine smell.  However the good ends there. The soap did not make a good lather. It left a residue that built up under my blade. This required for me to disassemble my razor twice, in order to complete my shave.&lt;br /&gt;To complete this review: I used a short handle safety razor with a persona blade.</li>
            <li> For over 160 years this soap was everything it is advertised to be.  Then Combe took over this soap and around 2004 made tallow it&#x27;s second ingredient.  They deny changing the formula but look at www.williamsmugsoap.com.  The box pictured has &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34; written in blue.  When this box was in production it was a fine soap. Now &amp;#34;mug&amp;#34; on today&#x27;s  box is white trimmed in blue.  THAT&#x27;S when it became a tallow second soap and ceased to become the iconic product it was for over 160 years.  I&#x27;d pay double or triple if Combe were willing to restore the old classic product.</li>
            <li> Left skin very dry &amp; irritated.  I also found the smell Irritating.  Would probably be for men without any sensetive skin issues.  Had to try it becuse of the price.  Get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> Lets face it you get what you pay for.  This soap is not very easy to lather at first but you get the hang of it.  I use this to make a uber lather typically.</li>
            <li> product in excellent condition</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought a few of this product for my husband.  When he needed a refill, I couldn&#x27;t locate it again.  I kept the box so I would not forget the right product. I was so excited to locate this again online as a gift, as he has wanted to return to brush/mug/soap shaving. Thank you for my surprise for him!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. Inexpensive and smells great, smells better than Van Der Hagen. It does take a little practice working up a lather but well worth it. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many mug soaps and those that come in a tube.  Actually, I liked Noxema&#x27;s tube soap best, but it was discontinued -- second best is Williams.  There used to be plenty to choose from, not anymore.  I&#x27;m glad one of the better ones, Williams, is still putting it out.  Their are some cheaper soaps, they go fast, don&#x27;t give your beard a good soak like Williams.</li>
            <li> I have recently went back old school when it comes to shaving. I now use a double edge razor and a shave brush and bought this soap to go with everything I ordered. I initiall bought it as a novelty as my last name is Williams but it works real good as a shave soap and i will be buying more in the future. Since I have gone back to the double edge razor I believe my shaving cost has dropped considerably. For anyone considering going back old school for shaving as I did i would suggest this soap and also be carefull when shaving and only use a light later of soap and light pressure wity the razor.</li>
            <li> While placed in my ancient shaving mug and using a durable badger shaving brush with a reknowned double edged blade, I experience a shave comparable to that obtained in a competent barber shop.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- it actually has lasting lather, which so many shaving soaps get wrong&lt;br /&gt;- dirty cheap, can&#x27;t mess that up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This is the primary reason I&#x27;m not going to use it:  Citronella / Lemon Balm stink.  Some might love this smell, but to me it&#x27;s unpleasant.  It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re rubbing your face with insect repellent.  Others say &amp;#34;you&#x27;ll smell like a man&amp;#34; with this soap, but it&#x27;s more like you smell like you&#x27;ve been bathing in citronella oil.&lt;br /&gt;- Could be slippery for those using a DE razor, but this could easily eliminate the lathering quality it has.  Hard balance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and lather qualities, everyone should try it out to see if it works best for them.  For me, it&#x27;s the fragrance that kills the deal, otherwise this would be a top pick for me.</li>
            <li> People often focus on the razor when shaving, and I would agree up to a point.  If you are truly going to shave, and not use a &#x27;Mach 3&#x27; or electric shaver then you need a good soap and a good brush.  This soap puts together a nice lather that allows the blade to slide across your skin, without catching and cutting you.  Definitely a good buy (plus its so inexpensive).</li>
            <li> This soap has always delivered.  It is much better than wasting can after can of&lt;br /&gt;shaving gel that doesn&#x27;t give you any closer shave.  A good way, along with the right&lt;br /&gt;mug and brush of saving 10 or 12 cans a year.</li>
            <li> This is good soap, it has good smooth characteristics that allow the blade to glide smoothly over your face.  The only thing I do not like is the slight residue it leave on my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Smells okay (a little bit &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; which I&#x27;m not wild about), but produces a great lather. Some people might like it.</li>
            <li> I started DE shaving less than two weeks ago, so I am certainly a new-bee to all this.  Was looking into DE shaving due to continual irritation and razor burn issues with cartridge shavers.  After a conversation with my barber (old-school and in business for over 43 years), I bought myself a safety razor, which came with Derby extra blades and picked up a disk of Williams at my local drugstore for a $1.09.  Following the instructions given to me by my barber...right out of the gate, first shave, I was able to build a HUGE, lasting lather that lubricated and conditioned my face better than any canned product I&#x27;ve used in over 21 years of shaving.  After 9 shaves, I am noticing a marked improvement in my razor burn issues, and have zero irritation.  DE shaving takes longer (probably because I am still very new to it) but it is well worth it and Williams is an excellent shave soap.  Inexpensive, lubricates and conditions extremely well and has a nice but not overpowering scent.  Try it for yourself.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advice given to me by my barber for using Williams...soak the disk and brush in HOT water for the time it takes you to shower.  Once done showering, dump out the water, but still leave enough of the original hot water that so that it is one half the depth of the soap disk.  Using circular and side to side brush motion, work up a lather (about 2 minutes).  You will end up with a lather that is thick and will last you an hour if necessary.</li>
            <li> On my quest to find the best shaving soap for my DE safety shaving routine I came across this little drug store gem. Let me start by saying when choosing a shave soap and reading reviews you have to factor in the price of the soap! Yes some soaps are way better than others but they can also be three times the price.    This is one of those brands that has been around forever. It was most likely in your father or grandfathers mug. The scent? Like a barbershop in the 30s. Love that smell, old fashioned, clean, and simple.    The lather worked up easily and like most tallow based soaps produced a thick, creamy lather. The lather itself wasn&#x27;t the longest lasting, it dried faster than Arko and Proraso, but did outlast the glycerin based Col. Conks. And again, consider than you can pick up this soap at any CVS or Walgreens for about $3. If you want a simple, clean smelling soap for under $3 this is it. No fancy oils or perfumes, and a great lather that lasts long enough for 1-2 pass shavers.</li>
            <li> best shave out there, I use this with a wet/dry electric razor &amp; it makes for the closest &amp; most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had before during and after.The price is right and as long as this is so ready available I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else.</li>
            <li> Great scent and works up a good quality lather fairly quick.  You also can&#x27;t beat the price, over all satisfied with this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and has a mild pleasant smell. Much cheaper than others and does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Awsome soap that doesn&#x27;t coast an arm and a leg. It does lather up really nice and I get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Must be old fashion but a hot lather makes a big difference. I have been using Williams for some time now. Not much competition any more.</li>
            <li> I went old school and used this and an old Ever-Ready single-edge razor. This soap works good, for me. I&#x27;m a white guy with the classic unfortunate combination of sensitive skin and a relatively thick beard growth, for whom it may concern. The soap has a old school citronella smell, which I personally enjoy. It is pretty hydrophilic(loves water). I cannot seem to get it to \\&quot;lather\\&quot; as good as, say, proraso or Taylor of Old Bond Street soaps would, but that doesn&#x27;t matter because it lubricates my face just fine and leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped immediatly and came in perfect condition. This is the best soap for making your own shaving cream. We actually used it for making pies to throw during Clown School!!! Best there is! :O)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used shaving soap and a brush pretty much ever since I first started shaving.  Once upon a time I used Old Spice shaving soap (still have an Old Spice shaving mug in fact) but that product hasn&#x27;t been available for many years now.  I switched to Williams Mug Shaving Soap when Old Spice was no longer available and I could find this product in local stores. Now, buying it on-line is the only way I can still get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers up nicely, has a nice fresh mild scent, and last a long time.  My only complaint is that it has a smaller diameter than my Old Spice mug.  Guess I can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and gave it a whirl a few nights ago. Compared to the ones I have been using (Col Conks and Van De Hagen), I noticed a remarkably quick drying up of the lather. It lathers pretty easy but despite what it says on the box about not drying, it does dry pretty fast. I had to keep applying it during the course of my shave which I don&#x27;t have to do with the other above mentioned shave soaps. This one seems to be ubiquitous in that you can find it everywhere. It sometimes amazes me that the really good soaps are hard to find but the soaps that kind of suck are highly available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent is god awful. If I was trying to get somebody into wet shaving, I would get them the starter pack by Van Der Hagen, that shave soap smells absolutely fantastic and also will not dry up and contains like 40% moisturizers, shea butter and aloe vera, not to mention it is hypoallergenic and it makes your face feel and smell nice..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a few reviews which seemed favorable to this, maybe these wet shavers remarked so favorably because they haven&#x27;t tried the really good soaps? I don&#x27;t know, but all in all, I would not buy this again unless I ran out of the good stuff and this was the only one I could get on a last minute thing.</li>
            <li> bought it for boyfriend, who had been looking for one for awhile. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Great item and service</li>
            <li> My husband is Australian, &amp; came to America to marry me. Has always used shave soap, but Williams is the very best! Smells so good and manly, we don&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I use it and it&#x27;s the same soap my father used. I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
            <li> im sure your all going to say im doing it wrong but the 1 thing i can do well is make up a lather and this was hard to lather up it smells like citronella and the large bubbles never went away it was light and not very slipery no matter the water amount if you want cheap shaving soap spend an extra 1 dollar and get van der hagen your face will appreciate it</li>
            <li> My husband only likes this kind and was having trouble finding in store...&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this for years</li>
            <li> I like the soap and the smell, but for me it seems to dry to quickly on the face, even if I just do one side of the face at a time.</li>
            <li> simple, nice smell, very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Love this mug shaving soap! This was my first experience with williams shaving soap - and a very great one at that. The scent is very pleasant and not overpowering and leans more towards a &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; smell and definitely not a &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34; smell. The soap lathers nicely without the need for adding too much water. Does not bother sensitive skin - and leaves you with a cool/refreshing feel afterword. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Foams up fast and thick and leaves a nice, unscented, soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is very good, lathers nicely and is easy to apply, however the smell isn&#x27;t that good (airplane soap) and it leaves a residue on everything it touches and once you wipe off your face your skin it very dry.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> been using this for years, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used handsoap in a pinch.  Only the cheapest of bargain motels provide soap this poor for shaving.  The lather is pitiful, the lubrication is non-existant.  It increased the pull of the razor on my skin.  Might as well shave dry.  I hate it I hate it I hate it.  It smells good... um, that&#x27;s about all I can say about it.  It&#x27;s too small for my mug too.  Small cake, poor lubrication.  What&#x27;s the point?  Sure it was cheap... but I can&#x27;t use this junk!</li>
            <li> OK shaving soap, but the cost of shipping was 3 times what the soap was worth!</li>
            <li> The soap was just as I remembered from when I was young</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used shaving soap in 20 years and was pleasantly surprised with the smoothness of the shave, not to mention the softness of the skin days after using it.  Will definitely be using it and ordering more.</li>
            <li> Awesome lather, classic sent, easy on the wallet. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave sope.</li>
            <li> VERY &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; not much lather &amp; smells &amp;#34;old mannish&amp;#34; not for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and could not find it at the local stores.  It makes a nice lather with a brush, and I have used a brush since 1960.  I do appreciate your new policy of allowing add-on purchases of small, single item products.</li>
            <li> This soap creates a perfect gliding surface for a safety razor or a straight razor blade.  It has a distinctive \\&quot;man-smell\\&quot;, a little bit like medicine.  Kind of reminds me of old-fashioned barber shops, which are very rare now in Virginia.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a unique shaving experience that is sick of paying so much for canned and brand named shaving creams that do not even work nearly as well as this classic cake of soap.  Stop reading this review and go buy a cake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now.</li>
            <li> It works OK, but requires an inordinate amount of time to get a decent lather.  It is also fast to dry and doesn&#x27;t provide much cushion during the shave.  I&#x27;m no expert, but everything else I have tried has been better.&lt;br /&gt; It smells nice, I used mine for hand soap after three shaves with it.</li>
            <li> That was my impression at first.  It smells like bershop soap.  Not at all unpleasant.  Somewhere between floral and mediciny.  That being said.  It lathers and works pretty well and carries a good price to boot.  Not my favorite soap so far, but definitely good and usable and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with blades for longer than I care to remember; first with double-edged razors, then Pal injectors, then with stupid Trac razors (never progressing past twin blades cause anything after that is a marketing rip-off -- back in the day Saturday Night Live had a Triple Trac Razor parodyâ€“ &amp;#34;a razor with three blades because the consumer is gullible enough to believe what he sees on TV commercials&amp;#34;). I had given up hope for an enjoyable shave again until the resurgence in shaving goods and popped for a Weishi razor, dug out my old badger brush and mug, and ordered Williams Mug Shaving Soap. I&#x27;m liberated again. This stuff lathers like crazy and is a lot simpler to lather than a lot of the tutorials I see online. I soak the brush for about one minute in hot water and soak the soap in my mug with about a 1/4 inch of water. I squeeze the brush of excess water, drain the mug, swirl the brush into the soap firmly till the bristles are coated with semi-wet soap, and then lather my face -- in under two minutes I have incredible lather with Williams. I will definitely buy this again -- and again - and again. And it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> this is a good soap, it lathers on good and stays wet. it tightens the skin a little bit, but that is normal makes shaving easier. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but it doesnt smell bad and ive been using this same bar for the past 2 months shaving with it every other day, and i still should get another month out of it.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first soaps I tried when I started using a shaving brush, and I did not like it. It just didn&#x27;t seem to lather well, and once I looked into the soap online I found that many others had the same difficulty. I happened to see it on the bottom shelf at a local grocery store for 98 cents, so I decided to give it another shot. I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wet the puck and let soak for a couple of minutes, pour out the excess water, then take a damp brush to it. Using that method, it lathers just as easy as anything and provides a comfortable shave. A 1.75 ounce puck will last me about a month and a half, and it has a pretty good grade on EWG&#x27;s Skin Deep to boot.</li>
            <li> I know its not the greatest soap but it gets the job done, that&#x27;s all matters for me. Besides look at the price, I do not understand why people are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Good smooth shave. Love it. I think this gives me a better shave than the canned soap does. I&#x27;m a permanent customer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Pleasant smell and provides a great shave. The only problem is that it doesnt stay in the bottom of my mug.</li>
            <li> My husband has a great deal of allergies, this product does not seem to bother him and that is a plus for us. The product arrived fast and works very well. My husband is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Amazing little soap. Lathers very well and gives a smooth shave. Plus, I love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To those who can&#x27;t make it lather - you need to use a boar brush. I use the Semogue 830, and this brush eats away this soap and creates 3x as much as lather made by a soft silver-tip. So, if you can&#x27;t make lather, blame your brush...not the soap. I also use a GT scuttle to keep my brush warm, but prefer to build lather on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always use this soap while traveling because it is small and light weight.</li>
            <li> This soap actually does produce a good lather. I&#x27;ve found the key is letting a small amount of water soak in to soften up the soap. The brush then makes a great lather that is thick but light. It&#x27;s not heavy like some other soaps or creams.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t lather up and stay long enough for me to finish a shave. It&#x27;s probably my hard water, but I have others that did much better. I ended throwing away my puck.</li>
            <li> I used the Williams Mug Shaving Soap for about a month or so after reading all of the high reviews here. The price was certainly fair and I knew if I didn&#x27;t like it it would not be too much of a loss.  There were a few people who had a hard time with the smell but I figured that I would get used to it.  The shave was fine and I had no problem getting a good lather, but even after a month I just couldn&#x27;t get past smelling like mosquito repellent. My favorite so far has been from the Tonsorial Shaving Cream from The New York Shaving Company.</li>
            <li> Very good shaving soap, very thick lather and smell good too. Helps me get a close shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get a nice lather, stiff peaks.  The lather lasts quite awhile on my face.  One of these pucks of soap will last me about 3 months,  It barely has a smell to it, and what there is just smells clean.  To me that&#x27;s just fine, I&#x27;ll use my aftershave for the smell.  Great shaving soap that&#x27;s uncomplicated and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The lather of this soap smells and feels great BUT this soap is just average as a shaving soap due the fact that the lather does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I was a bit concerned about purchasing such a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; soap; but it has proven to be perfect for me. It lathers nicely and provides a comfortable shave. I will certainly purchase another bar when this one is gone. It was shipped in a timely manner and arrived with no problems.</li>
            <li> All of the negative reviews on this product boil down to operator error. I love this soap and have no issues with it. I soak my boar brush in hot water while showering then give the brush one good shake. I then apply the wet brush to the dry puck and within a few minutes have enough thick, creamy lather to complete a three pass shave. I&#x27;ll gladly use this soap over the more expensive stuff any day.</li>
            <li> $4 for a cake of this soap is too high.  I can still find this soap, same brand in CVS Pharmacy or at Walgreens for about $1.50 a cake.  Same stuff, great shave.  I have used this soap for over 30 years and shaving with a mug, brush and soap is the only way to go.  But Amazon advertising this at $4.00 a cake is very expensive.</li>
            <li> Never have I worked so hard to form such a disappointing lather.  Though I love the softer, easy-to-lather soaps of modern creation, I am no disillusioned wimp when it comes to the task of taking the time to work an old-fashioned mug soap.  But believe me when I say this: no matter how much or little water I used, and no matter how much time I spent, I simply can&#x27;t get a decent lather from this soap.  I appreciate the classic scent and form of this product, but I&#x27;m guessing that the original formulation of decades past is far superior to that of this modern incarnation.  Do yourself a favor and wait until Williams decides to resurrect and originally great soap.</li>
            <li> It does the job however, I purchased it in CVS here in NYC for $1.67. It lathers well and I like it - I am looking for something else that smells a bit better. It doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell but I prefer something difference. But, it is inexpensive and does the job.</li>
            <li> Dad has been using this for decades, he still likes it.  I say okay because i really have no opinion but if dad likes it, it&#x27;s okay with me</li>
            <li> my husband loved this it went with his cup and razor, the old timey kind.</li>
