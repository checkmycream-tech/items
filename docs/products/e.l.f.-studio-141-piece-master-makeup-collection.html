    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon has been wonderful through all of this - bending over backward for the manufacturer&#x27;s failures.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect set if you need something to take when you travel.</li>
            <li>I buy all my elf makeup but thought this was a great price for the quantity of product that you get.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard great things about elf makeup.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy about:  </li>
            <li>Moving on, I do think the lip colors are very nice.</li>
            <li>The blush shades are also very nice, as well as the bronzers.</li>
            <li>The receiver of these gifts thought that the makeup set was very good and the books were also enjoyable.</li>
            <li>The eye shadows to leave a good deal of fall out too.</li>
            <li>Really good one as I gave it as gift.</li>
            <li>My daughter absolutly loved this.</li>
            <li>I am a more neutral girl where makeup is concerned, so this is great for me.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice makeup kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried e.l.f. products before and liked them.</li>
            <li>There are some good eye colors in the brights, but it leans mostly toward a neutral palette.  </li>
            <li>All of the bronzers are the shimmer kind.</li>
            <li>she liked this item.</li>
            <li>nice variety ok colors and shades.</li>
            <li>They show up decently, and if there isn&#x27;t one you like, you can easily combine to make the perfect color.</li>
            <li>I believe that it should&#x27;ve been packaged better because maybe the damage happen while shipped to me</li>
            <li>Your better of buying elf products at Target</li>
            <li>The bummer, is that the eye shadows are not terribly pigmented, even with a primer, they don&#x27;t show up as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>The blush and eyeshadows are so pigmented i love the way it looks on my face, i do</li>
            <li>this makeup enhances my beauty even more</li>
            <li>At the most, I&#x27;ll add some more lip color or gloss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift, it seems ok</li>
            <li>love this product... :) brought for my sis..</li>
            <li>everything you need in a compact easy to travel with case.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start by saying, i&#x27;m a HUGE fan of e.l.f products, i&#x27;ll give them all a chance.</li>
            <li>this was a gift, I contacted Amazon and they were happy to rush me a second box.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s no longer available</li>
            <li>She was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>However the plastic casing is really a let-down &amp; very cheap.</li>
            <li>Upon inspection, the make-up box was covered in powdery finger prints and the better part of a whole hand print.  </li>
            <li>I attempted to clean the make-up off the case, and ended up smearing it - and then, when using mild detergent, I destroyed the finish AND smeared the make-up even more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The item was put at the very bottom of the box and buried in 6 inches of inflatable packaging on the top side</li>
            <li>That is good if those are your go-to shades because you have an extra.</li>
            <li>I love the colors; I enjoy trying the new colors.</li>
            <li>The eye shadow selection is pretty decent, there&#x27;s lots of nice neutral shades.</li>
            <li>But this collection just wasn&#x27;t as good as some of their other products.</li>
            <li>If you prefer bright colors, this kit may leave you feeling less than satisfied especially in the lipstick choices.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the first box through amazon and received it.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only makeup that does not break me out :) and its affordable.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this may happen.</li>
            <li>the positive side:  </li>
            <li>This is not as much an Amazon packaging issue, as an e.l.f. packaging issue.  </li>
            <li>and she has enjoyed using all of the various eye shadows, lipsticks and blushes to complete her desired look.</li>
            <li>The packaging is very nice, and this is small enough so that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased a smaller one from Sephora that I loved.  </li>
            <li>We highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten other eye shadows from e.l.f in the past that were wonderful, these just weren&#x27;t the same quality.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t too drying either, but still a little lip gloss on top wouldn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>I was hurt when the new one I bought broke apart too.</li>
            <li>While the actual outside box was secure, the box that the item came in from e.l.f was not.  </li>
            <li>I have been told, I will see if there is a sale person willing to open the box at the store to see what we see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nt usually where alot of makeup because i love my natural but</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Both the first and second (will be my last)</li>
            <li>Not bad, but the eye shadows could definitely use a little work.</li>

            <li> This little collection is fab!</li>
            <li> but still what a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rock the shimmer/party on a regular workday,so that was a bit of a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Showed with all makeup broken to pieces</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows, blush, and foundation were broken.</li>
            <li> Part of the plastic box had also broken.  </li>
            <li> but upon opening, I found powdery fingerprints and broken plastic windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter opened and the powder inside was broken up and ruined all the make up .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was the color she would&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset about this purchase. :(</li>
            <li> El producto llego con una base rota.</li>

            <li> I love the colors; I enjoy trying the new colors. However the plastic casing is really a let-down &amp; very cheap. Both the first and second (will be my last) came apart within three uses. I bought the second figuring the plastic case was a one-time flaw... I was hurt when the new one I bought broke apart too.</li>
            <li> Showed with all makeup broken to pieces</li>
            <li> I received this kit in the mail and was so excited to open it, but was extremely disappointed when I opened the box. The entire kit was broken. The eyeshadows, blush, and foundation were broken. The kit didn&#x27;t slid open like it showed everything was cracked and already had fallen apart. I believe that it should&#x27;ve been packaged better because maybe the damage happen while shipped to me but still what a waste of money! I would not recommend this to anyone. Your better of buying elf products at Target that&#x27;s were I buy all my elf makeup but thought this was a great price for the quantity of product that you get. Just was sooo disappointed!!!!!</li>
            <li> nice variety ok colors and shades.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first box through amazon and received it.  While the actual outside box was secure, the box that the item came in from e.l.f was not.  In fact at one time that inner box had been taped closed and I could see where the tape had been torn open.  Upon inspection, the make-up box was covered in powdery finger prints and the better part of a whole hand print.  Part of the plastic box had also broken.  I attempted to clean the make-up off the case, and ended up smearing it - and then, when using mild detergent, I destroyed the finish AND smeared the make-up even more.&lt;br /&gt;As this was a gift, I contacted Amazon and they were happy to rush me a second box.  The second box came in a much larger Amazon box.  The item was put at the very bottom of the box and buried in 6 inches of inflatable packaging on the top side only.&lt;br /&gt;Again, the exterior of the box looked fin - but upon opening, I found powdery fingerprints and broken plastic windows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM unless you can open it IN a BRICK AND MORTAR STORE to verify all is well.  This is not as much an Amazon packaging issue, as an e.l.f. packaging issue.  Two out of Two is enough for me.  They sell these at box stores as well I have been told, I will see if there is a sale person willing to open the box at the store to see what we see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has been wonderful through all of this - bending over backward for the manufacturer&#x27;s failures.  Yet I am still left with a broken and fingerprint coated box of make-up that is not presentable as a gift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying, i&#x27;m a HUGE fan of e.l.f products, i&#x27;ll give them all a chance. But this collection just wasn&#x27;t as good as some of their other products. The eye shadow selection is pretty decent, there&#x27;s lots of nice neutral shades. And there&#x27;s also some funky colors mixed in. The bummer, is that the eye shadows are not terribly pigmented, even with a primer, they don&#x27;t show up as well as I had hoped. I&#x27;ve gotten other eye shadows from e.l.f in the past that were wonderful, these just weren&#x27;t the same quality. The eye shadows to leave a good deal of fall out too. Moving on, I do think the lip colors are very nice. They show up decently, and if there isn&#x27;t one you like, you can easily combine to make the perfect color. They aren&#x27;t too drying either, but still a little lip gloss on top wouldn&#x27;t hurt. The blush shades are also very nice, as well as the bronzers. The packaging is very nice, and this is small enough so that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. Not bad, but the eye shadows could definitely use a little work.</li>
            <li> powder everywhere. not even salvageable. so awful. And for some reason i can&#x27;t get a hold of anyone to return it. I&#x27;ve heard great things about elf makeup. I&#x27;m so upset about this purchase. :(</li>
            <li> We purchased this makeup set for our teenage daughter and she loves it. She is at the age that she enjoys experimenting with different looks and she has enjoyed using all of the various eye shadows, lipsticks and blushes to complete her desired look. We highly recommend this product. Just as a side note, the only issue was the make up was beaten around a bit in shipping and a few of the powders chipped slightly.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the only makeup that does not break me out :) and its affordable. The blush and eyeshadows are so pigmented i love the way it looks on my face, i dont usually where alot of makeup because i love my natural but this makeup enhances my beauty even more and I get alot of compliments with my makeup now.</li>
            <li> Really good one as I gave it as gift.</li>
            <li> This little collection is fab! It&#x27;s got a lot of colors, everything you need in a compact easy to travel with case. I&#x27;ll buy this again. I would recommend for anyone who likes color choices without having to have an entire closet of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The receiver of these gifts thought that the makeup set was very good and the books were also enjoyable.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice makeup kit. I had previously purchased a smaller one from Sephora that I loved.  But it&#x27;s no longer available so I bought this one.  I&#x27;ve tried e.l.f. products before and liked them. There are some good eye colors in the brights, but it leans mostly toward a neutral palette.  I am a more neutral girl where makeup is concerned, so this is great for me.  If you prefer bright colors, this kit may leave you feeling less than satisfied especially in the lipstick choices.  Also, you will find that some of the eye shades tend to be very very similar.  Almost duplicates.  That is good if those are your go-to shades because you have an extra. Some of the lipsticks--but not all-- have a slightly grainy feel.  Is that a sign of product age?&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wasn&#x27;t happy about:  All of the bronzers are the shimmer kind. I don&#x27;t rock the shimmer/party on a regular workday,so that was a bit of a disappointment.  Half of the blushes are shimmer shades also.&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side:  This is a perfect set if you need something to take when you travel. Case is convenient and the snap closure is tight enough that it won&#x27;t pop open in transit.&lt;br /&gt;On a regular day, I don&#x27;t carry any makeup with me so I never do makeup touch ups.  The shadows and blushes don&#x27;t fade throughout the day and lip colors last as long as any other standard stick.  Some of the red tones have a little stain and they stay on even longer.  At the most, I&#x27;ll add some more lip color or gloss.&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of reference:  I am of African descent with carmel skin color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift, it seems ok but when I received it powder was EVERYWHERE.  I had to wipe it with baby wipes before I could wrap it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my 16yo granddaughter. She LOVES it!</li>
            <li> El producto llego con una base rota. Exijo que me repongan el producto, que lo envíen con mejor embalaje  y que garanticen la llegada del producto en optimas  condiciones</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter for Christmas. As soon as she opened it, bronzer poured out of it. Unfortunately, it was the color she would&#x27;ve used. So we&#x27;re  sending it back and we refunded our money. Be aware that this may happen.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife and she loves it. there are a lot of options with this set and it travels well.</li>
            <li> Product came and was covered in powder.  My daughter opened and the powder inside was broken up and ruined all the make up .</li>
            <li> My daughter absolutly loved this. She was so excited to get this, she plays dress up all the time with it.</li>
            <li> love this product... :) brought for my sis.. she liked this item. and she appreciate it. she got appreciation from her frnds tooo...</li>
