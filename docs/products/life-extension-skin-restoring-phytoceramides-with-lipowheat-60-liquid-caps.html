            <li>my face has filled out.  </li>
            <li>He felt my face looked so smooth</li>

            <li>but overall, I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just in my first month of this supplement.  </li>
            <li>The first thing he asked was had I had a face lift.  </li>
            <li>In addition, when I told 3 other friends what I was trying, they must have liked what they saw because they all ordered the Life Extension Phytoceramides for themselves.</li>
            <li>I started using this pills two weeks ago just as an extra supplement , and I had forgotten what were they supposed to do when I send a picture to a friend who told me your skin look so smooth, then I also notice that when I was exposed to sunlight my skin felt really good and burned less.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect to take one pill and wake up the next day with everything fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much difference in minimizing my wrinkles...</li>
            <li>But how much longer?</li>
            <li>It really works not a miracle overnight</li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>My daughter even told me I look younger and how smooth my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking this for a month, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in any of my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Thanks Ellen &amp; Dr. Oz for the recommendation!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dr. Oz mentioned Phytoceramides on his show (not any particular brand) along with Vit C serum.  </li>
            <li>I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because you can always look a little bit better</li>
            <li>Like many of these claims they may well be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>While the science behind this idea sounds great,  the proof is in the actual results which I find lacking.  </li>
            <li>seems to be helping my 45 year old skin!  </li>
            <li>This is suppose to hydrate your skin but it does the exact opposite and just dries me out, I&#x27;m 26 and my skin was literally wrinkling when I took this</li>
            <li>Frequent buyer.</li>
            <li>I saw an old friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a year.  </li>
            <li>Within a few weeks you see a healthy difference in your facial skin.</li>
            <li>not much  don&#x27;t think there worth it</li>
            <li>I have been using the supplement for a long time and think it really helps.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped taking it and in time my skin has gone back to normal</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I started using this pills two weeks ago just as an extra supplement , and I had forgotten what were they supposed to do when I send a picture to a friend who told me your skin look so smooth, then I also notice that when I was exposed to sunlight my skin felt really good and burned less. Maybe this pills are as good as they claim but I have to keep using them to confirm 100%.</li>
            <li> My complexion is Better! Learned about this on Dr. Oz and I found this moisture in my skin to have improved.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was looking for miracles, but this wasn&#x27;t it.  I used the product for several months but noticed NO improvement at all.</li>
            <li> I have reorder this several time,</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference</li>
            <li> IF MY SKIN IS BETTER ,IT&#x27;S THE MIDDLE OF SPRING AND THE WEATHER IS DEFINATELY A FACTOR SO I CAN&#x27;T SAY IT&#x27;S THE CAPSULE,BUT IT&#x27;S NOT HURTING.SO I STILL TAKE THEM ANYWAY</li>
            <li> My only compliant is that they sent two small bottles as opposed to the large bottle pictured. Other than that, the pills seem to be working. I have a weird dry spot on my elbow that now seems to be softening up. I&#x27;ve tried everything on that spot (creams, oils, exfoliators, etc.) Anyway, I like it.</li>
            <li> Eh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much difference in minimizing my wrinkles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I have to give it more time?  But how much longer?</li>
            <li> I have been using the supplement for a long time and think it really helps.  I had VERY DRY cuticles and couldn&#x27;t find any outside cream, etc. that actually made any difference.  Then I heard about this product and started taking one a day along with fish oil  Now my cuticles are just fine even in the winter.  Of course, like anything else, it takes time.  Don&#x27;t expect to take one pill and wake up the next day with everything fine.  You need to take it for months before your skin begins to feel more hydrated.  Oh, and don&#x27;t forget to drink plenty of water as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I took this product long enough to see a difference</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works like it should.  Frequent buyer.</li>
            <li> It really works not a miracle overnight but I did notice a difference on my jaw line. It tightened up.</li>
            <li> Great item. Great price. Makes a huge difference on my jaw line and my skin is softer.will take these pills forever</li>
            <li> MADE MY SKIN MOIST AND CLEAR, NOW WAITING TO SEE IF MY DARK CIRCLES LIGHTEN OR GO AWAY</li>
            <li> seems to be helping my 45 year old skin!  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  It may take about two months to see any kind of difference, but I noticed a difference in my skin within two weeks.</li>
            <li> Just buy it....see for yourself....I personally have had amazing results.  I just reordered. This is a product I will take forever.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks you see a healthy difference in your facial skin. Forehead wrinkles are gone and my skin has a healthy glow.  Check around and you will find this is an excellent price.</li>
            <li> Great price. Fast delivery! Love it! Again, AWESOME!</li>
            <li> I have been taking one capsule now for just over 30 days and have not seen any results.  My husband is also taking one each day and has not seen any reduction of wrinkles or improvement to the skin.  Like many of these claims they may well be a waste of money.  While the science behind this idea sounds great,  the proof is in the actual results which I find lacking.  We will continue for one more month and see.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Phytoceramides for about 4 months now and noticed that in less than 2 weeks my hands, which had been extremely dry were smoother than they had been in ages.  I&#x27;m in my mid sixties so that alone was a nice result.  It took almost 6 weeks for me to notice lines diminishing some in my face and neck.  I actually had one friend ask what I used to make my face look so moist and &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; looking and the next day she ordered the product online. In addition, when I told 3 other friends what I was trying, they must have liked what they saw because they all ordered the Life Extension Phytoceramides for themselves. too.  I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 because you can always look a little bit better but overall, I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is suppose to hydrate your skin but it does the exact opposite and just dries me out, I&#x27;m 26 and my skin was literally wrinkling when I took this I looked about 85. I&#x27;ve stopped taking it and in time my skin has gone back to normal</li>
            <li> my face has filled out.  My daughter even told me I look younger and how smooth my skin looks.  Love it</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, very good price, i would buy again</li>
            <li> These pills with lipowheat, are the best says Dr. OZ, AND HE IS RIGHT.  GIve it a few weeks, but I felt firmness in my face, lines smoother.  Take one daily, will use as part of my daily regime</li>
            <li> Great product.  Use it all the time. Super fast delivery</li>
            <li> I tried this and love the improvement to my skin!  Less wrinkles and firmer skin on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this for a month, I really haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in any of my wrinkles. I have wrinkles around my mouth and neck mostly. I saw this on Dr Oz and the plastic surgeons recommended it so I am going to continue to take it. I will give it more time to see if I can see any difference in my skin all over. I am 56 and would like to see my skin look alittle better. I will post again in another month to let you know how it is coming along</li>
            <li> it really bring change in your skin but it kinda expensive .&lt;br /&gt;i m not taking other supplement except this one&lt;br /&gt;i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just in my first month of this supplement.  I&#x27;m almost 63 and have extremely dry skin in spite of all the creams, lotions, oils that I use.  My face is dry too but surprisingly for my age, I&#x27;m not too wrinkled.  Dr. Oz mentioned Phytoceramides on his show (not any particular brand) along with Vit C serum.  I&#x27;m trying it.  Hope to have good results!</li>
            <li> Thanks Ellen &amp; Dr. Oz for the recommendation!&lt;br /&gt;They took a couple months to kick in but Love the results!</li>
            <li> I saw an old friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in about a year.  The first thing he asked was had I had a face lift.  He felt my face looked so smooth he insisted on having the name of the supplement I was taking.</li>
            <li> still waiting for some results !!  I may have gotten some results but not much  don&#x27;t think there worth it</li>
            <li> I SAW NO IMPROVEMENT WHATSOEVER FROM THIS PRODUCT.  WOULD NOT PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> A watched poil never boils!  Started August 1st, and opened my second bottle September 2nd -  my deep laugh lines are 50% shorter - the bottom half have just seemed to disappear!!!</li>
            <li> would not be without it</li>
