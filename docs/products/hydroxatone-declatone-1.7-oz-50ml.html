    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product and seller would buy again</li>
            <li>The jar is very attractive.</li>
            <li>It did not do so great at hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li>was a welcome</li>
            <li>It applies nicely and the consistency is very good.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant smell</li>
            <li>I could NOT use my beloved Avon Anew products at all without reactions now, so this may just be their replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could NOT use my beloved Avon Anew products at all without reactions now, so this may just be their replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have good skin for my age, but the operative words are \\&quot;for my age\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I do think it was a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Despite that, I feel this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Give it about a week or so to work, and hopefully it will give the remarkable results I have been thrilled to get from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the remarkable results I have been thrilled to get from it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is very effective and non oily which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>This cream feels amazing and hydrates unlike anything I have ever used before.</li>
            <li>for anti-aging or firming, I&#x27;m kind of iffy here.</li>
            <li>so it kind of put me off a bit.</li>
            <li>I love the beautiful packaging but lets get to the important stuff.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It is more effective than anything I have ever used</li>
            <li>and I was pretty happy with the cream I was using before this (Kiels)</li>
            <li>it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The scent was very light</li>
            <li>Hydroxatone gets a lot of hype but the price is high, so I was very happy to get this opportunity to try it for free.  </li>
            <li>Look, if you want to look 23 again, you are not going to find that in any cream, but if you want a nice moisturizer, this is fine.</li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t get the $67 refund, which I accepted and was okay with.</li>
            <li>I do not like oily creams and was glad to see this is not</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this item.</li>
            <li>I was glad to get a chance to try it out with no strings attached (except for reviewing it for Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing it, but I&#x27;m sure it is helping to prevent additional aging.  </li>
            <li>both worked and smelled better for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t get better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream.</li>
            <li>I will definitely change this review though. :D</li>
            <li>But for sure this product is a wonderful, deep moisturizing cream that does hydrate my neck skin immediately without any unwanted side effects.</li>
            <li>love this cream.</li>
            <li>and I love the sun.</li>
            <li>There is not that wonderful fragrance that is in the original that I purchased directly from Hydroxatone.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing a good job maintaining and supporting what I have.</li>
            <li>This kind of problem does not go away quickly</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;m better off with coconut oil or shea butter, because I&#x27;m not convinced I need a special cream for every body part - too many bottles on the shelf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Description: This is a rich and luxurious cream with a light, fresh, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>She is extremely pleased with the performance and the smooth application.</li>
            <li>She tells me it has made her face feel so soft and smooth and has claimed it has helped shrink those pesky wrinkles around her eyes, even though I think she looks beautiful with or without this cream.</li>
            <li>The cream is light and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>but I felt it was just a little bit underwhelming when matched with the wordage on the box indicating it was a real superior product etc.</li>
            <li>makes my neck and chin smooth</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing, it actually feels like a gel-lotion hybrid.</li>
            <li>The good news is it didn&#x27;t make me break out, even though I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The cream is rich feeling and did seem to help with some of the fine wrinkles developing on my throat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>I have used and tested out a lot of really nice high end skin care on myself and others.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the claims that it is especially good for the neck are true, but in this dry winter weather, it is nice to have a bottle earmarked for that area, if only as a reminder to moisturize!</li>
            <li>Then I found out they had automatically enrolled me in a reshipment/recurring billing program, which I had originally said I did not want.</li>
            <li>strongest thing I&#x27;ve been able to use on my face was a Eucerin moisturizer, so I was hesitant to try the Hydroxatone at first.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see it making any special difference to my neck.  </li>
            <li>First, I think this cream really did do a nice job.  </li>
            <li>Received a sample and decided to buy a full size jar to try.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I love its consistency and scent, and the lovely blue jar in which it is provided.</li>
            <li>The creme is pretty light, no overbearing scent and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>This rich cream is excellent for use on the neck and throat, although I couldn&#x27;t give it a full five stars because it did occasionally leave my skin feeling slightly itchy.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light and it does not bother my somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazing how a tighter, smoother, and more moisturized neck area can make you feel younger and more relaxed especially when wearing certain neck lines.ve</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is amazing how a tighter, smoother, and more moisturized neck area can make you feel younger and more relaxed especially when wearing certain neck lines.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream for a week now and these advanced ingredients really do seem to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It makes my neck/chest skin just feel more comfortable, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate me, which is a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has more resiliency after using this cream, it looks dewy fresh and young.</li>
            <li>only thing I really liked is that the cream doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li>it is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the price, it&#x27;s pretty economical.</li>
            <li>Very pleased is what she told me and that they are exactly what she expected in moisturizing her neck.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t looked at the price yet, but the cream is smooth, the container is pretty, and I look normal after using it.</li>
            <li>The container is large &amp; attractive but contains very little product.</li>
            <li>First off, the product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Who knows, maybe one day we&#x27;ll be able to get total body lifts,</li>
            <li>Also, interestingly, a girlfriend said that it looks exactly like a creme from Avon just in a different box and label.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the weight of this cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed but the light scent that it does have reminds me of a plastic type scent.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used one that hasn&#x27;t ended up with my eyes swollen shut.</li>
            <li>and so the user needs to have patience and be willing to wait for a wrinkle-free neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I think they are more hype and not enough results for the price of the product.</li>
            <li>, I figured that I might have been too stingy with the cream and that by using more I could achieve the desired effect of a younger, firmer looking neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anything more than a basic moisturizer pretty much sends my face/neck into itchy blotchy swollen-ness.</li>
            <li>had no bad reactions or difficulties with this cream and highly recommend it to anyone who is really feeling discouraged with their neck, chin, and/or chest area.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that tight/pulling feeling when I turn my head like I normally get with basic moisturizers, so I am confident that this is helping my skin.</li>
            <li>Maybe women of a certain age are beyond the point where creams will make a difference.  </li>
            <li>The price is pretty high, but then they discontinued it.</li>
            <li>very hydrating.</li>
            <li>so that is really saying something.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much &#x27;wrinklage&#x27; or aging in these areas to begin with, so I think this is probably helping me maintain.</li>
            <li>The cream itself is VERY lightweight.  </li>
            <li>The cream works really well as a moisturizer</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think the results warrant spending so much money.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling hydrated the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not expect instant results when I started using Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this, although people with very sensitive skin may want to try a sample from a friend, first.</li>
            <li>I really like it and think you will to if you don&#x27;t mind the rather high price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge Avon Anew fan, but due to an allergic reaction to a foundation last year, my skin suddenly became hypervigilant about any kind of &#x27;anti aging&#x27; products.</li>
            <li>I sat and debated for awhile, saw some good reviews, and thought I would at least try it; if it made me break out, well that&#x27;s something others with sensitive skin might like to know too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only have about 3 more treatments left in the jar</li>
            <li>I began using the product twice a day on Jan. 5th and ran out on Feb. 17th, so there&#x27;s just about 6 weeks worth of product in the standard size jar which sells for $43.20 on Amazon as I write this review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I modified this down to 3 stars, and will say that while it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer, it&#x27;s not a purchase for me.</li>

            <li>feel confident Hydroxatone Declatone cream will at least reduce wrinkles and certainly improve the color and texture of the neck&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>I expected something a little heavier, but the consistency of this cream is fairly watery.</li>
            <li>I do find it important that this isn&#x27;t causing reaction to my skin at all, even after a facial peel, so that&#x27;s a big deal.</li>

            <li>I have very sensitive skin and often find that creams either feel like they are burning or give me a rash.</li>
            <li>I ordered a 30 day risk free trial of hydroxatone to get rid of undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li>I called to cancel whatever I was signed up for and to return this second shipment only to find out that I still owed them $67 for the first shipment because the first shipment contained TWO containers of the stuff and</li>
            <li>of the only creams I have tried which really worked is a high end cream from a company that begins with an L.  </li>
            <li>I really have noticed a softening of deep lines and the general appearance of my neck and chest is much improved.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>I have scarred the back of my neck by having too much sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sensitive to smell, and</li>
            <li>Where I use this (neck and chest) feels soft and supple and hydrated, and I don&#x27;t notice any crepiness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After just over a month of use five out of seven days a week every week, I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>for the next five days I decided to really layer it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen in advertised online with promises of amazing results and money-back guarantees (when I take advantage of such things, I always seem to get in trouble because I rarely get around to sending items back by the due</li>
            <li>cream and the packaging didn&#x27;t feel luxiourious or especially fine, and it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
            <li>I went past the risk free 30 day trial</li>
            <li>find that not using it for three days will get the skin back toward normal again</li>
            <li>I used this cream everyday for ten days straight and as far as I can tell, my decollete looks exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and Decollete Cream seemed like it might not work due to many of the reactions I read from people who had previously tried it.  </li>
            <li>like this product - the cream is thick and smooths on easily.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 and lucky that I don&#x27;t have the dried look yet</li>
            <li>the advertised amount was only for one so the actual cost of the first shipment is double what is advertised.</li>
            <li>It was supple when I first put it on, but would dry back up in a couple hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not better than Cerave dry skin cream ($15 for a huge tub) as far as moisture goes.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly surprised to find that only using once a day five out of seven days a week brings the same results that I was getting from the other higher priced cream which has now been discontinued.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin was a little smoother and looked a little better</li>
            <li>And so the potential for expected results is certainly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is rich and luxurious and it goes on delicately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not better than Cerave dry skin cream ($15 for a huge tub) as far as moisture goes.e boobage down with this stuff, just your neckline, so it goes far.</li>
            <li>There are plently of other moisturizers out there that feel the same &amp; will do the same as this one - at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying this with the idea of it actually doing something great to your skin, I think you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin, my share of wrinkles (I am 60)</li>
            <li>The cream dries quickly and leaves a soft feeling behind, not tacky at all.</li>
            <li>but in my experience it&#x27;s not any better than the more common and less expensive drug store</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I don&#x27;t see it making any special difference to my neck.  </li>
            <li> First, I think this cream really did do a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Received a sample and decided to buy a full size jar to try.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I love its consistency and scent, and the lovely blue jar in which it is provided.</li>
            <li> The creme is pretty light, no overbearing scent and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This rich cream is excellent for use on the neck and throat, although I couldn&#x27;t give it a full five stars because it did occasionally leave my skin feeling slightly itchy.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light and it does not bother my somewhat sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazing how a tighter, smoother, and more moisturized neck area can make you feel younger and more relaxed especially when wearing certain neck lines.ve</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is amazing how a tighter, smoother, and more moisturized neck area can make you feel younger and more relaxed especially when wearing certain neck lines.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a week now and these advanced ingredients really do seem to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It makes my neck/chest skin just feel more comfortable, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate me, which is a big plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has more resiliency after using this cream, it looks dewy fresh and young.</li>
            <li> only thing I really liked is that the cream doesn&#x27;t smell.  </li>
            <li> it is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the price, it&#x27;s pretty economical.</li>
            <li> Very pleased is what she told me and that they are exactly what she expected in moisturizing her neck.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t looked at the price yet, but the cream is smooth, the container is pretty, and I look normal after using it.</li>
            <li> The container is large &amp; attractive but contains very little product.</li>
            <li> First off, the product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Who knows, maybe one day we&#x27;ll be able to get total body lifts,</li>
            <li> Also, interestingly, a girlfriend said that it looks exactly like a creme from Avon just in a different box and label.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the weight of this cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed but the light scent that it does have reminds me of a plastic type scent.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used one that hasn&#x27;t ended up with my eyes swollen shut.</li>
            <li> and so the user needs to have patience and be willing to wait for a wrinkle-free neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think they are more hype and not enough results for the price of the product.</li>
            <li> , I figured that I might have been too stingy with the cream and that by using more I could achieve the desired effect of a younger, firmer looking neck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anything more than a basic moisturizer pretty much sends my face/neck into itchy blotchy swollen-ness.</li>
            <li> had no bad reactions or difficulties with this cream and highly recommend it to anyone who is really feeling discouraged with their neck, chin, and/or chest area.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that tight/pulling feeling when I turn my head like I normally get with basic moisturizers, so I am confident that this is helping my skin.</li>
            <li> Maybe women of a certain age are beyond the point where creams will make a difference.  </li>
            <li> The price is pretty high, but then they discontinued it.</li>
            <li> very hydrating.</li>
            <li> so that is really saying something.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much &#x27;wrinklage&#x27; or aging in these areas to begin with, so I think this is probably helping me maintain.</li>
            <li> The cream itself is VERY lightweight.  </li>
            <li> The cream works really well as a moisturizer</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think the results warrant spending so much money.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling hydrated the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not expect instant results when I started using Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this, although people with very sensitive skin may want to try a sample from a friend, first.</li>
            <li> I really like it and think you will to if you don&#x27;t mind the rather high price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Avon Anew fan, but due to an allergic reaction to a foundation last year, my skin suddenly became hypervigilant about any kind of &#x27;anti aging&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> I sat and debated for awhile, saw some good reviews, and thought I would at least try it; if it made me break out, well that&#x27;s something others with sensitive skin might like to know too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only have about 3 more treatments left in the jar</li>
            <li> I began using the product twice a day on Jan. 5th and ran out on Feb. 17th, so there&#x27;s just about 6 weeks worth of product in the standard size jar which sells for $43.20 on Amazon as I write this review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I modified this down to 3 stars, and will say that while it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer, it&#x27;s not a purchase for me.</li>

            <li> feel confident Hydroxatone Declatone cream will at least reduce wrinkles and certainly improve the color and texture of the neck&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> I expected something a little heavier, but the consistency of this cream is fairly watery.</li>
            <li> I do find it important that this isn&#x27;t causing reaction to my skin at all, even after a facial peel, so that&#x27;s a big deal.</li>

            <li> I have very sensitive skin and often find that creams either feel like they are burning or give me a rash.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 30 day risk free trial of hydroxatone to get rid of undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I called to cancel whatever I was signed up for and to return this second shipment only to find out that I still owed them $67 for the first shipment because the first shipment contained TWO containers of the stuff and</li>
            <li> of the only creams I have tried which really worked is a high end cream from a company that begins with an L.  </li>
            <li> I really have noticed a softening of deep lines and the general appearance of my neck and chest is much improved.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> I have scarred the back of my neck by having too much sun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smell, and</li>
            <li> Where I use this (neck and chest) feels soft and supple and hydrated, and I don&#x27;t notice any crepiness.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just over a month of use five out of seven days a week every week, I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> for the next five days I decided to really layer it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen in advertised online with promises of amazing results and money-back guarantees (when I take advantage of such things, I always seem to get in trouble because I rarely get around to sending items back by the due</li>
            <li> cream and the packaging didn&#x27;t feel luxiourious or especially fine, and it&#x27;s very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I went past the risk free 30 day trial</li>
            <li> find that not using it for three days will get the skin back toward normal again</li>
            <li> I used this cream everyday for ten days straight and as far as I can tell, my decollete looks exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and Decollete Cream seemed like it might not work due to many of the reactions I read from people who had previously tried it.  </li>
            <li> like this product - the cream is thick and smooths on easily.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 and lucky that I don&#x27;t have the dried look yet</li>
            <li> the advertised amount was only for one so the actual cost of the first shipment is double what is advertised.</li>
            <li> It was supple when I first put it on, but would dry back up in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better than Cerave dry skin cream ($15 for a huge tub) as far as moisture goes.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly surprised to find that only using once a day five out of seven days a week brings the same results that I was getting from the other higher priced cream which has now been discontinued.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin was a little smoother and looked a little better</li>
            <li> And so the potential for expected results is certainly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is rich and luxurious and it goes on delicately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better than Cerave dry skin cream ($15 for a huge tub) as far as moisture goes.e boobage down with this stuff, just your neckline, so it goes far.</li>
            <li> There are plently of other moisturizers out there that feel the same &amp; will do the same as this one - at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying this with the idea of it actually doing something great to your skin, I think you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin, my share of wrinkles (I am 60)</li>
            <li> The cream dries quickly and leaves a soft feeling behind, not tacky at all.</li>
            <li> but in my experience it&#x27;s not any better than the more common and less expensive drug store</li>
            <li> Also, for the record, it is very difficult for someone to judge changes to their own skin from the time you start using a product until the present time.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be rubbing your entire boobage down with this stuff, just your neckline, so it goes far.</li>
            <li> I hope they decide to change the scent  of this as it has a mild but not great scent.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, maybe less than half a teaspoon, to do your neck/chest.</li>
            <li> My wife reports:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Declatone cream for a few months now and while I cannot say there has been a major change in the overall appearance of my neck, I do believe there has been a lessening of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if it actually WAS old or if that is its scent.</li>
            <li> No real change, just a regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The cream is white and a little bit goes a long way to do the entire neck area and chest</li>
            <li> It is definitely different than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t produce extreme improvements but there definitely are some differences.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 59, and to quote the late, great Nora Ephron&#x27;s book title, \\&quot;I feel bad about my neck\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Nope,I still have dry</li>
            <li> Certainly not enough to warrant buying the product unless it continues to come down in price.</li>
            <li> The area under the chin is lifted slightly and the loose skin definitely looks observably</li>
            <li> I have a very dry Tzone, this did nothing to help the flakyness.</li>
            <li> I have to use a Q-tip to dig it out, the odd consistency makes it a little difficult to get a significant amount of product out of the jar without digging (and getting under your nails, ew!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: My skin feels soft and delicate and I see fewer wrinkles on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy, and it sinks in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this cream for obvious reasons, but after a few weeks of use, I notice no difference.</li>
            <li> I dip the tip of my finger in the jar 3 times each time I apply and a little bit goes a long way.</li>

            <li> so I recommend that it is used daily or at the least every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you have to use it</li>
            <li> I was anxious to try this because I have skin on the dry side.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is that the smell of the cream is not very appealing.</li>
            <li> After just three weeks of using this cream, the skin in this area looked less wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> I did not get a rash or feel like my skin was on fire, but as I said, I did feel slightly itchy at times.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact I have never bothered using a decollete cream in the past, and I have been using this one daily for the past few weeks, I have noticed no difference at all in the appearance and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Third, customer service is very rude.    </li>
            <li> It appears to be a very high-priced cold cream.</li>
            <li> Save yourself a lot of trouble and money, don&#x27;t buy this or anything else from this company.</li>
            <li> I firmly believe in this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about repurchase, when I get to the end of the jar I will update my review to reflect a yea or nay on that.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it takes for this cream to work, but it&#x27;s an expensive experiment.</li>
            <li> but by the last one, I was hoping to see dramatic results, but alas, I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>

            <li> I would say its ok/good, just not great.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend gave this to me to try out. No real change, just a regular moisturizer. It did not do so great at hydrating my skin. I have a very dry Tzone, this did nothing to help the flakyness. It was supple when I first put it on, but would dry back up in a couple hours. I am not a fan of something I have to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am just finishing a jar of the Declatone Neck and Decollete Treatment, and I noticed a big difference in my \\&quot;turkey neck\\&quot;.  My husband also noticed, so I am planning to purchase another jar. But NOT at the prices on the Hydroxatone website!!!  I currently apply sparingly morning and bedtime.</li>
            <li> First off, the product did nothing for me. It is just an expensive moisturizer.    Second, company makes misleading advertisement and cost of what you are actually getting.    Third, customer service is very rude.    Fourth, they sign you up for recurring shipments/billings when you explicitly say you don&#x27;t want to be enrolled.    What happened:    I ordered a 30 day risk free trial of hydroxatone to get rid of undereye dark circles. I went past the risk free 30 day trial so I couldn&#x27;t get the $67 refund, which I accepted and was okay with. Then I found out they had automatically enrolled me in a reshipment/recurring billing program, which I had originally said I did not want. I found this out because I got a second shipment. I called to cancel whatever I was signed up for and to return this second shipment only to find out that I still owed them $67 for the first shipment because the first shipment contained TWO containers of the stuff and the advertised amount was only for one so the actual cost of the first shipment is double what is advertised. SNEAKY, SNEAKY, SNEAKY. The customer service guy said I had to pay this balance or they wouldn&#x27;t cancel my reshipment membership. I was mad but paid for the other $67 so I can cancel it. Then the customer service person hung up on me. I had to call back to confirm everything with another person.    Save yourself a lot of trouble and money, don&#x27;t buy this or anything else from this company. There are numerous complaints posted online. I found out too late. ;/</li>
            <li> Excellent product and seller would buy again</li>
            <li> There is not that wonderful fragrance that is in the original that I purchased directly from Hydroxatone. This was a disappointment</li>
            <li> Gave my BW these pads for her neck. She is extremely pleased with the performance and the smooth application. Very pleased is what she told me and that they are exactly what she expected in moisturizing her neck.</li>
            <li> Received a sample and decided to buy a full size jar to try. smooth and clean. Not heavy. very hydrating. makes my neck and chin smooth</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for several weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;  I love the beautiful packaging but lets get to the important stuff.&lt;br /&gt;When using this I noticed a difference almost immediately.  I have scarred the back of my neck by having too much sun. It is more effective than anything I have ever used and I was pretty happy with the cream I was using before this (Kiels) so that is really saying something.  I do not like oily creams and was glad to see this is not one!&lt;br /&gt; I hope they decide to change the scent  of this as it has a mild but not great scent. The cream is very effective and non oily which is very important to me.  I really like it and think you will to if you don&#x27;t mind the rather high price.</li>
            <li> This cream is designed for the neck and bust.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smell, and I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s scent at all,  it&#x27;s vaguely chemical and not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream and the packaging didn&#x27;t feel luxiourious or especially fine, and it&#x27;s very expensive.  It goes in easily enough but I don&#x27;t see it making any special difference to my neck.  I got it through Amazon prime,  but I wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge Avon Anew fan, but due to an allergic reaction to a foundation last year, my skin suddenly became hypervigilant about any kind of &#x27;anti aging&#x27; products. Anything more than a basic moisturizer pretty much sends my face/neck into itchy blotchy swollen-ness. It looks like someone threw acid on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strongest thing I&#x27;ve been able to use on my face was a Eucerin moisturizer, so I was hesitant to try the Hydroxatone at first. I sat and debated for awhile, saw some good reviews, and thought I would at least try it; if it made me break out, well that&#x27;s something others with sensitive skin might like to know too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now, and I&#x27;ve been very shocked that there has been zero redness or reaction to this product on my face or neck. It does a great job of moisturizing, it actually feels like a gel-lotion hybrid. I have to use a Q-tip to dig it out, the odd consistency makes it a little difficult to get a significant amount of product out of the jar without digging (and getting under your nails, ew!) I can even use this after having done a facial peel and it doesn&#x27;t sting or burn or cause redness, it just feels like moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for anti-aging or firming, I&#x27;m kind of iffy here. Where I use this (neck and chest) feels soft and supple and hydrated, and I don&#x27;t notice any crepiness. It seems to be doing a good job maintaining and supporting what I have. I don&#x27;t have much &#x27;wrinklage&#x27; or aging in these areas to begin with, so I think this is probably helping me maintain. I don&#x27;t get that tight/pulling feeling when I turn my head like I normally get with basic moisturizers, so I am confident that this is helping my skin. It makes my neck/chest skin just feel more comfortable, and it doesn&#x27;t break me out or irritate me, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the price, it&#x27;s pretty economical. You don&#x27;t need much, maybe less than half a teaspoon, to do your neck/chest. You won&#x27;t be rubbing your entire boobage down with this stuff, just your neckline, so it goes far. I&#x27;m not sure about repurchase, when I get to the end of the jar I will update my review to reflect a yea or nay on that. I do find it important that this isn&#x27;t causing reaction to my skin at all, even after a facial peel, so that&#x27;s a big deal. I could NOT use my beloved Avon Anew products at all without reactions now, so this may just be their replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I modified this down to 3 stars, and will say that while it&#x27;s a nice basic moisturizer, it&#x27;s not a purchase for me. It&#x27;s not better than Cerave dry skin cream ($15 for a huge tub) as far as moisture goes.e boobage down with this stuff, just your neckline, so it goes far.

            <li> My neck has aged considerably this year, so I decided to try this product. The cream is light and goes on easily. The jar is very attractive. But I haven&#x27;t noticed a substantial difference with this cream after a month. It appears to be a very high-priced cold cream. If I am to spend money on a beauty product, I want to see a difference, especially after a month. I don&#x27;t know how long it takes for this cream to work, but it&#x27;s an expensive experiment. Glad I didn&#x27;t have to pay for this item. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this product, because it is pricey and because I have doubts about its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Maybe women of a certain age are beyond the point where creams will make a difference.  I have good skin for my age, but the operative words are \\&quot;for my age\\&quot;.  No matter what I use I can&#x27;t get rid of the lines or the appearance of lines on my neck.  I&#x27;m beginning to think that even if the lines could be made invisible, there would always be something to give my age, or anyone&#x27;s age away.  Who knows, maybe one day we&#x27;ll be able to get total body lifts, but until then, I don&#x27;t think any cream will ultimately make a difference.  Also, for the record, it is very difficult for someone to judge changes to their own skin from the time you start using a product until the present time.  Since we see ourselves in the mirror daily, we basically remember what we saw the day before, and changes, if they are to occur, take place over time.  That said, no one commented on any difference in my appearance since I started using this cream. I asked my husband if he saw any differences, and he tactfully said, \\&quot;Maybe\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this product out.  I&#x27;ve seen in advertised online with promises of amazing results and money-back guarantees (when I take advantage of such things, I always seem to get in trouble because I rarely get around to sending items back by the due date)and I was glad to get a chance to try it out with no strings attached (except for reviewing it for Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;I like this product - the cream is thick and smooths on easily.  The scent is very light and it does not bother my somewhat sensitive skin.  Is it making a difference on my 50+ year-old neck and decolletage?  After a month of use I&#x27;m not seeing it, but I&#x27;m sure it is helping to prevent additional aging.  As my mother used to say \\&quot;If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have used and tested out a lot of really nice high end skin care on myself and others.  One of the things that is difficult to deal with is the neck area. Sometimes when the neck gets saggy, it is hard to get it to change at all and it is frustrating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the only creams I have tried which really worked is a high end cream from a company that begins with an L.  The price is pretty high, but then they discontinued it. When you use it, it really does work, but if you stop, within a few days the skin returns to the way it was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and Decollete Cream seemed like it might not work due to many of the reactions I read from people who had previously tried it.  I stopped using any creams on my neck area for quite some time before testing out this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just over a month of use five out of seven days a week every week, I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.  The cream itself is VERY lightweight.  It has almost no fragrance at all.  The cream is white and a little bit goes a long way to do the entire neck area and chest too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am truly surprised to find that only using once a day five out of seven days a week brings the same results that I was getting from the other higher priced cream which has now been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neck area is tightened.  Skin is left plumped and moisturized.  I also found that it did take about 10 years off of the appearance, something which is VERY difficult to do.  The area under the chin is lifted slightly and the loose skin definitely looks observably different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that not using it for three days will get the skin back toward normal again so I recommend that it is used daily or at the least every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no bad reactions or difficulties with this cream and highly recommend it to anyone who is really feeling discouraged with their neck, chin, and/or chest area.  Give it about a week or so to work, and hopefully it will give the remarkable results I have been thrilled to get from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing how a tighter, smoother, and more moisturized neck area can make you feel younger and more relaxed especially when wearing certain neck lines.ve the remarkable results I have been thrilled to get from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is amazing how a tighter, smoother, and more moisturized neck area can make you feel younger and more relaxed especially when wearing certain neck lines.</li>
            <li> The cream works really well as a moisturizer but I didn&#x27;t have any visible improvement in my skin after using this for just over a month. The scent was very light but it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant smell so it kind of put me off a bit. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t be purchasing this cream as [[ASIN:B001JQLNMI Olay Professional Pro-X Hydra Firming Cream Anti Aging 1.7 Oz]] both worked and smelled better for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> Everyones skin is different and reacts differently to products. I was anxious to try this because I have skin on the dry side. The creme is pretty light, no overbearing scent and is not greasy. It says to use it am and at bed which I did. My skin was a little smoother and looked a little better but I felt it was just a little bit underwhelming when matched with the wordage on the box indicating it was a real superior product etc. I would say its ok/good, just not great. Also, interestingly, a girlfriend said that it looks exactly like a creme from Avon just in a different box and label.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact I have never bothered using a decollete cream in the past, and I have been using this one daily for the past few weeks, I have noticed no difference at all in the appearance and texture of my skin.  The good news is it didn&#x27;t make me break out, even though I have sensitive skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy, and it sinks in well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the weight of this cream. It&#x27;s not too thick and heavy, nor is it too thin either. I feel as though it nourishes and moisturizes the skin on my neck. My skin does feel tighter and firmer since I&#x27;ve been using it. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s worked miracles for me (I&#x27;m 51) but it has improved the overall look of my skin. The one thing I do not care for is the scent. It&#x27;s not heavily perfumed but the light scent that it does have reminds me of a plastic type scent. If there is one thing I&#x27;d change about this cream, that would be it. Overall, though, I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ll buy more. I&#x27;m allergic to every type of skin cream out there. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used one that hasn&#x27;t ended up with my eyes swollen shut. Just the scent alone will make them puffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t looked at the price yet, but the cream is smooth, the container is pretty, and I look normal after using it. It just doesn&#x27;t get better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth any price in my book.</li>
            <li> Look, if you want to look 23 again, you are not going to find that in any cream, but if you want a nice moisturizer, this is fine. I don&#x27;t know if the claims that it is especially good for the neck are true, but in this dry winter weather, it is nice to have a bottle earmarked for that area, if only as a reminder to moisturize!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream. I only have about 3 more treatments left in the jar and I don&#x27;t can&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I even took a before pic. I&#x27;m not sure how long you have to use it so maybe another jar might help? Anyway as it stands now, I am not impressed. I do think it was a good moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t cause a break out or rash so that is always a plus. If I wake up tomorrow and look and look like Angelina Jolie I will definitely change this review though. :D</li>
            <li> I did not expect instant results when I started using Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and D&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute; Cream and was not disappointed. But for sure this product is a wonderful, deep moisturizing cream that does hydrate my neck skin immediately without any unwanted side effects. And so the potential for expected results is certainly there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The promise is to eliminate wrinkles on the neck of whoever has a neck with wrinkles. This kind of problem does not go away quickly and so the user needs to have patience and be willing to wait for a wrinkle-free neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason Hydroxatone Declatone should work is that it contains Argireline which smoothes the skin by preventing the muscle contractions that result in wrinkles being formed. The cream also contains a skin-brightening ingredient that produces radiant skin and works against discoloration known as hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation describes skin cells that are darker than their surrounding cells, commonly known as \\&quot;blotchy\\&quot; skin. Causes include unprotected sun exposure or from popping pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident Hydroxatone Declatone cream will at least reduce wrinkles and certainly improve the color and texture of the neck&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> My bottle lasted just 3 weeks, but I think I noticed some improvement in my neck and chest area.  I sleep on my side, so my chest area is somewhat wrinkled now.  I have always used cream in this area (day and night), but I never notice a difference in skin quality.  After just three weeks of using this cream, the skin in this area looked less wrinkled.  The only complaint I would have is that the smell of the cream is not very appealing.</li>
            <li> This rich cream is excellent for use on the neck and throat, although I couldn&#x27;t give it a full five stars because it did occasionally leave my skin feeling slightly itchy. I have very sensitive skin and often find that creams either feel like they are burning or give me a rash. I did not get a rash or feel like my skin was on fire, but as I said, I did feel slightly itchy at times. Despite that, I feel this is a good product. The cream is rich feeling and did seem to help with some of the fine wrinkles developing on my throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this, although people with very sensitive skin may want to try a sample from a friend, first.</li>
            <li> This cream feels amazing and hydrates unlike anything I have ever used before. My skin has more resiliency after using this cream, it looks dewy fresh and young. I really have noticed a softening of deep lines and the general appearance of my neck and chest is much improved. I firmly believe in this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the cream: I dip the tip of my finger in the jar 3 times each time I apply and a little bit goes a long way. I expect this to last 3 months. The scent is light and fresh. The cream dries quickly and leaves a soft feeling behind, not tacky at all. It never leaves any residue on any of my clothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for a month now and I think I can actually see my neck skin getting smoother. I like the texture of it too. It is definitely different than any other cream I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of a complex cream for my neck and chest area. The cream is rich and luxurious and it goes on delicately. There is no tackiness or tightness. I have been using this cream for a week now and these advanced ingredients really do seem to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> First, I think this cream really did do a nice job.  It doesn&#x27;t produce extreme improvements but there definitely are some differences.  It applies nicely and the consistency is very good.  Applications last for several hours.&lt;br /&gt;But, the cost is truly prohibitive and I don&#x27;t think the results warrant spending so much money.  And that wasn&#x27;t even my biggest negative issue.  The cream has an \\&quot;old\\&quot; scent to it.  I smells like it has been forgotten on a shelf for a couple of years. I just felt like I was applying a cream that was past its expiration.  I could not find a date anywhere so I am not sure if it actually WAS old or if that is its scent.</li>
            <li> My wife Loves this cream. She tells me it has made her face feel so soft and smooth and has claimed it has helped shrink those pesky wrinkles around her eyes, even though I think she looks beautiful with or without this cream. But she is sold on it enough to have purchased another jar.</li>
            <li> My wife reports:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Declatone cream for a few months now and while I cannot say there has been a major change in the overall appearance of my neck, I do believe there has been a lessening of wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall keep using the product and give it four stars.  (I know these products take a while for transformation.)</li>
            <li> I have tried other products from Hydroxatone and I think they are more hype and not enough results for the price of the product. I was looking for something for my neck and chest. I am 40 and lucky that I don&#x27;t have the dried look yet and I am trying to keep it that way. This smells awful. If you are buying this with the idea of it actually doing something great to your skin, I think you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After using Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and Decollete Cream on my neck and upper chest for over a month I can say there is no noticeable difference in any discoloration or wrinkles of the skin. The moisturizing ability of the product does well but in my experience it&#x27;s not any better than the more common and less expensive drug store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible my neck and upper chest are not wrinkled and discolored enough to see noticeable results (I&#x27;m 47). I do see definite signs of age spots that I was hoping this product would help fade but no such luck.</li>
            <li> It made no sense to me having a moisturizer for my neck &amp; chest only.  So I used it on my face as well (which is showing signs of aging).  Over a month.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference.  My face &amp; neck look the same as when I started using it..  There are plently of other moisturizers out there that feel the same &amp; will do the same as this one - at a much lower price.  The container is large &amp; attractive but contains very little product.</li>
            <li> I used this cream everyday for ten days straight and as far as I can tell, my decollete looks exactly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for the next five days I decided to really layer it on, I figured that I might have been too stingy with the cream and that by using more I could achieve the desired effect of a younger, firmer looking neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Same as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strangely, with all this moisturizing you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d at least have banished my omnipresent dryness.  Nope,I still have dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing I really liked is that the cream doesn&#x27;t smell.  I hate perfumed products and this cream&#x27;s lack of fragrance was a welcome bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all in all, it is a very disappointing skin cream.</li>
            <li> This is a review of Hydroxatone Declatone Neck and Decollete cream.  I&#x27;m 59, and to quote the late, great Nora Ephron&#x27;s book title, \\&quot;I feel bad about my neck\\&quot; [[ASIN:0307276821 I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman]]. Hydroxatone gets a lot of hype but the price is high, so I was very happy to get this opportunity to try it for free.  I decided to do before, during, and after pictures so I could judge the effectiveness.  I began using the product twice a day on Jan. 5th and ran out on Feb. 17th, so there&#x27;s just about 6 weeks worth of product in the standard size jar which sells for $43.20 on Amazon as I write this review.  (Price changes quite often; a month ago it was $53.50.) No way to post my pictures but by the last one, I was hoping to see dramatic results, but alas, I don&#x27;t think so.  Perhaps a tiny bit, but perhaps not.  Certainly not enough to warrant buying the product unless it continues to come down in price.</li>
            <li> Got this cream for obvious reasons, but after a few weeks of use, I notice no difference. I expected something a little heavier, but the consistency of this cream is fairly watery. Think I&#x27;m better off with coconut oil or shea butter, because I&#x27;m not convinced I need a special cream for every body part - too many bottles on the shelf. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my wife. Here&#x27;s what she tells me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream. I have dry and sensitive skin, my share of wrinkles (I am 60) and I love the sun. As this cream was created for aging skin on the neck and decollete are, I wanted to try it. For three weeks I applied it in the morning and in the evening before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: My skin feels soft and delicate and I see fewer wrinkles on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Description: This is a rich and luxurious cream with a light, fresh, pleasant scent. The moment I apply it to my neck and chest it is quickly absorbed. It doesn&#x27;t leave any any film so won&#x27;t stain my blouse if I dress immediately after applying it. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: I am a fan of this product. I love its consistency and scent, and the lovely blue jar in which it is provided. Only four stars, however, since it is a bit expensive.</li>
