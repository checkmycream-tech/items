            <li>It works good</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>But, the blade by itself does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good sturdy grip</li>
            <li>Good razor for its use in &amp;#34;bodygrooming&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>A good idea.</li>
            <li>A good trimmer will do it with one swipe.  </li>
            <li>good luck...</li>
            <li>Run time is good and it has plenty of power</li>
            <li>It works about as good as a $10 electric razor.</li>
            <li>Good shaver.</li>
            <li>This is just my experience - good luck with your search.  </li>
            <li>3 Years of use for a $30 product is a good deal in my opinion</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with 3 attachments of varying lengths so it would be good for trimming and maintaining hair around the neck and sideburns, and should be good for removing body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had one before which worked good except for the switch that broke and would not let one repair it.</li>
            <li>Really good.</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li>and I was hopping to try it out myself eventually, you know just for good measure.</li>
            <li>Good for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Really takes awhile to take hair off.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Good for men with medium body hair.</li>
            <li>Loved the reviews</li>
            <li>Good combination of usability and attachements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it works good.</li>
            <li>its battery is also good.</li>
            <li>Really good product.</li>
            <li>let it sink in, http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Essence-Jojoba-4-Ounce-Bottle/dp/B001CMT8DA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426424426&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;desert+jojoba - Use a good shave cream v foam</li>

            <li>It comes in a nice box that makes a very nice presentation.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice, handy shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li>thanks amazon for offering great products/ reviews and excellent shipping!!</li>
            <li>This could be important as they use this razor to shave places I wouldn&#x27;t with what they say are very good results.</li>
            <li>Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the most &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; bits, but great for keeping chesthair, arm hair, etc a manageable length without looking like Bigfoot.</li>
            <li>Your girlfriend/wife/lovers are gonna love it, and get h***y (happy) easier.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but I have experienced more grabbing and pulling of hair then using then products used before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great price and a smooth product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to how it runs or feels, having never used it myself, but as the girlfriend having to deal with the aftermath, I can say that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li>In fact the trimmer has been designed as well, making a great product even better.</li>
            <li>quality build, with good instructions, presented in a nice way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Very happy with this razor and the price was right.</li>
            <li>its best to practice on your leg to get it right then be patient and go for it.  </li>
            <li>You have to hold it and angle it the right way to get the best results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very nice to be able to take this in the shower with me with no fear of damaging it.</li>
            <li>Love this groomer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this groomer!</li>
            <li>This is safe!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this product is mostly advertised to men, because it is for women too!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>and more so than that, it was on the shaft!</li>
            <li>I love my philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great body groomer.</li>
            <li>Pros:  waterproof, holds a good charge, works fairly well, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Very nice and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>A great product for body grooming and cheap too.</li>
            <li>Fantastic upgrade to a great product.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, does not scrape, does not make me bleed, leaves the skin smooth and</li>
            <li>and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>However, using this body groomer has been amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as effective on the face as it is on the body</li>
            <li>nice groomer for the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have them around just to know that in case I need them, I have them.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom is an excellent choice and currently it is being sold at a GREAT price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, an effective device for the man that needs a hand held, chargeable body groomer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s waterproof, but what is the point of a razor that doesn&#x27;t effectively trim hair?</li>
            <li>nice close shave..highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>More than a fair trade in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice stand and holds it&#x27;s charge about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the addition of the clippers</li>
            <li>Handy cleaning brush, charging stand and AC</li>
            <li>, this is a handy trimmer to have around.  </li>
            <li>While the pinching/stinging of hair-pulling was manageable, a slower glide over the skin was effective in reducing the pinch of pulled-hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While the pinching/stinging of hair-pulling was manageable, a slower glide over the skin was effective in reducing the pinch of pulled-hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: thank you have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was kind of freaking</li>
            <li>Very excellent especially in sensitive areas .....</li>
            <li>Perfect for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space</li>
            <li>Shaves nicely and seems to hold a charge well.  </li>
            <li>Loved it, might have better products, but for the cost , i like it.</li>
            <li>Good product from Philips :)</li>
            <li>This is a nice compact product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly noisy and you won&#x27;t be able to shave in discretion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re wanting to do.</li>
            <li>After reading all the great reviews, I though that this would be a very useful product.</li>
            <li>Not QUITE as close is a blade but very useful and great value</li>
            <li>works great for underarms chest and pelvic area for people that don&#x27;t want razor burns or irritation , had to switch to electric do to razors giving me skin tags , shaves pretty good ass</li>
            <li>The shaver nestled nicely in my hand and was very easy to control.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed with the battery life too, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I highly recommend this and do not let my statements about the battery not holding a charge sway your judgement, I am not he best about keeping it charged</li>
            <li>Ladies, this shaver will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li>the jump to this shiny new model and am very happy.  </li>
            <li>: The best I can suggest you is to buy a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy</li>
            <li>Fortunately Amazon has great customer service and I was able to return this product.  </li>
            <li>So far, this has been a great shaver and does a great job for my needs.</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that it comes fully charged and with a excellent warranty.</li>
            <li>The razor did a good job trimming corse chest hairs and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>But, it is very easy to use and you won&#x27;t see/feel stubble for about 24 hours, so before the shower is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very easy to use while in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use in or out of the shower</li>
            <li>Sure, some areas you will have to go over twice, but it still gets the job done better than a manual razor would!</li>
            <li>Great item, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>The included comb attachments are suitable for trimming without shaving.</li>
            <li>and I did use it to trim sideburns effectively and safely.</li>
            <li>Great product and worth the money</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite hairy, so through the years I collected shavers and trimmers of all kinds, so far, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Found this in a Wal-Mart and have been highly impressed thus far.</li>
            <li>This product is good, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all just smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>that I never felt the foil blade was effective in shaving anything more than a day or two of hair growth.  </li>
            <li>This product has turned into my BEST hair removal buddy because it is easy and GENTLE.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten good run times before the battery needs recharging and it has been very easy to keep the shaving head clean.  </li>
            <li>Great for keeping one manscaped in all the right areas.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to use, and shave all kinds of hair on your body!  </li>
            <li>a great personal razor no nicks no cuts wont tear through a 2 week beard but does great as a weekly trimmer</li>
            <li>though is break the oil barrier on your skin by showering with a good soap, then this Body Groomer works fantastic.  :)</li>
            <li>The product worked as promised, remove every millimeter of hair, I am very happy with my new clean body shaved look!</li>
            <li>but this one has great attachments that let you quickly keep things nice and neat, clean, without the pain</li>
            <li>Very smooth cut.</li>
            <li>its a very smooth cutter</li>
            <li>This works and it works good, quick and</li>
            <li>U can be quick with it and a good job.</li>
            <li>it is a reasonable price and a piece good device does the job, I love it!</li>
            <li>better be for I punched it ,</li>
            <li>and this is much, much better.</li>
            <li>I also have used the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; model (BG 2040), which is a much better product.  </li>
            <li>More durable and better shaving.  </li>
            <li>At the price, this model is ok, but if you can, buy the pro model -</li>
            <li>Like some others report, this electric shaver is ok.</li>
            <li>It does look and feel kind of cheaply made, and it takes 8 hours to charge fully.</li>
            <li>Recommend for sure.</li>
            <li>but this product is more like a face shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Norelco BG2028 after using Wahl clippers for many years.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the t edger I was using before.</li>
            <li>Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>Okay time to charge.</li>
            <li>if no luck...there are two torque screws at top under the foil...will see what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>you do put on any one of the three combs, make sure you hear that snap and turn on the shaver to ensure it won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>All in all, wherever I used the Bodygroom I got a nice smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li>I bought this as the excellent Bodygroom BG2030 has been discontinued...and I wanted a trimmer for my second home.  </li>
            <li>also made the mistake of waiting more than 30 days to try to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with this craptastic trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>most of us don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly got it because there are places on my neck that I alway cut muself trying to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li>this manmower and be smooth!</li>
            <li>This makes shaving more convenient in someways</li>
            <li>but I would recommend that a standard razor be used in conjunction with it to be the best shave.</li>
            <li>I mostly use this on my bikini area and underarms, but have used it on my legs too here</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>I love this, and I never worry about nicks, or cuts.</li>
            <li>Love this body shaver .</li>
            <li>ok</li>

            <li>So if your looking for the five oclock shadow, your going to love it.  </li>
            <li>I hoped that this would be able to shave all the body hair, even if it had been weeks of growth.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that you&#x27;ll pay much  more for anything better,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I was only testing it on my leg and was so impressed i went downtown and finished everything else off.</li>
            <li>It charges quickly-a problem with many items that are rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>but I am quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I do appreciate the results :)</li>

            <li>and he was fairly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>short, the greatest compliment</li>
            <li>- it worked ok under my arms.  </li>
            <li>It was more like 2 days AFTER a razor.</li>
            <li>Think of it as a lawnmower for body hair - it&#x27;s a bit more of a blunt instrument than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>Love this &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; groomer.  </li>
            <li>Okay fellow males.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased at the results I am able to achieve once I mastered the angle.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is okay, but could be improved.</li>
            <li>Great modern design.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Honesty makes this world a better place.</li>
            <li>I suppose its OK.</li>
            <li>my goods is smooth AF!</li>
            <li>I seem to be gaining more shaving time per charge with this use.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I bought this for my now ex  boyfriends birthday</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Found BG2020 works better than this one, but still does the job.</li>
            <li>great product, great price and arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li>If you are monogamous, your monogamy will go better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li>it just needs to cut better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>I would also be able to use it.</li>
            <li>I shave everything but the top of my head for cycling.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice charging stand, and it fits comfortably in the hand.  </li>
            <li>It works much better</li>
            <li>Three trimmer clip attachments of varying heights should satisfy most grooming preferences.  </li>
            <li>The charging station is more appealing and practical as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Body Groomer, so I am a &amp;#34;novice&amp;#34; with this type of thing.  :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to hold your breath when manscaping, it feels safe to use in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li>i love this shaver.</li>
            <li>I also thought it comical that Andy&#x27;s suggestion was that I buy another product from you.</li>
            <li>The most notable difference between this type of shaver and a Wahl designed for the head is that the clipper guide isnt pointy..</li>
            <li>and we was satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I look 100% better.</li>
            <li>I will just have to rely on that until I find something better.</li>
            <li>I am sooo pleased of this product.</li>
            <li>recommend you buy another one with more payment.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems since I got it, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>You have to angle it appropriately in order to trim thicker hair, but once you get used to it</li>
            <li>I find it does an exceptional job quickly and with appropriate results.</li>
            <li>It took 8 hours or more to charge and seemed that after that charge, you had perhaps one shave, or 10 or 20 minutes to use before the battery was drained again.</li>
            <li>If you are satisfied with their sizes, it&#x27;s a product to buy.</li>
            <li>My son convinced me I need to modify some of the more &amp;#34;foresty&amp;#34; parts of my anatomy.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s more daring and uses a razor.</li>
            <li>FYI, looking closely at the clippers, the design is ingenious.  </li>
            <li>but you better have patience.  </li>
            <li>I figured purchasing the newest version of the Bodygroom would be a safe bet.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the fact that this is waterproof and prefer to use it in the shower (easier cleanup).</li>
            <li>But if you need to shave and trim a lot, this is probably one of the better products for it.</li>
            <li>I had another model of the philips bodygroom and my broke after I drop it many times.</li>
            <li>I was a hairy dude, I just bought it and I am loving it clean and clyear body.</li>
            <li>This model is a great step up from the older models.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaver and decent razor.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to hold in your hand and easy to charge.  </li>
            <li>This is cool and nice to use</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Holds a pretty good charge&lt;br /&gt;Foils</li>
            <li>However, he loved it after first try</li>
            <li>the Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a pretty good example of that.  </li>
            <li>good razor, and affordable, exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>This was a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product and does what ever Philips claims it to do.</li>
            <li>Easy to control, and I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li>This razer is amazing because I can use it in the shower and it shaves super close.</li>
            <li>Bottom line: it is quick, effective, and cuts close.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li>Once you are done shaving you would realize that it has shaved better than the most available in the market.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and hardy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is also a really rare piece of shaving equipment because it&#x27;s safe to use on pubic areas!</li>
            <li>Battery lasts about an hour before recharge, but recharge light is a nice improvement over original models-no guess work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work to shave the frank or the beans, but for trimming it works excellently, and on flat surfaces you can also shave with it pretty effectively.</li>
            <li>Rather slim compared to most bodygroomers which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Great for use on the sensitive nether-regions.  </li>
            <li>You can even use it when its wet, perfect in the shower.  </li>
            <li>So far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Its able to keep your body groomed or as smooth as can be.</li>
            <li>Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really work good when it comes to trimming body hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li>Very useful and women will love.</li>
            <li>cuts nice and clean but not too clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy to use and gives good results.</li>
            <li>other than that one downside, the product is brilliant and well worth the price for the good job it does.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good enough for me, i love it!</li>
            <li>Better than the original</li>
            <li>I use this device to shave all my chest hair, but what I like best about this product is that I am able to adjust it, using the enclosed combs, so a little or a lot of hair remains.</li>
            <li>easy to use , this is an easy way to get the beast under control.&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>battery life seems better than advertised, and the design (including the charging station) is sleek, simple, and attractive.</li>
            <li>I reported it to Amazon and got an easy exchange.</li>
            <li>I have used this prduct for body hair trmming , it is easy to use and charge</li>
            <li>Easy to use and</li>
            <li>easy to grip and use</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and recharge (which is not needed too often).</li>
            <li>It was so easy that I am not going to have a problem using it once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Three adjustable heads that are easy to attach and detach&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>The charge ( for me ) lasts about 2 weeks, and can easily be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>It has an easy set up and its rechargeable and cordless which is a plus</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>the blades are that strong.  </li>
            <li>The older ones were good, but these seem to pull on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product, however it is very easy to loose the attachments that were included.</li>
            <li>Use when hat is dry and cool works awesome!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While my main use may be for body shaving, the BODYGROOM&#x27;s most effective role may be that of a hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While my main use may be for body shaving, the BODYGROOM&#x27;s most effective role may be that of a hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I got this new one and Its really good.</li>
            <li>Works fine for me!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>This product is fine.  </li>
            <li>but I imagine that it would work fine for that as well.</li>
            <li>A perfect improvement on previous models.</li>
            <li>Pull skin taught and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for about 5 months, now it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li>I was very happy to find this on Amazon for half of what I have paid elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I enjoy how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well for fine hair, but chokes and pulls on thicker or denser hair.</li>
            <li>This is best used in areas like chest, and -ahem- &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; that have less dense hair</li>
            <li>Another nice feature is how easy it is to clean just by rinsing with hot water.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very useful.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love the Bodygroom, i love how easy to use and gentle</li>
            <li>Perfect for what its designed for, if a little pricey.</li>
            <li>I just took a trip to Cabo in Mexico and this little guy was my best freind there!</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product that i have purchased so far from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and believe it or not, the instructions with it are clear and concise.</li>
            <li>This thing is way inferior, it just doesn&#x27;t shave as smoothly.</li>
            <li>Same great product.</li>
            <li>This body groomer works fantastic, is so lightweight</li>
            <li>Great male body</li>
            <li>If you are looking for smooth skin, this is not it.  </li>
            <li>I have more success with hair clippers and a razor.  </li>
            <li>It is a great product which will work for people that have an abundance of bodily hair growth.  </li>
            <li>The device is also suited for use without the combs to get a relatively smooth shave (yes, I tested it, on a lower leg area, be forewarned, I can see the trimmer pinching if the skin is not taut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li>That helps it win some points back in my book.</li>
            <li>Smooth close shave, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>I cannot give personal feedback, but I know the recipient was happy with it.</li>
            <li>Making it smooth as a babies butt.</li>
            <li>It does what it is supposed to it smoothly.</li>
            <li>The groomer is light weight and shaves with a smooth touch.  </li>
            <li>Great body shaver, I&#x27;ve used this on my groin, legs, back, neck, armpits, and &#x27;crack&#x27;.</li>
            <li>its cheap</li>
            <li>It slides smoothly along the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs well in the shower, is easy to clean, and keeps a great charge, only needing to charge it after 5-6 shaves spaced days apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get it as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but I does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li>my smooth, hairless beer belly.</li>
            <li>As an European, I am a great fan of brAun.</li>
            <li>Great for legs, arms and back.</li>
            <li>but I was amazed by how light this model was compared to others in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d need instructions, but they are important for a level of comfort and use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain</li>
            <li>For the price it is a great buy overall.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Philips also offers good customer service.</li>
            <li>This gets those places perfectly &amp; to my surprise also works very well for my facial hair.</li>
            <li>and I was more than pleased with how fast I could trim.</li>
            <li>It offers a good reach</li>
            <li>Good for trimming the old bush.</li>
            <li>After using an electric beard trimmer to shave my chest and lower regions for awhile, I have found this device to be far superior and safer.  </li>
            <li>- I didn&#x27;t find it to be very useful.</li>
            <li>It was very useful to me.</li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of the original Bodygroom.  </li>
            <li>You will feel more &#x27;pull&#x27; than you would with a regular razor or electric shaver, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer head does snap off easily to allow access for cleaning and Philips Norelco seems to have provided a better, more secure housing to lessen the likelihood of the razor head/foil from popping off unexpectedly.  </li>

            <li>this would do a good job on a first pass, to be followed up with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the foil blade apparatus was easily clogged and required continuous rinsing to function at a barely adequate level.  </li>
            <li>And for below the waist, it really is very safe and effective as the other reviewers wrote, the result is surprisingly smooth without any cuts or irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I think the manual suggests dry but gentle soap and water in the shower worked best for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like it would be safe at first glace.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different groomers, but this is the most i like it ever !</li>
            <li>Great to do some manscaping, doesn&#x27;t do to good on the middle of your back, and this is all I know,</li>
            <li>I am glad I was made aware of this product.  </li>
            <li>I had an original model, got a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this groomer, but it is a lightweight device designed for sensitive shaving areas.</li>
            <li>As usual Philips made a great product!</li>
            <li>A full charge took about 8hrs before the charging light turned off.</li>
            <li>They can give you a good pinch if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>We had in plugged in for the full time and never saw the light change.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it rather remarkable how regular clippers will shred you, but these won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This works great when used on dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I even use it on my face regularly with great success.</li>
            <li>Pulls and does not provide a clean trim.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was just a tiny bit more effective.</li>
            <li>Might be worth purchasing the next model up, if you want to keep your man and/or yourself happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Lets dispense with the one thing I did not like and that was how to remove the grill to clean it.</li>
            <li>, therefor I needed something to trim up and clean up &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; for my fiance</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s safe to use on one&#x27;s most sensitive flesh too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>is by far the best big ball sac trimmer made.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>With the old one, the shaving was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>sound is like a turbo motor which I have gotten use do and having some thick shaving lather is awesome to compliment indeed.  </li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is designed to help maintain clean looking body hair, specifically below the neck.  </li>
            <li>do so cleanly.</li>
            <li>Cuts quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The blade can be cleaned out and it comes with this mini 2-sided brush to get into the grooves of the blades if you want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li>(Could just be my skin type is very sensitive to this kind of product)</li>
            <li>the shaver is great because it doesn&#x27;t leave any shaving burn and limited stubble if any.</li>
            <li>Pretty good, shaves fairly close a few pulls here and there.</li>
            <li>Works well, went right through all my hair without issue -- easy to clean</li>
            <li>If you purchased this relative inexpensive shaver for the right reasons, you should be happy with its performance.</li>
            <li>This one takes many swipes so of you have a large area you are doing, its gonna take a while.  </li>
            <li>-- that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for, and it says so right in the manual!</li>
            <li>Priced right!</li>
            <li>Norelco got it right!</li>
            <li>The middle fine hair razor doesn&#x27;t grab and pull your hair at all and feels very safe on areas below the waist.  </li>
            <li>Works great, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>This Noreclo BG2028 looks more modern and is definately trimming better/easier than my 1st groomer.</li>
            <li>Comes with a bunch of attachments, more than I could really use</li>
            <li>so the only thing its good for is maybe a beard trimmer .</li>
            <li>but overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend to anybody considering to get a good body groomer.</li>
            <li>Good basic electric razor.</li>
            <li>Last, the 2040, looks good in the pictures, but it&#x27;s a pain to charge and clunkier to use than the rest of them.  </li>
            <li>At this price, you really can&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li>The razor is simple to charge and has some good accessories.</li>
            <li>The good news I didn&#x27;t get any redness or welts that a regular razor would do.</li>
            <li>It works best on less-course hair, or at least hair that isn&#x27;t as concentrated.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>A full charge takes 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps the 50 minute run time on a full charge will get you by while you are away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>But if you do it somewhat frequently, you&#x27;ll have no problem shaving your face and getting a pretty dang good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a bad idea to look neat, well attended to</li>
            <li>Feels like the natural evolution of what was already a pretty good design.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about this shaver is a full charge seems to last a while.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and really cut down on the amount of money I spend at a salon every month.</li>
            <li>The stand is nice and will keep it out of the way - it does not tip over easily like the last one I had.</li>
            <li>All that hair below the neckline is buzzed away pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product is very good, long lasting battery, more so then I thought.</li>
            <li>Using the #1 guard on this trims it to the perfect length - it&#x27;s short enough that it looks good, yet not so short that it becomes prickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily the replacement was easy to find and order and was not expensive.</li>
            <li>This little shaver sure is superior to anything I&#x27;ve used that wasn&#x27;t designed for body hair.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s incapable of getting a nice, super smooth shave like you expect from a traditional razor and some nicer electric</li>
            <li>Although this Bodygroom is marketed toward a younger male audience, it is undoubtedly an excellent unisex product.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend this product to anyone, great quality and very affordable.</li>
            <li>I can quickly trim up and not get knicked.</li>
            <li>Makes quick work of manscaping my nether regions.</li>
            <li>If you can find a 2030 model - it&#x27;s tremendous.  </li>
            <li>I owned an older model and this one is so much better that there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a body trimmer/shaver as a male, you do not have to look any further or buy the $70 version of this thing, this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is the best thing possible for personal hygiene.</li>
            <li>This unit can pay for itself quickly, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li>Unit came quickly and I charged it up</li>
            <li>Its light weight, easy to handle, and it does what its suppose to, I&#x27;m happy that i didn&#x27;t listen to the negative re​views  </li>
            <li>highly recommend it for safe body grooming.</li>
            <li>One of the things I like most is that, guard-less, it&#x27;s a very effective razor; in a pinch I can shave my face as I&#x27;m driving to wherever I&#x27;m already late.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty light.</li>
            <li>For long hair it is extremely good and does what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li>Works great, love that I can use it in the shower, the button is easy to depress and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Great product, been using an older model for around ten years.</li>
            <li>He has his main trimmer to keep his mountain man beard neat, mini foil shaver for a smooth &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34;, and now this one for smooth &amp;#34;berries&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>it left my legs very smooth and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It is a trimmer - you will have pointy fuzz that are very minute to the eye when you feel the skin - maybe a easy shave to follow up will be needed.</li>
            <li>However, the foil actually broke while I was using it in the shower and it nicked me pretty good.</li>
            <li>Washing the blades are easy and fast</li>
            <li>I bought the first version back in 06 and loved it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really clears the hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever, is very comfortable, small and really does not hurt the skin as above, the recharge time is a bit long but worth is great</li>
            <li>With as many implements required to keep our house lawn looking great, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised he requires several different styles for his personal grooming, lol.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>does exactly what it supposed to!</li>
            <li>This is my third one and I love how easy it is to use on unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li>Seems to self clean pretty well with just a tap.</li>
            <li>This Bodygroom has a great design, is easy and convenient to use wet OR dry, and changing trimming lengths is super easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I have not tried any of the competitors products, I feel no reason to as I could never ask anything more from this handy little device.</li>
            <li>Its also amazing on my chest and back.  </li>
            <li>, it saves u from using a real shaver and is a huge time saver.</li>
            <li>Great for sculpting and keeping heavy growth areas under control</li>
            <li>Enjoy that thing☺ make my body shaving much quicker and easier</li>
            <li>The instructions said the light would change when the device was ready for use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: It was an absolute pleasure to use this tool, and I am comfortable after the work was done.  </li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>It worth it</li>
            <li>If you want to have a try go with the Norelco professional model, it might be it works better.</li>
            <li>It has an ergonomic feel and it far from bulky, something that will give any user more control when they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although I liked the Braun Cruzer, this one definitely outperformed it.</li>
            <li>For trimming my chest, I find it more comfortable than the regular trimmer because the combs have rounded tips.</li>
            <li>Well worth the selling price</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It takes care of the most sensitive areas also.</li>
            <li>You do have to hold it at a more awkward angle for it to work its best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this as a complimentary shaver, but if you want that skin-tight shave, you&#x27;ll need something else.</li>
            <li>Love this product so far.</li>
            <li>but was not crazy about the pivoting head.</li>
            <li>Works great, but this was purchased to replace one that was only 5 years old and just died.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>And of course, I have to nicely package the unit and send it back via UPS just to get my refund?!</li>
            <li>I dont know if the performance is worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy and comfortable when it&#x27;s done, but quite the chore when left undone for too long--but not anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>definitely worth purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the BG2028 to be as effective as one could expect for such a device.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I felt the BG2028 is a sturdy and effective body shaver/trimmer ... a vast improvement in quality over the 2020.</li>
            <li>worth consideration.</li>
            <li>before the low battery light starts blinking and maybe 1 or 2 more uses after that before it dies.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my most regrettable purchase.  </li>
            <li>The razor is plenty powerful and does the job.  </li>
            <li>This thing feels nice in the hand and powered up after charging, however IT SIMPLY DOESN&#x27;T CUT HAIR.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I can&#x27;t say this is really worth the $40 price tag though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent whole body shaver with good cutting ability, solid battery life, and an easy to clean design.</li>
            <li>Works very well and is very powerful.</li>
            <li>As long as you aren&#x27;t expecting a razor close shave (it&#x27;s an electric shaver, so if you want it that smooth it&#x27;ll take a little more time), this is great.</li>
            <li>This one feels even more solid than the original.</li>
            <li>It works much better than many of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>charger is nice and it feels good in your hand when using, I give it four stars all around for at least giving me a decent face shave without water or shave cream.</li>
            <li>Overall a good and decent product.</li>
            <li>For the former two, it really doesn&#x27;t work that great, although it does work better, say, in the shower than totally dry.</li>
            <li>I have another groomer that cuts right through no problem.  </li>
            <li>right out the box the BG2028 handled like a pro</li>
            <li>Buy it right now.</li>
            <li>You could go swimming right away lets us say it that way.</li>
            <li>I had a brAun body groomer, and once I got this, I understood that I had made the right choice.</li>
            <li>a positive note: This does not nick my skin!</li>
            <li>Use it for below the belt area, works very well.. clean shave.</li>
            <li>had the first gen model which tended to nick and cut in the most sensitive places.  </li>
            <li>On a full charge I was able to trim my entire body from winter growth.  </li>
            <li>Does not cut quite as closely as a previous one owned, but maybe feel better after more use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the significantly higher price.</li>
            <li>Leave your shave so smoothly almost hairless like a normal blade</li>
            <li>suitable for female use unless you don&#x27;t mind stubble as it does not shave as close as a razor.</li>
            <li>This thing is AMAZING, I told my girlfriend earlier that she just became my second favorite thing in the world because of this shaver.  </li>
            <li>I wanted a body grooming one because while the beard trimmer works good you got to be real careful not to nick/cut yourself with it.</li>
            <li>This shipped quickly, and shaves very closely to the skin.</li>
            <li>My last Phillips Norelco Bodygroom lasted me six years and finally died, so I happily bought this one.  </li>
            <li>The trimming function is gentle and I noticed no hair-pulling, meaning that more sensitive regions can be trimmed without fear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimming function is gentle and I noticed no hair-pulling, meaning that more sensitive regions can be trimmed without fear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has 3 different length guards, plus a foil, so this can get really close, or leave a nice, longer cut.</li>
            <li>Depending on what area you are shaving you might want to quickly go over it with a razor to get the last little bit of stubble, but this groomer does a VERY good job</li>
            <li>Full body dry shave, super easy.  </li>
            <li>it is easy, you just have to pop off the top part of the trimmer and can effectively clean out the small hairs which may get stuck in the inside.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much!</li>
            <li>I tried it the very first day in the shower on the groin area, and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I have used this frequently in the last weeks, and looks like the battery is still as good as it was on the first use.</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;re stuck with loose comb parts to keep track of unless you supply your own carrying case to put them all in.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean shave but you have to break the clippers in real good because it can be very painful upon the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I use this for underarms and private parts hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Its very smooth on the skin and does not require any lather.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend it to all the guys!</li>
            <li>Still, there are other tools that would do a better job if that was the primary intention.</li>
            <li>From the little use I got, it seemed like a good razor.  </li>
            <li>This is a good little trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li>This model has a little longer neck between the handle and the head, which is good for those of us that want to get places like our backs</li>
            <li>Easy to use, quick, never any ingrown hairs (which was always a problem for me, shaving my bikini with a regular razor), no bumps or redness or anything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I felt the BG2028 is a sturdy and effective body shaver/trimmer ... a vast improvement in quality over the 2020.when being used for shaving, the BODYGROOM does pull hair at times ... mainly from the clippers.  </li>
            <li>It worked pretty well and gave my father a new &#x27;clean&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>the first time was a nightmare going with no guard.</li>
            <li>He absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li>My first norelco body groomer died after 3 years.</li>
            <li>I did this with my first one and it made a world of difference...</li>
            <li>shaves pretty close</li>
            <li>well being my first time.</li>
            <li>But it did not get better the 2nd time around.</li>
            <li>Ok, imagine a pair of regular buzzers, like you use to give haircuts.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying this is the first electrical razor I have ever owned...</li>
            <li>I realized that it performed MUCH better (actually performed pretty dang</li>
            <li>and I use this groomer to trim my bikini line because it works ten times better than any electric grooming razor I&#x27;ve found targeted towards women.  </li>
            <li>It looks much better quality than the last one</li>
            <li>The unit itself is much better designed than the last...</li>
            <li>those like spending more time doing something that can be done three times faster with a different device.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>And yes you can use this on your balls, but gently!</li>
            <li>give this 4 stars only because it will work better for people that have an abundance of hair on their body..  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I was actually looking at purchasing the top of the line one (BG2040 i believe)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pleased that it came with several guards so you can choose the length you like where you like it.</li>
            <li>And, yes, I&#x27;ve used it from top to bottom with some stops in the mid sections.</li>
            <li>my only hope is that a) it lasts more than 30 months (about the time i have found they most often die) and/or norelco would make it possible to replace the battery</li>
            <li>Exactly what I need it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overall &#x27;okay&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I returned this product after the first use.  </li>
            <li>It jams up every so often and we need to replace the blades pretty often as well, but it works well</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do the nape of his neck either - it left more hair than it cut.  </li>
            <li>- both guys let me have a swipe at them, and while it did trim the hair, it left more than it cut.  </li>
            <li>Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>this is the first body groomer that i have purchased but not my first norelco product.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I would like to see a cap that covers the grille so that you only use the trimmers on the top and bottom.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time on genitals.  </li>
            <li>I still got nicked the first time.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised-</li>
            <li>Does a great job of trimming thick or longer</li>
            <li>Eh, I thought it would work better than it does.. especially with some of the reviews..</li>
            <li>Works as intended and works much better than a prior model I had.</li>
            <li>: Can you help me with the exact date of purchase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After that, it took hair off pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations from this shaver.</li>
            <li>maybe 10 minutes more (total of an hour).</li>
            <li>Much better and safer than a standard razor works everywhere no problem</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>After a month or two it takes a bit more time to get the same shave</li>
            <li>Though I used this product for the first time, I thought I would write a review on this one since I have been shaving with electric shavers for quite a while.</li>
            <li>Useful, ready to use, correctly priced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able knock out my chest and back in about 15 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The speed of the motor stays consistent over the battery</li>
            <li>The biggest drawback is not using it for shaving or such, though I&#x27;m sure it would work as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>The design is far more streamlined on this new one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The swiveling head just didn&#x27;t trim that great in my opinion compared to the fixed head that was on eh previous one.</li>
            <li>groomer, as it like to pull hairs with the flat part at the top while trying to trim up (below).</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Not always effective for very close shaving or when used on wet hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>a couple of times before i feel it&#x27;s a closer enough shave, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like it and it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is much improved over the earlier models I used and is of better quality.</li>
            <li>A few more options on the blade guard lengths (the longest is not very long) and a faster charge time would be nice, but you can get that by upgrading to the Pro or Plus model.</li>
            <li>Full discretion: I&#x27;m a woman who wanted a more durable shaver than the purple-lady on that I previously had that bit the dust.</li>
            <li>The positive reviews help explain the benefits &amp; features well.</li>
            <li>First it doesnt cut very well.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time, and I love the stand that holds it upright on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers from the competition, but for my skin and hair, this one works the best.</li>
            <li>But, minor redness aside, it&#x27;s one of the better non-facial trimmers I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li>: it takes too many passes to remove hair and the angles are strange</li>
            <li>First using the head cleaner has really improved the consistency of the shave with this.</li>
            <li>This is the first body hair trimmer I have ever purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare to.  </li>
            <li>nice try, no success.</li>
            <li>Not as good as past models</li>
            <li>Major time saver, not quite as easy to get a smooth cut as a regular razor</li>
            <li>The combs that come with this are useless, but if you are looking to shave an area completely clean, this thing works great.</li>
            <li>I weight train and any serious lifter will tell you that too much body hair is just not that attractive when you want the focus to be on your muscles.</li>
            <li>While the BODYGROOM is adequate in providing a convenient, quick shave, I have never discovered a foil shaver that provides a close enough shave to replace the razor ...</li>
            <li>This unit des a FAIR job at trimming body hair with very FEW nicks.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve ever shaven special areas you know it&#x27;s not always fun as it grows back</li>
            <li>I started in an easy spot, the area just above the penis.</li>
            <li>The cordless technology comes in handy as you don&#x27;t have to unwrap the wire around you as we had to do with previous units.  </li>
            <li>I had the previous model for 4 years and really liked it.</li>
            <li>Also would recommend to use dry rather than in the shower, performs better.</li>
            <li>The BG2028 does a good job of cleaning up and the charge last long time.  </li>
            <li>I get better results with a single blade disposable.</li>
            <li>When this one goes, I will certainly buy the newest model.</li>
            <li>Yeah, some certain hairy man has a problem with that.  </li>
            <li>I nor my boyfriend have a particularly large crop of body hair, so the combs were of no use to</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised, however, by the PHILIPS NORELCO BG2028/42 BODYGROOM as it appears to be a significant upgrade in quality from the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaves down a good amount, certain areas of the body need to be wet shaved to be completely smooth.</li>
            <li>Works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my old Norelco trimmer started having issues, I decided to try this new model, which turns out to work just as well, and has addressed most of my problems with the old model.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, long battery life and the attachments are great for trimming side head hair.</li>
            <li>I treat this unit as dry-use only that just happens to be fine to rinse under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re warned never to use it on facial hair - though I did try it on my goatee and it works fine there.  </li>
            <li>It does the job just fine, but for the sake of comfort I recommend sticking to a traditional razor in that situation.  </li>
            <li>my first use, I had a decent amount of stubble (a week of no shaving) built up</li>
            <li>1-yr but for some reason the blade/foil doesn&#x27;t stay attached at particular angles!  </li>
            <li>This new BG2028 is a little larger, longer, and feels more solid than 2020, with more flare to the handle to provide a better grip.  </li>
            <li>This works as good as advertised, and if it holds up as long as my other one I&#x27;ll consider it a success.</li>
            <li>Learning to use it properly takes a little practice, but after that initial getting used to it, it performs the best grooming I&#x27;ve ever got.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m not that hairy - and since even on its closest setting this doesn&#x27;t trim much for me - I didn&#x27;t find it to be very useful.losest setting this doesn&#x27;t trim much for me</li>
            <li>This is a HUGE improvement over the last one.</li>
            <li>It lasted several years and did a great job of removing hair in relatively few strokes before eventually biting the dust.  </li>
            <li>Works real well in these areas.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer attachements are somewhat flimsy and based on how they worked, I probably won&#x27;t use them much.  </li>
            <li>its helpful and cut the very well  </li>
            <li>Works very well and can be used in shower or bath too.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>You really need that convenience.</li>
            <li>It does not work very well in the shower with water running on you.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t get it to cut very well at all with any of the guards on.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it t trims very well.</li>
            <li>So much for product quality.</li>
            <li>I even tried it on my legs once, left them smooth and without a nick or dryness.</li>
            <li>and I really tried to like it, folks--a piece of garbage in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erratic</li>
            <li>I tried it and it really doesn&#x27;t work well there.</li>
            <li>and the razor didn&#x27;t perform very well.</li>
            <li>my body, however... I find this razor to not do much.</li>
            <li>and he said it should take three weeks until I notice the blade wont pull as much.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a smooth short trim, all it did was cut skin and catch hair.</li>
            <li>and you would do it fast.</li>
            <li>much much easier to use than philips electric razors designed for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>works like a charm, I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody on the fence who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>Better to use wet in the shower.</li>
            <li>, that is you wont be left with a smooth feel, bc it leaves stubs.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do the job as advertized.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>It seems truly waterproof and even more efficient with wet</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>it really just doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li>It fits well in my hand-someone had their mind on ergonomics which is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I have shaved my legs all my life, and really didn&#x27;t like doing it...</li>
            <li>Razor part is absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>Attachments work as they should, razor is smooth over all skin surfaces, and the trimmer is the same as all of them.  </li>
            <li>It trims very close to the body almost as if you had shaved, but it&#x27;s faster.</li>
            <li>I will admit, you don&#x27;t achieve the absolute closest \\&quot;not</li>
            <li>and I felt like it really didn&#x27;t do the job I needed it to.</li>
            <li>I had a bit more luck with it when it was wet</li>
            <li>I guess I misunderstood the nature of this bodygrooming tool when I ordered it - and also think that it doesn&#x27;t quite do what it says it does - so I thought it might be helpful for someone like me to say what I thought it was and what it really is.</li>
            <li>I imagine that for someone who wants to remove all of their body hair</li>
            <li>&quot; them (much like one curls a ribbon with scissors).</li>
            <li>The unit head itself was able to remove unwanted hair with minimal amount of nicks and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gets the job done fast and without any cuts.</li>
            <li>can get a very close shave with this, without the danger of hurting yourself.</li>
            <li>This Philips Bodygroom works very well</li>
            <li>This shaver works really well.</li>
            <li>razor burn, shaves really close without the combs.</li>
            <li>Attachments don&#x27;t really work too well.</li>
            <li>Really like the storage holder and all the accessories that are included with this.</li>
            <li>Once charging the Philips Norelco Bodygroom for 8 hours, it was ready to be used.&lt;br /&gt;1st</li>
            <li>The combination is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>it works really well in the shower too.</li>
            <li>In a place where you really don&#x27;t want to get cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hungry for blood.</li>
            <li>Thanks Guys</li>
            <li>my life has become much easier</li>
            <li>and I’m not that well off to afford to be wasting that much.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried Veet and Nair and those never worked, and I’m too much of a whimp for plucking it.</li>
            <li>This causes the edges to the hairs to curl at the end much like Velcro.</li>
            <li>Yeah, that trademark is very highly appreciated in our continent.</li>
            <li>, fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;with</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it but can&#x27;t return a used razor.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does work but not as much as I</li>
            <li>you would were this straight out the box.</li>
            <li>For 30$ i wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>blinking orange light gives plenty of warning that 10 minutes are left.  </li>
            <li>However, one of the combs could work reasonably well as a head protector with some rubber bands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m knocking off one star because of how fast the blades dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>does not cut hair very well</li>
            <li>Move too fast</li>
            <li>You will be given far more attention by your female friend after using this - I guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>probably the same kind of shaver.. have been cut only once...</li>
            <li>This makes my third version of Phillips Norelco Bodygroom and by far my favorite version.</li>
            <li>This is a marked improvement, along with the on/off switch being more like a solid button, rather than a rubber coated sensor.</li>
            <li>This worked far better and easier than a traditional razor on all but my privates.  </li>
            <li>It works really well, just REALLY be careful and patient and make sure not to  because you can accidentally nick yourself and that is something you don&#x27;t want to stress about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other reasonably priced razors, they worked okay, but I still had to shave with a real razor.  </li>
            <li>Even the shortest comb doesn&#x27;t give a very close trim - and in my case, given that I&#x27;m not extremely hairy, left most of my chest and belly hair intact without trimming it much at all.  </li>
            <li>, I have tried other similar products but the don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Without getting to personal it is not completely pain free in the MOST sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll also find yourself experimenting with angles to hold it and shaving more often (every day for me in the summer wearing shorts and skirts as opposed to every other day) because it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the other modules are better than this one.</li>
            <li>Then I found this, it reminded me of the original and turns out it is almost the same</li>
            <li>The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that most of the combs are way too long to be useful for me.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying a whole new trimmer!</li>
            <li>The product offers three levels of length, which I think they are very useful to suit people&#x27;s preferences.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the recharge time is a bit long, 8 hours, but it is worth it for the stable performance of the machine when being used.</li>
            <li>I dont know if its the short profile blades or what, but if you are expecting a clean cut, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It is sooo gentle and amazingly efficient compared to the products I&#x27;ve used in the past for manscaping.  </li>
            <li>If you want a truly clean look, this trimmer requires you to use a very specific angle.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that stops me from giving it a 5-star review, is the lack of an add-on blade, with shorter teeth for a clean shave.</li>
            <li>and yeah it handles those sensitive areas very gently.</li>
            <li>The power is pretty strong and can last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>battery life is amazing for how small this device is.  </li>
            <li>I bought years ago, sturdier, holds the charge far longer, head is not flimsy, like the first one.  </li>
            <li>I find it much easier to just use a normal razor and shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasted 3 years with pretty frequent use and always worked well for me.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and does a good job of removing thick topical hair.  </li>
            <li>shaver does one thing very well, and that is to not pinch or nick the more sensitive and harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li>I have used this only once so far, no need for more, as I don&#x27;t like to be completely shaved.</li>
            <li>good Product overall, however this model cuts a little too close</li>
            <li>I had owned the original Bodygroom from the time it came out, but my last one didn&#x27;t survive the trip home from Mexico, so I bought this new model.  </li>
            <li>I really like the dual course hair cutters as they come in handy in hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li>The intimate areas, specifically a man&#x27;s orbs can easily be nicked with a razor or other hair removal items.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Philips Norelco&#x27;s new Bodygroom Shaver</li>
            <li>/&gt;So if you are a woman with skin so sensitive you break out into one HUGE red leg then perhaps you should try it.</li>
            <li>Much better than previous Body groomer I owned</li>
            <li>It shaves a tad better than my previous model</li>
            <li>, I guess, on longer hair more typically found on</li>
            <li>The hair grows back so quickly because it isnt a close shave.</li>
            <li>I had an older one of these</li>
            <li>but I have experienced none of the common side affects of the regular razor like bumps or rash</li>
            <li>Also since my husband starting used this for shaving and trimming his mustache and beard, he doesn&#x27;t brake out any more in the facial hair area.</li>
            <li>I can easily reach my whole back with it, which makes the process much faster than with the regular shaver.</li>
            <li>Overall, much better and safer than using a regular disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Older model that you can still buy razors for.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my son to replace an older one.</li>
            <li>takes a while to groom oneself with this particular item.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It was safe and reach difficult corners for safe trim.</li>
            <li>This one does a decent job with no attachments and a using it for a trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The razor works decent, but it &#x27;catches&#x27; every now and then on the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go too, too fast when shaving thicker body hair or the razor will get caught up, but overall it&#x27;s a surprisingly powerful</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a trimmer, which works for under the neck and also, comes in a decent price range, look no more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- Next day try a light dusting of a cornstarch based powder for those with sensitive skin or try Balla powder http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00185SPJO/ref&#x3D;twister_B002ZFQ8N6?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li>But if you use shaving cream you will definitely notice a fairly quick and close shave.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, do not expect very smooth shave but does the job much easier in difficult body areas than a razor.</li>
            <li>It works, but it doesn&#x27;t work great, and im not a very hairy guy, but it still takes quite a long time to trim the area, actually a lot longer than I</li>
            <li>Great price, travels well, small footprint, holds a charge for a very long time, and convenient.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>High quality case and on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended upgrade.</li>
            <li>just bought newer model, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend both this item and the seller.</li>
            <li>highly recommended shaver for man or women.</li>
            <li>Rechargeable, and high quality</li>
            <li>highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I have tried and own several of the Bodygroom razors, this one (the BG2028), the BG2040, the BG2030 and one other one that I no longer have and forget the number.  </li>
            <li>Ok it works on legs and chest and flat areas, but not in the genital area or inner thighs.</li>
            <li>I also tried it on a small patch of hair with the combs removed and, while it didn&#x27;t give a close shave, it did do a decent job there of trimming things back fairly close.  </li>
            <li>My experiences thus far had been limited to the first and second generations of previous yrs (great design, works as intended) but they show their age in time...</li>
            <li>I also use it for the downstairs area which I am very pleased because I can comfortably use it without worrying about accidental cutting.</li>
            <li>The design and feel is smooth and it removes hair without a problem plus the back attachment is VERY helpful for removing back hair.</li>
            <li>I saw this I wondered because it was for gentle and sensitive areas</li>
            <li>Dont be scared to use in your sensitive areas, just be gentle.</li>
            <li>I used a normal razor and shaved</li>
            <li>The various heads that come with it are useful.  </li>
            <li>I do wish it had additional guards of different lengths, but the ones that come with are all useful.</li>
            <li>This thing buzzes away all hair with absolutely no negative effects upon the skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li>And compared to attempting to use a regular electric razor made for your face (even the pricey ones by Norelco and Panasonic which I have), the Bodygroom easily wins.</li>
            <li>Normally, I prefer a razor because it provides a closer shave, but like the option of a wet/dry groomer for travel purposes or when time is an issue.  </li>
            <li>I don’t normally do this sort of thing</li>
            <li>I have used it to shave in all places from the neck down including the most sensitive spots and have had no negative experiences whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not aimed at close shaving, but rather even trimming, and as it stands it would be most useful for a very hairy man who wants to tame things a bit rather than for the average man who wants to</li>
            <li>The right reason -a groomer that you can trust to shave more delicate, sensitive areas without nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li>This groomer isn&#x27;t strong enough to do regular shaving like you would for a face or legs.  </li>
            <li>quick and easy trimmer and can use it dry or wet!</li>
            <li>I used it only twice, for not very long, and the battery light was already turning on for a recharge.</li>
            <li>So I bought this because the general reviews were fairly positive with it.</li>
            <li>My legs are so smooth and bump-free that a friend&#x27;s daughter even asked if I was wearing nylons the other day.</li>
            <li>One star removed due to it is not pain free.</li>
            <li>Very good on sensitive areas without cutting or irratating.  </li>
            <li>The new one shipped to me was defective.</li>
            <li>&amp; I would get a new one if this was lost.</li>
            <li>This is a new product used sparingly and caringly.</li>
            <li>: I can provide you with 15% Discount Coupon for your new purchase from philips online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a new one.</li>
            <li>I think it was a newer model (or as new)</li>
            <li>It takes multiple sessions across multiple days and showers to be free of the hair.</li>
            <li>tell if it&#x27;s charging because the light only goes on when you initially start charging it</li>
            <li>know the more expensive units tout their rapid charge time, but I figure how often and how quickly do you really need to trim up?  </li>
            <li>I used it for about a half hr to 40 minutes in the shower and it still seemed to run strong.</li>
            <li>One of the earlier entrants in the race to persuade men to clipper themselves everywhere was a product very much like this one.</li>
            <li>I began shaving my head at a very early age in life</li>
            <li>Having very sensitive skin I have had to stop shaving my legs altogether.</li>
            <li>I am very surprised that you would not honor the guarantee on your product.</li>
            <li>Do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li>I still need to use my big clippers first.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for one I bought over seven years ago, it lasted that long and was well worth it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a body groomer for either yourself or your significant other, then the Phillips Norelco Bodygroomer is a must buy.  </li>
            <li>It works well for maintenance, but hair has to be pretty short for it to work well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a pretty solid shaver.  </li>
            <li>But it is better than some others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>BODYGROOM is a shaver/trimmer with a shaving head that has a foil in the middle with clippers on the long sides (front and back of the shaver head), meaning it can cut longer hair to a length suitable for the foil to provide a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-There&#x27;s definitely a bit of a learning curve when using this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>First off, it only cuts about 1 in 10 hairs each pass.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>just WOW!</li>
            <li>It shaves pretty well especially in those areas but one has to be patient with this.</li>
            <li>Just gotta pull your skin tight and it will be fine.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re single, your single life will be better.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts for a long time, plenty of time to shave the whole chest, belly and intimate areas.</li>
            <li>not a super smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li>At first they shipped me a used device and the top part was broken with someone else&#x27;s hair still clinging onto it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little timid when it comes to shaving the nether-regions and this shaver has been just fine for me.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much just use this to catch elusive back hair, or trim up sideburns and such.</li>
            <li>This product shaves underarms and \\&quot;below the belt\\&quot; pretty well and doesn&#x27;t really nick although you still have to be careful while shaving in the sensitive spots.  </li>
            <li>more mess as this shaver cuts the hairs into tiny bits rather than longer</li>
            <li>Somehow this is cheaper from the manufacturer than from Amazon  Second Prep prep prep after a bit of practice - Wash you skin completely and dry off - Soften and protect the skin with a light coat of JoJoba Oil</li>
            <li>I will say, however, that the guards are probably better used dry than wet, because trimming wet hair to a certain length isn&#x27;t very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t work very well as a trimmer for the thick hair on my head, but below the neck it easily outperformed a traditional razor with a disposable blade--specifically the Gillette Sensor Excel.  </li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for back and sensitive areas- solid and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use it in the shower and then turn on the shower to wash clippings down the drain -- keeps the bathroom clean.</li>
            <li>, it takes a little longer than regular shaving and you may have to go over an area more than once.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the mild discomfort when shaving.</li>
            <li>This clipper-foil combination make hard to reach areas more manageable to shave.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time getting it away from my wife &amp; adult daughter who both love it as well.</li>
            <li>; it takes a long time to shave with this as one has to movie it over the same area again and again to achieve a good shave/trim.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; it needs to be shaved a particular angle to be able to get it cutting the hair properly which means that one needs to practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this tool would only really be useful for the very hairy man who wants to \\&quot;mow the lawn\\&quot; every few days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly built for long-term use.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my wife or I would like.</li>
            <li>This product never would recharge (no blinking green light as promised).  </li>
            <li>And my underarms are smoother than they have ever been (plus switching to Dove Sensitive Skin antiperspirant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even gentle enough for underarms.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for shaving my privates in hope that it would be a more delicate approach to do it.</li>
            <li>I prefer for the head to be fixed</li>
            <li>I hope you like getting hair pulled in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>does what it says so far</li>
            <li>&quot; shave you can get with a razor, but what you are left with is a still VERY close \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; shave with NO pain.  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a replacement for my boyfriend after he lost all of the combs on his old one.</li>
            <li>So far this one has worked just as well.  </li>
            <li>Plus for about 35 dollars, even if it does break early, it won&#x27;t break the bank to replace it.</li>
            <li>However, with my sensitive skin I did notice some irritation when using it, even with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I was getting with the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving clog-up near the foil.</li>
            <li>About 1/3 the amount of hair gets clogged up inbetween the foil and the head of the unit then with the old Bodygroom.</li>
            <li>This means I have to lift my leg up in order to shave it, whereas on the old one, I could switch the direction of the comb and just shave it standing up.</li>
            <li>However, after the initial shave it got much easier to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to go through the hell of using an old fashioned razor in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>This is the third trimmer I have bought because everyone in my family wants one.</li>
            <li>I was using the old barber style plugin razors...</li>
            <li>When I was reviewing this product I was looking for something to help a 48 year old man (me) with &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>that wasn&#x27;t really the deal, and as such we know nothing about it at my age.....</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>: I would like to speak with someone directly.</li>
            <li>I will be sure to send my concerns in complaint form (I will include a transcript of this conversation).</li>
            <li>I also really like the low battery indicator</li>
            <li>and it gives plenty of warning before the razor will completely die.  </li>
            <li>so a close shave across sensitive areas isn&#x27;t going to feel like torture or scratchinig you while it cuts hair.  </li>
            <li>Early on, we thought it didn&#x27;t work because it wasn&#x27;t taking hair off.  </li>
            <li>Liking it so far...</li>
            <li>No pulling or tugging on the hairs, and gets the job done simple and fast.</li>
            <li>no problems so far</li>
            <li>but, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>people have said these can or can&#x27;t be used for shaving you face, and as far as I can tell, there is no reason they can&#x27;t be used for that,</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or scrapes, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it like my old one -</li>
            <li>This has been fixed with the addition of a rubber housing and the blade can&#x27;t pop out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is using the guard the way the device is can get kind of tricky to cut hair.</li>
            <li>used it in stages, so I first used it with the supplied comb to cut the hair to a manageable length and then used the bare head on the skin to take off the last length of hair.  </li>
            <li>Good quality, even though the price is expensive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These can cut right down to the skin very safely, but are very slow and inefficient at doing so.</li>
            <li>I was not happy with the results at that time, I was going to write a review right away and give it a 2 star because who wants to be smooth for a night then next day have bumps all over!?!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>/&gt;it doesn&#x27;t get as hot and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as much.&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li>Other than the addition of more guards, there&#x27;s not much room for improvement here.</li>
            <li>It held a full charge for over a half hour.</li>
            <li>My girl likes my smooth skin in her favorite places, and I like the special treatment I get because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as Doctor Evil said, you really must try it:</li>
            <li>/&gt;In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to trim or shave body hair, especially on the back or below the waist.</li>
            <li>It also comes with three attachments, a charger and a little brush to clean the groomer between shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I quickly figured out when I needed to shave in a rolling manner, circular one, or use an up and down motion.</li>
            <li>Bought this to mainly do some trimming on back hairs and some around the neckline and chest.  </li>
            <li>You should definitely opt for a more expensive model, as this one is cheap and doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as my last Philips shaver.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model of this that I used for several years.</li>
            <li>I bought this exact same razer several years ago at a Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>shaver works wet or dry, and I found it to be fine either way.</li>
            <li>have kept my body shaved ever since competing in bodybuilding shows years ago, mainly to avoid the weeks of prickly/itchy discomfort that accompanies the hair growing back.  </li>
            <li>The only downside I noticed was when being used for shaving, the BODYGROOM does pull hair at times ... mainly from the clippers.  </li>
            <li>Works best on thinner hair, has a bit of difficulty doing thick stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Words of advice: I suggest taking it really slow over thick hair first, then go at a normal speed over the stubble until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Also, with the old one, I could place the comb on either side of the foil and shave either way; with the new one, I can only shave with the combs inward (facing the body of the unit).</li>
            <li>Arrived as expected, no issues and a better shave then the previous Norelco body groom model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a problem with irritation and a single charge will last me about two weeks&#x27; worth of shaves.</li>
            <li>If you wait too long, this razor isn&#x27;t gonna do much.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on products, but I genuinely want to help people avoid wasting money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s far better than constantly exposing your delicate nether-regions to a razor blade, isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li>Sometimes it requires a few passes, but I&#x27;ve found that true of all electric razors.  </li>
            <li>It has very precise blades and does not hurt the skin, even if you put too much pressure accidentally or in a wrong angle.</li>
            <li>The combs are solid plastic, but do have the flexibility you&#x27;ll want for certain areas, especially around the groin.</li>
            <li>I use it purely for trimming purposes and you have to go over the same area multiple times for it to work, but if then you will still miss some hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Another doctor diagnosed the sulfa allergy, and he told me that those little pink shavers we all love are the problem.</li>
            <li>But an actual razor is hard to beat and does a better job when it comes to a close shave.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with how close it trims and I have yet used it enough to run the battery down enough to recharge it for he second time.  </li>
            <li>new battery indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s low before it dies.</li>
            <li>(the replacement blades are around the same price as a new unit).  </li>
            <li>it does not give a very close shave, actually the only defence i can see after use</li>
            <li>I really prefer this for the back of my neck rather than the feel of a traditional Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Obviously you&#x27;d need to shave thick hair more often to avoid having to do this time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips has made a number of shavers over the years, and this is one of the best ( and least expensive ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very careful and gentle when shaving sensitive areas, with this body groom though, I got nipped twice and cut once within one shave!</li>
            <li>The base is pretty great (and the biggest improvement upon the earlier models).</li>
            <li>which means some other means has to be used first.  </li>
            <li>I felt I should warn others to stay away from this product, it barely works!</li>
            <li>Try using the larger trimming comb the first time so you won&#x27;t be surprised if you end up with a shorter than expected trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>an update, make sure you go slowly!  </li>
            <li>tried the things you really shouldn&#x27;t with this shaver by first by seeing if it could mow down several days of facial hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Been clean shaving stem to stern with razors for over a decade ago since Gillete came out with the \\&quot;Protector\\&quot; with its&#x27; added small wires to reduce the nicks associated with razors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s better than a safety razor for catching back hair, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick and this will pull on occasion and her hair is really fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to be careful with the trimming edges on certain parts of your body.</li>
            <li>Basically is doesn&#x27;t work properly, hair are trapped and you have to clean every two seconds.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t need to cut down to the skin, I recommend larger teeth, like a more conventional buzzer.</li>
            <li>It turns out, it&#x27;s really just designed to trim back long body hair on men.</li>
            <li>To clean it on that upper part with the blades, simply push that black plastic on the lower blade upwards and the box with blades will pop out, showing you the hair accumulated there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t necessary to clear the hair out at all.  </li>
            <li>so far on the same charge.</li>
            <li>Any area that I did shave came out much smoother than expected.</li>
            <li>The only thing I have a problem with is the racks that it has to make the hair stand up to be cut.(I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>After years of bumpy legs and underarms, I recently developed a yeast infection in my underarms (yes, it was as gross as it sounds and itchy as H*LL)  </li>
            <li>He told me that never shaving again with those was the only way to get some relief on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Always been a fan of norelco products, I actually replaced my old bodygroom (BG2020) with this unit.</li>
            <li>surprised I&#x27;m the only one noticing this?</li>
            <li>I got no cuts so far and it gives a close body shave if you don&#x27;t use the different trimmer sizes.</li>
            <li>This is a VAST improvement over early versions in speed, run time and build quality.  </li>
            <li>If you body shave (especially chest or below the belt), you know about the near unbearable itch, burn and bumps associated with using a blade and the nicks you get with beard trimmers when encountering wrinkles and folds.  </li>
            <li>Unless you are careful taking off the combs on the old unit, the whole razor-portion of the unit ends up coming off with it, spreading bits of hair everywhere and possibly causing-if you were one of the unlucky ones-damage to the foil when it hit the counter/floor.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin at all in the sensitive areas like a beard trimmer and doesn&#x27;t leave a razor burn if going against the grain like a facial electric razor.  </li>
            <li>It took a while and didn&#x27;t grab any hairs, but my intention wasn&#x27;t to shave completely, I wanted to trim short.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I had with the old one was that the blades would occasionally catch and pop out of the unit.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many electric body groomers and nothing as frustrating to use as this.  </li>
            <li>but I usually just leave it on overnight when it needs it and a full charge lasts me about a week.</li>
            <li>But after giving the groomer a good 8 hour charge I took the plunge and gave it a serious workout - no more nicks and cuts, rashes or bleeding - and though you obviously need to be careful it is 1000 % better than a conventional beard and mustache trimmer !</li>
            <li>It’s just sad that a 5 year old razor does such a better job than a brand new one..</li>
            <li>Or if you have a lot of hair, I&#x27;d trim it down first with some scissors, then use this.</li>
            <li>This razor works much better than combo razors to be used for facial stubble and body grooming, the others proved to be too weak, while this one cuts smooth doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and has had no catching on the skin</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it in the shower, but other than that it&#x27;s a pretty solid trimmer.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to do any hard process to get it clean after shaving yourself.</li>
            <li>I got this based of the other reviews,  all i can really say is it works</li>
            <li>3 x&#x27;s as much as the other direction.</li>
            <li>(Decades ago I was given my first Remington which was shaped much like a heavy wedge that, with wet fingers, fell from your hand frequently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Held on to the original until the motor gave out so was forced to upgrade.</li>
            <li>Okay, yes, my review title might sound stupid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 2-wks, but a definite recommend so far.</li>
            <li>Got 3 different guides for various lengths of hair, or you can remove it completely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After going to 3 different stores and seeing products priced from $30 to $200, most of them behind glass</li>
            <li>too wide for some reason and too expensive but works good.</li>
            <li>If no other reviewers mention this, then I would imagine this to be the case, even though I&#x27;ve looked at it quite closely and can&#x27;t see any defects that would cause the following problem.  </li>
            <li>The cutting foil also seems to fit more tightly into the head</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and even with no guard on you&#x27;re not going to nick yourself as long as you exercise some common sense.</li>
            <li>the most part this device seems to be a slightly modified facial hair trimmer (the blades might be a bit harsh for facial skin)</li>
            <li>I do have is very thin and soft, so anything should be able to cut it</li>
            <li>Icuts body hair pretty well, just not really good for a deep shave, and doesn&#x27;t really work on the balls.</li>
            <li>So far I have not &amp;#34;knicked&amp;#34; anything, as I have with other shavers/trimmers, it does seem to function well in sensitive areas...</li>
            <li>At least with that I feel like I&#x27;m in full control.</li>
            <li>charger needs at least 8 hours to get the shaver to full power.  </li>
            <li>Take your time the first few times and don&#x27;t try to get it all in session one.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s me get really close without hurting anything down below.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get down to the skin, but very close.  </li>
            <li>I actually like the head on this trimmer better than past, as it has some industrial plastic as opposed to metal to for less skin irritation.</li>
            <li>(The first one stopped working after 2 yrs when the on/off button stopped depressing, and the 2nd has been going strong after</li>
            <li>it&#x27;d be that the blades seem to go a bit dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li>It is not easy to shave though I would say it safer than the other shavers available in the market.</li>
            <li>it gets very close to the skin almost razor like and it is very sharp and does not hesitate to do its job.</li>
            <li>Also, the longest length setting is very close for my taste, does not allow for a less conspicuous trim.</li>
            <li>love the option of use it wet or dry, and that is small enough to take along while traveling.</li>
            <li>you can barely see it but not close as razor unless you go over same area several</li>
            <li>I am thinking this might be because my hair is thin and easily pushed.</li>
            <li>:)  after reading the negative reviews, I agree with some of the viewers it boils down to your technique.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Only real issues I have are the battery life leaving something to be desired, and it slows down a bit after going over a lot of stubble requiring a bit of an internal rinse every so often.</li>
            <li>Not only this, but it takes twice as long to trim the same amount of hair as the old bodygroom.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom is advertised as a versatile all-around shaver that will effortlessly remove unwanted body hair whether your skin is dry, wet, or lathered in shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The newly designed non-adjustable combs are designed in such a way that the trimmed hair can&#x27;t fall away and gets trapped in the comb clogging up the blade almost immediately, so you have to clear them out with a brush after almost every pass to keep working.</li>
            <li>The on/off button is easy to activate and I find the unit shuts off several times each use because I lightly bump the switch - annoying but not terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this to help trim certain areas of my body that a regular razor just is not comfortable.</li>
            <li>Since there is no other product that we have found which works as well, we just purchased a replacement but wonder how long this one will last.</li>
            <li>When you do your chest/stomach hair it does pull a little, but not enough to cause any pain or anything, just make sure you are going over your hair in slow, deliberate motions and it will work perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure if I would trust it 100% on those real sensitive areas but so far I&#x27;ve had no complaints.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> But, the blade by itself does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Good sturdy grip</li>
            <li> Good razor for its use in &amp;#34;bodygrooming&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li> 3 Years of use for a $30 product is a good deal in my opinion</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with 3 attachments of varying lengths so it would be good for trimming and maintaining hair around the neck and sideburns, and should be good for removing body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had one before which worked good except for the switch that broke and would not let one repair it.</li>
            <li> Really good.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li> and I was hopping to try it out myself eventually, you know just for good measure.</li>

            <li> Good for men with medium body hair.</li>
            <li> Loved the reviews</li>
            <li> Good combination of usability and attachements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it works good.</li>
            <li> its battery is also good.</li>
            <li> Really good product.</li>

            <li> This is a very nice, handy shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li> thanks amazon for offering great products/ reviews and excellent shipping!!</li>
            <li> This could be important as they use this razor to shave places I wouldn&#x27;t with what they say are very good results.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the most &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; bits, but great for keeping chesthair, arm hair, etc a manageable length without looking like Bigfoot.</li>
            <li> Your girlfriend/wife/lovers are gonna love it, and get h***y (happy) easier.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I have experienced more grabbing and pulling of hair then using then products used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver.  </li>
            <li> Great price and a smooth product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to how it runs or feels, having never used it myself, but as the girlfriend having to deal with the aftermath, I can say that I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> In fact the trimmer has been designed as well, making a great product even better.</li>
            <li> quality build, with good instructions, presented in a nice way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> Very happy with this razor and the price was right.</li>
            <li> its best to practice on your leg to get it right then be patient and go for it.  </li>
            <li> You have to hold it and angle it the right way to get the best results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very nice to be able to take this in the shower with me with no fear of damaging it.</li>
            <li> Love this groomer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this groomer!</li>
            <li> This is safe!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is mostly advertised to men, because it is for women too!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> and more so than that, it was on the shaft!</li>
            <li> I love my philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and great body groomer.</li>
            <li> Pros:  waterproof, holds a good charge, works fairly well, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> A great product for body grooming and cheap too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic upgrade to a great product.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, does not scrape, does not make me bleed, leaves the skin smooth and</li>
            <li> and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> However, using this body groomer has been amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as effective on the face as it is on the body</li>
            <li> nice groomer for the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have them around just to know that in case I need them, I have them.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom is an excellent choice and currently it is being sold at a GREAT price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, an effective device for the man that needs a hand held, chargeable body groomer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s waterproof, but what is the point of a razor that doesn&#x27;t effectively trim hair?</li>
            <li> nice close shave..highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> More than a fair trade in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice stand and holds it&#x27;s charge about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the addition of the clippers</li>
            <li> Handy cleaning brush, charging stand and AC</li>
            <li> , this is a handy trimmer to have around.  </li>
            <li> While the pinching/stinging of hair-pulling was manageable, a slower glide over the skin was effective in reducing the pinch of pulled-hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> : thank you have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was kind of freaking</li>
            <li> Very excellent especially in sensitive areas .....</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space</li>
            <li> Shaves nicely and seems to hold a charge well.  </li>
            <li> Loved it, might have better products, but for the cost , i like it.</li>
            <li> Good product from Philips :)</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly noisy and you won&#x27;t be able to shave in discretion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re wanting to do.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews, I though that this would be a very useful product.</li>
            <li> Not QUITE as close is a blade but very useful and great value</li>
            <li> works great for underarms chest and pelvic area for people that don&#x27;t want razor burns or irritation , had to switch to electric do to razors giving me skin tags , shaves pretty good ass</li>
            <li> The shaver nestled nicely in my hand and was very easy to control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed with the battery life too, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I highly recommend this and do not let my statements about the battery not holding a charge sway your judgement, I am not he best about keeping it charged</li>
            <li> Ladies, this shaver will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> the jump to this shiny new model and am very happy.  </li>
            <li> : The best I can suggest you is to buy a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon has great customer service and I was able to return this product.  </li>
            <li> So far, this has been a great shaver and does a great job for my needs.</li>
            <li> The only good thing is that it comes fully charged and with a excellent warranty.</li>
            <li> The razor did a good job trimming corse chest hairs and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> But, it is very easy to use and you won&#x27;t see/feel stubble for about 24 hours, so before the shower is perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very easy to use while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use in or out of the shower</li>
            <li> Sure, some areas you will have to go over twice, but it still gets the job done better than a manual razor would!</li>
            <li> Great item, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> The included comb attachments are suitable for trimming without shaving.</li>
            <li> and I did use it to trim sideburns effectively and safely.</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite hairy, so through the years I collected shavers and trimmers of all kinds, so far, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li> Found this in a Wal-Mart and have been highly impressed thus far.</li>
            <li> This product is good, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all just smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> that I never felt the foil blade was effective in shaving anything more than a day or two of hair growth.  </li>
            <li> This product has turned into my BEST hair removal buddy because it is easy and GENTLE.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten good run times before the battery needs recharging and it has been very easy to keep the shaving head clean.  </li>
            <li> Great for keeping one manscaped in all the right areas.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to use, and shave all kinds of hair on your body!  </li>
            <li> a great personal razor no nicks no cuts wont tear through a 2 week beard but does great as a weekly trimmer</li>
            <li> though is break the oil barrier on your skin by showering with a good soap, then this Body Groomer works fantastic.  :)</li>
            <li> The product worked as promised, remove every millimeter of hair, I am very happy with my new clean body shaved look!</li>
            <li> but this one has great attachments that let you quickly keep things nice and neat, clean, without the pain</li>
            <li> Very smooth cut.</li>
            <li> its a very smooth cutter</li>
            <li> This works and it works good, quick and</li>
            <li> U can be quick with it and a good job.</li>
            <li> it is a reasonable price and a piece good device does the job, I love it!</li>
            <li> better be for I punched it ,</li>
            <li> and this is much, much better.</li>
            <li> I also have used the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; model (BG 2040), which is a much better product.  </li>
            <li> More durable and better shaving.  </li>
            <li> At the price, this model is ok, but if you can, buy the pro model -</li>
            <li> Like some others report, this electric shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> It does look and feel kind of cheaply made, and it takes 8 hours to charge fully.</li>
            <li> Recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> but this product is more like a face shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco BG2028 after using Wahl clippers for many years.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the t edger I was using before.</li>
            <li> Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Okay time to charge.</li>
            <li> if no luck...there are two torque screws at top under the foil...will see what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> you do put on any one of the three combs, make sure you hear that snap and turn on the shaver to ensure it won&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> All in all, wherever I used the Bodygroom I got a nice smooth shave without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I bought this as the excellent Bodygroom BG2030 has been discontinued...and I wanted a trimmer for my second home.  </li>
            <li> also made the mistake of waiting more than 30 days to try to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with this craptastic trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> most of us don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly got it because there are places on my neck that I alway cut muself trying to shave with a razor.</li>
            <li> this manmower and be smooth!</li>
            <li> This makes shaving more convenient in someways</li>
            <li> but I would recommend that a standard razor be used in conjunction with it to be the best shave.</li>
            <li> I mostly use this on my bikini area and underarms, but have used it on my legs too here</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this, and I never worry about nicks, or cuts.</li>
            <li> Love this body shaver .</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;An upgraded design for the best male body-trimmer on the market makes this Recommended.</li>
            <li> So if your looking for the five oclock shadow, your going to love it.  </li>
            <li> I hoped that this would be able to shave all the body hair, even if it had been weeks of growth.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that you&#x27;ll pay much  more for anything better,&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For more grooming tips visit  mengroomingtips10.com</li>
            <li> This Item Excellent and Recommend to total use of the body ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier and more convenient to just remember to shave whenever I shower, and the device can handle the water.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I was only testing it on my leg and was so impressed i went downtown and finished everything else off.</li>
            <li> It charges quickly-a problem with many items that are rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> but I am quite satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I do appreciate the results :)</li>
            <li> My wife uses it way more than I do.</li>
            <li> and he was fairly satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> short, the greatest compliment</li>
            <li> - it worked ok under my arms.  </li>
            <li> It was more like 2 days AFTER a razor.</li>
            <li> Think of it as a lawnmower for body hair - it&#x27;s a bit more of a blunt instrument than I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; groomer.  </li>
            <li> Okay fellow males.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased at the results I am able to achieve once I mastered the angle.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is okay, but could be improved.</li>
            <li> Great modern design.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Honesty makes this world a better place.</li>
            <li> I suppose its OK.</li>
            <li> my goods is smooth AF!</li>
            <li> I seem to be gaining more shaving time per charge with this use.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this for my now ex  boyfriends birthday</li>
            <li> ok.</li>
            <li> Found BG2020 works better than this one, but still does the job.</li>
            <li> great product, great price and arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li> If you are monogamous, your monogamy will go better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like magic.</li>
            <li> it just needs to cut better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> I would also be able to use it.</li>
            <li> I shave everything but the top of my head for cycling.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice charging stand, and it fits comfortably in the hand.  </li>
            <li> It works much better</li>
            <li> Three trimmer clip attachments of varying heights should satisfy most grooming preferences.  </li>
            <li> The charging station is more appealing and practical as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Body Groomer, so I am a &amp;#34;novice&amp;#34; with this type of thing.  :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to hold your breath when manscaping, it feels safe to use in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> i love this shaver.</li>
            <li> I also thought it comical that Andy&#x27;s suggestion was that I buy another product from you.</li>
            <li> The most notable difference between this type of shaver and a Wahl designed for the head is that the clipper guide isnt pointy..</li>
            <li> and we was satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I look 100% better.</li>
            <li> I will just have to rely on that until I find something better.</li>
            <li> I am sooo pleased of this product.</li>
            <li> recommend you buy another one with more payment.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems since I got it, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> You have to angle it appropriately in order to trim thicker hair, but once you get used to it</li>
            <li> I find it does an exceptional job quickly and with appropriate results.</li>
            <li> It took 8 hours or more to charge and seemed that after that charge, you had perhaps one shave, or 10 or 20 minutes to use before the battery was drained again.</li>
            <li> If you are satisfied with their sizes, it&#x27;s a product to buy.</li>
            <li> My son convinced me I need to modify some of the more &amp;#34;foresty&amp;#34; parts of my anatomy.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s more daring and uses a razor.</li>
            <li> FYI, looking closely at the clippers, the design is ingenious.  </li>
            <li> but you better have patience.  </li>
            <li> I figured purchasing the newest version of the Bodygroom would be a safe bet.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the fact that this is waterproof and prefer to use it in the shower (easier cleanup).</li>
            <li> But if you need to shave and trim a lot, this is probably one of the better products for it.</li>
            <li> I had another model of the philips bodygroom and my broke after I drop it many times.</li>
            <li> I was a hairy dude, I just bought it and I am loving it clean and clyear body.</li>
            <li> This model is a great step up from the older models.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and decent razor.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to hold in your hand and easy to charge.  </li>
            <li> This is cool and nice to use</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Holds a pretty good charge&lt;br /&gt;Foils</li>
            <li> However, he loved it after first try</li>
            <li> the Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a pretty good example of that.  </li>
            <li> good razor, and affordable, exactly what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li> This was a pretty good shaver.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product and does what ever Philips claims it to do.</li>
            <li> Easy to control, and I love that it is cordless.</li>
            <li> This razer is amazing because I can use it in the shower and it shaves super close.</li>
            <li> Bottom line: it is quick, effective, and cuts close.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> Once you are done shaving you would realize that it has shaved better than the most available in the market.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and hardy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also a really rare piece of shaving equipment because it&#x27;s safe to use on pubic areas!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts about an hour before recharge, but recharge light is a nice improvement over original models-no guess work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work to shave the frank or the beans, but for trimming it works excellently, and on flat surfaces you can also shave with it pretty effectively.</li>
            <li> Rather slim compared to most bodygroomers which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Great for use on the sensitive nether-regions.  </li>
            <li> You can even use it when its wet, perfect in the shower.  </li>
            <li> So far I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its able to keep your body groomed or as smooth as can be.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really work good when it comes to trimming body hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> Very useful and women will love.</li>
            <li> cuts nice and clean but not too clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy to use and gives good results.</li>
            <li> other than that one downside, the product is brilliant and well worth the price for the good job it does.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good enough for me, i love it!</li>
            <li> Better than the original</li>
            <li> I use this device to shave all my chest hair, but what I like best about this product is that I am able to adjust it, using the enclosed combs, so a little or a lot of hair remains.</li>
            <li> easy to use , this is an easy way to get the beast under control.&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li> battery life seems better than advertised, and the design (including the charging station) is sleek, simple, and attractive.</li>
            <li> I reported it to Amazon and got an easy exchange.</li>
            <li> I have used this prduct for body hair trmming , it is easy to use and charge</li>
            <li> Easy to use and</li>
            <li> easy to grip and use</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and recharge (which is not needed too often).</li>
            <li> It was so easy that I am not going to have a problem using it once or twice a week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Three adjustable heads that are easy to attach and detach&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> The charge ( for me ) lasts about 2 weeks, and can easily be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> It has an easy set up and its rechargeable and cordless which is a plus</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> the blades are that strong.  </li>
            <li> The older ones were good, but these seem to pull on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product, however it is very easy to loose the attachments that were included.</li>
            <li> Use when hat is dry and cool works awesome!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While my main use may be for body shaving, the BODYGROOM&#x27;s most effective role may be that of a hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While my main use may be for body shaving, the BODYGROOM&#x27;s most effective role may be that of a hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I got this new one and Its really good.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me!&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> This product is fine.  </li>
            <li> but I imagine that it would work fine for that as well.</li>
            <li> A perfect improvement on previous models.</li>
            <li> Pull skin taught and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 5 months, now it won&#x27;t hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find this on Amazon for half of what I have paid elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I enjoy how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well for fine hair, but chokes and pulls on thicker or denser hair.</li>
            <li> This is best used in areas like chest, and -ahem- &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; that have less dense hair</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is how easy it is to clean just by rinsing with hot water.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very useful.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the Bodygroom, i love how easy to use and gentle</li>
            <li> Perfect for what its designed for, if a little pricey.</li>
            <li> I just took a trip to Cabo in Mexico and this little guy was my best freind there!</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product that i have purchased so far from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and believe it or not, the instructions with it are clear and concise.</li>
            <li> This thing is way inferior, it just doesn&#x27;t shave as smoothly.</li>
            <li> Same great product.</li>
            <li> This body groomer works fantastic, is so lightweight</li>
            <li> Great male body</li>
            <li> If you are looking for smooth skin, this is not it.  </li>
            <li> I have more success with hair clippers and a razor.  </li>
            <li> It is a great product which will work for people that have an abundance of bodily hair growth.  </li>
            <li> The device is also suited for use without the combs to get a relatively smooth shave (yes, I tested it, on a lower leg area, be forewarned, I can see the trimmer pinching if the skin is not taut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li> That helps it win some points back in my book.</li>
            <li> Smooth close shave, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> I cannot give personal feedback, but I know the recipient was happy with it.</li>
            <li> Making it smooth as a babies butt.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to it smoothly.</li>
            <li> The groomer is light weight and shaves with a smooth touch.  </li>
            <li> Great body shaver, I&#x27;ve used this on my groin, legs, back, neck, armpits, and &#x27;crack&#x27;.</li>
            <li> its cheap</li>
            <li> It slides smoothly along the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It runs well in the shower, is easy to clean, and keeps a great charge, only needing to charge it after 5-6 shaves spaced days apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get it as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but I does what it suppose to do.</li>
            <li> my smooth, hairless beer belly.</li>
            <li> As an European, I am a great fan of brAun.</li>
            <li> Great for legs, arms and back.</li>
            <li> but I was amazed by how light this model was compared to others in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d need instructions, but they are important for a level of comfort and use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain</li>
            <li> For the price it is a great buy overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Philips also offers good customer service.</li>
            <li> This gets those places perfectly &amp; to my surprise also works very well for my facial hair.</li>
            <li> and I was more than pleased with how fast I could trim.</li>
            <li> It offers a good reach</li>
            <li> Good for trimming the old bush.</li>
            <li> After using an electric beard trimmer to shave my chest and lower regions for awhile, I have found this device to be far superior and safer.  </li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t find it to be very useful.</li>
            <li> It was very useful to me.</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the original Bodygroom.  </li>
            <li> You will feel more &#x27;pull&#x27; than you would with a regular razor or electric shaver, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer head does snap off easily to allow access for cleaning and Philips Norelco seems to have provided a better, more secure housing to lessen the likelihood of the razor head/foil from popping off unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer head does snap off easily to allow access for cleaning and Philips Norelco seems to have provided a better, more secure housing to lessen the likelihood of the razor head/foil from popping off unexpectedly.  </li>
            <li> Used with a body-shaving Gel, very smooth and cuts really close!</li>
            <li> irritation at all; great for those sensitive areas ;)</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve each got naturally fine, blonde hair, and fine fair body</li>
            <li> this would do a good job on a first pass, to be followed up with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the foil blade apparatus was easily clogged and required continuous rinsing to function at a barely adequate level.  </li>
            <li> And for below the waist, it really is very safe and effective as the other reviewers wrote, the result is surprisingly smooth without any cuts or irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I think the manual suggests dry but gentle soap and water in the shower worked best for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like it would be safe at first glace.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different groomers, but this is the most i like it ever !</li>
            <li> Great to do some manscaping, doesn&#x27;t do to good on the middle of your back, and this is all I know,</li>
            <li> I am glad I was made aware of this product.  </li>
            <li> I had an original model, got a lot of use out of it.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this groomer, but it is a lightweight device designed for sensitive shaving areas.</li>
            <li> As usual Philips made a great product!</li>
            <li> A full charge took about 8hrs before the charging light turned off.</li>
            <li> They can give you a good pinch if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> We had in plugged in for the full time and never saw the light change.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it rather remarkable how regular clippers will shred you, but these won&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This works great when used on dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I even use it on my face regularly with great success.</li>
            <li> Pulls and does not provide a clean trim.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was just a tiny bit more effective.</li>
            <li> Might be worth purchasing the next model up, if you want to keep your man and/or yourself happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Lets dispense with the one thing I did not like and that was how to remove the grill to clean it.</li>
            <li> , therefor I needed something to trim up and clean up &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; for my fiance</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s safe to use on one&#x27;s most sensitive flesh too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> is by far the best big ball sac trimmer made.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> With the old one, the shaving was nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> sound is like a turbo motor which I have gotten use do and having some thick shaving lather is awesome to compliment indeed.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is designed to help maintain clean looking body hair, specifically below the neck.  </li>
            <li> do so cleanly.</li>
            <li> Cuts quickly and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The blade can be cleaned out and it comes with this mini 2-sided brush to get into the grooves of the blades if you want a deeper clean.</li>
            <li> (Could just be my skin type is very sensitive to this kind of product)</li>
            <li> the shaver is great because it doesn&#x27;t leave any shaving burn and limited stubble if any.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, shaves fairly close a few pulls here and there.</li>
            <li> Works well, went right through all my hair without issue -- easy to clean</li>
            <li> If you purchased this relative inexpensive shaver for the right reasons, you should be happy with its performance.</li>
            <li> This one takes many swipes so of you have a large area you are doing, its gonna take a while.  </li>
            <li> -- that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for, and it says so right in the manual!</li>
            <li> Priced right!</li>
            <li> Norelco got it right!</li>
            <li> The middle fine hair razor doesn&#x27;t grab and pull your hair at all and feels very safe on areas below the waist.  </li>
            <li> Works great, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> This Noreclo BG2028 looks more modern and is definately trimming better/easier than my 1st groomer.</li>
            <li> Comes with a bunch of attachments, more than I could really use</li>
            <li> so the only thing its good for is maybe a beard trimmer .</li>
            <li> but overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend to anybody considering to get a good body groomer.</li>
            <li> Good basic electric razor.</li>
            <li> Last, the 2040, looks good in the pictures, but it&#x27;s a pain to charge and clunkier to use than the rest of them.  </li>
            <li> At this price, you really can&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li> The razor is simple to charge and has some good accessories.</li>
            <li> The good news I didn&#x27;t get any redness or welts that a regular razor would do.</li>
            <li> It works best on less-course hair, or at least hair that isn&#x27;t as concentrated.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> A full charge takes 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps the 50 minute run time on a full charge will get you by while you are away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> But if you do it somewhat frequently, you&#x27;ll have no problem shaving your face and getting a pretty dang good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not a bad idea to look neat, well attended to</li>
            <li> Feels like the natural evolution of what was already a pretty good design.  </li>
            <li> The good thing about this shaver is a full charge seems to last a while.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and really cut down on the amount of money I spend at a salon every month.</li>
            <li> The stand is nice and will keep it out of the way - it does not tip over easily like the last one I had.</li>
            <li> All that hair below the neckline is buzzed away pretty easily.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product is very good, long lasting battery, more so then I thought.</li>
            <li> Using the #1 guard on this trims it to the perfect length - it&#x27;s short enough that it looks good, yet not so short that it becomes prickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily the replacement was easy to find and order and was not expensive.</li>
            <li> This little shaver sure is superior to anything I&#x27;ve used that wasn&#x27;t designed for body hair.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s incapable of getting a nice, super smooth shave like you expect from a traditional razor and some nicer electric</li>
            <li> Although this Bodygroom is marketed toward a younger male audience, it is undoubtedly an excellent unisex product.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend this product to anyone, great quality and very affordable.</li>
            <li> I can quickly trim up and not get knicked.</li>
            <li> Makes quick work of manscaping my nether regions.</li>
            <li> If you can find a 2030 model - it&#x27;s tremendous.  </li>
            <li> I owned an older model and this one is so much better that there is no comparison.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a body trimmer/shaver as a male, you do not have to look any further or buy the $70 version of this thing, this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is the best thing possible for personal hygiene.</li>
            <li> This unit can pay for itself quickly, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High</li>
            <li> Unit came quickly and I charged it up</li>
            <li> Its light weight, easy to handle, and it does what its suppose to, I&#x27;m happy that i didn&#x27;t listen to the negative re​views  </li>
            <li> highly recommend it for safe body grooming.</li>
            <li> One of the things I like most is that, guard-less, it&#x27;s a very effective razor; in a pinch I can shave my face as I&#x27;m driving to wherever I&#x27;m already late.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pretty light.</li>
            <li> For long hair it is extremely good and does what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li> Works great, love that I can use it in the shower, the button is easy to depress and the charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great product, been using an older model for around ten years.</li>
            <li> He has his main trimmer to keep his mountain man beard neat, mini foil shaver for a smooth &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34;, and now this one for smooth &amp;#34;berries&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> it left my legs very smooth and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It is a trimmer - you will have pointy fuzz that are very minute to the eye when you feel the skin - maybe a easy shave to follow up will be needed.</li>
            <li> However, the foil actually broke while I was using it in the shower and it nicked me pretty good.</li>
            <li> Washing the blades are easy and fast</li>
            <li> I bought the first version back in 06 and loved it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really clears the hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever, is very comfortable, small and really does not hurt the skin as above, the recharge time is a bit long but worth is great</li>
            <li> With as many implements required to keep our house lawn looking great, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised he requires several different styles for his personal grooming, lol.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> does exactly what it supposed to!</li>
            <li> This is my third one and I love how easy it is to use on unwanted hair.  </li>
            <li> Seems to self clean pretty well with just a tap.</li>
            <li> This Bodygroom has a great design, is easy and convenient to use wet OR dry, and changing trimming lengths is super easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I have not tried any of the competitors products, I feel no reason to as I could never ask anything more from this handy little device.</li>
            <li> Its also amazing on my chest and back.  </li>
            <li> , it saves u from using a real shaver and is a huge time saver.</li>
            <li> Great for sculpting and keeping heavy growth areas under control</li>
            <li> Enjoy that thing☺ make my body shaving much quicker and easier</li>
            <li> The instructions said the light would change when the device was ready for use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary: It was an absolute pleasure to use this tool, and I am comfortable after the work was done.  </li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> It worth it</li>
            <li> If you want to have a try go with the Norelco professional model, it might be it works better.</li>
            <li> It has an ergonomic feel and it far from bulky, something that will give any user more control when they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I liked the Braun Cruzer, this one definitely outperformed it.</li>
            <li> For trimming my chest, I find it more comfortable than the regular trimmer because the combs have rounded tips.</li>
            <li> Well worth the selling price</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It takes care of the most sensitive areas also.</li>
            <li> You do have to hold it at a more awkward angle for it to work its best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this as a complimentary shaver, but if you want that skin-tight shave, you&#x27;ll need something else.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far.</li>
            <li> but was not crazy about the pivoting head.</li>
            <li> Works great, but this was purchased to replace one that was only 5 years old and just died.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> And of course, I have to nicely package the unit and send it back via UPS just to get my refund?!</li>
            <li> I dont know if the performance is worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy and comfortable when it&#x27;s done, but quite the chore when left undone for too long--but not anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely worth purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found the BG2028 to be as effective as one could expect for such a device.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I felt the BG2028 is a sturdy and effective body shaver/trimmer ... a vast improvement in quality over the 2020.</li>
            <li> worth consideration.</li>
            <li> before the low battery light starts blinking and maybe 1 or 2 more uses after that before it dies.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my most regrettable purchase.  </li>
            <li> The razor is plenty powerful and does the job.  </li>
            <li> This thing feels nice in the hand and powered up after charging, however IT SIMPLY DOESN&#x27;T CUT HAIR.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I can&#x27;t say this is really worth the $40 price tag though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent whole body shaver with good cutting ability, solid battery life, and an easy to clean design.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very powerful.</li>
            <li> As long as you aren&#x27;t expecting a razor close shave (it&#x27;s an electric shaver, so if you want it that smooth it&#x27;ll take a little more time), this is great.</li>
            <li> This one feels even more solid than the original.</li>
            <li> It works much better than many of the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> charger is nice and it feels good in your hand when using, I give it four stars all around for at least giving me a decent face shave without water or shave cream.</li>
            <li> Overall a good and decent product.</li>
            <li> For the former two, it really doesn&#x27;t work that great, although it does work better, say, in the shower than totally dry.</li>
            <li> I have another groomer that cuts right through no problem.  </li>
            <li> right out the box the BG2028 handled like a pro</li>
            <li> Buy it right now.</li>
            <li> You could go swimming right away lets us say it that way.</li>
            <li> I had a brAun body groomer, and once I got this, I understood that I had made the right choice.</li>
            <li> a positive note: This does not nick my skin!</li>
            <li> Use it for below the belt area, works very well.. clean shave.</li>
            <li> had the first gen model which tended to nick and cut in the most sensitive places.  </li>
            <li> On a full charge I was able to trim my entire body from winter growth.  </li>
            <li> Does not cut quite as closely as a previous one owned, but maybe feel better after more use.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the significantly higher price.</li>
            <li> Leave your shave so smoothly almost hairless like a normal blade</li>
            <li> suitable for female use unless you don&#x27;t mind stubble as it does not shave as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> This thing is AMAZING, I told my girlfriend earlier that she just became my second favorite thing in the world because of this shaver.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a body grooming one because while the beard trimmer works good you got to be real careful not to nick/cut yourself with it.</li>
            <li> This shipped quickly, and shaves very closely to the skin.</li>
            <li> My last Phillips Norelco Bodygroom lasted me six years and finally died, so I happily bought this one.  </li>
            <li> The trimming function is gentle and I noticed no hair-pulling, meaning that more sensitive regions can be trimmed without fear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimming function is gentle and I noticed no hair-pulling, meaning that more sensitive regions can be trimmed without fear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It has 3 different length guards, plus a foil, so this can get really close, or leave a nice, longer cut.</li>
            <li> Depending on what area you are shaving you might want to quickly go over it with a razor to get the last little bit of stubble, but this groomer does a VERY good job</li>
            <li> Full body dry shave, super easy.  </li>
            <li> it is easy, you just have to pop off the top part of the trimmer and can effectively clean out the small hairs which may get stuck in the inside.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> I tried it the very first day in the shower on the groin area, and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I have used this frequently in the last weeks, and looks like the battery is still as good as it was on the first use.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re stuck with loose comb parts to keep track of unless you supply your own carrying case to put them all in.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice clean shave but you have to break the clippers in real good because it can be very painful upon the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I use this for underarms and private parts hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Its very smooth on the skin and does not require any lather.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend it to all the guys!</li>
            <li> Still, there are other tools that would do a better job if that was the primary intention.</li>
            <li> From the little use I got, it seemed like a good razor.  </li>
            <li> This is a good little trimmer/shaver.</li>
            <li> This model has a little longer neck between the handle and the head, which is good for those of us that want to get places like our backs</li>
            <li> Easy to use, quick, never any ingrown hairs (which was always a problem for me, shaving my bikini with a regular razor), no bumps or redness or anything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I felt the BG2028 is a sturdy and effective body shaver/trimmer ... a vast improvement in quality over the 2020.when being used for shaving, the BODYGROOM does pull hair at times ... mainly from the clippers.  </li>
            <li> It worked pretty well and gave my father a new &#x27;clean&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> the first time was a nightmare going with no guard.</li>
            <li> He absolutely LOVES it!</li>
            <li> My first norelco body groomer died after 3 years.</li>
            <li> I did this with my first one and it made a world of difference...</li>
            <li> shaves pretty close</li>
            <li> well being my first time.</li>
            <li> But it did not get better the 2nd time around.</li>
            <li> Ok, imagine a pair of regular buzzers, like you use to give haircuts.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is the first electrical razor I have ever owned...</li>
            <li> I realized that it performed MUCH better (actually performed pretty dang</li>
            <li> and I use this groomer to trim my bikini line because it works ten times better than any electric grooming razor I&#x27;ve found targeted towards women.  </li>
            <li> It looks much better quality than the last one</li>
            <li> The unit itself is much better designed than the last...</li>
            <li> those like spending more time doing something that can be done three times faster with a different device.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> And yes you can use this on your balls, but gently!</li>
            <li> give this 4 stars only because it will work better for people that have an abundance of hair on their body..  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> I was actually looking at purchasing the top of the line one (BG2040 i believe)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased that it came with several guards so you can choose the length you like where you like it.</li>
            <li> And, yes, I&#x27;ve used it from top to bottom with some stops in the mid sections.</li>
            <li> my only hope is that a) it lasts more than 30 months (about the time i have found they most often die) and/or norelco would make it possible to replace the battery</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overall &#x27;okay&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I returned this product after the first use.  </li>
            <li> It jams up every so often and we need to replace the blades pretty often as well, but it works well</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do the nape of his neck either - it left more hair than it cut.  </li>
            <li> - both guys let me have a swipe at them, and while it did trim the hair, it left more than it cut.  </li>
            <li> Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> this is the first body groomer that i have purchased but not my first norelco product.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I would like to see a cap that covers the grille so that you only use the trimmers on the top and bottom.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time on genitals.  </li>
            <li> I still got nicked the first time.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised-</li>
            <li> Does a great job of trimming thick or longer</li>
            <li> Eh, I thought it would work better than it does.. especially with some of the reviews..</li>
            <li> Works as intended and works much better than a prior model I had.</li>
            <li> : Can you help me with the exact date of purchase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> After that, it took hair off pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations from this shaver.</li>
            <li> maybe 10 minutes more (total of an hour).</li>
            <li> Much better and safer than a standard razor works everywhere no problem</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> After a month or two it takes a bit more time to get the same shave</li>
            <li> Though I used this product for the first time, I thought I would write a review on this one since I have been shaving with electric shavers for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Useful, ready to use, correctly priced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able knock out my chest and back in about 15 minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The speed of the motor stays consistent over the battery</li>
            <li> The biggest drawback is not using it for shaving or such, though I&#x27;m sure it would work as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> The design is far more streamlined on this new one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The swiveling head just didn&#x27;t trim that great in my opinion compared to the fixed head that was on eh previous one.</li>
            <li> groomer, as it like to pull hairs with the flat part at the top while trying to trim up (below).</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Not always effective for very close shaving or when used on wet hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> a couple of times before i feel it&#x27;s a closer enough shave, but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like it and it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is much improved over the earlier models I used and is of better quality.</li>
            <li> A few more options on the blade guard lengths (the longest is not very long) and a faster charge time would be nice, but you can get that by upgrading to the Pro or Plus model.</li>
            <li> Full discretion: I&#x27;m a woman who wanted a more durable shaver than the purple-lady on that I previously had that bit the dust.</li>
            <li> The positive reviews help explain the benefits &amp; features well.</li>
            <li> First it doesnt cut very well.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time, and I love the stand that holds it upright on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers from the competition, but for my skin and hair, this one works the best.</li>
            <li> But, minor redness aside, it&#x27;s one of the better non-facial trimmers I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li> : it takes too many passes to remove hair and the angles are strange</li>
            <li> First using the head cleaner has really improved the consistency of the shave with this.</li>
            <li> This is the first body hair trimmer I have ever purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare to.  </li>
            <li> nice try, no success.</li>
            <li> Not as good as past models</li>
            <li> Major time saver, not quite as easy to get a smooth cut as a regular razor</li>
            <li> The combs that come with this are useless, but if you are looking to shave an area completely clean, this thing works great.</li>
            <li> I weight train and any serious lifter will tell you that too much body hair is just not that attractive when you want the focus to be on your muscles.</li>
            <li> While the BODYGROOM is adequate in providing a convenient, quick shave, I have never discovered a foil shaver that provides a close enough shave to replace the razor ...</li>
            <li> This unit des a FAIR job at trimming body hair with very FEW nicks.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve ever shaven special areas you know it&#x27;s not always fun as it grows back</li>
            <li> I started in an easy spot, the area just above the penis.</li>
            <li> The cordless technology comes in handy as you don&#x27;t have to unwrap the wire around you as we had to do with previous units.  </li>
            <li> I had the previous model for 4 years and really liked it.</li>
            <li> Also would recommend to use dry rather than in the shower, performs better.</li>
            <li> The BG2028 does a good job of cleaning up and the charge last long time.  </li>
            <li> I get better results with a single blade disposable.</li>
            <li> When this one goes, I will certainly buy the newest model.</li>
            <li> Yeah, some certain hairy man has a problem with that.  </li>
            <li> I nor my boyfriend have a particularly large crop of body hair, so the combs were of no use to</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised, however, by the PHILIPS NORELCO BG2028/42 BODYGROOM as it appears to be a significant upgrade in quality from the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaves down a good amount, certain areas of the body need to be wet shaved to be completely smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great dry or wet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my old Norelco trimmer started having issues, I decided to try this new model, which turns out to work just as well, and has addressed most of my problems with the old model.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, long battery life and the attachments are great for trimming side head hair.</li>
            <li> I treat this unit as dry-use only that just happens to be fine to rinse under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re warned never to use it on facial hair - though I did try it on my goatee and it works fine there.  </li>
            <li> It does the job just fine, but for the sake of comfort I recommend sticking to a traditional razor in that situation.  </li>
            <li> my first use, I had a decent amount of stubble (a week of no shaving) built up</li>
            <li> 1-yr but for some reason the blade/foil doesn&#x27;t stay attached at particular angles!  </li>
            <li> This new BG2028 is a little larger, longer, and feels more solid than 2020, with more flare to the handle to provide a better grip.  </li>
            <li> This works as good as advertised, and if it holds up as long as my other one I&#x27;ll consider it a success.</li>
            <li> Learning to use it properly takes a little practice, but after that initial getting used to it, it performs the best grooming I&#x27;ve ever got.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m not that hairy - and since even on its closest setting this doesn&#x27;t trim much for me - I didn&#x27;t find it to be very useful.losest setting this doesn&#x27;t trim much for me</li>
            <li> This is a HUGE improvement over the last one.</li>
            <li> It lasted several years and did a great job of removing hair in relatively few strokes before eventually biting the dust.  </li>
            <li> Works real well in these areas.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer attachements are somewhat flimsy and based on how they worked, I probably won&#x27;t use them much.  </li>
            <li> its helpful and cut the very well  </li>
            <li> Works very well and can be used in shower or bath too.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> You really need that convenience.</li>
            <li> It does not work very well in the shower with water running on you.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it to cut very well at all with any of the guards on.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it t trims very well.</li>
            <li> So much for product quality.</li>
            <li> I even tried it on my legs once, left them smooth and without a nick or dryness.</li>
            <li> and I really tried to like it, folks--a piece of garbage in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erratic</li>
            <li> I tried it and it really doesn&#x27;t work well there.</li>
            <li> and the razor didn&#x27;t perform very well.</li>
            <li> my body, however... I find this razor to not do much.</li>
            <li> and he said it should take three weeks until I notice the blade wont pull as much.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a smooth short trim, all it did was cut skin and catch hair.</li>
            <li> and you would do it fast.</li>
            <li> much much easier to use than philips electric razors designed for your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> works like a charm, I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody on the fence who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> Better to use wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> , that is you wont be left with a smooth feel, bc it leaves stubs.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the job as advertized.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> It seems truly waterproof and even more efficient with wet</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> it really just doesn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> It fits well in my hand-someone had their mind on ergonomics which is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I have shaved my legs all my life, and really didn&#x27;t like doing it...</li>
            <li> Razor part is absolutely unusable.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Attachments work as they should, razor is smooth over all skin surfaces, and the trimmer is the same as all of them.  </li>
            <li> It trims very close to the body almost as if you had shaved, but it&#x27;s faster.</li>
            <li> I will admit, you don&#x27;t achieve the absolute closest \\&quot;not</li>
            <li> and I felt like it really didn&#x27;t do the job I needed it to.</li>
            <li> I had a bit more luck with it when it was wet</li>
            <li> I guess I misunderstood the nature of this bodygrooming tool when I ordered it - and also think that it doesn&#x27;t quite do what it says it does - so I thought it might be helpful for someone like me to say what I thought it was and what it really is.</li>
            <li> I imagine that for someone who wants to remove all of their body hair</li>
            <li> &quot; them (much like one curls a ribbon with scissors).</li>
            <li> The unit head itself was able to remove unwanted hair with minimal amount of nicks and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gets the job done fast and without any cuts.</li>
            <li> can get a very close shave with this, without the danger of hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> This Philips Bodygroom works very well</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well.</li>
            <li> razor burn, shaves really close without the combs.</li>
            <li> Attachments don&#x27;t really work too well.</li>
            <li> Really like the storage holder and all the accessories that are included with this.</li>
            <li> Once charging the Philips Norelco Bodygroom for 8 hours, it was ready to be used.&lt;br /&gt;1st</li>
            <li> The combination is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> it works really well in the shower too.</li>
            <li> In a place where you really don&#x27;t want to get cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hungry for blood.</li>
            <li> Thanks Guys</li>
            <li> my life has become much easier</li>
            <li> and I’m not that well off to afford to be wasting that much.</li>
            <li> I’ve tried Veet and Nair and those never worked, and I’m too much of a whimp for plucking it.</li>
            <li> This causes the edges to the hairs to curl at the end much like Velcro.</li>
            <li> Yeah, that trademark is very highly appreciated in our continent.</li>
            <li> , fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;with</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it but can&#x27;t return a used razor.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does work but not as much as I</li>
            <li> you would were this straight out the box.</li>
            <li> For 30$ i wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li> blinking orange light gives plenty of warning that 10 minutes are left.  </li>
            <li> However, one of the combs could work reasonably well as a head protector with some rubber bands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m knocking off one star because of how fast the blades dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> does not cut hair very well</li>
            <li> Move too fast</li>
            <li> You will be given far more attention by your female friend after using this - I guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> probably the same kind of shaver.. have been cut only once...</li>
            <li> This makes my third version of Phillips Norelco Bodygroom and by far my favorite version.</li>
            <li> This is a marked improvement, along with the on/off switch being more like a solid button, rather than a rubber coated sensor.</li>
            <li> This worked far better and easier than a traditional razor on all but my privates.  </li>
            <li> It works really well, just REALLY be careful and patient and make sure not to  because you can accidentally nick yourself and that is something you don&#x27;t want to stress about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other reasonably priced razors, they worked okay, but I still had to shave with a real razor.  </li>
            <li> Even the shortest comb doesn&#x27;t give a very close trim - and in my case, given that I&#x27;m not extremely hairy, left most of my chest and belly hair intact without trimming it much at all.  </li>
            <li> , I have tried other similar products but the don&#x27;t work as good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without getting to personal it is not completely pain free in the MOST sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also find yourself experimenting with angles to hold it and shaving more often (every day for me in the summer wearing shorts and skirts as opposed to every other day) because it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully the other modules are better than this one.</li>
            <li> Then I found this, it reminded me of the original and turns out it is almost the same</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that most of the combs are way too long to be useful for me.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying a whole new trimmer!</li>
            <li> The product offers three levels of length, which I think they are very useful to suit people&#x27;s preferences.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the recharge time is a bit long, 8 hours, but it is worth it for the stable performance of the machine when being used.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its the short profile blades or what, but if you are expecting a clean cut, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It is sooo gentle and amazingly efficient compared to the products I&#x27;ve used in the past for manscaping.  </li>
            <li> If you want a truly clean look, this trimmer requires you to use a very specific angle.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that stops me from giving it a 5-star review, is the lack of an add-on blade, with shorter teeth for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> and yeah it handles those sensitive areas very gently.</li>
            <li> The power is pretty strong and can last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> battery life is amazing for how small this device is.  </li>
            <li> I bought years ago, sturdier, holds the charge far longer, head is not flimsy, like the first one.  </li>
            <li> I find it much easier to just use a normal razor and shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasted 3 years with pretty frequent use and always worked well for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and does a good job of removing thick topical hair.  </li>
            <li> shaver does one thing very well, and that is to not pinch or nick the more sensitive and harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I have used this only once so far, no need for more, as I don&#x27;t like to be completely shaved.</li>
            <li> good Product overall, however this model cuts a little too close</li>
            <li> I had owned the original Bodygroom from the time it came out, but my last one didn&#x27;t survive the trip home from Mexico, so I bought this new model.  </li>
            <li> I really like the dual course hair cutters as they come in handy in hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> The intimate areas, specifically a man&#x27;s orbs can easily be nicked with a razor or other hair removal items.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Philips Norelco&#x27;s new Bodygroom Shaver</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you are a woman with skin so sensitive you break out into one HUGE red leg then perhaps you should try it.</li>
            <li> Much better than previous Body groomer I owned</li>
            <li> It shaves a tad better than my previous model</li>
            <li> , I guess, on longer hair more typically found on</li>
            <li> The hair grows back so quickly because it isnt a close shave.</li>
            <li> I had an older one of these</li>
            <li> but I have experienced none of the common side affects of the regular razor like bumps or rash</li>
            <li> Also since my husband starting used this for shaving and trimming his mustache and beard, he doesn&#x27;t brake out any more in the facial hair area.</li>
            <li> I can easily reach my whole back with it, which makes the process much faster than with the regular shaver.</li>
            <li> Overall, much better and safer than using a regular disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Older model that you can still buy razors for.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son to replace an older one.</li>
            <li> takes a while to groom oneself with this particular item.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It was safe and reach difficult corners for safe trim.</li>
            <li> This one does a decent job with no attachments and a using it for a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The razor works decent, but it &#x27;catches&#x27; every now and then on the skin&#x27;s surface.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go too, too fast when shaving thicker body hair or the razor will get caught up, but overall it&#x27;s a surprisingly powerful</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a trimmer, which works for under the neck and also, comes in a decent price range, look no more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - Next day try a light dusting of a cornstarch based powder for those with sensitive skin or try Balla powder http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00185SPJO/ref&#x3D;twister_B002ZFQ8N6?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> But if you use shaving cream you will definitely notice a fairly quick and close shave.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, do not expect very smooth shave but does the job much easier in difficult body areas than a razor.</li>
            <li> It works, but it doesn&#x27;t work great, and im not a very hairy guy, but it still takes quite a long time to trim the area, actually a lot longer than I</li>
            <li> Great price, travels well, small footprint, holds a charge for a very long time, and convenient.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> High quality case and on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended upgrade.</li>
            <li> just bought newer model, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend both this item and the seller.</li>
            <li> highly recommended shaver for man or women.</li>
            <li> Rechargeable, and high quality</li>
            <li> highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> I have tried and own several of the Bodygroom razors, this one (the BG2028), the BG2040, the BG2030 and one other one that I no longer have and forget the number.  </li>
            <li> Ok it works on legs and chest and flat areas, but not in the genital area or inner thighs.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on a small patch of hair with the combs removed and, while it didn&#x27;t give a close shave, it did do a decent job there of trimming things back fairly close.  </li>
            <li> My experiences thus far had been limited to the first and second generations of previous yrs (great design, works as intended) but they show their age in time...</li>
            <li> I also use it for the downstairs area which I am very pleased because I can comfortably use it without worrying about accidental cutting.</li>
            <li> The design and feel is smooth and it removes hair without a problem plus the back attachment is VERY helpful for removing back hair.</li>
            <li> I saw this I wondered because it was for gentle and sensitive areas</li>
            <li> Dont be scared to use in your sensitive areas, just be gentle.</li>
            <li> I used a normal razor and shaved</li>
            <li> The various heads that come with it are useful.  </li>
            <li> I do wish it had additional guards of different lengths, but the ones that come with are all useful.</li>
            <li> This thing buzzes away all hair with absolutely no negative effects upon the skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> And compared to attempting to use a regular electric razor made for your face (even the pricey ones by Norelco and Panasonic which I have), the Bodygroom easily wins.</li>
            <li> Normally, I prefer a razor because it provides a closer shave, but like the option of a wet/dry groomer for travel purposes or when time is an issue.  </li>
            <li> I don’t normally do this sort of thing</li>
            <li> I have used it to shave in all places from the neck down including the most sensitive spots and have had no negative experiences whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not aimed at close shaving, but rather even trimming, and as it stands it would be most useful for a very hairy man who wants to tame things a bit rather than for the average man who wants to</li>
            <li> The right reason -a groomer that you can trust to shave more delicate, sensitive areas without nicks or cuts.  </li>
            <li> This groomer isn&#x27;t strong enough to do regular shaving like you would for a face or legs.  </li>
            <li> quick and easy trimmer and can use it dry or wet!</li>
            <li> I used it only twice, for not very long, and the battery light was already turning on for a recharge.</li>
            <li> So I bought this because the general reviews were fairly positive with it.</li>
            <li> My legs are so smooth and bump-free that a friend&#x27;s daughter even asked if I was wearing nylons the other day.</li>
            <li> One star removed due to it is not pain free.</li>
            <li> Very good on sensitive areas without cutting or irratating.  </li>
            <li> The new one shipped to me was defective.</li>
            <li> &amp; I would get a new one if this was lost.</li>
            <li> This is a new product used sparingly and caringly.</li>
            <li> : I can provide you with 15% Discount Coupon for your new purchase from philips online store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought a new one.</li>
            <li> I think it was a newer model (or as new)</li>
            <li> It takes multiple sessions across multiple days and showers to be free of the hair.</li>
            <li> tell if it&#x27;s charging because the light only goes on when you initially start charging it</li>
            <li> know the more expensive units tout their rapid charge time, but I figure how often and how quickly do you really need to trim up?  </li>
            <li> I used it for about a half hr to 40 minutes in the shower and it still seemed to run strong.</li>
            <li> One of the earlier entrants in the race to persuade men to clipper themselves everywhere was a product very much like this one.</li>
            <li> I began shaving my head at a very early age in life</li>
            <li> Having very sensitive skin I have had to stop shaving my legs altogether.</li>
            <li> I am very surprised that you would not honor the guarantee on your product.</li>
            <li> Do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> I still need to use my big clippers first.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one I bought over seven years ago, it lasted that long and was well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a body groomer for either yourself or your significant other, then the Phillips Norelco Bodygroomer is a must buy.  </li>
            <li> It works well for maintenance, but hair has to be pretty short for it to work well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a pretty solid shaver.  </li>
            <li> But it is better than some others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> BODYGROOM is a shaver/trimmer with a shaving head that has a foil in the middle with clippers on the long sides (front and back of the shaver head), meaning it can cut longer hair to a length suitable for the foil to provide a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-There&#x27;s definitely a bit of a learning curve when using this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> First off, it only cuts about 1 in 10 hairs each pass.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> just WOW!</li>
            <li> It shaves pretty well especially in those areas but one has to be patient with this.</li>
            <li> Just gotta pull your skin tight and it will be fine.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re single, your single life will be better.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts for a long time, plenty of time to shave the whole chest, belly and intimate areas.</li>
            <li> not a super smooth close shave.  </li>
            <li> At first they shipped me a used device and the top part was broken with someone else&#x27;s hair still clinging onto it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little timid when it comes to shaving the nether-regions and this shaver has been just fine for me.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much just use this to catch elusive back hair, or trim up sideburns and such.</li>
            <li> This product shaves underarms and \\&quot;below the belt\\&quot; pretty well and doesn&#x27;t really nick although you still have to be careful while shaving in the sensitive spots.  </li>
            <li> more mess as this shaver cuts the hairs into tiny bits rather than longer</li>
            <li> Somehow this is cheaper from the manufacturer than from Amazon  Second Prep prep prep after a bit of practice - Wash you skin completely and dry off - Soften and protect the skin with a light coat of JoJoba Oil</li>
            <li> I will say, however, that the guards are probably better used dry than wet, because trimming wet hair to a certain length isn&#x27;t very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t work very well as a trimmer for the thick hair on my head, but below the neck it easily outperformed a traditional razor with a disposable blade--specifically the Gillette Sensor Excel.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for back and sensitive areas- solid and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use it in the shower and then turn on the shower to wash clippings down the drain -- keeps the bathroom clean.</li>
            <li> , it takes a little longer than regular shaving and you may have to go over an area more than once.  </li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the mild discomfort when shaving.</li>
            <li> This clipper-foil combination make hard to reach areas more manageable to shave.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting it away from my wife &amp; adult daughter who both love it as well.</li>
            <li> ; it takes a long time to shave with this as one has to movie it over the same area again and again to achieve a good shave/trim.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; it needs to be shaved a particular angle to be able to get it cutting the hair properly which means that one needs to practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell, this tool would only really be useful for the very hairy man who wants to \\&quot;mow the lawn\\&quot; every few days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly built for long-term use.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my wife or I would like.</li>
            <li> This product never would recharge (no blinking green light as promised).  </li>
            <li> And my underarms are smoother than they have ever been (plus switching to Dove Sensitive Skin antiperspirant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even gentle enough for underarms.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for shaving my privates in hope that it would be a more delicate approach to do it.</li>
            <li> I prefer for the head to be fixed</li>
            <li> I hope you like getting hair pulled in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> does what it says so far</li>
            <li> &quot; shave you can get with a razor, but what you are left with is a still VERY close \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; shave with NO pain.  </li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my boyfriend after he lost all of the combs on his old one.</li>
            <li> So far this one has worked just as well.  </li>
            <li> Plus for about 35 dollars, even if it does break early, it won&#x27;t break the bank to replace it.</li>
            <li> However, with my sensitive skin I did notice some irritation when using it, even with shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I was getting with the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving clog-up near the foil.</li>
            <li> About 1/3 the amount of hair gets clogged up inbetween the foil and the head of the unit then with the old Bodygroom.</li>
            <li> This means I have to lift my leg up in order to shave it, whereas on the old one, I could switch the direction of the comb and just shave it standing up.</li>
            <li> However, after the initial shave it got much easier to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to go through the hell of using an old fashioned razor in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This is the third trimmer I have bought because everyone in my family wants one.</li>
            <li> I was using the old barber style plugin razors...</li>
            <li> When I was reviewing this product I was looking for something to help a 48 year old man (me) with &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> that wasn&#x27;t really the deal, and as such we know nothing about it at my age.....</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> : I would like to speak with someone directly.</li>
            <li> I will be sure to send my concerns in complaint form (I will include a transcript of this conversation).</li>
            <li> I also really like the low battery indicator</li>
            <li> and it gives plenty of warning before the razor will completely die.  </li>
            <li> so a close shave across sensitive areas isn&#x27;t going to feel like torture or scratchinig you while it cuts hair.  </li>
            <li> Early on, we thought it didn&#x27;t work because it wasn&#x27;t taking hair off.  </li>
            <li> Liking it so far...</li>
            <li> No pulling or tugging on the hairs, and gets the job done simple and fast.</li>
            <li> no problems so far</li>
            <li> but, I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> people have said these can or can&#x27;t be used for shaving you face, and as far as I can tell, there is no reason they can&#x27;t be used for that,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or scrapes, and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it like my old one -</li>
            <li> This has been fixed with the addition of a rubber housing and the blade can&#x27;t pop out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is using the guard the way the device is can get kind of tricky to cut hair.</li>
            <li> used it in stages, so I first used it with the supplied comb to cut the hair to a manageable length and then used the bare head on the skin to take off the last length of hair.  </li>
            <li> Good quality, even though the price is expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These can cut right down to the skin very safely, but are very slow and inefficient at doing so.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results at that time, I was going to write a review right away and give it a 2 star because who wants to be smooth for a night then next day have bumps all over!?!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t get as hot and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as much.&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> Other than the addition of more guards, there&#x27;s not much room for improvement here.</li>
            <li> It held a full charge for over a half hour.</li>
            <li> My girl likes my smooth skin in her favorite places, and I like the special treatment I get because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as Doctor Evil said, you really must try it:</li>
            <li> /&gt;In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to trim or shave body hair, especially on the back or below the waist.</li>
            <li> It also comes with three attachments, a charger and a little brush to clean the groomer between shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I quickly figured out when I needed to shave in a rolling manner, circular one, or use an up and down motion.</li>
            <li> Bought this to mainly do some trimming on back hairs and some around the neckline and chest.  </li>
            <li> You should definitely opt for a more expensive model, as this one is cheap and doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as my last Philips shaver.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model of this that I used for several years.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same razer several years ago at a Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> shaver works wet or dry, and I found it to be fine either way.</li>
            <li> have kept my body shaved ever since competing in bodybuilding shows years ago, mainly to avoid the weeks of prickly/itchy discomfort that accompanies the hair growing back.  </li>
            <li> The only downside I noticed was when being used for shaving, the BODYGROOM does pull hair at times ... mainly from the clippers.  </li>
            <li> Works best on thinner hair, has a bit of difficulty doing thick stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Words of advice: I suggest taking it really slow over thick hair first, then go at a normal speed over the stubble until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Also, with the old one, I could place the comb on either side of the foil and shave either way; with the new one, I can only shave with the combs inward (facing the body of the unit).</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, no issues and a better shave then the previous Norelco body groom model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with irritation and a single charge will last me about two weeks&#x27; worth of shaves.</li>
            <li> If you wait too long, this razor isn&#x27;t gonna do much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on products, but I genuinely want to help people avoid wasting money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s far better than constantly exposing your delicate nether-regions to a razor blade, isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li> Sometimes it requires a few passes, but I&#x27;ve found that true of all electric razors.  </li>
            <li> It has very precise blades and does not hurt the skin, even if you put too much pressure accidentally or in a wrong angle.</li>
            <li> The combs are solid plastic, but do have the flexibility you&#x27;ll want for certain areas, especially around the groin.</li>
            <li> I use it purely for trimming purposes and you have to go over the same area multiple times for it to work, but if then you will still miss some hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Another doctor diagnosed the sulfa allergy, and he told me that those little pink shavers we all love are the problem.</li>
            <li> But an actual razor is hard to beat and does a better job when it comes to a close shave.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with how close it trims and I have yet used it enough to run the battery down enough to recharge it for he second time.  </li>
            <li> new battery indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s low before it dies.</li>
            <li> (the replacement blades are around the same price as a new unit).  </li>
            <li> it does not give a very close shave, actually the only defence i can see after use</li>
            <li> I really prefer this for the back of my neck rather than the feel of a traditional Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Obviously you&#x27;d need to shave thick hair more often to avoid having to do this time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips has made a number of shavers over the years, and this is one of the best ( and least expensive ).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very careful and gentle when shaving sensitive areas, with this body groom though, I got nipped twice and cut once within one shave!</li>
            <li> The base is pretty great (and the biggest improvement upon the earlier models).</li>
            <li> which means some other means has to be used first.  </li>
            <li> I felt I should warn others to stay away from this product, it barely works!</li>
            <li> Try using the larger trimming comb the first time so you won&#x27;t be surprised if you end up with a shorter than expected trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> an update, make sure you go slowly!  </li>
            <li> tried the things you really shouldn&#x27;t with this shaver by first by seeing if it could mow down several days of facial hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Been clean shaving stem to stern with razors for over a decade ago since Gillete came out with the \\&quot;Protector\\&quot; with its&#x27; added small wires to reduce the nicks associated with razors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s better than a safety razor for catching back hair, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this will pull on occasion and her hair is really fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do have to be careful with the trimming edges on certain parts of your body.</li>
            <li> Basically is doesn&#x27;t work properly, hair are trapped and you have to clean every two seconds.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t need to cut down to the skin, I recommend larger teeth, like a more conventional buzzer.</li>
            <li> It turns out, it&#x27;s really just designed to trim back long body hair on men.</li>
            <li> To clean it on that upper part with the blades, simply push that black plastic on the lower blade upwards and the box with blades will pop out, showing you the hair accumulated there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t necessary to clear the hair out at all.  </li>
            <li> so far on the same charge.</li>
            <li> Any area that I did shave came out much smoother than expected.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have a problem with is the racks that it has to make the hair stand up to be cut.(I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> After years of bumpy legs and underarms, I recently developed a yeast infection in my underarms (yes, it was as gross as it sounds and itchy as H*LL)  </li>
            <li> He told me that never shaving again with those was the only way to get some relief on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Always been a fan of norelco products, I actually replaced my old bodygroom (BG2020) with this unit.</li>
            <li> surprised I&#x27;m the only one noticing this?</li>
            <li> I got no cuts so far and it gives a close body shave if you don&#x27;t use the different trimmer sizes.</li>
            <li> This is a VAST improvement over early versions in speed, run time and build quality.  </li>
            <li> If you body shave (especially chest or below the belt), you know about the near unbearable itch, burn and bumps associated with using a blade and the nicks you get with beard trimmers when encountering wrinkles and folds.  </li>
            <li> Unless you are careful taking off the combs on the old unit, the whole razor-portion of the unit ends up coming off with it, spreading bits of hair everywhere and possibly causing-if you were one of the unlucky ones-damage to the foil when it hit the counter/floor.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin at all in the sensitive areas like a beard trimmer and doesn&#x27;t leave a razor burn if going against the grain like a facial electric razor.  </li>
            <li> It took a while and didn&#x27;t grab any hairs, but my intention wasn&#x27;t to shave completely, I wanted to trim short.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I had with the old one was that the blades would occasionally catch and pop out of the unit.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many electric body groomers and nothing as frustrating to use as this.  </li>
            <li> but I usually just leave it on overnight when it needs it and a full charge lasts me about a week.</li>
            <li> But after giving the groomer a good 8 hour charge I took the plunge and gave it a serious workout - no more nicks and cuts, rashes or bleeding - and though you obviously need to be careful it is 1000 % better than a conventional beard and mustache trimmer !</li>
            <li> It’s just sad that a 5 year old razor does such a better job than a brand new one..</li>
            <li> Or if you have a lot of hair, I&#x27;d trim it down first with some scissors, then use this.</li>
            <li> This razor works much better than combo razors to be used for facial stubble and body grooming, the others proved to be too weak, while this one cuts smooth doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and has had no catching on the skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it in the shower, but other than that it&#x27;s a pretty solid trimmer.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to do any hard process to get it clean after shaving yourself.</li>
            <li> I got this based of the other reviews,  all i can really say is it works</li>
            <li> 3 x&#x27;s as much as the other direction.</li>
            <li> (Decades ago I was given my first Remington which was shaped much like a heavy wedge that, with wet fingers, fell from your hand frequently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Held on to the original until the motor gave out so was forced to upgrade.</li>
            <li> Okay, yes, my review title might sound stupid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 2-wks, but a definite recommend so far.</li>
            <li> Got 3 different guides for various lengths of hair, or you can remove it completely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going to 3 different stores and seeing products priced from $30 to $200, most of them behind glass</li>
            <li> too wide for some reason and too expensive but works good.</li>
            <li> If no other reviewers mention this, then I would imagine this to be the case, even though I&#x27;ve looked at it quite closely and can&#x27;t see any defects that would cause the following problem.  </li>
            <li> The cutting foil also seems to fit more tightly into the head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and even with no guard on you&#x27;re not going to nick yourself as long as you exercise some common sense.</li>
            <li> the most part this device seems to be a slightly modified facial hair trimmer (the blades might be a bit harsh for facial skin)</li>
            <li> I do have is very thin and soft, so anything should be able to cut it</li>
            <li> Icuts body hair pretty well, just not really good for a deep shave, and doesn&#x27;t really work on the balls.</li>
            <li> So far I have not &amp;#34;knicked&amp;#34; anything, as I have with other shavers/trimmers, it does seem to function well in sensitive areas...</li>
            <li> At least with that I feel like I&#x27;m in full control.</li>
            <li> charger needs at least 8 hours to get the shaver to full power.  </li>
            <li> Take your time the first few times and don&#x27;t try to get it all in session one.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s me get really close without hurting anything down below.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get down to the skin, but very close.  </li>
            <li> I actually like the head on this trimmer better than past, as it has some industrial plastic as opposed to metal to for less skin irritation.</li>
            <li> (The first one stopped working after 2 yrs when the on/off button stopped depressing, and the 2nd has been going strong after</li>
            <li> it&#x27;d be that the blades seem to go a bit dull rather quickly.</li>
            <li> It is not easy to shave though I would say it safer than the other shavers available in the market.</li>
            <li> it gets very close to the skin almost razor like and it is very sharp and does not hesitate to do its job.</li>
            <li> Also, the longest length setting is very close for my taste, does not allow for a less conspicuous trim.</li>
            <li> love the option of use it wet or dry, and that is small enough to take along while traveling.</li>
            <li> you can barely see it but not close as razor unless you go over same area several</li>
            <li> I am thinking this might be because my hair is thin and easily pushed.</li>
            <li> :)  after reading the negative reviews, I agree with some of the viewers it boils down to your technique.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Only real issues I have are the battery life leaving something to be desired, and it slows down a bit after going over a lot of stubble requiring a bit of an internal rinse every so often.</li>
            <li> Not only this, but it takes twice as long to trim the same amount of hair as the old bodygroom.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom is advertised as a versatile all-around shaver that will effortlessly remove unwanted body hair whether your skin is dry, wet, or lathered in shaving cream.</li>
            <li> The newly designed non-adjustable combs are designed in such a way that the trimmed hair can&#x27;t fall away and gets trapped in the comb clogging up the blade almost immediately, so you have to clear them out with a brush after almost every pass to keep working.</li>
            <li> The on/off button is easy to activate and I find the unit shuts off several times each use because I lightly bump the switch - annoying but not terrible.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help trim certain areas of my body that a regular razor just is not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Since there is no other product that we have found which works as well, we just purchased a replacement but wonder how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> When you do your chest/stomach hair it does pull a little, but not enough to cause any pain or anything, just make sure you are going over your hair in slow, deliberate motions and it will work perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would trust it 100% on those real sensitive areas but so far I&#x27;ve had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Even though trimmer while it lasted was good - the product is now useless and wasted money.</li>
            <li> I fell back to my 5 year old Remington beard trimmer with the broken adjustable comb (i took the comb off) and it plowed right through the hair no problem.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced the battery charging issues others have mentioned, mine seems to work fine at least over the first three months I have had it.</li>
            <li> Since I dont have much body hair, not sure if that was good or bad product.</li>
            <li> My old one was a philips like this one but the other end had a trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a longer lasting charge and a shaver that doesn&#x27;t take as long to charge as well, then you should get the next one above it.</li>
            <li> I showed signs of a sulfa allergy, which was actually worse than the original problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the little round points on the outside blades work great (no scratching or cutting like my old trimmer)</li>
            <li> So big long white hairs sticking out both sides of his head</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the recharge time is pretty slow</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not painful, but enough of a tug to be irritating.</li>
            <li> However, when my ex finally used it on his, not so luxurious mane down stairs, if ya know what I mean, he looked and felt as smooth as a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> The charging head on the old one hung down and is a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> I usually end up replacing the whole unit because I can&#x27;t find the foils in stores</li>
            <li> Only time will tell how well it holds up in the long run...</li>
            <li> Long charge time, short battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They recommend that you run the battery completely flat before recharging it to improve the battery life.</li>
            <li> After the initial charge the shaver stays charged for long periods of time with no faltering or need to</li>
            <li> It does its job with only minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> My husband used it and it pulled the hairs directly out rather than shaving them down.  </li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin down there.</li>
            <li> Not worth buying the more expensive versions since I guess they will last the same.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m optimistic that it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give four stars is that it is almost not usable in shower , but on dry skin it trims well</li>
            <li> Get a heavier shaver for less sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco would fade to black after 15-20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Now when issues such as hairiness is openly and widely discussed, the Bodygroomer is in, uhm, the thicket of the discourse.</li>
            <li> The battery is consistent, I mean, it lasts as long as written on product details (50 mins) and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why you would want to merely shorten your back hair, but to each his own.  </li>
            <li> After my old trimmer died after many years of use, I had the worst trimmer experience with the BG2028.&lt;br /&gt;It can only trim one way, pinches, pulls hair and feels very bulky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not giving it five stars because he still requires several other trimmers for regular use.  </li>
            <li> I bought another version with the actual clippers on one side and the same trimmer on the other</li>
            <li> I ordered the extra replacement foil and expect it will last a long time as the other two have.</li>
            <li> works as well as previous model owned, but the blade fits poorly and falls out easily.  </li>
            <li> Having used another Philips Norelco bodygroomer before this one, my main complaint was how low performing the battery was.</li>
            <li> the negative, as with the old trimmer, the cutter that comes with the new trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the replacement blades-- cutting performance improves surprisingly much after the first blade replacement.  </li>
            <li> Cutting foil has been improved over the first version and give a much smoother shave now.</li>
            <li> Battery efficient and it can either trim or shave pretty much anything without pinching or cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> I would like it better if the head weren&#x27;t tipped forward, which can make it awkward to maneuver (</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t irritate me at the most inconvenient times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more cuts or sores normally incurred by men who keep their nether regions in check.</li>
            <li> the long run, it is probably a money saver too.  </li>
            <li> Works basicly everywhere, if one direction feels too rough, take the blade cart.</li>
            <li> Another plus is how long it holds a charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hairy guy either...seems strange.</li>
            <li> As a woman, you don&#x27;t need to spend an extra $20-40 to get a pink razor that&#x27;s &amp;#34;made for women&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This product is only for minimal grooming.</li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Hod charge for long time.</li>
            <li> Those days are long gone with this groomer (and I would assume any \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> Shortest setting is still too long for his desired length.</li>
            <li> Recharge time is long, but shouldn&#x27;t be an issue if you leave it plugged in your bathroom all day.</li>
            <li> The charging dock is convenient to use and battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to everyone, no matter how long they want their body hair to be.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not entirely surprised.</li>
            <li> Runs a long time on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> as long as you use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I ended up taking the comb off and using it under a running shower head down to bare skin.</li>
            <li> Not only was it a little cheaper then the other two I bought, it had the fixed trimmer</li>
            <li> tried the razor wet and dry, and different types of movement (short strokes, rolling, up and down, back and forth, shake it all about), nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Tried both wet and dry with similar results.</li>
            <li> It is still a bit rough on the privates and clogs (I wish they would have fixed this after the previous model), but it does well for the price.</li>
            <li> is a solid performer, that can be used dry or wet.</li>
            <li> the first thing that needs to be addressed is that the packaging is a little hard to open its in a clam shell that is sealed 360 degrees</li>
            <li> Use as recommended by the Manufacturer and be a little careful on the sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Regardless, I decided to make my 2nd body groomer also a Norelco mostly due to the price.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a product I&#x27;ll buy at some other point if I have the chance.</li>
            <li> You definitely want to use some type of shaving cream or other type of friction lessening product.  </li>
            <li> , does a pretty poor job in the shower on wet hair, even though advertised as such</li>
            <li> But this body groomer not only reaches those spots without any burns, it can also be used for other areas around the body.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, this thing is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> but once you get that charge, you can get two or three uses out of it before you need to re-charge it again, making it a vast improvement over other models.</li>
            <li> The hard, plastic-covered switch feels like it will last longer than the old rubber-covered switch on the 2020, which used to get stuck</li>
            <li> Again the hair shouldn&#x27;t be very long or else</li>
            <li> I use it dry, before my shower.  </li>
            <li> but as of this date I have NOT used it for anything but dry shaving.</li>
            <li> when dry, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li> I just trimmed dry and NOTHING pulled or got knicked.</li>
            <li> It can get a bit bothersome to clean, but it isn&#x27;t difficult, just time consuming.</li>
            <li> operated it dry.  </li>
            <li> for every single men.</li>
            <li> Runs for days on a single charge.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the main shave head seems very delicate.  </li>
            <li> On my first use, it hurt pretty bad due to long hair on my chest and stomach.</li>
            <li> I am not normally one that writes reviews on products</li>
            <li> I would rate it average thought for the following reasons</li>
            <li> so things are not just loose but for $20.00 it aint a biggie.</li>
            <li> This is not strong at all and it performs less than a normal razor.</li>
            <li> Fellas, get use to this trimmer before trimming down low!</li>
            <li> When you add the attachments, they push down the hair and only some of it gets cut.</li>
            <li> The extra hair just washes down the sink.</li>
            <li> but this again if given an option simply because I cannot put 30 mins t shave down there.</li>
            <li> Same thing outside and inside! :/</li>
            <li> Works well dry or wet.</li>
            <li> shaves very nicely on wet or dry skin.</li>
            <li> A big improvement over the previous BG2020 design, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it with the different comb attachments....and even without (scary at first).  </li>
            <li> Works well in wet and dry conditions.  </li>
            <li> I have used it wet and dry.</li>
            <li> The Bodygroom is designed to be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I tried it in the shower too since it’s for wet and dry and again, no luck.</li>
            <li> Can be used dry or wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The unit is not loud, and does not vibrate in the hand like other products.  </li>
            <li> For how cheap you can get it on Amazon, I think I can justify having it as a &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; trimmer (i.e. it gets a close enough shave for when I&#x27;m lazy or for keeping stubble at bay for day to day casual situations).</li>
            <li> The initial shaver came with a broken charging stand that we didn&#x27;t discover for months because he procrastinated trying the new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Trimmers work nicely, but the angle of the design and lack of a pivot make this a very awkward experience.</li>
            <li> I have only used it as a dry body shaver for back and scrotum areas (go slow and stretch the skin</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t come with the attachment that&#x27;s a little smaller and used tp trim beards.</li>
            <li> following day, we both had little bumps where we used it...</li>
            <li> I have to make several passes to remove even a little bit of hair, regardless of the body part.  </li>
            <li> so you half to have sharp scissors to open it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more painful to use.  </li>
            <li> and then if you aren&#x27;t extremely careful.</li>
            <li> and there if you don&#x27;t be careful</li>
            <li> and I think it was money well spent.</li>
            <li> I spent 45 min on hold before talking to a Norelco customer service person to confirm the unit was defective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a couple of years, and I&#x27;ve found that it gets harder and harder to charge.</li>
            <li> This is not at all what i expected.  </li>
            <li> Be careful and remember to replace the foil before the 1yr mark.  </li>
            <li> and there when I notice a few hairs starting to grow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy.</li>
            <li> I have taken it on trips and if it&#x27;s a few days, not necessary to take charger.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive and not very refined attachments.</li>
            <li> Comes out of the box partially charged, for immediate use.  </li>
            <li> It is a rough cut with this guy.</li>
            <li> These combs are way easier to take off, although it is a bit harder to tell the size differences without looking at the numbers imprinted on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can practically shave with my eyes closed with this model.</li>
            <li> Well, it works as expected.</li>
            <li> But it shaves my nether regions as expected.</li>
            <li> It can handle beards, but it&#x27;s really not meant for that.</li>
            <li> I do recommend Norelco&#x27;s body groomer nonfoaming gel and having the area slightly wet makes it easier.</li>
            <li> The device is water resistant, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it too wet and was designed with hypoallergenic foil and rounded blades and combs to prevent skin irritation.  </li>
            <li> used this shaver on my father, a man who never really bought into &#x27;manscaping&#x27; before.  </li>
            <li> is the only way to destroy the evils this thing possesses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> Although, I do wish they listed the expected lifespan of the non-user replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I only have myself to blame for missing the return and refund period.  </li>
            <li> The electric razor itself is lighter than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of rechargeable shavers for this specific reason....</li>
            <li> this stop working the second time i used, just stop charging the batery, it only charged one time and no more!</li>
            <li> I like it as much as I like any other BodyGroomer I&#x27;ve owned, essentially, but the attachable trimmers are useless.</li>
            <li> They were completely inept at cutting thru any decent amount of hair.</li>
            <li> For me wet worked the best,it comes with 3 combs to trim hair in areas other than the legs to the desired length.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I know that talking about hair removal for women is a sensitive topic, but ladies, THIS IS IT.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I know that talking about hair removal for women is a sensitive topic, but ladies, THIS IS IT.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Phillips Norelco clipper and found this newer model frustrating.</li>
            <li> My chest and belly hair gets a little long, and I used to shave it, but shaving (or trimming too close) causes it to be prickly.</li>
            <li> It is a little tricky for people that do not have a lot of hair or a lot of long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Second, half of those few hairs it &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; feel as if they are ripped out by tweezers.</li>
            <li> Norelco offered no help other then to confirm that the unit was defective.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this or any other Norelco product.</li>
            <li> I have used a facial razor in the past and had some nicks and bleeding as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> off and turn it the other way.</li>
            <li> I had to go over a small area several time for the trimmer to trim.  </li>
            <li> I have had similar shavers in the past where you had to use a comb- without one you would mutilate yourself.</li>
            <li> Works well on chest and other areas.</li>
            <li> It takes me a while to shave my entire body, so I usually have to charge it halfway through.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t knick your balls, but sharp blades</li>
            <li> and it gets the spots that my other electric shaver (Norelco Nivea) either can not reach or burns the hell out of my neck.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t notice any snagging like other user mentioned.</li>
            <li> It is beyond my comprehension to understand what was going on with these other people.</li>
            <li> The gift was not used until recently because it was a gift so it is now slightly past the 45 day guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this is due to the configuration of the clipper blades.</li>
            <li> The other issue I had was the placement of the power switch and the way it actuates.</li>
            <li> but that might be due to technique rather than product.</li>
            <li> pinching, nicking, or other unpleasantries.</li>
            <li> The teeth are rounded instead of sharp and that seems to make the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hairs were still a little tough to get during the first round, due to their coarseness, but eventually we got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no pulling as the blades on the cutter head are very sharp and meshed closely together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I did lose the trimmer holder (plastic holder) and had to purchase a new one, and was not happy with customer service</li>
            <li> So that means less time spent using the brush to unclog it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used previous versions in the past and this lives up to that standard.</li>
            <li> It looks really slick, is lighter than the previous model, and feels solid in the hand.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea what these other people who left negative reviews are talking about.</li>
            <li> Probably a conventional electric razor would work on that type of hair.  </li>
            <li> The rounded teeth are probably to blame as less hair enters the clippers than compared to one with sharp teeth.  </li>
            <li> Hard to review this without being too graphic,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave stubbles or itchy red patches on the body, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the battery life.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd (at least) bodygroom.  </li>
            <li> i would say that the only negative thing about this electric blade is the noise it makes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have thick facial hair, and this doesn&#x27;t even work on that.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t need to push it against the skin, but gliding it slowly over it, while making a back and forth movement with one&#x27;s wrist that keeps the shaver in contact with the skin.</li>
            <li> I find that this one cuts just as well for forty dollars less, and has the reach feature for hard to get to parts like a guys back area.&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this unit is still advertised as working dry or wet, the wet performance remains poor-- hair gets matted down with water, the wet hair bits stick to the cutter, and the combs don&#x27;t glide as well with the friction of damp skin.  </li>
            <li> There is a thin rubber piece running down the side of the razor that helps with support, but the razor does have a plastic body and felt slipper at times (I only used the razor dry, so do not know how it would feel using in the shower).</li>
            <li> When it arrived I immediately went to work on the growing jungle I had down below.</li>
            <li> shaving down there matters.</li>
            <li> of you like when woman shaved down there, don&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;outta nowhere driving down the road&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;reaching over to ENGAGE while we&#x27;re watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was down to using[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> below the neck, on everything from your chest and arms down to your toes</li>
            <li> Because of this, I&#x27;m assuming the Bodygroom can also be used down there, though I&#x27;ve never tried this nor do I have a reason to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you run down to \\&quot;empty\\&quot; you will have to charge for a while before you can finish.  </li>
            <li> ; I would expect a much faster shave in those hard to reach areas,&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; one might feel small nick like stuff happening in some delicate parts while shaving though I did not see any visible bleeding or cuts.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The down side is that previous clippers of this brand started wearing out after ~2 years.</li>
            <li> short, if you have the old BodyGroom, you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this one (unless you buy the one with the backhandle, which might offset the con mentioned above) and will probably want to hang on to that one.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp and does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see and advantage with respect to my previous Phipils Body Groom trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll take the slightly less close of a shave.</li>
            <li> My previous one, the battery died.</li>
            <li> is a slight irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a couple of adjusters for &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; of hair you are trying to trim, but doesn&#x27;t grab hair evenly if you are not super hairy</li>
            <li> Charger stand is a plus and price on Amazon was less than any place.</li>
            <li> Cuts body grooming time in half.</li>
            <li> Quite an upgrade from my previous Bodygroom, which ended up quitting after about 7 years.</li>
            <li> There are slight improvements made to this one over the previous model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It made his bottom half look like a models.</li>
            <li> This model holds a charge WAY longer than the previous one.</li>
            <li> This was an issue I had with the previous model</li>
            <li> (This might be typical of waterproof devices.)</li>
            <li> A replacement blade is $13 and that is about half what I paid for the unit.  </li>
            <li> Previous one lasted for two years and broke to pieces.</li>
            <li> Incredibly tedious, made the job take five times longer than the older model.</li>
            <li> When it starts to get dull, don&#x27;t try to hold out too long, just buy another one</li>
            <li> It slides right into the charging base, you don&#x27;t have to fuss to get it properly seated.</li>
            <li> so I can take it into the shower with me and not have to worry about making a mess in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> My preference would be for it to be a little narrower and/or less material to the sides of the trimmers.</li>
            <li> periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs now lock tightly onto the trimmer, and also seem to have a smoother</li>
            <li> I followed all of the charging instructions for this shaver and it was dead after less than 15 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Now it has less chance of cutting you, but it will be more difficult to cut hair efficiently since less hair fits in the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Charging takes a little time</li>
            <li> The little trimmers on either side of the shaver did basically nothing.</li>
            <li> (im a little paranoid)  </li>
            <li> sometimes it scrapes, sometimes it bleeds, but with this little gadget, there&#x27;s none of that.  </li>
            <li> I feel the hair snagging a little when I shave.</li>
            <li> This little guy keeps going and going.</li>
            <li> my husband used to \\&quot;manscape\\&quot;, it took a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> just little oooh ouch.</li>
            <li> I lost the little comb things</li>
            <li> I opted for little.</li>
            <li> or it will nick a little).</li>
            <li> Wish it got a little closer on the foil shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little cautious shaving my... areas, but it&#x27;s just my paranoia.</li>
            <li> I wished I found it years ago and that the tool would stay a little sharper.</li>
            <li> I have used this on 2 occasions hoping that the first time it was bad due to</li>
            <li> Very average shaver.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing that has happened so far for me is that there is no warning when the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;groomer are not effective at all and very difficult to clean the grooming blades</li>
            <li> You will get a few nicks here</li>
            <li> it is simply the worse design i have ever come across.</li>
            <li> no matter which way i used this razor it is simply not a smooth shave</li>
            <li> This came with a non-functional, dead power supply.</li>
            <li> Gives you a close shave, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, and doesn&#x27;t cut me even though I&#x27;m dealing with uneven body curves.</li>
            <li> a green LED is supposed to show indicating a charge is occurring nothing.</li>
            <li> There is a rubberized section on either side of the shaver that enabled me to get a firm grip.</li>
            <li> It appears to be made only for thin or sparse</li>
            <li> One of the combs was missing from the package, so I contacted the company and they sent it to me at no cost.</li>
            <li> to charge once dead</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m too impatient to wait for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Again i have thicker hair, so the result may be different for people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday since I got it (2 weeks) and have not charged it ever since opening the box.</li>
            <li> that is firm and refuses to be pushed away, thus it&#x27;s directed into the blades.</li>
            <li> have used it a few times since getting out of the hosp...</li>
            <li> The power cord only plugs into the stand, not the razor, so you cannot leave the stand behind.</li>
            <li> so there are times where the battery would be dead for a week before I got to charging it again.</li>
            <li> I also have extremely sensitive skin so using any shaver, electric or manual, is generally an uncomfortable experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this product, take your time the 1st few times till you get the hang of it......and HANG ON.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Here are a few of our observations on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I just wasted $40</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only frustrating part</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have complained that it is ineffective against thick, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get out of the plastic sealed clamshell pack - plan on using a utility knife or something sharp to cut it out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My experience with the older 2020 model was disappointing in</li>
            <li> The attachements work well for common lengths and the ability to use it wet or dry is convenient for cleaning, but, of course, less usable when cutting any length of hair beyond flush since wet hair doesn&#x27;t work with the guides  (not the razors fault).  </li>
            <li> This shaver pulls hair which is pretty painful.</li>
            <li> No more irritation and messy gels.</li>
            <li> It had a little trouble with thick hair.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a cheaper hair trimmer, this is absolutely nothing different from a cheap trimmer besides an outrageous price for such a terrible product.</li>
            <li> You really should go slow, but I was going crazy on my shaft and balls with this thing</li>
            <li> It is quite the miraculous little device!</li>
            <li> Cutting dense hair, such facial with these will be a very slow process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on a weekly basis for a few months now - I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t try this sooner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> No more packages of razors, no more fancy shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> No more packages of razors, no more fancy shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gotten to be almost impossible to find a decent wet/dry shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li> surface-- no more having them pop off during use from the friction against my skin.  </li>
            <li> The time it takes to shave overgrown hair is not appropriate for this product.</li>
            <li> I would prefer a small WAHL hair clipper that my dad used to edge my hair with when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally found this difficult to use on the &amp;#34;below the neck&amp;#34; areas which is why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> No more knicks, cuts, and razor bumps.</li>
            <li> and it just doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap for us.  </li>
            <li> No more hairs that get caught and the motor seems to be a bit stronger.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 trimmers in the past at Target and paid almost $50.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not safe to do</li>
            <li> but they would not honor their guarantee even though It was a Christmas gift and was just 6 days past the guarantee date.  </li>
            <li> : You have already past 45 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the foil shaver is rather small and will take longer to shave a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The charger is small, but doesn&#x27;t work without the stand.  </li>
            <li> I tried it in the shower and wet makes it pull much worse.  </li>
            <li> the charger is simple and easy to use (not that the others were bad, just I hate my electric razors)</li>
            <li> Not very good.  </li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to use, totally ineffective for cutting, and difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Imagine if I had gotten that bad boy near my balls!</li>
            <li> Learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> The one&#x27;s blades had just gotten dull and the battery life was just about gone.  </li>
            <li> The guards are sometimes hard to get off.</li>
            <li> Money is hard to come by</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t press it too hard on the skin to avoid cuts.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trimming with scissors and tried electric razors but will little</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the negative reviews...</li>
            <li> problem is, for us at least, it doesn&#x27;t WORK.  </li>
            <li> Has 3 attachments for different cutting lengths, can also be used with out the attachments.  </li>
            <li> The shaving sucks on this one.</li>
            <li> Where can I send a complaint E-mail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try to be delicate with this review, so as not to offend anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always charged, and always out of the way) and because it doesn&#x27;t hurt me when I use it in delicate places.</li>
            <li> I had one complaint or criticism</li>
            <li> : On the third use I started to notice it \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; instead of cutting.  </li>
            <li> it sucks.</li>
            <li> Albeit my body hair is fairly thick, however I am no wolf man.  </li>
            <li> : Go slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It wasnt working at 1st, held it in another direction and slowly started seeing the hair being removed.</li>
            <li> Norelco stands behind its products just return the unit you have and get another one and see what you are missing.  </li>
            <li> These are all about being slow and avoiding injuring, not taking off a thick beard.  </li>
            <li> The boys like it too if you know what I mean</li>
            <li> no more nicks and cuts in the &amp;#34;under the Hood&amp;#34; department for me!</li>
            <li> second i was a little disappointed that they don&#x27;t give a carrying sleeve to contain everything in one</li>
            <li> I mean like....</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t mean to rush you, just checking to see if we are still connected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suzan: I don&#x27;t mean to rush you, just checking to see if we are still connected.</li>
            <li> The manual specifies this, but if you plan on using this somewhere that is hard to reach, it will be very difficult to maintain the necessary holding angle to achieve the close cut.  </li>
            <li> In any event disappointed I&#x27;m out 40 bucks for a shaver that fails right out the box.</li>
            <li> stop using a razor or scary electric razor down there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying to use on my body as I have to go over sections multiple times (no matter how little hair there is).</li>
            <li> trimming, the head falls off, uncomfortable cutting action...</li>
            <li> Plus a possibility to get a little cut is there sadly if you catch what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
            <li> and I’m a little sad about it.</li>
            <li> the second bad thing, is the trimmer can catch hair and yank, so it will feel at time like some one is yanking the hair out.  </li>
            <li> Probably the only way you could get any closer would be to use a dipilatator, a method that is often quite painful.</li>
            <li> The charge time on the battery is atrocious at 8 hours (seems the only difference between this and the Plus version</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> The only issue (as other reported) is that it will gebogged down and stop when used to shave thicker hair, which can be kinda&#x27; painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> Using the #1 comb attachment I found it to be extremely slow and had a difficult time cutting long hair.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is the products weak point.</li>
            <li> : I Just checked with y supervisor and sorry we are not able to process the refund for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Later that night (after we had taken the garbage to the dumpster) I tried it and was severely disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you want to remove hair from delicate places without painful nicks and cuts, this little devil will do the trick.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great ...</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase when I bought it.</li>
            <li> so i opted for this base model, (which was practically the same except for the shorter charge time and no pivoting head).  </li>
            <li> I finally solved the problem but it was annoying in extremis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone mentioned earlier, the attachments are practically worthless if you want to trim to a shorter length.  </li>
            <li> Leaves a blood bath behind...</li>
            <li> Also, the plug on the charging base takes up only one outlet in the wall or one outlet on a power strip.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s a secret:</li>
            <li> I tired out before the unit</li>
            <li> Groom with confidence and peace of mind of no more dangerous cuts.</li>
            <li> After a while, if you find it isn&#x27;t cutting as well, remember that you can pick up a replacement trimmer foil for it (after a while they get dull).</li>
            <li> like its predecessor, you will find it nearly impossible to nick, cut or scratch yourself no matter how clumsily you&#x27;re flailing about to shave anywhere.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed, this is my 3rd Norelco item aside from 2 shavers.</li>
            <li> After doing some online research I decided to give this a try, though I was still skeptical.  </li>
            <li> The 3 combs that came with are at times difficult to snap and stay on there, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m snapping them in incorrectly.  </li>
            <li> so now I just use the trimmer , I just picked wrong</li>
            <li> Just a weird design, IMO.  </li>
            <li> so those attachments are completely useless when trying to trim body hair.</li>
            <li> im sorry</li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> ill start with replacement adapter cable</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if these are fake reviews or what, but this thing NIPS like no other.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Game over!</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> ER trips are expensive and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the attachments to be useless, but the unit itself works well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t get that opportunity.</li>
            <li> it is fairly uncomfortable to use at times and takes longer than I would like sometimes )</li>
            <li> : Unfortunately we cannot give you refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased in my entire life!</li>
            <li> Taking off the head proved to be difficult though.</li>
            <li> the shave becomes difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For shaving your chest, back, legs, and arms, the Philips Norelco BG2028 works insanely well...</li>
            <li> I get bad ingrown hairs (especially down there) and when I&#x27;ve used this, I haven&#x27;t had that issue at all.</li>
            <li> By comparison, the Norelco does a very poor job of trimming close.</li>
            <li> Rather than cutting, it seems to grab the hair and yank it out, then trapping the hair in the screen.</li>
            <li> No rash, pulling it cutting.</li>
            <li> You can go all crazy with it and not worry about cutting up your man parts.  </li>
            <li> cutting blades (one on each side) for longer hair&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suzan: Please see if you are comfortble with trimmer after 21 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: If I am unhappy at the end of 21 days</li>
            <li> They also have rounded tips between the cutting blades</li>
            <li> The reviews talking about nicks and cuts or pulling v cutting hair must have defective units.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for a disposable razor!  </li>
            <li> The attachments are useless as it doesn&#x27;t get the darn hair off!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t obscenely expensive (yay!)</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get all the hair.</li>
            <li> This makes for a very uncomfortable time after putting underwear or a shirt on.</li>
            <li> As a hairy chick who shaves every 1-2 days, this seemed impossible.  </li>
            <li> Bad move.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> just bad</li>
            <li> It was painful and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, as I haven&#x27;t had any painful moments yets...</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> Years ago I purchased a Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom and was rather disappointed in the performance and quality of the device.  </li>
            <li> I was kinda disappointed with this purchase because they the blades could be way sharper.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving because I always manage to cut myself, or get itchy or otherwise irritated.</li>
            <li> Undeterred I managed to chop out a region just at the base of the shaft and decided to try out the shaver.</li>
            <li> oh and the fact that I hate wasting money -.-</li>
            <li> Plenty of idiots in the comment complain it gave them rashes on their necks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly annoying, and has persisted even with replacement blades/</li>
            <li> Improved charging base.</li>
            <li> The base does not require you to push the unit into it in order to connect the charging contacts.</li>
            <li> Annoying but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re anything like me and hate having your hair pulled in the nether regions, then this is an awful product that belongs in the garbage.</li>
            <li> and I hated it.</li>
            <li> but I hated the way it swiveled.</li>
            <li> disappointed, stay away!</li>
            <li> Horrible body groomer!</li>
            <li> It happens but still annoying!</li>
            <li> The BG2020 had NO issues, never nipped me one time, but this model is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made on Amazon.</li>
            <li> if you have thicker hair, this will be horrible for you.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda torn with this body groomer. It works good but it&#x27;s not great ...I have to go over the skin a couple of times before i feel it&#x27;s a closer enough shave, but it&#x27;s good enough. It&#x27;s keeps an excellent charge though and it&#x27;s pretty light.</li>
            <li> Works well for the price.</li>
            <li> My beef with this trimmer is that it doesnt handle thicker hair well at all.  It catches and chokes.  I have another groomer that cuts right through no problem.  I dont know if its the short profile blades or what, but if you are expecting a clean cut, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Does everything I need it to do well. My only gripe is that the recharge time is pretty slow but if you don&#x27;t plan on using it daily it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Works good. All my Nerelco problems have short battery life and end up giving up after a year. Hope this one is different.</li>
            <li> Bought this to mainly do some trimming on back hairs and some around the neckline and chest.  Works real well in these areas.  The trimmer attachements are somewhat flimsy and based on how they worked, I probably won&#x27;t use them much.  But, the blade by itself does a good job.  I have not experienced the battery charging issues others have mentioned, mine seems to work fine at least over the first three months I have had it.</li>
            <li> its helpful and cut the very well  but if you like to use it with water dont buy it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Pros:  waterproof, holds a good charge, works fairly well, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  will knick you now and then if you aren&#x27;t extremely careful.</li>
            <li> Better than the original I bought years ago, sturdier, holds the charge far longer, head is not flimsy, like the first one.  Norelco rocks!</li>
            <li> Works very well and can be used in shower or bath too.</li>
            <li> This is one piece of GARBAGE! Could not deliver a close shave even with no facial hair! Do NOT waste your money!</li>
            <li> A great product for body grooming and cheap too. Doesn&#x27;t leave stubbles or itchy red patches on the body, at least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as effective on the face as it is on the body but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called the body groom.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Good sturdy grip and did what it claims to do. It is a trimmer - you will have pointy fuzz that are very minute to the eye when you feel the skin - maybe a easy shave to follow up will be needed.</li>
            <li> This razor/ personal groomer rocks !  After years of ever so careful trimming of my man parts in order to please my woman,  my old trimmer finally conked out and needed replacement.  After doing some online research I decided to give this a try, though I was still skeptical.  But after giving the groomer a good 8 hour charge I took the plunge and gave it a serious workout - no more nicks and cuts, rashes or bleeding - and though you obviously need to be careful it is 1000 % better than a conventional beard and mustache trimmer !</li>
            <li> nice groomer for the price</li>
            <li> Love this groomer! The battery life is great and suitable for me and my husband! I&#x27;m glad I purchased this groomer!</li>
            <li> Fellas, get use to this trimmer before trimming down low! it gets very close to the skin almost razor like and it is very sharp and does not hesitate to do its job. the first time was a nightmare going with no guard. I used it 4-5 times since I bought and am finally getting used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is very good, long lasting battery, more so then I thought. I have used it 5 times (about 1.5 months) so far on the same charge.</li>
            <li> Good razor for its use in &amp;#34;bodygrooming&amp;#34;. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on the most &amp;#34;tender&amp;#34; bits, but great for keeping chesthair, arm hair, etc a manageable length without looking like Bigfoot. Perfect for what its designed for, if a little pricey.</li>
            <li> got to shave my private regions and this works like a charm.  Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Its water proof and it does a great job and manscaping. Big pro is that it is water proof. You really need that convenience. Get it!</li>
            <li> Works like a champ.  The 3 combs that came with are at times difficult to snap and stay on there, but that&#x27;s probably because I&#x27;m snapping them in incorrectly.  I&#x27;d recommend it anyway.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would use something like this product, nor would need to have one, yet it does what it says it does. The positive reviews help explain the benefits &amp; features well.</li>
            <li> Works fine for me!&lt;br /&gt;And for the price, you cannot beat it!</li>
            <li> Works great! The only bad thing that has happened so far for me is that there is no warning when the battery is dead. 2 people using it weekly the battery lasts for almost a month.</li>
            <li> I had a Philips Norelco BG2040 BodyGroom Pro. It was awesome. Somehow I lost the stand and thought I&#x27;d buy this BG2028 instead of buying a $25 stand for the BG2040. Bad move. This thing is way inferior, it just doesn&#x27;t shave as smoothly. It&#x27;s not even a close contest. In fact, I&#x27;m buying another BG2040 now.</li>
            <li> This groomer stays charged forever!</li>
            <li> I should have looked at it better be for I punched it ,didn&#x27;t meet my expect ions foil gave out too soon so now I just use the trimmer , I just picked wrong</li>
            <li> Use it for below the belt area, works very well.. clean shave. No problem at all. Don&#x27;t trust the negative reviews... this is good stuff.. and i&#x27;m not working for philips or anything... this is unbiased review..</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my son-in-law! He absolutely LOVES it! The fact that he can use it in the shower makes it even better!!</li>
            <li> My first norelco body groomer died after 3 years. Since I dont have much body hair, not sure if that was good or bad product. Regardless, I decided to make my 2nd body groomer also a Norelco mostly due to the price. This Noreclo BG2028 looks more modern and is definately trimming better/easier than my 1st groomer. For the price, I would recommend. I cannot speak for how this product would work for someone with a ton of hair.</li>
            <li> Held on to the original until the motor gave out so was forced to upgrade. Same great product.</li>
            <li> Easy to control, and I love that it is cordless. Had been using trimmer that had removable heads, but realized I was always using the same one and this is much, much better.</li>
            <li> Works great, wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Just the ticket for keeping body hair tamed.</li>
            <li> Even though it was relatively inexpensive, it performs it&#x27;s job quite well. You will get a few nicks here and there if you don&#x27;t be careful but it&#x27;s no fault of the machine. Just gotta pull your skin tight and it will be fine. Comes with a bunch of attachments, more than I could really use but I see the value in it all. It&#x27;s nice to have them around just to know that in case I need them, I have them. All in all, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> No more cuts or sores normally incurred by men who keep their nether regions in check. It doesn&#x27;t look like it would be safe at first glace. Trust me though, you will not get 1 nick or scratch using this thing. I cant speak to the utility of the guards as I have no needed to use one. You will be given far more attention by your female friend after using this - I guarantee it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this on a weekly basis for a few months now - I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t try this sooner! Closer shave that&#x27;s 100X safer than a regular set of clippers. Never again will my &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin suffer at the cost of being well groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I have not tried any of the competitors products, I feel no reason to as I could never ask anything more from this handy little device. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Worth it. Very nice product&lt;br /&gt;Must be in wardrobe !&lt;br /&gt;Useful for every single men. I have tried many different groomers, but this is the most i like it ever !</li>
            <li> I actually does what it is supposed to do.  It trims hair all over with relative ease.  It cuts forward and reverse at two different angles and doesn&#x27;t tend to pinch or catch on skin.  Only time will tell how well it holds up in the long run...</li>
            <li> My chest and belly hair gets a little long, and I used to shave it, but shaving (or trimming too close) causes it to be prickly. Using the #1 guard on this trims it to the perfect length - it&#x27;s short enough that it looks good, yet not so short that it becomes prickly. My only complaint is the battery life. I used it only twice, for not very long, and the battery light was already turning on for a recharge.</li>
            <li> You should definitely opt for a more expensive model, as this one is cheap and doesn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as my last Philips shaver.  I had to go out and buy another one after a week.</li>
            <li> This product is fine.  I also have used the &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; model (BG 2040), which is a much better product.  More durable and better shaving.  At the price, this model is ok, but if you can, buy the pro model - it&#x27;s worth the significantly higher price.</li>
            <li> Like some others report, this electric shaver is ok. The only issue (as other reported) is that it will gebogged down and stop when used to shave thicker hair, which can be kinda&#x27; painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> This is my third one and I love how easy it is to use on unwanted hair.  I ordered the extra replacement foil and expect it will last a long time as the other two have.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see and advantage with respect to my previous Phipils Body Groom trimmer. Same thing outside and inside! :/</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very useful.</li>
            <li> Your girlfriend/wife/lovers are gonna love it, and get h***y (happy) easier. It has very precise blades and does not hurt the skin, even if you put too much pressure accidentally or in a wrong angle. The battery lasts for a long time, plenty of time to shave the whole chest, belly and intimate areas.</li>
            <li> This works great when used on dry skin.  It does not work very well in the shower with water running on you.  It does not irritate your skin at all and I have not been cut by it once.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Works well, went right through all my hair without issue -- easy to clean</li>
            <li> This shipped quickly, and shaves very closely to the skin. Depending on what area you are shaving you might want to quickly go over it with a razor to get the last little bit of stubble, but this groomer does a VERY good job and I think it was money well spent. Plus it&#x27;s water proof so you can take it into the shower!</li>
            <li> I do not like this thing at all.  It works well with no guard but I can&#x27;t get it to cut very well at all with any of the guards on.  I don&#x27;t like the angle with which you have to hold it to cut either.  Just a weird design, IMO.  I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> I am not normally one that writes reviews on products however i have to comment on this razor.  I have purchased many electric body groomers and nothing as frustrating to use as this.  it is simply the worse design i have ever come across. if this is a body groomer then why does the 3 attachments only trim at 1,2 and 3 inch lengths.  so those attachments are completely useless when trying to trim body hair. so the only option you have is no attachemnts and then that just shaves it off so close when all i want to do is groom my hair. hense the name body groomer. but you cant because there are not attachements the correct length for that. so the only thing its good for is maybe a beard trimmer . no matter which way i used this razor it is simply not a smooth shave im sorry it is aweful. its almost like they hired some interns to design a razor and then decided to market it. save your money but if  you do buy this and are swearing at it as you are smashing it against the bathroom wall dont forget i warned you.</li>
            <li> The product worked as promised, remove every millimeter of hair, I am very happy with my new clean body shaved look!</li>
            <li> I bought it to keep arm, chest &amp; belly hair under control. It does the job and feels good doing it. It does look and feel kind of cheaply made, and it takes 8 hours to charge fully.</li>
            <li> I had an older model of this that I used for several years. It ended up dying on me (I believe the battery went on it). I bought another one though, because I like how well they work. After a while, if you find it isn&#x27;t cutting as well, remember that you can pick up a replacement trimmer foil for it (after a while they get dull). I did this with my first one and it made a world of difference...plus it&#x27;s way cheaper than buying a whole new trimmer!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave nearly as close as my wife or I would like. My hair is thick and this will pull on occasion and her hair is really fine so this will go over and not even cut a hair.  Tried both wet and dry with similar results.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Well built and works great.</li>
            <li> Great product, however it is very easy to loose the attachments that were included. Otherwise, it t trims very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of these norelco trimmers over the years, always been a fan as I keep buying them. I actually like the head on this trimmer better than past, as it has some industrial plastic as opposed to metal to for less skin irritation. Works well dry or wet. Recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love the Bodygroom, i love how easy to use and gentle it is on all parts of the body and she likes the results. Attention MEN! stop using a razor or scary electric razor down there. This is safe!</li>
            <li> Arrived just as described! Excellent packing and delivered perfectly on time! This is definitely a product I&#x27;ll buy at some other point if I have the chance.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  Does not cut quite as closely as a previous one owned, but maybe feel better after more use.</li>
            <li> This came with a non-functional, dead power supply. I contacted Philips/Norelco immediately for a replacement. They had none, and neither does anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero stars.</li>
            <li> I was a hairy dude, I just bought it and I am loving it clean and clyear body. It worth it</li>
            <li> Horrible body groomer! Useless, I don&#x27;t know if I got a bum shaver but this product is more like a face shaver.</li>
            <li> it is excellent product I like it</li>
            <li> This product never would recharge (no blinking green light as promised).  Appears from comments that some others have had the same issue.  Used twice with charge from factory and then tossed.  Too expensive for a disposable razor!  From the little use I got, it seemed like a good razor.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco BG2028 after using Wahl clippers for many years. By comparison, the Norelco does a very poor job of trimming close. Rather than cutting, it seems to grab the hair and yank it out, then trapping the hair in the screen. Very uncomfortable to use, totally ineffective for cutting, and difficult to clean. After one attempt, I&#x27;m tossing this product in the trash and going back to Wahl.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do well on what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Very average shaver. This is not strong at all and it performs less than a normal razor. And under the water? Basically is doesn&#x27;t work properly, hair are trapped and you have to clean every two seconds. If you want to have a try go with the Norelco professional model, it might be it works better.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the t edger I was using before. Makes a big difference on my neck and back.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product and Service. I will definitely recommend this trimmer to my friends. One of the best experience.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Doesnt give a close shave at all. It is very difficult to get all the hair. The hair grows back so quickly because it isnt a close shave.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I had an older one of these and it worked well until it died. The new one shipped to me was defective. The replacement that was shipped was also defective having the same problem as the returned unit. I spent 45 min on hold before talking to a Norelco customer service person to confirm the unit was defective. Norelco offered no help other then to confirm that the unit was defective. The charging system did not work on either unit. I suspect that Amazon has received an entire lot that is defective. So much for product quality. Would not recommend this or any other Norelco product.</li>
            <li> Major time saver, not quite as easy to get a smooth cut as a regular razor but I have experienced none of the common side affects of the regular razor like bumps or rash so I&#x27;ll take the slightly less close of a shave. Charging takes a little time but I usually just leave it on overnight when it needs it and a full charge lasts me about a week. Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Shaving was always such a chore for the hubby....now he can&#x27;t wait to grow out the stubble to use this! I even tried it on my legs once, left them smooth and without a nick or dryness. Also since my husband starting used this for shaving and trimming his mustache and beard, he doesn&#x27;t brake out any more in the facial hair area. It is quite the miraculous little device!</li>
            <li> This shaver pulls hair which is pretty painful. Totally disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase when I bought it. It kept pulling my hairs and not leaving a close shave. If this happens to you, experiment with different angles. It makes a world of difference. This is a great body razor. Gives you a close shave, doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, and doesn&#x27;t cut me even though I&#x27;m dealing with uneven body curves. I&#x27;ve used it a couple times. Still haven&#x27;t needed to recharge it. It also has a nice feel to it/not awkward to hold. The product was designed well</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer and it works great, I would recommend it for the advertised uses.</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of rechargeable shavers for this specific reason....right out the box the BG2028 handled like a pro shaves pretty close then the orange led starts to show. Okay time to charge. Nothing! I let it sit overnight. Nothing. I research online...a green LED is supposed to show indicating a charge is occurring nothing. So i figure its a faulty adapter plug or the lithium batts stopped holding a charge. In any event disappointed I&#x27;m out 40 bucks for a shaver that fails right out the box. It happens but still annoying! Will try to fix...ill start with replacement adapter cable if no luck...there are two torque screws at top under the foil...will see what&#x27;s inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will stick to my instincts and use wired shavers from now on!!!</li>
            <li> Although this Bodygroom is marketed toward a younger male audience, it is undoubtedly an excellent unisex product. The shaver nestled nicely in my hand and was very easy to control. There is a rubberized section on either side of the shaver that enabled me to get a firm grip. It has an ergonomic feel and it far from bulky, something that will give any user more control when they shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Bodygroom was almost intuitive. I quickly figured out when I needed to shave in a rolling manner, circular one, or use an up and down motion. Any area that I did shave came out much smoother than expected. Probably the only way you could get any closer would be to use a dipilatator, a method that is often quite painful. There was absolutely no pulling as the blades on the cutter head are very sharp and meshed closely together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESSORIES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Trimming comb (1/8 inch / 3mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Trimming comb (3/16 inch / 5mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Trimming comb (9/32 inch / 7mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Shaving head&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Adapter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Charging stand/cradle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Instructional booklet (includes visuals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you do put on any one of the three combs, make sure you hear that snap and turn on the shaver to ensure it won&#x27;t fall off. The combs are solid plastic, but do have the flexibility you&#x27;ll want for certain areas, especially around the groin. Try using the larger trimming comb the first time so you won&#x27;t be surprised if you end up with a shorter than expected trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the versatility of the Bodygroom and it definitely lives up to everything it says it does. If you need another shaving head you may wish to order a Philips Norelco shaving head, model BG2000. Check out the compatibility check listed on the page. All in all, wherever I used the Bodygroom I got a nice smooth shave without any irritation. Although I liked the Braun Cruzer, this one definitely outperformed it.</li>
            <li> High quality case and on/off switch.  Cutting foil has been improved over the first version and give a much smoother shave now.</li>
            <li> This item stopped working after 2 uses...it won&#x27;t charge anymore. If i could return this now after using it, i would definitely return it without hesitation.</li>
            <li> It does what it says it will do, and it works great. The only thing I have a problem with is the racks that it has to make the hair stand up to be cut.(I have sensitive skin).  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice for the pice.</li>
            <li> Gets caught in my fur too often.  For a &amp;#34;body groomer&amp;#34;, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d ensure makes a dent in my sasquatch-like chest hair...it just pulls it out.</li>
            <li> I bought this exact same razer several years ago at a Wal-Mart. That one accidently broke one day so I had to buy another one. This razer is amazing because I can use it in the shower and it shaves super close. It takes me about 5 minutes to shave both legs for a fairly good shave, 10-15 minutes for a great job. Its also amazing on my chest and back.  No rash, pulling it cutting.</li>
            <li> Best body groomer in the market... battery holds up for several hours</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product is mostly advertised to men, because it is for women too!  After years of bumpy legs and underarms, I recently developed a yeast infection in my underarms (yes, it was as gross as it sounds and itchy as H*LL)  After one doctor put me on sulfa I showed signs of a sulfa allergy, which was actually worse than the original problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another doctor diagnosed the sulfa allergy, and he told me that those little pink shavers we all love are the problem. They yank the hair out and irritate the area, and they spread bacteria around with every stroke.  He told me that never shaving again with those was the only way to get some relief on my sensitive skin.  As a hairy chick who shaves every 1-2 days, this seemed impossible.  He recommended a Norelco product and I went hunting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going to 3 different stores and seeing products priced from $30 to $200, most of them behind glass so I couldn&#x27;t even read the box, I ended up with the Norelco Body Groomer.  I wanted something that resembled the razors I was giving up to make the transition easier.  This product has turned into my BEST hair removal buddy because it is easy and GENTLE.  Technically it is for below the neck only, but I have used it on my chin and upper lip too.  I use it dry, before my shower.  My legs are so smooth and bump-free that a friend&#x27;s daughter even asked if I was wearing nylons the other day. And my underarms are smoother than they have ever been (plus switching to Dove Sensitive Skin antiperspirant.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it takes a little longer than regular shaving and you may have to go over an area more than once.  You&#x27;ll also find yourself experimenting with angles to hold it and shaving more often (every day for me in the summer wearing shorts and skirts as opposed to every other day) because it doesn&#x27;t shave as close.  But, it is very easy to use and you won&#x27;t see/feel stubble for about 24 hours, so before the shower is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the long run, it is probably a money saver too.  No more packages of razors, no more fancy shaving gel.  I wish I had found this product YEARS ago.  Seriously, I know that talking about hair removal for women is a sensitive topic, but ladies, THIS IS IT.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.n, it is probably a money saver too.  No more packages of razors, no more fancy shaving gel.  I wish I had found this product YEARS ago.  Seriously, I know that talking about hair removal for women is a sensitive topic, but ladies, THIS IS IT.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I bought this as the excellent Bodygroom BG2030 has been discontinued...and I wanted a trimmer for my second home.  My often-used two-year-old 2030 still works great, BTW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is--and I really tried to like it, folks--a piece of garbage in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Erratic trimming, the head falls off, uncomfortable cutting action...just bad all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also made the mistake of waiting more than 30 days to try to return it, so I&#x27;m stuck with this craptastic trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah well...I just hope Norelco pays attention to these things.  I wish I had bought a pair of 2030s in 2011.</li>
            <li> Battery efficient and it can either trim or shave pretty much anything without pinching or cutting your skin. It&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> shaves very nicely on wet or dry skin. does not tug hair, and it comes close to the skin. only have to charge once a month about if used under the neck. great product</li>
            <li> These things are awesome.  Full body dry shave, super easy.  I even use it on my face regularly with great success.</li>
            <li> I have used a facial razor in the past and had some nicks and bleeding as a result.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try one made for body hair.  This product does the trick with no cuts or nicks whatsoever, yet it does get close.</li>
            <li> Works basicly everywhere, if one direction feels too rough, take the blade cart. off and turn it the other way. that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of body hair, and I used to trim it using a regular electric hair trimmer, and shave my back with a regular electric shaver (same as I use on my face). I decided to try the Bodygroom and I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. I can easily reach my whole back with it, which makes the process much faster than with the regular shaver. For trimming my chest, I find it more comfortable than the regular trimmer because the combs have rounded tips. And for below the waist, it really is very safe and effective as the other reviewers wrote, the result is surprisingly smooth without any cuts or irritation at all. I prefer to use it dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that the Bodygroom is not recommended for facial hair. I tried it and it really doesn&#x27;t work well there. It appears to be made only for thin or sparse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philips also offers good customer service. One of the combs was missing from the package, so I contacted the company and they sent it to me at no cost. I also got a discount for a future purchase for registering the product online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sum, I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to trim or shave body hair, especially on the back or below the waist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for a couple of years, and I&#x27;ve found that it gets harder and harder to charge. Now it won&#x27;t charge at all. It&#x27;s gotten to be almost impossible to find a decent wet/dry shaver/trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works very good. Much better than previous Body groomer I owned</li>
            <li> I have used this on 2 occasions hoping that the first time it was bad due to well being my first time. But it did not get better the 2nd time around. Pulls and does not provide a clean trim. I would not buy this again nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ok, imagine a pair of regular buzzers, like you use to give haircuts. Now imagine the blades&#x27; teeth roughly 5X smaller. Now it has less chance of cutting you, but it will be more difficult to cut hair efficiently since less hair fits in the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These can cut right down to the skin very safely, but are very slow and inefficient at doing so. If you don&#x27;t need to cut down to the skin, I recommend larger teeth, like a more conventional buzzer.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying this is the first electrical razor I have ever owned... When I purchased it, I was looking for something that could do face, arms, and chest decently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first use, I had a decent amount of stubble (a week of no shaving) built up and the razor didn&#x27;t perform very well. I used a normal razor and shaved and once I felt the hair coming back, I tried the Norelco Bodygroom. I realized that it performed MUCH better (actually performed pretty dang well... no water or shave cream) on shorter hairs (two days of no shaving). If you wait too long, this razor isn&#x27;t gonna do much. But if you do it somewhat frequently, you&#x27;ll have no problem shaving your face and getting a pretty dang good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my body, however... I find this razor to not do much. It&#x27;s annoying to use on my body as I have to go over sections multiple times (no matter how little hair there is). I find it much easier to just use a normal razor and shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you have a rock-hard body this will work well, but reality is... most of us don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is nice and it feels good in your hand when using, I give it four stars all around for at least giving me a decent face shave without water or shave cream.</li>
            <li> Works great, looks sleek. It shaves a tad better than my previous model but it doesn&#x27;t come with the attachment that&#x27;s a little smaller and used tp trim beards.</li>
            <li> I use this for all my shaving needs. I mostly got it because there are places on my neck that I alway cut muself trying to shave with a razor. This gets those places perfectly &amp; to my surprise also works very well for my facial hair. It&#x27;s also very nice to be able to take this in the shower with me with no fear of damaging it. Works great dry or wet. Another plus is how long it holds a charge. I took it on a trip with me &amp; forgot the charger. I used it every day for 2 weeks &amp; when I got home it still had a usable charge. Although designed &amp; marketed for mem I have a hard time getting it away from my wife &amp; adult daughter who both love it as well. This could be important as they use this razor to shave places I wouldn&#x27;t with what they say are very good results. Well worth the selling price &amp; I would get a new one if this was lost.</li>
            <li> Wow.... I don&#x27;t know if these are fake reviews or what, but this thing NIPS like no other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Always been a fan of norelco products, I actually replaced my old bodygroom (BG2020) with this unit. The BG2020 had NO issues, never nipped me one time, but this model is HORRIBLE. I was yelping in pain!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I talked to a Norelco customer service rep and he said it should take three weeks until I notice the blade wont pull as much. This didn&#x27;t seem to be the case with the last model, so I&#x27;ll re-edit this in three weeks and let you know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m the only one noticing this? I&#x27;m not a hairy guy either...seems strange.</li>
            <li> This is not at all what i expected.  I use it purely for trimming purposes and you have to go over the same area multiple times for it to work, but if then you will still miss some hair.  All in all I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Phillips Norelco clipper and found this newer model frustrating. The newly designed non-adjustable combs are designed in such a way that the trimmed hair can&#x27;t fall away and gets trapped in the comb clogging up the blade almost immediately, so you have to clear them out with a brush after almost every pass to keep working. Incredibly tedious, made the job take five times longer than the older model. Also, the longest length setting is very close for my taste, does not allow for a less conspicuous trim. I&#x27;ll be sending it back.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst purchases I have ever made on Amazon. After reading all the great reviews, I though that this would be a very useful product. It wasn&#x27;t. I was expecting a smooth short trim, all it did was cut skin and catch hair. Pinches everywhere, blood was drawn and it doesn&#x27;t even cut well! Save your money and buy a cheaper hair trimmer, this is absolutely nothing different from a cheap trimmer besides an outrageous price for such a terrible product. Hopefully the other modules are better than this one. The only good thing is that it comes fully charged and with a excellent warranty. I wish I could give zero stars.</li>
            <li> This is cool and nice to use but I wish it was just a tiny bit more effective. Plus a possibility to get a little cut is there sadly if you catch what I&#x27;m saying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these Norelco bodygrooms, this is my 5th one.  This model is a great step up from the older models.  However, the foil actually broke while I was using it in the shower and it nicked me pretty good. Ouch.  Be careful and remember to replace the foil before the 1yr mark.  Overall, much better and safer than using a regular disposable razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Close shave&lt;br /&gt;No irritation at all; great for those sensitive areas ;)&lt;br /&gt;Holds a pretty good charge&lt;br /&gt;Foils last about a year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;slow to charge once dead&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t find the replacement foils in stores.  I usually end up replacing the whole unit because I can&#x27;t find the foils in stores and I&#x27;m too impatient to wait for the replacement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and I use this groomer to trim my bikini line because it works ten times better than any electric grooming razor I&#x27;ve found targeted towards women.  No pinching, no pulling, no clogging.  Easy to use, quick, never any ingrown hairs (which was always a problem for me, shaving my bikini with a regular razor), no bumps or redness or anything.  I&#x27;ll never use another product.  My last Phillips Norelco Bodygroom lasted me six years and finally died, so I happily bought this one.  It looks much better quality than the last one and I&#x27;m optimistic that it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Great body trimmer for in and out of the shower!</li>
            <li> I like it as much as I like any other BodyGroomer I&#x27;ve owned, essentially, but the attachable trimmers are useless. I would not buy this shaver if you like to trim your goods; go for the more expensive models.</li>
            <li> In 2 months, the battery runs out of charge after 1 minute of operation. This is a new product used sparingly and caringly. Even though trimmer while it lasted was good - the product is now useless and wasted money.</li>
            <li> easy to use , this is an easy way to get the beast under control.&lt;br /&gt;no need to look like a werewolf anymore!&lt;br /&gt;Use this manmower and be smooth!</li>
            <li> Great for use on the sensitive nether-regions.  You have to be brave though.  You definitely want to use some type of shaving cream or other type of friction lessening product.  Learned that the hard way.</li>
            <li> This little shaver sure is superior to anything I&#x27;ve used that wasn&#x27;t designed for body hair.  Some reviewers have complained that it is ineffective against thick, coarse hair.  Maybe, but the body hair I wanted removed is neither.  Probably a conventional electric razor would work on that type of hair.  If you want to remove hair from delicate places without painful nicks and cuts, this little devil will do the trick.</li>
            <li> This body groomer works fantastic, is so lightweight so it&#x27;s very easy to use while in the shower. Leave your shave so smoothly almost hairless like a normal blade I have only tiny hair that can&#x27;t bee seen only if you touch the area. Washing the blades are easy and fast so you don&#x27;t have to do any hard process to get it clean after shaving yourself. Battery last to groom all your body and you would do it fast. I would totally recommend this product to anyone, great quality and very affordable.</li>
            <li> This makes shaving more convenient in someways but I would recommend that a standard razor be used in conjunction with it to be the best shave. It had a little trouble with thick hair. but overall it was a good purchase.</li>
            <li> too wide for some reason and too expensive but works good. this is my 2nd one of these norelco razors.</li>
            <li> As a woman, you don&#x27;t need to spend an extra $20-40 to get a pink razor that&#x27;s &amp;#34;made for women&amp;#34;. I use this shaver for everything - including bikini - and it works like a charm! As long as you aren&#x27;t expecting a razor close shave (it&#x27;s an electric shaver, so if you want it that smooth it&#x27;ll take a little more time), this is great. It&#x27;s perfect for when I forgot to shave my legs and don&#x27;t care/have time to fully shave. I get bad ingrown hairs (especially down there) and when I&#x27;ve used this, I haven&#x27;t had that issue at all. It&#x27;s even gentle enough for underarms. Ladies, this shaver will be your new best friend!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Great price, travels well, small footprint, holds a charge for a very long time, and convenient. I started laser hair removal treatments but the process takes about a year, so I&#x27;ve been using this in between sessions. I hate shaving because I always manage to cut myself, or get itchy or otherwise irritated. I mostly use this on my bikini area and underarms, but have used it on my legs too here and there when I notice a few hairs starting to grow. I&#x27;m very impressed with the battery life too, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Very good Quality. Very satisfied. This was definitely worth the investment. Glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Very very good.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I have experienced more grabbing and pulling of hair then using then products used before.</li>
            <li> Great to do some manscaping, doesn&#x27;t do to good on the middle of your back, and this is all I know, please stop emailing me about weird questions about your personal areas and armpits, because I don&#x27;t know, or here is an idea try using Google to do some actual research, because I won&#x27;t respond any more.</li>
            <li> I love this, and I never worry about nicks, or cuts. It takes care of the most sensitive areas also.</li>
            <li> Older model that you can still buy razors for. When this one goes, I will certainly buy the newest model. A perfect 10 for everything!</li>
            <li> Does the job as a close up trimmer but don&#x27;t even try to use the length attachments, get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on every part of the body</li>
            <li> effective&lt;br /&gt;and practical.&lt;br /&gt;any man needs it to shave his private areas without having cuts. esp. in glueal fold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like it</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Norelco body groomer. Each groomer has benn improved every time I purchased one. This one is the best yet.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for safe body grooming.</li>
            <li> much much easier to use than philips electric razors designed for your face.&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t get as hot and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin as much.&lt;br /&gt;note that it&#x27;s still possible to cut yourself in...some places.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for shaving my privates in hope that it would be a more delicate approach to do it. works like a charm, I&#x27;d recommend it to anybody on the fence who doesn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> The trimmer on this shaver is very good but the shaver is marginal, but then I didn&#x27;t buy it for the shaver.</li>
            <li> So I am a man of discerning tastes when it comes to a body trimmer for my groin region. I have been on the search for the perfect trimmer/shaver that wont cut my skin. After looking around for quite a while on amazon I opted to purchase this product. When it arrived I immediately went to work on the growing jungle I had down below. I started in an easy spot, the area just above the penis. The little trimmers on either side of the shaver did basically nothing. They were completely inept at cutting thru any decent amount of hair. Undeterred I managed to chop out a region just at the base of the shaft and decided to try out the shaver. IMMEDIATELY cut myself with the shaver! I don&#x27;t even know how that&#x27;s possible! Its got a foil that is supposed to protect the skin! and more so than that, it was on the shaft! Imagine if I had gotten that bad boy near my balls! Game over! Promptly returned... nice try, no success.</li>
            <li> Great male body groomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;Trims hair to a length you can barely see it but not close as razor unless you go over same area several times.&lt;br /&gt;No worries razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;No need for shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;fast convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;Not suitable for female use unless you don&#x27;t mind stubble as it does not shave as close as a razor.</li>
            <li> Love this body shaver . Very easy to use in or out of the shower</li>
            <li> Not as good as past models but it does do the trick. Better to use wet in the shower. You do have to hold it at a more awkward angle for it to work its best.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t call it ultimate &amp;#34;Body&amp;#34; groomer, as it like to pull hairs with the flat part at the top while trying to trim up (below). Other than that, long battery life and the attachments are great for trimming side head hair.</li>
            <li> A good idea. Charger is great and it seems to have a lot of juice, just doesn&#x27;t seems like the blades are that strong.  Albeit my body hair is fairly thick, however I am no wolf man.  Might be worth purchasing the next model up, if you want to keep your man and/or yourself happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Fantastic upgrade to a great product. My previous one, the battery died. This one is also nimh, but hope it lasts. The unit itself is much better designed than the last... Highly recommended upgrade.</li>
            <li> I got this based of the other reviews,  all i can really say is it works ok but if i had to buy another I&#x27;d save the money for something else,  it does not give a very close shave, actually the only defence i can see after use is a slight irritation of the skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Easy to use and great body groomer. The boys like it too if you know what I mean and I think you do!</li>
            <li> Very nice razor for &amp;#34;sensitive areas&amp;#34;. I can quickly trim up and not get knicked. Very happy with this razor and the price was right.</li>
            <li> A big improvement over the previous BG2020 design, and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my old Norelco trimmer started having issues, I decided to try this new model, which turns out to work just as well, and has addressed most of my problems with the old model.  This new BG2028 is a little larger, longer, and feels more solid than 2020, with more flare to the handle to provide a better grip.  The hard, plastic-covered switch feels like it will last longer than the old rubber-covered switch on the 2020, which used to get stuck periodically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combs now lock tightly onto the trimmer, and also seem to have a smoother surface-- no more having them pop off during use from the friction against my skin.  The cutting foil also seems to fit more tightly into the head (that also used to pop off). Another plus is that recharge time seems shorter now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative, as with the old trimmer, the cutter that comes with the new trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the replacement blades-- cutting performance improves surprisingly much after the first blade replacement.  While this unit is still advertised as working dry or wet, the wet performance remains poor-- hair gets matted down with water, the wet hair bits stick to the cutter, and the combs don&#x27;t glide as well with the friction of damp skin.  I treat this unit as dry-use only that just happens to be fine to rinse under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An upgraded design for the best male body-trimmer on the market makes this Recommended.</li>
            <li> Not very good.  if you have thicker hair, this will be horrible for you.  First it doesnt cut very well.  I had to go over a small area several time for the trimmer to trim.  A good trimmer will do it with one swipe.  This one takes many swipes so of you have a large area you are doing, its gonna take a while.  the second bad thing, is the trimmer can catch hair and yank, so it will feel at time like some one is yanking the hair out.  Finally it leaves stubs, so you can go over an area about 100 time and you will see no effect, that is you wont be left with a smooth feel, bc it leaves stubs.  When your are done using the device you look like you shaved not today but three days ago and the hair is growing back.  So if your looking for the five oclock shadow, your going to love it.  If you are looking for smooth skin, this is not it.  I have more success with hair clippers and a razor.  Again i have thicker hair, so the result may be different for people with thin hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent tool for :&lt;br /&gt;1. those that like nicks and cuts&lt;br /&gt;2. those that like that leaving their skin with that sand paper feel.&lt;br /&gt;3. those like spending more time doing something that can be done three times faster with a different device.&lt;br /&gt;4. those who like to use razors after they find out it doesnt cut well.</li>
            <li> I hoped that this would be able to shave all the body hair, even if it had been weeks of growth. However, it only works well when the hair is short. The time it takes to shave overgrown hair is not appropriate for this product. This product is only for minimal grooming.</li>
            <li> This unit des a FAIR job at trimming body hair with very FEW nicks. The instructions state that it can be used in the shower but as of this date I have NOT used it for anything but dry shaving. Besides the fact that you&#x27;ll pay much  more for anything better,&lt;br /&gt;This is a replacement for another unit.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son to replace an older one. He loves it. That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom is an excellent choice and currently it is being sold at a GREAT price.  You can not go wrong with this one. For more grooming tips visit  mengroomingtips10.com</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far. I got no cuts so far and it gives a close body shave if you don&#x27;t use the different trimmer sizes. And yes you can use this on your balls, but gently!</li>
            <li> Makes quick work of manscaping my nether regions. Let&#x27;s me get really close without hurting anything down below.</li>
            <li> Not QUITE as close is a blade but very useful and great value</li>
            <li> When it run out of battery, you will have to toss it, because it does not charge at all!</li>
            <li> It is a great product which will work for people that have an abundance of bodily hair growth.  I have used it on occasion, but the cut was not as close as I would like it.  I tried it with the different comb attachments....and even without (scary at first).  I definitely got a closer cut without the combs and realized that the metal portion of the blades have rounded edges so that it will not scar you when using it.  I like the fact that it is rechargeable..so you can take it and stand in the shower while using it...so hair doesn&#x27;t get all over the place.  I did not try using it with water on my body or with gels...just dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this 4 stars only because it will work better for people that have an abundance of hair on their body..  It is a little tricky for people that do not have a lot of hair or a lot of long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it is a great product by PN...</li>
            <li> Designed to trim body hair below the neck, this product serves its purpose well. The included comb attachments are suitable for trimming without shaving. The device is also suited for use without the combs to get a relatively smooth shave (yes, I tested it, on a lower leg area, be forewarned, I can see the trimmer pinching if the skin is not taut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part this device seems to be a slightly modified facial hair trimmer (the blades might be a bit harsh for facial skin) and I did use it to trim sideburns effectively and safely. The charge time on the battery is atrocious at 8 hours (seems the only difference between this and the Plus version is the charging time and color of the plastic parts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, an effective device for the man that needs a hand held, chargeable body groomer. P-)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the job as advertized. Yes, it has a couple of adjusters for &amp;#34;length&amp;#34; of hair you are trying to trim, but doesn&#x27;t grab hair evenly if you are not super hairy, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, does a pretty poor job in the shower on wet hair, even though advertised as such</li>
            <li> Great product and worth the money</li>
            <li> I use this for underarms and private parts hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;Its very smooth on the skin and does not require any lather.</li>
            <li> This Item Excellent and Recommend to total use of the body ..I bought about 30 machine to my friends and everyone admire them</li>
            <li> Enjoy shaving with it.</li>
            <li> This is a good little trimmer/shaver. I can&#x27;t complain too much. For how cheap you can get it on Amazon, I think I can justify having it as a &amp;#34;convenience&amp;#34; trimmer (i.e. it gets a close enough shave for when I&#x27;m lazy or for keeping stubble at bay for day to day casual situations). However, it&#x27;s incapable of getting a nice, super smooth shave like you expect from a traditional razor and some nicer electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; abilities are great too! That helps it win some points back in my book. I just leave this in my shower and use it almost every day. It&#x27;s easier and more convenient to just remember to shave whenever I shower, and the device can handle the water. It seems truly waterproof and even more efficient with wet cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life seems better than advertised, and the design (including the charging station) is sleek, simple, and attractive. I&#x27;d recommend this as a complimentary shaver, but if you want that skin-tight shave, you&#x27;ll need something else.</li>
            <li> Great product, been using an older model for around ten years. just bought newer model, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Eh, it&#x27;s ok I guess? I still need to use my big clippers first.</li>
            <li> At first they shipped me a used device and the top part was broken with someone else&#x27;s hair still clinging onto it. GROSS! I reported it to Amazon and got an easy exchange. The replacement came in just a couple days which was awesome. Now on to the produce review. I&#x27;m not a very hairy guy. Although this product is not meant for the face, I often use it to trim my goatee and facial hair. This is not a razor so of course it will not have results like a razor. It&#x27;s meant for trimming. I also use it for the downstairs area which I am very pleased because I can comfortably use it without worrying about accidental cutting. The power is pretty strong and can last a pretty long time. I have used it everyday since I got it (2 weeks) and have not charged it ever since opening the box.</li>
            <li> Love this product so far. not a super smooth close shave.  but it is easy to use, and shave all kinds of hair on your body!  Got it when it was on sale, great price! You can even use it when its wet, perfect in the shower.  Easy to clean too!</li>
            <li> takes a while to groom oneself with this particular item.</li>
            <li> The combs that come with this are useless, but if you are looking to shave an area completely clean, this thing works great. I have had similar shavers in the past where you had to use a comb- without one you would mutilate yourself. This model works great without any attachments. Smooth close shave, no nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  I would like it better if the head weren&#x27;t tipped forward, which can make it awkward to maneuver (and/or see what you&#x27;re doing) when using the edge trimmer.</li>
            <li> I got this on a deal and I love it. Does exactly what it says.  I would definitely recommend to anybody considering to get a good body groomer.</li>
            <li> works great. didn&#x27;t mangle my balls. cuts nice and clean but not too clean. would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing body hair in the shower. Keeps a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> On my face it agitates my skin.. I use it now only occasionally on my side burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my body (I like to trim my leg hair once a month or so.. crotch.. chest.. armpit, etc.) it really just doesn&#x27;t get the job done. It takes multiple sessions across multiple days and showers to be free of the hair. The attachments are useless as it doesn&#x27;t get the darn hair off! I am thinking this might be because my hair is thin and easily pushed. It seems to cut hair well that is firm and refuses to be pushed away, thus it&#x27;s directed into the blades. I would prefer a small WAHL hair clipper that my dad used to edge my hair with when I was a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note: This does not nick my skin! I do appreciate this and is probably the only reason I still have it in my bathroom.. oh and the fact that I hate wasting money -.-</li>
            <li> I read through all the reviews and was kinda reluctant since some reviewers metioned snags and cuts in the privates. Which worried me. I was actually looking at purchasing the top of the line one (BG2040 i believe) but was not crazy about the pivoting head. I prefer for the head to be fixed and therefore i can control when it pivots. (im a little paranoid)  so i opted for this base model, (which was practically the same except for the shorter charge time and no pivoting head).  i was pleasantly suprised.  The guy who designed this razor should get a Nobel peace prize.  the little round points on the outside blades work great (no scratching or cutting like my old trimmer) and then the foil part catches the shortened hair and finishes it off.  I was only testing it on my leg and was so impressed i went downtown and finished everything else off. :)  after reading the negative reviews, I agree with some of the viewers it boils down to your technique.  its best to practice on your leg to get it right then be patient and go for it.  good luck... thanks amazon for offering great products/ reviews and excellent shipping!!</li>
            <li> I have used this prduct for body hair trmming , it is easy to use and charge&lt;br /&gt;It was safe and reach difficult corners for safe trim.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  I cannot give personal feedback, but I know the recipient was happy with it.</li>
            <li> This product shaves underarms and \\&quot;below the belt\\&quot; pretty well and doesn&#x27;t really nick although you still have to be careful while shaving in the sensitive spots.  I wish the battery lasted longer but I knew what the life of it was when I bought it so o well.  If you are looking for a longer lasting charge and a shaver that doesn&#x27;t take as long to charge as well, then you should get the next one above it.</li>
            <li> I hope you like getting hair pulled in sensitive areas. Because if you do, then consider this a five star product. However, if you&#x27;re anything like me and hate having your hair pulled in the nether regions, then this is an awful product that belongs in the garbage.</li>
            <li> One of the earlier entrants in the race to persuade men to clipper themselves everywhere was a product very much like this one. Now when issues such as hairiness is openly and widely discussed, the Bodygroomer is in, uhm, the thicket of the discourse. Lets dispense with the one thing I did not like and that was how to remove the grill to clean it. I finally solved the problem but it was annoying in extremis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased that it came with several guards so you can choose the length you like where you like it. And, yes, I&#x27;ve used it from top to bottom with some stops in the mid sections. One of the things I like most is that, guard-less, it&#x27;s a very effective razor; in a pinch I can shave my face as I&#x27;m driving to wherever I&#x27;m already late. It charges quickly-a problem with many items that are rechargeable. It fits well in my hand-someone had their mind on ergonomics which is very helpful. (Decades ago I was given my first Remington which was shaped much like a heavy wedge that, with wet fingers, fell from your hand frequently.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you need to manscape yourself? Probably not an imperative but it&#x27;s not a bad idea to look neat, well attended to and Phillips Norelco is the thing to help you do that.</li>
            <li> I got tired of trimming with scissors and tried electric razors but will little success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was nicking myself and that caused irritation in places that shouldn&#x27;t be irritated! When trimmer arrived I gave it a test and I was more than pleased with how fast I could trim. No more irritation and messy gels. Quick and easy. Works well on chest and other areas. Another nice feature is how easy it is to clean just by rinsing with hot water. Charge lasts a long time.  Charger stand is a plus and price on Amazon was less than any place.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price. My wife and I have used it and she likes it for legs, etc. Would definately reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Works really well. No complains</li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts like it should but I do not like the design at all.  I personally found this difficult to use on the &amp;#34;below the neck&amp;#34; areas which is why I purchased it.  Run time is good and it has plenty of power so it may work well for others.</li>
            <li> Love it.... No irritation on the privite parts of the body. Making it smooth as a babies butt. Been using this brand for years &amp; my daughter needed one. This is the newer model &amp; it works great for here.  The seller was great with shipment &amp; on time.</li>
            <li> Recommended to EveryOne</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy dude and I&#x27;m going on a beach vacation soon, therefor I needed something to trim up and clean up &amp;#34;manscape&amp;#34; for my fiance so she&#x27;s not so embarrassed. Either way it comes with 3 guards so you don&#x27;t have to trim too close. I used the shortest guard for my chest and no guard for my back. It&#x27;s awesome! The only complaint I have is using the guard the way the device is can get kind of tricky to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Good basic electric razor.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for one I bought over seven years ago, it lasted that long and was well worth it. Easy to use and new battery indicator lets you know when it&#x27;s low before it dies.</li>
            <li> Works great, but this was purchased to replace one that was only 5 years old and just died. Since there is no other product that we have found which works as well, we just purchased a replacement but wonder how long this one will last.</li>
            <li> Although i have used it only once but I am quite satisfied with the product. It does what it is supposed to it smoothly.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was made aware of this product.  I have shaved my legs all my life, and really didn&#x27;t like doing it...sometimes it scrapes, sometimes it bleeds, but with this little gadget, there&#x27;s none of that.  It does a great job, does not scrape, does not make me bleed, leaves the skin smooth and it doesn&#x27;t seem to need constant charging.  Very comfortable to hold in your hand and easy to charge.  I have taken it on trips and if it&#x27;s a few days, not necessary to take charger.  Depends on how often it&#x27;s used, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I have been body grooming for years now and this shaver is a great help. It offers a good reach and yeah it handles those sensitive areas very gently.</li>
            <li> this is my 3rd (at least) bodygroom.  This is a VAST improvement over early versions in speed, run time and build quality.  my only hope is that a) it lasts more than 30 months (about the time i have found they most often die) and/or norelco would make it possible to replace the battery</li>
            <li> Use when hat is dry and cool works awesome! Tap out every use!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great for body hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my face but I imagine that it would work fine for that as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s waterproof, but what is the point of a razor that doesn&#x27;t effectively trim hair? I don&#x27;t even have thick facial hair, and this doesn&#x27;t even work on that.</li>
            <li> Overpriced.  It works about as good as a $10 electric razor.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I would definitely recommend this for both male and female use.  It comes with several shave length attachments.  The charge lasts a long time, and I love the stand that holds it upright on the bathroom counter.  Good shaver.</li>
            <li> Razor part is absolutely unusable. Chews at the skin and doesn&#x27;t cut hair well. Trimmers work nicely, but the angle of the design and lack of a pivot make this a very awkward experience.</li>
            <li> is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever, is very comfortable, small and really does not hurt the skin as above, the recharge time is a bit long but worth is great</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it meets all the expectations I had for it and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great product. Very smooth cut. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Hod charge for long time. Very convenient. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love my philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom! It&#x27;s a life saver! no more nicks and cuts in the &amp;#34;under the Hood&amp;#34; department for me! I just took a trip to Cabo in Mexico and this little guy was my best freind there! I very highly recommend it to all the guys!</li>
            <li> A perfect improvement on previous models. The base is pretty great (and the biggest improvement upon the earlier models). Rather slim compared to most bodygroomers which is a huge plus. Definitely a must have for guys.</li>
            <li> Works well and is unbeatable for the price.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this thing for keeping his boys groomed.  The initial shaver came with a broken charging stand that we didn&#x27;t discover for months because he procrastinated trying the new trimmer.  However, he loved it after first try so we bought a second one and now he has two that have to share a charger.  Not giving it five stars because he still requires several other trimmers for regular use.  He has his main trimmer to keep his mountain man beard neat, mini foil shaver for a smooth &amp;#34;stem&amp;#34;, and now this one for smooth &amp;#34;berries&amp;#34;.  With as many implements required to keep our house lawn looking great, I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised he requires several different styles for his personal grooming, lol.  I do appreciate the results :)</li>
            <li> Quality product from Philips. easy to grip and use</li>
            <li> Works best on thinner hair, has a bit of difficulty doing thick stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Words of advice: I suggest taking it really slow over thick hair first, then go at a normal speed over the stubble until it&#x27;s gone. Obviously you&#x27;d need to shave thick hair more often to avoid having to do this time and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also a really rare piece of shaving equipment because it&#x27;s safe to use on pubic areas! No itch, no burn, etc. (mileage may vary, speaking from a personal experience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only real issues I have are the battery life leaving something to be desired, and it slows down a bit after going over a lot of stubble requiring a bit of an internal rinse every so often.</li>
            <li> have used it a few times since getting out of the hosp... they shaved me  for open heart surg.  probably the same kind of shaver.. have been cut only once...my fault, didn&#x27;t follow directions....no itch after..nice close shave..highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good for trimming the old bush. Ladies dig it. I use the #1 attachment.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. My wife uses it way more than I do. It has saved her underarms from all the razor sensitivity.</li>
            <li> does what it says so far</li>
            <li> For my back, sack, and crack. . Protip: Go slow. ER trips are expensive and embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I have tried and own several of the Bodygroom razors, this one (the BG2028), the BG2040, the BG2030 and one other one that I no longer have and forget the number.  This one does a decent job with no attachments and a using it for a trimmer.  As someone mentioned earlier, the attachments are practically worthless if you want to trim to a shorter length.  The razor works decent, but it &#x27;catches&#x27; every now and then on the skin&#x27;s surface.  It&#x27;s overall &#x27;okay&#x27;.  If you can find a 2030 model - it&#x27;s tremendous.  Attachments work as they should, razor is smooth over all skin surfaces, and the trimmer is the same as all of them.  Why Philips ever changed the 2030 is beyond me.  Last, the 2040, looks good in the pictures, but it&#x27;s a pain to charge and clunkier to use than the rest of them.  This is just my experience - good luck with your search.  (Philips - bring back the BG2030, you&#x27;ve been trying to copy it unsuccessfully.)</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Inexpensive and not very refined attachments. Irritates the skin when grooming.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really impressed me. It trims very close to the body almost as if you had shaved, but it&#x27;s faster. As a cyclist, I shave just about everything, and this has been a great tool to keeping my legs, chest, armpits, and face hair-free. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with irritation and a single charge will last me about two weeks&#x27; worth of shaves. It does have varying shave guards but I&#x27;ve never used them because I want it to shave as close as possible. The stand is nice and will keep it out of the way - it does not tip over easily like the last one I had. Cleaning it is easy, you just have to pop off the top part of the trimmer and can effectively clean out the small hairs which may get stuck in the inside. Bottom line: it is quick, effective, and cuts close.</li>
            <li> This razor works much better than combo razors to be used for facial stubble and body grooming, the others proved to be too weak, while this one cuts smooth doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin and has had no catching on the skin</li>
            <li> I returned this product after the first use.  My husband used it and it pulled the hairs directly out rather than shaving them down.  It was painful and ineffective.</li>
            <li> Is the best body hair shaver I have used!</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and he was fairly satisfied with it. It jams up every so often and we need to replace the blades pretty often as well, but it works well and he uses it in the shower without a problem.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, shaves fairly close a few pulls here and there.</li>
            <li> It shaves well and has never cut or irritated my skin. I can use it anywhere on my body without worrying about getting cut. It takes me a while to shave my entire body, so I usually have to charge it halfway through. Overall, I really like it and it works better than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Easy to use, works well.  You can go all crazy with it and not worry about cutting up your man parts.  It also works well as a shaver.  Doesn&#x27;t get down to the skin, but very close.  I&#x27;ve found the attachments to be useless, but the unit itself works well.</li>
            <li> I get a close shave every time I use this.</li>
            <li> This product is used for body trimming.  It works well and maintains a charge.  The various heads that come with it are useful.  I&#x27;ve used previous versions in the past and this lives up to that standard.</li>
            <li> Been clean shaving stem to stern with razors for over a decade ago since Gillete came out with the \\&quot;Protector\\&quot; with its&#x27; added small wires to reduce the nicks associated with razors.  I have tried all the Mach&#x27;s (3, 4 and 5) as well.  I can without hesitation state I will never buy another razor again.  If you body shave (especially chest or below the belt), you know about the near unbearable itch, burn and bumps associated with using a blade and the nicks you get with beard trimmers when encountering wrinkles and folds.  Those days are long gone with this groomer (and I would assume any \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot;). I will admit, you don&#x27;t achieve the absolute closest \\&quot;not even stubble left\\&quot; shave you can get with a razor, but what you are left with is a still VERY close \\&quot;stubble\\&quot; shave with NO pain.  More than a fair trade in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the greatest compliment I think I could give for this product is: \\&quot;I can use it every day.\\&quot;  Try saying that with any razor blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cordless.  But it&#x27;s weak. Couldn&#x27;t cut one man part in 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Grabs at the hairs and I felt like it really didn&#x27;t do the job I needed it to. My husband likes it to &amp;#34;man-scap&amp;#34;, but doesn&#x27;t work for me in that regard.</li>
            <li> I thought it would shave closer.</li>
            <li> it is a reasonable price and a piece good device does the job, I love it! If you are thinking getting one. go for it!</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Finally I got the hair all over my body shaved, it&#x27;s just what I want, my girl friend and boy friend all like it, lol!</li>
            <li> No more knicks, cuts, and razor bumps. Cuts body grooming time in half. Groom with confidence and peace of mind of no more dangerous cuts.</li>
            <li> I had an original model, got a lot of use out of it. It finally died (after, like, six years and lots of dropping it on the floor), and I had to buy a replacement. This one feels even more solid than the original. Just remember it&#x27;s a *body* groom -- it&#x27;s not a face/neck shaver! Plenty of idiots in the comment complain it gave them rashes on their necks -- that&#x27;s not what it&#x27;s for, and it says so right in the manual!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this shaver.  I owned an older model and this one is so much better that there is no comparison.  I have used it to shave in all places from the neck down including the most sensitive spots and have had no negative experiences whatsoever.  I would definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great price and a smooth product!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my boyfriend after he lost all of the combs on his old one. I can&#x27;t attest to how it runs or feels, having never used it myself, but as the girlfriend having to deal with the aftermath, I can say that I&#x27;m very pleased. It wasn&#x27;t obscenely expensive (yay!) and it doesn&#x27;t leaves him pleasantly groomed and not like an untamed lion or a newborn baby (also yay!).</li>
            <li> Works well in wet and dry conditions.  Does not cut or scrape the skin.  Easy to use and recharge (which is not needed too often).</li>
            <li> Husband doesn&#x27;t like. Shortest setting is still too long for his desired length. Does not use.</li>
            <li> Had one of the earlier Phillips Norelco Body Groom models for about 3 years prior to buying this one.  The one&#x27;s blades had just gotten dull and the battery life was just about gone.  It lasted 3 years with pretty frequent use and always worked well for me.  So far this one has worked just as well.  If I get another 3 years out of it, I will be happy.  3 Years of use for a $30 product is a good deal in my opinion</li>
            <li> Learning to use it properly takes a little practice, but after that initial getting used to it, it performs the best grooming I&#x27;ve ever got. I&#x27;m quite hairy, so through the years I collected shavers and trimmers of all kinds, so far, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One doesn&#x27;t need to push it against the skin, but gliding it slowly over it, while making a back and forth movement with one&#x27;s wrist that keeps the shaver in contact with the skin. And it&#x27;s safe to use on one&#x27;s most sensitive flesh too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the option of use it wet or dry, and that is small enough to take along while traveling. It also comes with a battery that lasts almost an hour, which is enough to get my body well-groomed before recharging it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a dud?  It&#x27;s a nice trimmer.  It comes in a nice box that makes a very nice presentation.  It&#x27;s very good looking and nice to hold, with lines that help your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with 3 attachments of varying lengths so it would be good for trimming and maintaining hair around the neck and sideburns, and should be good for removing body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice stand and holds it&#x27;s charge about an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get out of the plastic sealed clamshell pack - plan on using a utility knife or something sharp to cut it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is, for us at least, it doesn&#x27;t WORK.  2 men and 1 woman here and we&#x27;ve tried it and it just doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap for us.  We&#x27;ve each got naturally fine, blonde hair, and fine fair body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too big to trim ear hair.  Yeah, some certain hairy man has a problem with that.  So big long white hairs sticking out both sides of his head and I couldn&#x27;t get it to do anything to them but rip one out.  He said \\&quot;Well it does say below the neck.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we tried the back of his neck.  It didn&#x27;t do the nape of his neck either - it left more hair than it cut.  It was the same with the chest and legs - both guys let me have a swipe at them, and while it did trim the hair, it left more than it cut.  What it cut, it did not cut CLOSE at all.  (This was without an attachment.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my female self - when dry, it didn&#x27;t do anything.  I had a bit more luck with it when it was wet - it worked ok under my arms.  My legs however- it just left stubble.  It was NOTHING like a razor.  It was more like 2 days AFTER a razor.</li>
            <li> I guess I misunderstood the nature of this bodygrooming tool when I ordered it - and also think that it doesn&#x27;t quite do what it says it does - so I thought it might be helpful for someone like me to say what I thought it was and what it really is. I thought it was designed to give a close shave below the neck for either men or women. It turns out, it&#x27;s really just designed to trim back long body hair on men. Think of it as a lawnmower for body hair - it&#x27;s a bit more of a blunt instrument than I was expecting.  It&#x27;s not aimed at close shaving, but rather even trimming, and as it stands it would be most useful for a very hairy man who wants to tame things a bit rather than for the average man who wants to \\&quot;manscape.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with three sizes of comb, and you&#x27;re advised not to use it without a comb. Given that, I would have preferred if they&#x27;d built the comb in to the apparatus, and designed a mechanism for adjusting its length. This one doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case - so you&#x27;re stuck with loose comb parts to keep track of unless you supply your own carrying case to put them all in. Even the shortest comb doesn&#x27;t give a very close trim - and in my case, given that I&#x27;m not extremely hairy, left most of my chest and belly hair intact without trimming it much at all.  You&#x27;re warned never to use it on facial hair - though I did try it on my goatee and it works fine there.  I also tried it on a small patch of hair with the combs removed and, while it didn&#x27;t give a close shave, it did do a decent job there of trimming things back fairly close.  I imagine that for someone who wants to remove all of their body hair this would do a good job on a first pass, to be followed up with a straight razor. Still, there are other tools that would do a better job if that was the primary intention. As far as I can tell, this tool would only really be useful for the very hairy man who wants to \\&quot;mow the lawn\\&quot; every few days. Since I&#x27;m not that hairy - and since even on its closest setting this doesn&#x27;t trim much for me - I didn&#x27;t find it to be very useful.losest setting this doesn&#x27;t trim much for me - I didn&#x27;t find it to be very useful.</li>
            <li> As body hair trimmers go, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s easy to use and even with no guard on you&#x27;re not going to nick yourself as long as you exercise some common sense. Pull skin taught and you&#x27;ll be fine. I do wish it had additional guards of different lengths, but the ones that come with are all useful. And in case you&#x27;re wondering, the number for each guard is stamped on its back. It took me a while to realize that, so I was lining them up to compare size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver works wet or dry, and I found it to be fine either way. It slides right into the charging base, you don&#x27;t have to fuss to get it properly seated. Other than the addition of more guards, there&#x27;s not much room for improvement here. It&#x27;s a great all around below the neck shaver. If that&#x27;s what you need, give this one a try. It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> I suppose I misunderstand how electric razors are supposed to be used. I nor my boyfriend have a particularly large crop of body hair, so the combs were of no use to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the razor wet and dry, and different types of movement (short strokes, rolling, up and down, back and forth, shake it all about), nothing worked. It would get maybe 10% of the hairs at max after several pass throughs. I get better results with a single blade disposable. It often pulled at the hairs and ended up \\&quot;curling\\&quot; them (much like one curls a ribbon with scissors). I tried different areas of my body, different amounts of pressure, nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I got a dud? Maybe I&#x27;m just ill-versed in the ways of electric-based shaving? Whatever the case, this razor is now going into the recycling bin.</li>
            <li> We (yes, both my wife and I) are happy with the Philips Norelco Bodygroom.  The cordless technology comes in handy as you don&#x27;t have to unwrap the wire around you as we had to do with previous units.  The unit head itself was able to remove unwanted hair with minimal amount of nicks and scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it in stages, so I first used it with the supplied comb to cut the hair to a manageable length and then used the bare head on the skin to take off the last length of hair.  It worked wonderfully and I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Full discretion: I&#x27;m a woman who wanted a more durable shaver than the purple-lady on that I previously had that bit the dust. This does the trick for trimming back the downstairs. The adjustable combs work well. Seems like a solid piece of electronics, so I&#x27;m hoping it sticks around.</li>
            <li> Love this &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; groomer.  Do not use it as the regular shaver.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else has said, this thing has blunt edges so you don&#x27;t knick your balls, but sharp blades so it doesn&#x27;t pull. I just trimmed dry and NOTHING pulled or got knicked.</li>
            <li> I use it for armpits and crotch. Gets the job done fast and without any cuts.</li>
            <li> Comes out of the box partially charged, for immediate use.  Has a 45 day money back guarantee.  Has 3 attachments for different cutting lengths, can also be used with out the attachments.  Has a trimmer on each side of the head, as well as a regular type shaving head, for close shaves.  Do not use on your facial hair. Appears to do an excellent job of trimming close shaves.  Comes with built in rechargeable battery, which in not replaceable.  Also has recharging cradle, and cleaning brush included in package, along with instructions.</li>
            <li> Okay fellow males.  You want something that will sculpt your man area without shredded it to pieces and putting you out of commission for a week.  This thing is AMAZING, I told my girlfriend earlier that she just became my second favorite thing in the world because of this shaver.  It is sooo gentle and amazingly efficient compared to the products I&#x27;ve used in the past for manscaping.  You really should go slow, but I was going crazy on my shaft and balls with this thing and it didn&#x27;t cause any irritation at all.  When you do your chest/stomach hair it does pull a little, but not enough to cause any pain or anything, just make sure you are going over your hair in slow, deliberate motions and it will work perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a body trimmer/shaver as a male, you do not have to look any further or buy the $70 version of this thing, this one works perfectly.</li>
            <li> If you want a truly clean look, this trimmer requires you to use a very specific angle.  The manual specifies this, but if you plan on using this somewhere that is hard to reach, it will be very difficult to maintain the necessary holding angle to achieve the close cut.  I am pleased at the results I am able to achieve once I mastered the angle.  But if you are going to need to groom your back, I would probably look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Phillips Norelco Bodygroom is just what I needed for my Bathroom.  The groomer is light weight and shaves with a smooth touch.  I have been using it for my neck area and it gets the spots that my other electric shaver (Norelco Nivea) either can not reach or burns the hell out of my neck.  But this body groomer not only reaches those spots without any burns, it can also be used for other areas around the body.  If you are looking for a body groomer for either yourself or your significant other, then the Phillips Norelco Bodygroomer is a must buy.  It also comes with three attachments, a charger and a little brush to clean the groomer between shavings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very well and is very powerful. Battery life is great and it&#x27;s just an all around great product. Perfect for body hair, wouldn&#x27;t use it on my face though...</li>
            <li> Timely and efficient and exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> The power button activates with the slightest tap, causing the razor to repeatedly turn on by itself inside of my travel bag.  It is not a mechanical switch or slide.  I could not find a way to prevent this, and it is a show stopper if you plan to go through airport security.  The power cord only plugs into the stand, not the razor, so you cannot leave the stand behind.</li>
            <li> PROS: This Bodygroom has a great design, is easy and convenient to use wet OR dry, and changing trimming lengths is super easy. You can&#x27;t go too, too fast when shaving thicker body hair or the razor will get caught up, but overall it&#x27;s a surprisingly powerful trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: You can&#x27;t charge it without the stand, which is cumbersome/cluttered if you need to travel with it. The battery life is okay, but could be improved.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping one manscaped in all the right areas. Even without the blade protector it doesn&#x27;t cut or snag or anything!&lt;br /&gt;You can get a very close shave with this, without the danger of hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hit or miss sometime I like it sometime it Nicks me</li>
            <li> This Philips Bodygroom works very well, I have tried other similar products but the don&#x27;t work as good. Now I&#x27;m going to see how the durability goes.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Doesn&#x27;t yank or pull on hair as I trim.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers from the competition, but for my skin and hair, this one works the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
            <li> Leaves a blood bath behind...beware</li>
            <li> It is perfect shaver ! The only reason I give four stars is that it is almost not usable in shower , but on dry skin it trims well</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a trimmer, which works for under the neck and also, comes in a decent price range, look no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great company.</li>
            <li> Great modern design. Quite an upgrade from my previous Bodygroom, which ended up quitting after about 7 years. No more hairs that get caught and the motor seems to be a bit stronger. Great waterproof design.</li>
            <li> Excellent buying experience! The item was exactly as described, it arrived very quickly and was packaged very securely. The price was also the best on the internet, too. Great item, exactly what I wanted! Highly recommend both this item and the seller. Thanks very much!</li>
            <li> this is the first body groomer that i have purchased but not my first norelco product. the first thing that needs to be addressed is that the packaging is a little hard to open its in a clam shell that is sealed 360 degrees so you half to have sharp scissors to open it. second i was a little disappointed that they don&#x27;t give a carrying sleeve to contain everything in one so things are not just loose but for $20.00 it aint a biggie. the groomer its self i tested out when i got it and its a very smooth cutter i didn&#x27;t notice any snagging like other user mentioned. the shaver is great because it doesn&#x27;t leave any shaving burn and limited stubble if any. highly recommended shaver for man or women.</li>
            <li> I use to use, well... lol.  This works and it works good, quick and if you&#x27;ve ever shaven special areas you know it&#x27;s not always fun as it grows back but this one has great attachments that let you quickly keep things nice and neat, clean, without the pain ;)  I&#x27;m not a hairy guy and not a model or anything like that, but like to keep hair scaped and neat in all places especially around the shaft so it doesn&#x27;t irritate me at the most inconvenient times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend for guys</li>
            <li> Had one before which worked good except for the switch that broke and would not let one repair it. This one has a different switch. Time will tell if this is the products weak point.</li>
            <li> a great personal razor no nicks no cuts wont tear through a 2 week beard but does great as a weekly trimmer</li>
            <li> This makes my third version of Phillips Norelco Bodygroom and by far my favorite version. I bought the first version back in 06 and loved it. I used it for about 2-3 years until the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge. I bought another version with the actual clippers on one side and the same trimmer on the other but it swiveled and I hated it. I liked the addition of the clippers but I hated the way it swiveled. The swiveling head just didn&#x27;t trim that great in my opinion compared to the fixed head that was on eh previous one. With that being said I used that until about the same amount of time and the battery stopped holding a charge. Then I found this, it reminded me of the original and turns out it is almost the same and I love it. Not only was it a little cheaper then the other two I bought, it had the fixed trimmer like I like and the charger is simple and easy to use (not that the others were bad, just I hate my electric razors) Anyways, I highly recommend this and do not let my statements about the battery not holding a charge sway your judgement, I am not he best about keeping it charged so there are times where the battery would be dead for a week before I got to charging it again. I travel a lot so I do not get to maintain things like I want/should.</li>
            <li> If you purchased this relative inexpensive shaver for the right reasons, you should be happy with its performance. The right reason -a groomer that you can trust to shave more delicate, sensitive areas without nicks or cuts.  If you have heavier shaving in mind, then don&#x27;t buy this product.  Get a heavier shaver for less sensitive areas.  I have gotten good run times before the battery needs recharging and it has been very easy to keep the shaving head clean.  I am very pleased with this groomer, but it is a lightweight device designed for sensitive shaving areas.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to help remove my body hair. Found this in a Wal-Mart and have been highly impressed thus far. The design and feel is smooth and it removes hair without a problem plus the back attachment is VERY helpful for removing back hair. Simply perfect</li>
            <li> Great body shaver, I&#x27;ve used this on my groin, legs, back, neck, armpits, and &#x27;crack&#x27;. Recharge time is long, but shouldn&#x27;t be an issue if you leave it plugged in your bathroom all day. Shaves down a good amount, certain areas of the body need to be wet shaved to be completely smooth. Comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I owned an earlier model Bodygroom that somehow got stuck in the on position and wouldn&#x27;t shut off. Eventually, it ran out of battery power and died entirely. This model has a little longer neck between the handle and the head, which is good for those of us that want to get places like our backs but aren&#x27;t as flexible as a contortionist. This is a marked improvement, along with the on/off switch being more like a solid button, rather than a rubber coated sensor. This works as good as advertised, and if it holds up as long as my other one I&#x27;ll consider it a success. Plus for about 35 dollars, even if it does break early, it won&#x27;t break the bank to replace it. Thumbs up.</li>
            <li> At this price, you really can&#x27;t get much better. Don&#x27;t expect to shave your face with this, however! It is a rough cut with this guy. If you do have to shave your face with this, prepare for nicks and sore skin. It works in the shower which is great. I would like to see a cap that covers the grille so that you only use the trimmers on the top and bottom. Other than that, this thing is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> This philips Norelco groomer is the best thing since sliced bread. I use it daily and it is made of durable plastic</li>
            <li> Honesty makes this world a better place. So here it is.&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best big ball sac trimmer made.&lt;br /&gt;This is it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I had the previous model for 4 years and really liked it. I use it for my bikini and underarms. Great Product!</li>
            <li> The razor did a good job trimming corse chest hairs and was easy to use. It held a full charge for over a half hour. The razor is simple to charge and has some good accessories. There is a thin rubber piece running down the side of the razor that helps with support, but the razor does have a plastic body and felt slipper at times (I only used the razor dry, so do not know how it would feel using in the shower). Overall a good product for a good price.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly.  Used it for the first time on genitals.  Worked great.  It was so easy that I am not going to have a problem using it once or twice a week.  Would recommend this for any man that does Manscaping.</li>
            <li> It works well for maintenance, but hair has to be pretty short for it to work well which means some other means has to be used first.  I still got nicked the first time.  Once you get used to it I suppose its OK.</li>
            <li> This does a great job</li>
            <li> Worked fine for about 5 months, now it won&#x27;t hold a charge. What a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> My experiences thus far had been limited to the first and second generations of previous yrs (great design, works as intended) but they show their age in time... a bummer given the cost.  (The first one stopped working after 2 yrs when the on/off button stopped depressing, and the 2nd has been going strong after 1-yr but for some reason the blade/foil doesn&#x27;t stay attached at particular angles!  It&#x27;s truly annoying, and has persisted even with replacement blades/foil.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made the jump to this shiny new model and am very happy.  It looks really slick, is lighter than the previous model, and feels solid in the hand.  Works exactly as promised- but that should be a given with Norelco.  Feels like the natural evolution of what was already a pretty good design.  It&#x27;s only been 2-wks, but a definite recommend so far.</li>
            <li> Used with a body-shaving Gel, very smooth and cuts really close! Battery life is good enough for me, i love it!</li>
            <li> Its amazing!!! Bro my goods is smooth AF! This product is good, doesn&#x27;t hurt at all just smooth shaving. Really good. Dudes buy this, it saves u from using a real shaver and is a huge time saver. U can be quick with it and a good job. Must buy for any guy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ its cheap</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it in the shower, but other than that it&#x27;s a pretty solid trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a cordless below the neck shaver designed to keep unwanted body hair in check.  It&#x27;s the entry level trimmer in the Philips BG (Bodygroom) series.  I began shaving my head at a very early age in life so I&#x27;ve owned plenty of electric hair trimmers and clippers over the years.  I also have extremely sensitive skin so using any shaver, electric or manual, is generally an uncomfortable experience.  They&#x27;ve made a lot of shaving advancements over the years and the Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a pretty good example of that.  Here are my thoughts;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Water resistant and can be used in the shower as well as with foams and gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ 3 different length comb guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Foil and dual blades are hypoallergenic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Self sharpening blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Handy cleaning brush, charging stand and AC Adaptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Does a great job of trimming thick or longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Sturdy construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ 2 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Not always effective for very close shaving or when used on wet hair in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- No carrying or storage case for accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Long charge time, short battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is a pretty solid shaver.  It&#x27;s powerful and does a good job of removing thick topical hair.  Great for sculpting and keeping heavy growth areas under control, this is a handy trimmer to have around.  However, with my sensitive skin I did notice some irritation when using it, even with shaving gel.  But, minor redness aside, it&#x27;s one of the better non-facial trimmers I&#x27;ve used in a while.</li>
            <li> I have the Philips BodyGroom model BG2020 and it&#x27;s served me well over the years. There are slight improvements made to this one over the previous model:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Improved charging base. The base does not require you to push the unit into it in order to connect the charging contacts. Instead, it goes in with relative ease. Also, the plug on the charging base takes up only one outlet in the wall or one outlet on a power strip. The charging head on the old one hung down and is a bit bigger. The design is far more streamlined on this new one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The combs. This is a HUGE improvement over the last one. Unless you are careful taking off the combs on the old unit, the whole razor-portion of the unit ends up coming off with it, spreading bits of hair everywhere and possibly causing-if you were one of the unlucky ones-damage to the foil when it hit the counter/floor. These combs are way easier to take off, although it is a bit harder to tell the size differences without looking at the numbers imprinted on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Battery use. I seem to be gaining more shaving time per charge with this use. I can go 4 uses with this one, as opposed to the \\&quot;3 uses per charge\\&quot; I was getting with the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Shaving clog-up near the foil. About 1/3 the amount of hair gets clogged up inbetween the foil and the head of the unit then with the old Bodygroom. So that means less time spent using the brush to unclog it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for the bummer.  The shaving sucks on this one. I&#x27;m almost inclined to believe I received a unit with a faulty trimmer. If no other reviewers mention this, then I would imagine this to be the case, even though I&#x27;ve looked at it quite closely and can&#x27;t see any defects that would cause the following problem.  I feel the hair snagging a little when I shave. The length of hair I&#x27;m shaving between shaves is the same as the last one, so I know hair length isn&#x27;t the issue. It&#x27;s not painful, but enough of a tug to be irritating. With the old one, the shaving was nice and smooth. Also, with the old one, I could place the comb on either side of the foil and shave either way; with the new one, I can only shave with the combs inward (facing the body of the unit). If I do it with the combs outward, it snags the hair 3 x&#x27;s as much as the other direction. This means I have to lift my leg up in order to shave it, whereas on the old one, I could switch the direction of the comb and just shave it standing up. Not only this, but it takes twice as long to trim the same amount of hair as the old bodygroom. (I did each on different legs using the same numbered comb: comb 1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you have the old BodyGroom, you&#x27;ll be disappointed with this one (unless you buy the one with the backhandle, which might offset the con mentioned above) and will probably want to hang on to that one. I know I will.</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that most of the combs are way too long to be useful for me. Mostly I only use the shortest comb or just use the razor without any of the combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No razor burn, shaves really close without the combs. Holds a charge for a good while. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I bought this for my now ex  boyfriends birthday and I was hopping to try it out myself eventually, you know just for good measure. Unfortunately, I won&#x27;t get that opportunity. However, when my ex finally used it on his, not so luxurious mane down stairs, if ya know what I mean, he looked and felt as smooth as a babies bottom. It made his bottom half look like a models. Zing. I shall miss that penis.</li>
            <li> Works...ok. Good for trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Really takes awhile to take hair off.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality, but probably would&#x27;nt buy again for my purpose (legs)</li>
            <li> My second body groomer from Norelco. Found BG2020 works better than this one, but still does the job. I recommend Philips Norelco on this line of products with no hesitation.</li>
            <li> great product, great price and arrived faster then expected.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed by how well this worked. A few more options on the blade guard lengths (the longest is not very long) and a faster charge time would be nice, but you can get that by upgrading to the Pro or Plus model.</li>
            <li> Very very very very good. I recomendos all with the assurance of acquiring an excellent product. Very useful and women will love.</li>
            <li> this stop working the second time i used, just stop charging the batery, it only charged one time and no more!</li>
            <li> The guys, listen up: assuming you are 18 or over, please continue reading; if not, please stop reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a secret: shaving down there matters. The matter what your woman is telling you, I am telling you, she prefers that you are shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re single, your single life will be better. If you are monogamous, your monogamy will go better. It&#x27;s that simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of you like when woman shaved down there, don&#x27;t you? Why do you think it&#x27;s different for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin down there. I have no idea what these other people who left negative reviews are talking about. This thing buzzes away all hair with absolutely no negative effects upon the skin whatsoever. It&#x27;s like magic. It is beyond my comprehension to understand what was going on with these other people. I would recommend you disregard what they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you waiting for? Buy it right now. It is the best thing possible for personal hygiene. It is one of the best buys on Amazon. Low price, maximum effectiveness, giving life-changing results, what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> This product is not easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;groomer are not effective at all and very difficult to clean the grooming blades</li>
            <li> Very good on sensitive areas without cutting or irratating.  Attachments don&#x27;t really work too well.</li>
            <li> Enjoy that thing☺ make my body shaving much quicker and easier</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t clip or cut you. It slides smoothly along the skin. The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do well is to be used as a shaver.</li>
            <li> This groomer does what it needs to do. It&#x27;s used to trim anything below the neckline. On my first use, it hurt pretty bad due to long hair on my chest and stomach. However, after the initial shave it got much easier to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs well in the shower, is easy to clean, and keeps a great charge, only needing to charge it after 5-6 shaves spaced days apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to go through the hell of using an old fashioned razor in sensitive areas. I just can&#x27;t give it 5 stars due to the mild discomfort when shaving. (Could just be my skin type is very sensitive to this kind of product)</li>
            <li> Good for men with medium body hair. Very easy to clean and hardy. The blades are very sharp and does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> good razor, and affordable, exactly what i was looking for.  I only use it about once a month so i cant comment on the wear and tear.</li>
            <li> Eh, I thought it would work better than it does.. especially with some of the reviews.. I purchased specifically for shaving my private area. It works, but it doesn&#x27;t work great, and im not a very hairy guy, but it still takes quite a long time to trim the area, actually a lot longer than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;The pros - So far I have not &amp;#34;knicked&amp;#34; anything, as I have with other shavers/trimmers, it does seem to function well in sensitive areas... it just needs to cut better in my opinion. I will continue to use this, as I haven&#x27;t had any painful moments yets... I would rather spend an extra 5 minutes shaving then get a cut... guys, you know what im talking about.</li>
            <li> This is the third trimmer I have bought because everyone in my family wants one. I purchased 2 trimmers in the past at Target and paid almost $50. each. I was very happy to find this on Amazon for half of what I have paid elsewhere. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> This little guy keeps going and going. Works perfectly and really cut down on the amount of money I spend at a salon every month. As usual Philips made a great product!</li>
            <li> If you have hair and want it gone....  this is great. I was using the old barber style plugin razors... why the  he^&amp; did I not buy this all these years.</li>
            <li> When I was reviewing this product I was looking for something to help a 48 year old man (me) with &amp;#34;Manscaping&amp;#34;.  80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s that wasn&#x27;t really the deal, and as such we know nothing about it at my age.....lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it...if you&#x27;re a man, and you&#x27;re reading this...that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re reading this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I tend to date women significantly younger it realized I need to figure it out, so here went the search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say Gentlemen this product has changed my WORLD.  I&#x27;m not gonna turn this into &amp;#34;Penthouse Letters&amp;#34;, but let me just say this, as tactfully as I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it, use it and see what happens.  Research online the best WAYS....I just soap up in the shower and use it there.....very simple....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be glad you did.  I mean like....&amp;#34;outta nowhere driving down the road&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;reaching over to ENGAGE while we&#x27;re watching a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this product, take your time the 1st few times till you get the hang of it......and HANG ON.</li>
            <li> The shaver works great without the attachments. When you add the attachments, they push down the hair and only some of it gets cut. You have to go back and forth multiple times to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this body groom unit based on the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;This thing nips and cuts SKIN off! I am very careful and gentle when shaving sensitive areas, with this body groom though, I got nipped twice and cut once within one shave! You should not have anything break skin to the point that you bleed! I am very disappointed, this is my 3rd Norelco item aside from 2 shavers. I will not buy Phillips again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: And of course, I have to nicely package the unit and send it back via UPS just to get my refund?! Can&#x27;t even get customer service help!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed, stay away!</li>
            <li> Rechargeable, and high quality and it&#x27;s even waterproof! Really like the storage holder and all the accessories that are included with this.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the charging instructions for this shaver and it was dead after less than 15 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little timid when it comes to shaving the nether-regions and this shaver has been just fine for me.</li>
            <li> good Product overall, however this model cuts a little too close so i have got ingrown hairs when i use the foil part.</li>
            <li> Once charging the Philips Norelco Bodygroom for 8 hours, it was ready to be used.&lt;br /&gt;1st my husband used to \\&quot;manscape\\&quot;, it took a little getting used to. He is not overly hairy and his hair is not overly coarse.&lt;br /&gt;It wasnt working at 1st, held it in another direction and slowly started seeing the hair being removed. It looked great after he was done.&lt;br /&gt;I then decided to try it on my legs just to see if that is an easier/faster solution (I use [[ASIN:B0077PLO06 Braun Silk-Epil 3170 Epilator]]  it is fairly uncomfortable to use at times and takes longer than I would like sometimes ) it left my legs very smooth and was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The following day, we both had little bumps where we used it... I was not happy with the results at that time, I was going to write a review right away and give it a 2 star because who wants to be smooth for a night then next day have bumps all over!?!&lt;br /&gt;Well, We waited and tried again, the 2nd time there was no bumps and no issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a great addition for any man for bodygrooming, and women will find this handy as well!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work to shave the frank or the beans, but for trimming it works excellently, and on flat surfaces you can also shave with it pretty effectively.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this from a woman&#x27;s point of view. Having very sensitive skin I have had to stop shaving my legs altogether. I was down to using[[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]]that is meant to take peach fuzz off of your face which I must say it does quite nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this I wondered because it was for gentle and sensitive areas I would also be able to use it. I have used it wet and dry. For me wet worked the best,it comes with 3 combs to trim hair in areas other than the legs to the desired length. They are 1/8 inch, 3/16th inch, 9/32 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without getting to personal it is not completely pain free in the MOST sensitive areas. It reminded me of epilalators we used way back when. The good news I didn&#x27;t get any redness or welts that a regular razor would do. You could go swimming right away lets us say it that way. I think the manual suggests dry but gentle soap and water in the shower worked best for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are a woman with skin so sensitive you break out into one HUGE red leg then perhaps you should try it. So far I am happy with it. One star removed due to it is not pain free. Nor does it make you cry in pain, just little oooh ouch.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I enjoy how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Three adjustable heads that are easy to attach and detach&lt;br /&gt;Two cutting blades (one on each side) for longer hair&lt;br /&gt;metal mesh with blades for shorter hair&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;waterproof&lt;br /&gt;easy to charge&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None so far. Works great</li>
            <li> I was just starting to get the hang of using this but after just a couple of months....it simply died. It would no longer charge,or turn on ...dead.&lt;br /&gt;For me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and works much better than a prior model I had.</li>
            <li> I dont know. I have mixed feelings. Hairs pull and get stuck with this. But it is better than some others I have used in the past. I dont know if the performance is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I shave everything but the top of my head for cycling.  It&#x27;s healthy and comfortable when it&#x27;s done, but quite the chore when left undone for too long--but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the things you really shouldn&#x27;t with this shaver by first by seeing if it could mow down several days of facial hair growth.  It does the job just fine, but for the sake of comfort I recommend sticking to a traditional razor in that situation.  I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend this be used to trim the hair on your head as it&#x27;s simply not cut out for that--get a regular hair trimmer for that instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But below the neck, on everything from your chest and arms down to your toes it&#x27;s ideal.  You will feel more &#x27;pull&#x27; than you would with a regular razor or electric shaver, but it&#x27;s not uncomfortable and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try using it on your privates except with one of the trimmer attachments though.  It&#x27;s just not safe to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more mess as this shaver cuts the hairs into tiny bits rather than longer, drain clogging hairs as a traditional razor does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that it has trimmers on both sides of the foil.  The combination is very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: This worked far better and easier than a traditional razor on all but my privates.  It really didn&#x27;t work very well as a trimmer for the thick hair on my head, but below the neck it easily outperformed a traditional razor with a disposable blade--specifically the Gillette Sensor Excel.  And compared to attempting to use a regular electric razor made for your face (even the pricey ones by Norelco and Panasonic which I have), the Bodygroom easily wins.</li>
            <li> This is the ideal solution for your manscaping needs.  All that hair below the neckline is buzzed away pretty easily.  It has a nice charging stand, and it fits comfortably in the hand.  The head  does not irritate the skin.  It comes with three hair length attachments.  I&#x27;m not really sure why you would want to merely shorten your back hair, but to each his own.  Maybe you want the Summer Wookee look?  It is waterproof, which is a great feature!  definitely worth purchasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an update, make sure you go slowly!  It works much better the slower you go.</li>
            <li> Years ago I purchased a Philips Norelco BG2020 Bodygroom and was rather disappointed in the performance and quality of the device.  I was pleasantly surprised, however, by the PHILIPS NORELCO BG2028/42 BODYGROOM as it appears to be a significant upgrade in quality from the older model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have kept my body shaved ever since competing in bodybuilding shows years ago, mainly to avoid the weeks of prickly/itchy discomfort that accompanies the hair growing back.  Normally, I prefer a razor because it provides a closer shave, but like the option of a wet/dry groomer for travel purposes or when time is an issue.  My experience with the older 2020 model was disappointing in that I never felt the foil blade was effective in shaving anything more than a day or two of hair growth.  Additionally, the foil blade apparatus was easily clogged and required continuous rinsing to function at a barely adequate level.  Eventually, the constant snapping/unsnapping of the foil for cleaning purposes weakened the housing to a point in which the foil would pop off at the slightest pressure when being used.  The BG2028 seems to have improved this aspect of the shaver as I have yet to experience any issues with the foil clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BODYGROOM is a shaver/trimmer with a shaving head that has a foil in the middle with clippers on the long sides (front and back of the shaver head), meaning it can cut longer hair to a length suitable for the foil to provide a closer shave.  Having the clippers on both sides allows for back and forth shaving rather than \\&quot;raking\\&quot; the shaver in one direction.  This clipper-foil combination make hard to reach areas more manageable to shave.  I found the BG2028 to be as effective as one could expect for such a device.  While the BODYGROOM is adequate in providing a convenient, quick shave, I have never discovered a foil shaver that provides a close enough shave to replace the razor ... the BG2028 is no exception.  The only downside I noticed was when being used for shaving, the BODYGROOM does pull hair at times ... mainly from the clippers.  While the pinching/stinging of hair-pulling was manageable, a slower glide over the skin was effective in reducing the pinch of pulled-hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While my main use may be for body shaving, the BODYGROOM&#x27;s most effective role may be that of a hair trimmer.  Three trimmer clip attachments of varying heights should satisfy most grooming preferences.  The clips are curved plastic combs that snap on the head and, in this case, can only be used in one direction (the comb part of the attachments face in one direction).  The comb teeth have rounded tips to prevent the user from being inadvertently poked or stabbed.  The trimming function is gentle and I noticed no hair-pulling, meaning that more sensitive regions can be trimmed without fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer head does snap off easily to allow access for cleaning and Philips Norelco seems to have provided a better, more secure housing to lessen the likelihood of the razor head/foil from popping off unexpectedly.  The nicest feature though, is that it can be used both in and outside the shower ... versatility is a big plus.  The charging station is more appealing and practical as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I felt the BG2028 is a sturdy and effective body shaver/trimmer ... a vast improvement in quality over the 2020.when being used for shaving, the BODYGROOM does pull hair at times ... mainly from the clippers.

            <li> I&#x27;ve had other reasonably priced razors, they worked okay, but I still had to shave with a real razor.  this is the same. It gets me 85% there, but not quite all the way.  The edging tool doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I&#x27;m disapointed with that especially.  I still use it, but always finish with a blade razor.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the re-charge feature, and combs.  Hard to review this without being too graphic, but it DOES do what you expect.  The charge ( for me ) lasts about 2 weeks, and can easily be used in the shower. Philips has made a number of shavers over the years, and this is one of the best ( and least expensive ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFECT for that back of the neck thing you get between haircuts, too  -- that ALONE makes this a great value. Easier to have someone help you with that, but you CAN do it correcly with mirrors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from having my hair cut every 3 weeks to every 4 - This unit can pay for itself quickly, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High quality build, with good instructions, presented in a nice way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth consideration.</li>
            <li> This is is &amp;#34;first&amp;#34; Body Groomer, so I am a &amp;#34;novice&amp;#34; with this type of thing.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Key point though is break the oil barrier on your skin by showering with a good soap, then this Body Groomer works fantastic.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sound is like a turbo motor which I have gotten use do and having some thick shaving lather is awesome to compliment indeed.  :)</li>
            <li> It has exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s waterproof and does a great job everywhere you need it to. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works really well. You don&#x27;t have to hold your breath when manscaping, it feels safe to use in all the nooks and crannies.</li>
            <li> Works well for fine hair, but chokes and pulls on thicker or denser hair. Gave me a skin rash and ingrowns. The guards tend to fall off as well.</li>
            <li> had the first gen model which tended to nick and cut in the most sensitive places.  I can practically shave with my eyes closed with this model.</li>
            <li> Unit came quickly and I charged it up and I&#x27;m pleased with how close it trims and I have yet used it enough to run the battery down enough to recharge it for he second time.  They recommend that you run the battery completely flat before recharging it to improve the battery life.</li>
            <li> Well, it works as expected. The guards are sometimes hard to get off. But it shaves my nether regions as expected.</li>
            <li> i love this shaver. I lost the little comb things but i never used them anyway. I use the ends to shave my face and it works great with no irritation. I like that it works really well in the shower too. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Fortunately Amazon has great customer service and I was able to return this product.  I attempted to return it Philips but they would not honor their guarantee even though It was a Christmas gift and was just 6 days past the guarantee date.  The following is the chat conversation I had with Philips about this ineffective product in full:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Welcome to Philips Chat, you&#x27;re chatting with Andy.

Please tell me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: I am trying to return a purchase that was a Christmas gift. The gift was not used until recently because it was a gift so it is now slightly past the 45 day guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Please stay connected I am on your issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: It takes 21days to get adjusted with trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Please see if you are comfortble with trimmer after 21 days of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: If I am unhappy at the end of 21 days what steps should I take then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Is your trimmer with 3 combs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: I suggest you can try those 3 combs as per your convenience and that can give you satisfactory results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: Actually Suzan, while we were speaking I checked to see if Amazon would refund the money for your defective product, and they will. I am very surprised that you would not honor the guarantee on your product. I also thought it comical that Andy&#x27;s suggestion was that I buy another product from you. I will be sure to send my concerns in complaint form (I will include a transcript of this conversation). I am also going to write and in depth review of your product on Amazon.com and include the transcript to show the level of customer service potential customers would receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: I totally understand your concern Zachary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: I apologize for your recent experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: I don&#x27;t mean to rush you, just checking to see if we are still connected. Are you with me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: Yes. Where can I send a complaint E-mail?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Zachary you can write us at:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Philips Consumer Lifestyle&lt;br /&gt;PO Box 10313&lt;br /&gt;Stamford, CT 06904&lt;br /&gt;ATTN: Consumer Care&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;zachary: thank you have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Thank you Zachary. Have a nice day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suzan: Thank you for contacting Philips Consumer Lifestyle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe I have owned 3 products from Philips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hair trimmer, a dvd player and a pair of headphones.  I have had issues with all three.  I should have learned my lesson after 2, but 3 strikes......</li>
            <li> Great product! Loved the reviews so I bought one. Thanks!</li>
            <li> After using an electric beard trimmer to shave my chest and lower regions for awhile, I have found this device to be far superior and safer.  It doesn&#x27;t pinch your skin at all in the sensitive areas like a beard trimmer and doesn&#x27;t leave a razor burn if going against the grain like a facial electric razor.  I really like the dual course hair cutters as they come in handy in hard to reach areas.  They also have rounded tips between the cutting blades so they won&#x27;t scratch the skin.  The middle fine hair razor doesn&#x27;t grab and pull your hair at all and feels very safe on areas below the waist.  I also really like the low battery indicator and it gives plenty of warning before the razor will completely die.  You can get about 3 uses of ~20min before the low battery light starts blinking and maybe 1 or 2 more uses after that before it dies.  A full charge took about 8hrs before the charging light turned off.</li>
            <li> It was like I was in a horror movie. Blood was flowing in the shower. I was kind of freaking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time out of the box and the device cuts me. In a place where you really don&#x27;t want to get cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hungry for blood. Human blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to my trusty Gillette Fusion razor. At least with that I feel like I&#x27;m in full control.</li>
            <li> An excellent quality product, does as advertised grooms the body, a close clean shave!!!FIVE STARS! Priced right! Norelco got it right!</li>
            <li> Oh yes. I dont even know where to start. This product helped me reach places that i Never had the you know what to go. This is by far the best product that i have purchased so far from Amazon. Thanks Guys</li>
            <li> It does what I want it to do. It doesn&#x27;t get it as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but I does what it suppose to do. I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
            <li> Very excellent especially in sensitive areas .....I recommend it</li>
            <li> works as well as previous model owned, but the blade fits poorly and falls out easily.  Annoying but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Does a great job grooming all areas..</li>
            <li> Good combination of usability and attachements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a hairy guy, but I dont want to become one either.  I picked up this unit to help keep it under control.  The most notable difference between this type of shaver and a Wahl designed for the head is that the clipper guide isnt pointy.. so a close shave across sensitive areas isn&#x27;t going to feel like torture or scratchinig you while it cuts hair.  I really prefer this for the back of my neck rather than the feel of a traditional Wahl.  The attachements work well for common lengths and the ability to use it wet or dry is convenient for cleaning, but, of course, less usable when cutting any length of hair beyond flush since wet hair doesn&#x27;t work with the guides  (not the razors fault).  I&#x27;ll use it in the shower and then turn on the shower to wash clippings down the drain -- keeps the bathroom clean.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty good shaver. I let my spouse use it and he was very impressed with it as well. It has an easy set up and its rechargeable and cordless which is a plus because it&#x27;s portable and you can even use it in the shower as instructed. It gives a nice clean shave but you have to break the clippers in real good because it can be very painful upon the first couple of uses. All in all it does the job and we was satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I will try to be delicate with this review, so as not to offend anyone. How best to put this..?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it&#x27;s efficient (the cradle is awesome. It&#x27;s always charged, and always out of the way) and because it doesn&#x27;t hurt me when I use it in delicate places. A daily buzz with this thing ensures that I get lots of attention from my wife. It trims and shaves without being abrasive. It can handle beards, but it&#x27;s really not meant for that. It works best on less-course hair, or at least hair that isn&#x27;t as concentrated. Yes, you hairy bears could use it to shave your back if you wanted to, but it would take a while. This is best used in areas like chest, and -ahem- &amp;#34;bikini area&amp;#34; that have less dense hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful with the trimming edges on certain parts of your body. They can give you a good pinch if you&#x27;re not careful. But that&#x27;s far better than constantly exposing your delicate nether-regions to a razor blade, isn&#x27;t it guys?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know... You&#x27;re thinking I&#x27;m some metrosexual nancy-boy. Go ahead. My girl likes my smooth skin in her favorite places, and I like the special treatment I get because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as Doctor Evil said, you really must try it: It&#x27;s breathtaking.</li>
            <li> Okay, yes, my review title might sound stupid. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s true.  This groomer isn&#x27;t strong enough to do regular shaving like you would for a face or legs.  It&#x27;s supposed to be used, I guess, on longer hair more typically found on men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared this with my girlfriend and only she found it moderately functional.  When I used it it pulled my hair.  She&#x27;s used it a couple of times to touch up her legs a bit between shaves.  For that this seems like an acceptable product.  But for me - the intended consumer of this product - I can&#x27;t see myself using it. I have trimmers that do the job.  This one doesn&#x27;t, unfortunately.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> Works great to trim hair all over my body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to use euphimisms to avoid offense. The intimate areas, specifically a man&#x27;s orbs can easily be nicked with a razor or other hair removal items. However, using this body groomer has been amazing. I do recommend Norelco&#x27;s body groomer nonfoaming gel and having the area slightly wet makes it easier.</li>
            <li> It is still a bit rough on the privates and clogs (I wish they would have fixed this after the previous model), but it does well for the price. This model holds a charge WAY longer than the previous one. Look forward to multiple sessions before a recharge.</li>
            <li> it works good. i didnt experienced any problems after 1 year. its battery is also good. charge last for months/4-5 usages..&lt;br /&gt;let me explain like this: i charged this device 4 times for last 1 year.</li>
            <li> As a Greek-American man, I know a thing or two about superfluous body hair. It&#x27;s not good. Thanks to Philips Norelco&#x27;s new Bodygroom Shaver my life has become much easier and I look 100% better. I use this device to shave all my chest hair, but what I like best about this product is that I am able to adjust it, using the enclosed combs, so a little or a lot of hair remains. I opted for little. After the initial charge the shaver stays charged for long periods of time with no faltering or need to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bodygroom is water-resistant so I can take it into the shower with me and not have to worry about making a mess in my bathroom. The extra hair just washes down the sink. This shaver came just in the nick of time, I might add, because summer in the Pacific Northwest involves lots of swimming in lakes and pool parties. Now I don&#x27;t have to worry about looking like Sasquatch. I can focus on trying to lose my beer belly...my smooth, hairless beer belly. Great product.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco BG2028/42 Bodygroom is designed to help maintain clean looking body hair, specifically below the neck.  Besides the razor itself, you receive 3 combs for 3 different lengths, a charging stand,  and a cleaning brush.  The device is water resistant, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it too wet and was designed with hypoallergenic foil and rounded blades and combs to prevent skin irritation.  The Bodygroom is designed to be used wet or dry.  The device is cordless and has a two year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used this shaver on my father, a man who never really bought into &#x27;manscaping&#x27; before.  Here are a few of our observations on this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The charger needs at least 8 hours to get the shaver to full power.  The instructions said the light would change when the device was ready for use.  We had in plugged in for the full time and never saw the light change.  Our adventure into manscaping lasted about an hour and the device still seemed to have a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There&#x27;s definitely a bit of a learning curve when using this for the first time.  You have to hold it and angle it the right way to get the best results.  Early on, we thought it didn&#x27;t work because it wasn&#x27;t taking hair off.  We figure out later, however, that we were holding it properly.  After that, it took hair off pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-White hairs were still a little tough to get during the first round, due to their coarseness, but eventually we got them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The experience was painless.  The shaver seemed to glide on the skin rather gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my father had no complaints on the Philips Norelco Bodygroom.  It worked pretty well and gave my father a new &#x27;clean&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> I don’t normally do this sort of thing but I just wasted $40 and I’m a little sad about it. Money is hard to come by and I’m not that well off to afford to be wasting that much. I recently purchased this in the hopes of alleviating my chronic..body hair. I’ve tried Veet and Nair and those never worked, and I’m too much of a whimp for plucking it. So I bought this because the general reviews were fairly positive with it. I got it home and like a dope I threw away the packaging and brought it upstairs. Later that night (after we had taken the garbage to the dumpster) I tried it and was severely disappointed. I went over the same spot three different times and still it didn’t get cut all the hair. I tried it in the shower too since it’s for wet and dry and again, no luck. I fell back to my 5 year old Remington beard trimmer with the broken adjustable comb (i took the comb off) and it plowed right through the hair no problem. I will just have to rely on that until I find something better. It’s just sad that a 5 year old razor does such a better job than a brand new one.. I wanted a body grooming one because while the beard trimmer works good you got to be real careful not to nick/cut yourself with it. I felt I should warn others to stay away from this product, it barely works!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever purchased in my entire life! First off, it only cuts about 1 in 10 hairs each pass. Second, half of those few hairs it &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; feel as if they are ripped out by tweezers. If that wasn&#x27;t enough, when it &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; the hairs it does&#x27;t do so cleanly. This causes the edges to the hairs to curl at the end much like Velcro. This makes for a very uncomfortable time after putting underwear or a shirt on. I never write reviews, but I am terrified of this product after one use. I would throw it away, but feel like burning it is the only way to destroy the evils this thing possesses.</li>
            <li> The BG2028 does a good job of cleaning up and the charge last long time.  Perfect for travel as it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space</li>
            <li> No complains at all. Really good product. The only thing that stops me from giving it a 5-star review, is the lack of an add-on blade, with shorter teeth for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> works great for underarms chest and pelvic area for people that don&#x27;t want razor burns or irritation , had to switch to electric do to razors giving me skin tags , shaves pretty good ass a razor would</li>
            <li> Great looking, but not designed well. I had higher expectations from this shaver. Using the #1 comb attachment I found it to be extremely slow and had a difficult time cutting long hair. I think this is due to the configuration of the clipper blades. I ended up taking the comb off and using it under a running shower head down to bare skin. It took a while and didn&#x27;t grab any hairs, but my intention wasn&#x27;t to shave completely, I wanted to trim short. The other issue I had was the placement of the power switch and the way it actuates. Depending on how you&#x27;re holding it, you may press the power switch by accident.The good thing about this shaver is a full charge seems to last a while. I used it for about a half hr to 40 minutes in the shower and it still seemed to run strong. My old Norelco would fade to black after 15-20 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this groomer for about 10 months now. It is much improved over the earlier models I used and is of better quality. I have only used it as a dry body shaver for back and scrotum areas (go slow and stretch the skin or it will nick a little). So far, this has been a great shaver and does a great job for my needs. Battery lasts about an hour before recharge, but recharge light is a nice improvement over original models-no guess work. Liking it so far...</li>
            <li> Works great! No pulling or tugging on the hairs, and gets the job done simple and fast.</li>
            <li> The product fits the description and works well. The charging dock is convenient to use and battery lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> WOW! just WOW! I am sooo pleased of this product. As an European, I am a great fan of brAun. Yeah, that trademark is very highly appreciated in our continent. I had a brAun body groomer, and once I got this, I understood that I had made the right choice. Very low levels of noise. The battery is consistent, I mean, it lasts as long as written on product details (50 mins) and maybe 10 minutes more (total of an hour). I have used this frequently in the last weeks, and looks like the battery is still as good as it was on the first use. YES, WATER RESISTANT. I tried it the very first day in the shower on the groin area, and it worked very well. To clean it on that upper part with the blades, simply push that black plastic on the lower blade upwards and the box with blades will pop out, showing you the hair accumulated there.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone, no matter how long they want their body hair to be. The product offers three levels of length, which I think they are very useful to suit people&#x27;s preferences.&lt;br /&gt;BTW, the recharge time is a bit long, 8 hours, but it is worth it for the stable performance of the machine when being used.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really clears the hair efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;with a tan your bod will look magnificent!  No bull.</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to handle.  Shaves nicely and seems to hold a charge well.  The only issue is that the main shave head seems very delicate.  I had to order a replacement after about a year.  Luckily the replacement was easy to find and order and was not expensive. UPDATE - Eventually the charger stops working and it does not seem possible to fix it.</li>
            <li> Great for mowing the lawn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent whole body shaver with good cutting ability, solid battery life, and an easy to clean design. It works much better than many of the other products I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s clearly built for long-term use.</li>
            <li> Loved it, might have better products, but for the cost , i like it.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Norelco Bodygroom series.  Bodygroom 2028 is an improvement on the 2020 model. The problem with the 2020 model was that it had these fat guides that had a tendency to fall of when grooming, but not with this one.  The guides have been redesigned to be sleeker.  In fact the trimmer has been designed as well, making a great product even better.</li>
            <li> Purchased for manscaping and does the trick. I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments and I don&#x27;t have any problems with nicks. My preference would be for it to be a little narrower and/or less material to the sides of the trimmers. The foil shaver, for the most part, is useless for my needs. I just wanted the trimmers. I also like how the manufacturer blunted the tips of the trimmers so they wouldn&#x27;t &#x27;gouge&#x27; the skin.</li>
            <li> Ok it works on legs and chest and flat areas, but not in the genital area or inner thighs. I don&#x27;t really like it but can&#x27;t return a used razor.</li>
            <li> I have the Philips Norelco Bodygroom&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Norelco-BG2040-34-Bodygroom/dp/B0037HP9OA/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_sbs_bt_11?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1WNTFGACVATH7WJRB7QD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I find that this one cuts just as well for forty dollars less, and has the reach feature for hard to get to parts like a guys back area.&lt;br /&gt;This is a solid performer, that can be used dry or wet. For the price this simply cannot be beat. Don&#x27;t even think of getting a Mangroom when you can get a deal like this.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;Its head doesn&#x27;t move and it&#x27;s fixed.&lt;br /&gt;It does work but not as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you buy another one with more payment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, easy to use and gives good results. The down side is that previous clippers of this brand started wearing out after ~2 years. The recent clipper I bought has some changes, so hopefully it&#x27;ll hold longer.</li>
            <li> Once you get how this razor is designed it will work well for you. Much better and safer than a standard razor works everywhere no problem but you do need to practice a bit with it. Take your time the first few times and don&#x27;t try to get it all in session one. The reviews talking about nicks and cuts or pulling v cutting hair must have defective units. Norelco stands behind its products just return the unit you have and get another one and see what you are missing.  Update  First using the head cleaner has really improved the consistency of the shave with this. http://www.amazon.com/Norelco-Philips-HQ110-Cleaner-Lubricant/dp/B001DFVJU6 Somehow this is cheaper from the manufacturer than from Amazon  Second Prep prep prep after a bit of practice - Wash you skin completely and dry off - Soften and protect the skin with a light coat of JoJoba Oil let it sink in, http://www.amazon.com/Desert-Essence-Jojoba-4-Ounce-Bottle/dp/B001CMT8DA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426424426&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;desert+jojoba - Use a good shave cream v foam so you can see what you are doing http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Body-Mens-Shave-Gel/dp/B00I5H5Z78/ref&#x3D;sr_1_cc_1?s&#x3D;aps&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426427443&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords&#x3D;gillette+body+shave+gel - Wash with a good anti bacterial soap http://www.amazon.com/Dial-Gold-Antibacterial-4-Ounce-10-Count/dp/B005JRGHU6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426427508&amp;sr&#x3D;1-15&amp;keywords&#x3D;anti+bacterial++bar+soap - Coat the area with a cooling antiseptic cream, http://www.amazon.com/finipil-Lait-50-1-5-44/dp/B00C4YJL96/ref&#x3D;sr_1_sc_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1426424633&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-spell&amp;keywords&#x3D;fifnipil - Next day try a light dusting of a cornstarch based powder for those with sensitive skin or try Balla powder http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00185SPJO/ref&#x3D;twister_B002ZFQ8N6?_encoding&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says. Haven&#x27;t had any problems since I got it, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Wish it got a little closer on the foil shave but that might be due to technique rather than product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on everything below the neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite what I expected. It does feel good in your hands but it does catch on the skin and hair sometimes. I ended up returning it after giving it a good trial run.</li>
            <li> just and awesome experience! does exactly what it supposed to!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Works well&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut skin&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s charging because the light only goes on when you initially start charging it</li>
            <li> Icuts body hair pretty well, just not really good for a deep shave, and doesn&#x27;t really work on the balls. Lol</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great once you get used to how it works.  You have to angle it appropriately in order to trim thicker hair, but once you get used to it I find it does an exceptional job quickly and with appropriate results.</li>
            <li> The older ones were good, but these seem to pull on your hair.  I was kinda disappointed with this purchase because they the blades could be way sharper.</li>
            <li> Works great, love that I can use it in the shower, the button is easy to depress and the charge lasts a long time. Good product from Philips :)</li>
            <li> It worked well for what I needed it for. It was simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good item no problems so far</li>
            <li> Works well! I&#x27;m a little cautious shaving my... areas, but it&#x27;s just my paranoia. If you don&#x27;t moisturize well, it will snag. Or if you have a lot of hair, I&#x27;d trim it down first with some scissors, then use this. It can get a bit bothersome to clean, but it isn&#x27;t difficult, just time consuming. Taking off the head proved to be difficult though. Just gotta learn how to do it through experience.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product, it´s good. It was very useful to me. It´s ligth, is water resistant... I like it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help trim certain areas of my body that a regular razor just is not comfortable. I weight train and any serious lifter will tell you that too much body hair is just not that attractive when you want the focus to be on your muscles. Great for legs, arms and back. Not sure if I would trust it 100% on those real sensitive areas but so far I&#x27;ve had no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most regrettable purchase.  It will not charge and constantly trips the breakers on my home.  If I had the packaging I would send it back TODAY!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Having used another Philips Norelco bodygroomer before this one, my main complaint was how low performing the battery was. It took 8 hours or more to charge and seemed that after that charge, you had perhaps one shave, or 10 or 20 minutes to use before the battery was drained again. Not the case with this one model. The BG2028 does take a while to fully charge but once you get that charge, you can get two or three uses out of it before you need to re-charge it again, making it a vast improvement over other models. Not only that but I was amazed by how light this model was compared to others in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had one complaint or criticism it&#x27;d be that the blades seem to go a bit dull rather quickly. After a month or two it takes a bit more time to get the same shave you would were this straight out the box. This was an issue I had with the previous model so I&#x27;m not entirely surprised. Overall a good and decent product.</li>
            <li> It does what it is advertised for. I tried grooming my chest, and it cleans it well - ALMOST like shaving it. But an actual razor is hard to beat and does a better job when it comes to a close shave. For trimming, it comes with trimming combs with different sizes. If you are satisfied with their sizes, it&#x27;s a product to buy. It does a good job. According to the manufacturer, it is DESIGNED FOR areas on body BELOW NECK LINE.</li>
            <li> It works really well, just REALLY be careful and patient and make sure not to  because you can accidentally nick yourself and that is something you don&#x27;t want to stress about.</li>
            <li> quick and easy trimmer and can use it dry or wet!</li>
            <li> Though I used this product for the first time, I thought I would write a review on this one since I have been shaving with electric shavers for quite a while. This one is a tricky shaver. It shaves pretty well especially in those areas but one has to be patient with this. It is not easy to shave though I would say it safer than the other shavers available in the market. Again the hair shouldn&#x27;t be very long or else the shave becomes difficult. Once you are done shaving you would realize that it has shaved better than the most available in the market. I would rate it average thought for the following reasons -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; it takes a long time to shave with this as one has to movie it over the same area again and again to achieve a good shave/trim.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; it needs to be shaved a particular angle to be able to get it cutting the hair properly which means that one needs to practice.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; I would expect a much faster shave in those hard to reach areas,&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; one might feel small nick like stuff happening in some delicate parts while shaving though I did not see any visible bleeding or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#62; I would expect an improved version of this. I wouldn&#x27;t but this again if given an option simply because I cannot put 30 mins t shave down there.</li>
            <li> For 30$ i wasn&#x27;t expecting much but, I was pleasantly surprised by this product. Its light weight, easy to handle, and it does what its suppose to, I&#x27;m happy that i didn&#x27;t listen to the negative re​views  it was getting.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for back and sensitive areas- solid and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> My son convinced me I need to modify some of the more &amp;#34;foresty&amp;#34; parts of my anatomy. He&#x27;s more daring and uses a razor. So, I thought I&#x27;d try this. Works perfectly and believe it or not, the instructions with it are clear and concise. You wouldn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d need instructions, but they are important for a level of comfort and use. Truly a five star.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Philips Norelco Bodygroom product I&#x27;ve owned.  Just like with electric shavers, I have to retrace the path of my cuttings to get a thorough shave with this product.  It does its job with only minor skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I used many trimmer and found this the best. The good thing about this is that it cab be used in in the water as well as out side the water.</li>
            <li> This is the first body hair trimmer I have ever purchased so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare to.  The razor is plenty powerful and does the job.  Seems to self clean pretty well with just a tap.</li>
            <li> A really good hair trimmer.  Cuts quickly and smoothly.  Can be used dry or wet.  Easy to use.  Runs for days on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Useful, ready to use, correctly priced</li>
            <li> Use as recommended by the Manufacturer and be a little careful on the sensitive areas. Easy to clean and maintain</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver and decent razor.  For long hair it is extremely good and does what it needs to do.  If you need a skin close shave though this might not be the product for you.  For the price it is a great buy overall.</li>
            <li> I use this thing in the shower and it is a champ. Runs a long time on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;No pinching, nicking, or other unpleasantries.</li>
            <li> Shaving cream. The Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom is advertised as a versatile all-around shaver that will effortlessly remove unwanted body hair whether your skin is dry, wet, or lathered in shaving cream. For the former two, it really doesn&#x27;t work that great, although it does work better, say, in the shower than totally dry. But if you use shaving cream you will definitely notice a fairly quick and close shave.  I&#x27;m able knock out my chest and back in about 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does one thing very well, and that is to not pinch or nick the more sensitive and harder to reach areas. Because of this, I&#x27;m assuming the Bodygroom can also be used down there, though I&#x27;ve never tried this nor do I have a reason to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shaving your chest, back, legs, and arms, the Philips Norelco BG2028 works insanely well... as long as you use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims without redness or nicks.  In fact, it rather remarkable how regular clippers will shred you, but these won&#x27;t.  Sometimes it requires a few passes, but I&#x27;ve found that true of all electric razors.  FYI, looking closely at the clippers, the design is ingenious.  The teeth are rounded instead of sharp and that seems to make the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have said these can or can&#x27;t be used for shaving you face, and as far as I can tell, there is no reason they can&#x27;t be used for that, but you better have patience.  Cutting dense hair, such facial with these will be a very slow process.  These are all about being slow and avoiding injuring, not taking off a thick beard.  The rounded teeth are probably to blame as less hair enters the clippers than compared to one with sharp teeth.  Also, the foil shaver is rather small and will take longer to shave a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected, no issues and a better shave then the previous Norelco body groom model. Although, I do wish they listed the expected lifespan of the non-user replaceable battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the body groom for years, and this is my 3rd one.  When it starts to get dull, don&#x27;t try to hold out too long, just buy another one (the replacement blades are around the same price as a new unit).  Nothing like getting an electric razor snagged on your wrinkly sack.</li>
            <li> Provides a great trim. Has a nice charging stand, and excellent battery life. Three trimming heads provide the trim level you desire. You can also use the trimmer without the snap on trimming heads.</li>
            <li> On a full charge I was able to trim my entire body from winter growth.  Not one hair left standing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I operated it dry.  I didn&#x27;t suffer any nicks or scrapes, and I have sensitive skin.  (Yes, I used it EVERYWHERE.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During use it wasn&#x27;t necessary to clear the hair out at all.  At the end I cleaned the unit like the instructions say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is not loud, and does not vibrate in the hand like other products.  The on/off button is easy to activate and I find the unit shuts off several times each use because I lightly bump the switch - annoying but not terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is amazing for how small this device is.  I tired out before the unit did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A blinking orange light gives plenty of warning that 10 minutes are left.  The speed of the motor stays consistent over the battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may want to take note that you cannot run the device on AC power.  (This might be typical of waterproof devices.) If you run down to \\&quot;empty\\&quot; you will have to charge for a while before you can finish.  A full charge takes 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another downside is for travelers. There is no carrying case supplied.  However, one of the combs could work reasonably well as a head protector with some rubber bands.  The charger is small, but doesn&#x27;t work without the stand.  The charger plugs into the stand, and two metal pads on the device touch mating fingers inside the stand.  Perhaps the 50 minute run time on a full charge will get you by while you are away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: On the third use I started to notice it \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; instead of cutting.  It&#x27;s a bit more painful to use.  I tried it in the shower and wet makes it pull much worse.  A replacement blade is $13 and that is about half what I paid for the unit.  I&#x27;m knocking off one star because of how fast the blades dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: It was an absolute pleasure to use this tool, and I am comfortable after the work was done.  I wished I found it years ago and that the tool would stay a little sharper.</li>
            <li> Previous one lasted for two years and broke to pieces. I bought a new one. Not worth buying the more expensive versions since I guess they will last the same. Easy to use, do not expect very smooth shave but does the job much easier in difficult body areas than a razor. One star cut for durability.</li>
            <li> does not cut hair very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;especially body hair.</li>
            <li> it sucks. the foil side cuts hairs sometimes and the edges almost never cut hair. Im not even that hairy and the body hair I do have is very thin and soft, so anything should be able to cut it but this product just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product and does what ever Philips claims it to do. I just have one grouse, the 1,2 and 3 numbered tips don&#x27;t really work good when it comes to trimming body hair. That&#x27;s the only frustrating part or maybe I still have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it like my old one - My old one was a philips like this one but the other end had a trimmer. I think it was a newer model (or as new) but I lost it a while back. Thought this one would be the same but it&#x27;s not. This once cuts and brutalizes me, to the point I don&#x27;t use it. Frowny face.</li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of the original Bodygroom.  It lasted several years and did a great job of removing hair in relatively few strokes before eventually biting the dust.  I figured purchasing the newest version of the Bodygroom would be a safe bet.  I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGELY DISSAPOINTED.  This thing feels nice in the hand and powered up after charging, however IT SIMPLY DOESN&#x27;T CUT HAIR.  I have to make several passes to remove even a little bit of hair, regardless of the body part.  Not only does it not cut the hair well, but it PULLS, YANKS, and HURTS the hair that it doesn&#x27;t cut.  I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on products, but I genuinely want to help people avoid wasting money on this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll have to look for something else, because the newest Bodygroom is not going to &amp;#34;cut it.&amp;#34;  I only have myself to blame for missing the return and refund period.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, handy shaver/trimmer. It has 3 different length guards, plus a foil, so this can get really close, or leave a nice, longer cut. I don&#x27;t do any \\&quot;manscaping\\&quot; so I pretty much just use this to catch elusive back hair, or trim up sideburns and such. I absolutely love the fact that this is waterproof and prefer to use it in the shower (easier cleanup). It&#x27;s not perfect, and I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s better than a safety razor for catching back hair, but it works well enough. I will say, however, that the guards are probably better used dry than wet, because trimming wet hair to a certain length isn&#x27;t very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great. The biggest drawback is not using it for shaving or such, though I&#x27;m sure it would work as a beard trimmer. Unless you do lots of \\&quot;manscaping,\\&quot; I can&#x27;t say this is really worth the $40 price tag though. But if you need to shave and trim a lot, this is probably one of the better products for it.</li>
            <li> I had another model of the philips bodygroom and my broke after I drop it many times. I got this new one and Its really good.</li>
            <li> After my old trimmer died after many years of use, I had the worst trimmer experience with the BG2028.&lt;br /&gt;It can only trim one way, pinches, pulls hair and feels very bulky.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact product. The electric razor itself is lighter than I expected it to be. By switching to this electric razor, I reduced my shave time from 1hr and 45min to just 45min! All you have to do is just slide it across whatever you&#x27;re shaving, and the hair instantly falls off! Sure, some areas you will have to go over twice, but it still gets the job done better than a manual razor would! This product is waterproof, so you can shave and bathe with ease! The blade can be cleaned out and it comes with this mini 2-sided brush to get into the grooves of the blades if you want a deeper clean. i would say that the only negative thing about this electric blade is the noise it makes. It&#x27;s fairly noisy and you won&#x27;t be able to shave in discretion if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re wanting to do. other than that one downside, the product is brilliant and well worth the price for the good job it does.</li>
            <li> I have used this only once so far, no need for more, as I don&#x27;t like to be completely shaved. It worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> I had owned the original Bodygroom from the time it came out, but my last one didn&#x27;t survive the trip home from Mexico, so I bought this new model.  The biggest problem I had with the old one was that the blades would occasionally catch and pop out of the unit.  This has been fixed with the addition of a rubber housing and the blade can&#x27;t pop out anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the more expensive units tout their rapid charge time, but I figure how often and how quickly do you really need to trim up?  I&#x27;m not a big fan of displaying my personal shaver on the counter in my bathroom, so once a week I put this on the charger for the requisite 8 hours and then put everything back in a cabinet.  The shaver works all week without requiring a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like its predecessor, you will find it nearly impossible to nick, cut or scratch yourself no matter how clumsily you&#x27;re flailing about to shave anywhere.</li>
            <li> Got 3 different guides for various lengths of hair, or you can remove it completely. Its able to keep your body groomed or as smooth as can be. Dont be scared to use in your sensitive areas, just be gentle. Move too fast you may scrape parts of your body, which will bring irritation. Also would recommend to use dry rather than in the shower, performs better.</li>
            <li> This is not just for men!! I use it to shave my legs and it does a very good job. I use it without the shave heads. Just don&#x27;t press it too hard on the skin to avoid cuts. The fact that it can be used in the shower is awesome. Cleaning is a cinch and I just use the running water under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Best money I&#x27;ve ever spent on a shaver. I use it for my under arms and my legs and have even used it on my face. It doesn&#x27;t scratch me like some of the ones I bought from Walmart. I would recommend this to women too.</li>
            <li> Good quality, even though the price is expensive. However, I did lose the trimmer holder (plastic holder) and had to purchase a new one, and was not happy with customer service</li>
