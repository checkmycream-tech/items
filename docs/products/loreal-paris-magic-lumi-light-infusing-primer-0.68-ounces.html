            <li>I&#x27;m so bummed because i found this in &#x27;style&#x27; magazine and tried the sample and was thrilled, but now this &#x27;separating&#x27; thing isn&#x27;t going to cut it!</li>

            <li>I have oily skin and this lumi primer works good with my face</li>
            <li>It makes a shiny glow but with foundation over&lt;br /&gt;it, it looks really good and it covers my pores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Good luck to you.</li>
            <li>Good primer.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping, great price and amazing product!!!!!</li>
            <li>Was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>This is okay as a primer, but great as a highlighter.</li>
            <li>i use this primer with foundation it gives nice good dewy look, i would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a glowing makeup.</li>
            <li>Love this primer!  </li>
            <li>And if you cat afford it for all those ,.. a nice cheap one is from remmel,.. their primers are good!</li>

            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>... more!  </li>
            <li>I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It went on beautifully and made my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff!  </li>
            <li>buy more of this product when I run out!</li>
            <li>Its not expensive and works perfectly..</li>
            <li>I really love this product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I do love this product tho!  </li>
            <li>love this as a highlighter!  </li>
            <li>I love this primer!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing ...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried mixing it with my foundation with it being so watery, but it gives a really nice glow though when I use it underneath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, but I like E.L.F translucent powder.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I picked this product up.  </li>
            <li>It goes on the skin nicely and it moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice primer, but just know that you will have that dewy look.</li>
            <li>-it&#x27;s more a primer booster that gives a gorgeously flawless, cakeless fresh looking finish when you know the way to use</li>
            <li>Nice Primer</li>
            <li>Nice highlighter.</li>
            <li>Depends what kind of skin you have and the look you&#x27;re going for I guess.</li>
            <li>I honestly think it&#x27;s my HG product of 2013.</li>
            <li>Just run warm water over the container, for about 1/2 min to 1 minute.  </li>
            <li>~perfect for me because i rarely wear more than sunscreen and a bit of eyeliner/lip stain/gloss.</li>
            <li>Nice for evening or formal occasions.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal True Match Lumi Healthy Luminous Makeup used with L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer is a perfect combination.</li>
            <li>This is nice for a nice light highlight under makeup.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know who to explain it, just stay away and get something better, there are plenty of nice primers out there and highlighters, try the one stick from Benefit, trust me, you will never want to go cheap again!</li>
            <li>I could have worn just this and looked great haha!  </li>
            <li>Best to use this sparingly other wise</li>
            <li>If this were more of a luminous skin tone color I would love it more.</li>
            <li>I love this product .</li>
            <li>Love this primer.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more when I use it all up</li>
            <li>My skin is combination but more on oily side.</li>
            <li>I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I will be able to use it before it</li>
            <li>A better value.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a light creme, it has a nice glow (not glitter, just shimmering glow).</li>
            <li>but, more like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really love the look.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and my foundation goes on better with it</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your moisturizer/sunscreen if you use them and let it set for 15 minutes or more.</li>
            <li>(I love</li>
            <li>it gives ur skin that healthy glow under ur foundation</li>
            <li>I think mixing it in with my foundation gives a more dewy look, but I like it both ways.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this primer-</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I use to buy it from Target but haven&#x27;t been able to find it there for a while.</li>
            <li>will be ordering more because to me it seems you need&lt;</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use it under my bronzer and my make-up looks so much better.</li>
            <li>It is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this as a primer</li>
            <li>In theory, this product should have been an immediate favorite.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a breakout like that in many years.  </li>
            <li>boo to Magic Lumi</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have used it for about 3 years and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love the brightness it gives my complexion.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>is so stunning.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I bought this by accident yesterday when I meant to get the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Concealer.</li>
            <li>Better as a Highlight for nose, browbone and under eyes.</li>
            <li>but I will use it more for highlite my face.</li>
            <li>this primer gives you a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>Eyes, chin, top of cheek bones, etc.  </li>
            <li>so I add this to L&#x27;Oreal Paris Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.</li>
            <li>love it love it, i mix it with my liquid fundation, and it makes my faces looks brighter and smoother, I will also add a shimmer powder on after</li>
            <li>Normally I love this product, but had to get a refund because when I went to use it just water squirted out, even after shaking the heck out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I would like for it to be a bit more shiny or dewy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay primer.</li>
            <li>It does smooth out my skin and leaves a nice pallet for my foundation.</li>
            <li>I have never used a primer and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Love this product, hope company don&#x27;t change or discontinue.</li>
            <li>exactly the results I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li>that I accidentally got this and my first impression was so good</li>
            <li>and it really gives you that bright look.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi.</li>
            <li>The product is not oily, my skin breaks out easily and this product does not cause any type of break out.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in my makeup bag and pumps out easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>As for the product itself, I highly recommend it as it is great and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I have used it by itself too and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>However, I mix a half pump of this with my Clinique tinted moisturizer, and my skin looks so flawless!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li>Super shimmery!</li>
            <li>It is great for photos, gives your face a nice light.also good for everyday we a r&#x27;m gives the face nice light, look younger and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Makeup lasts and makes a huge difference with primer usage</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li>On the plus side it does makes one&#x27;s skin smooth and helps to hide some pores and flaws.</li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this Loreal Lumi Primer in the mail and almost tossed it, but I wasn&#x27;t leaving the house that day</li>
            <li>rubs on like a light lotion.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be so shiny and kind of pearly - it&#x27;s supposed to be that way</li>
            <li>I really liked the product but it separated fast, making it unusable.</li>
            <li>Great buy at only 10$.</li>
            <li>LIGHT FOR WHEN YOU ARE ON THE GO.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s not that cheap for a drug store product.  </li>
            <li>But it makes makeup glide on so smooth.</li>
            <li>Made my eyes burn and didn&#x27;t even help secure my makeup.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy for sure</li>
            <li>It it light weight and makes my skin look brighter.</li>
            <li>I loved the bottle I bought locally but what I received from Amazon was mostly water.  </li>
            <li>I loved the brightening and luminating effect it provides, and as a primer, it did help foundation last longer and apply more evenly.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be the absolute best method for applying different types of foundation!)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so excited</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way this genius application wasn&#x27;t my original idea.</li>
            <li>not sure if I&#x27;ve found the best way to apply it yet.</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>This primer is great for those who have dry skin.</li>
            <li>And the &amp;#34;separating&amp;#34; is super easy and quick to fix.</li>
            <li>(Maybe it is a good primer, but it&#x27;s nothing like the other brands I&#x27;ve used, which are thicker and seem to lay a better canvas for</li>
            <li>, then im good to good, with no other make up, look freshed, and glowy, great for a casual day off.</li>
            <li>I use this with my l&#x27;oreal true match lumi foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this product - really adds a glow to my complexion &amp; additional moisture</li>
            <li>Other than that it looks great.</li>
            <li>I love a super dewy face, and nothing gives me that inner glow like Magic Lumi.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also seen people use it on top of their foundation as a cheek bone highlight or mixed with their foundation to achieve an even more radiant glow.</li>
            <li>Made my face seem super oily and my makeup would slide off during the day.</li>
            <li>, I would not recommend this ti someone with SUPER OILY skin, but yes to anyone with dry/normal or with a teeny bit of oiliness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m highly allergic to most products</li>
            <li>I first put on the BB primer, then I use cover girl olay with a light tint of foundation and then I use this over my make-up on my cheeks, chin and under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and i just am liking it very much!</li>
            <li>Have had many people compliment me about the new &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; I am wearing.</li>
            <li>For the price compared to higher priced department store products, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li>If you want a nice highlight on your face,.. this is not your product, not only will it make it look greasy</li>
            <li>Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Used product for wedding over weekend and made my make up look very even and surprisingly made a bigger difference than would have thought.</li>
            <li>Useful product.  </li>
            <li>If you do have sensitive skin, try the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Primer instead.  </li>
            <li>I heard about this product and liked how it looked when applied in several on line videos..</li>
            <li>I am unsure why they chose to market it as a primer; I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly useful for that purpose.</li>
            <li>I use it more as a highlighter for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>love this primer, not oily and leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>my normal Cover Girl make up over it and wah lah!!!  </li>
            <li>I must say I absolutely love the packaging, its easy to apply and mess free</li>
            <li>other users, I loved this product until it separated.</li>
            <li>the right price and</li>
            <li>It does look really pretty at first!</li>
            <li>Love primers in general, but</li>
            <li>I may be adding too much foundation on top of it, but I really do enjoy the lasting coverage.</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, whitish at first, blends easily around my entire eye area and POP goes your eyes with or without make up or eye make up</li>
            <li>It peel of if used with certain moisturizers!</li>
            <li>When I first bought it I didn&#x27;t use it right away</li>
            <li>My skin has become more sensitive as I age, and much dryer.  </li>
            <li>I bet this would be amazing on a dry skin person!</li>
            <li>I usually only use it in places where I will put highlight on top of it and a thicker primer on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>I shook several times and more watery liquid came out.  </li>
            <li>Finally on the 3-4th try I was able to get some lotion out.  </li>
            <li>If your dark skinned you need to use this with a light hand it will look a bit chalky, your blending skills have to be magic to fix it if you didn&#x27;t use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>The package is small which is perfect for me once I do not use make-up daily</li>
            <li>I also use the Magic Lumi Concealer/Highlighter, another terrific product comparable to YSL Touche Eclat.</li>
            <li>I was able to use it for about a month and then one day it started pumping out water/oil and clumps of the pearly white color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it under foundation as a primer, mixed with foundation, and as a highlighter on top of cheek bones.  </li>
            <li>This is my first primer I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li>(a friend of mine made this comment) and my mother said it must be hot because I&#x27;m sweating bullets.</li>
            <li>but on weekends I just mix it with a dab of moisturizer and use on my entire face for a nice smooth and younger looking complexion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!  </li>
            <li>but it seemed to make my face seem more ghostly white</li>
            <li>Okay, so this isn&#x27;t a primer that will set your make up to last,</li>
            <li>But shake it first-</li>
            <li>at first try, I put this on my hand and it gave a glowing luminous look.  </li>
            <li>Also, when I went to pull the plastic cap off, the entire top came out getting primer all over me, my make up bag and my sink</li>
            <li>I have used this mixed in with my foundation, or used as a highlighter on top of my foundation.  </li>
            <li>The water oil and white are separated and even if i shake it it wont get much better.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I had to first wash off the Primer.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a primer for the first time &amp; didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, so I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Good coverage and color with a soft natural glow without being obvious.</li>
            <li>There are other similar products out there, many for a lot more coin than this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Lumi Primer gives just enough brightness and silky moisture to set a fresh and clean look to foundation and really covers up those pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s kind of odd that it&#x27;s considered a primer tho.  </li>
            <li>I would consider this a little pricier than most products I buy, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have very freckly fair skin that is somewhat hard to manage.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference and its a watery product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s like a light lotion with a luminizer mixed in.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and seems to stay on real well.</li>
            <li>although if I apply too much foundation, it masks the glow.</li>
            <li>It is very watery.  </li>
            <li>But it is still very watery and somewhat separated.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a difference,but I continued to use it because I wanted my skin to have a glow,but instead,I wound up looking shiny</li>
            <li>, I may have been using too much.</li>
            <li>This absolutely should be in your collection if you like the dewy/glowy thing.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning and by mid-day you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It is really shiny when you put on</li>
            <li>but loreal really needs to do something to keep the mixture emulsified</li>
            <li>It did, but also irritated my skin too much.  </li>
            <li>Very luminous.</li>
            <li>I use a brush or my fingertips to gently blend it in.</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people also use it as a highlighter, but I am not savvy enough to do this method without looking a bit too shiny; I find that it looks most natural and flattering for me just mixing with my foundation and smoothing on the whole face.</li>
            <li>This is a very sneaky way to force a response.</li>
            <li>My daughter even asked me what I was using because my skin looked so young and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I was in a hurry, not paying much attention, and somehow didn&#x27;t notice this was a primer.</li>
            <li>I really like  this product</li>
            <li>Have too much reflection for the whole face.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>(I use the Real Techniques sponge to apply foundation -</li>
            <li>OK mixed with makeup - very watery and thins my foundation a lot so not as much coverage which is OK for more casual look.  </li>
            <li>work an afternoon shift, Put my face on, getting ready to go off to work; got a call asking me to work an overnight instead; went to bed to catch a few hours sleep, woke up with makeup as nice looking as though I&#x27;d just put it</li>
            <li>This is a nice dupe for the MAC Strobe Fluid (not the cream, the fluid).  </li>
            <li>The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the shipping time since it takes a little longer than a normal Amazon shipment.</li>
            <li>Now, instead of one smooth item, I have to deal with a clear liquid and a white one, and mix them up in my hands first in order to get an even coverage.</li>
            <li>will say the glow that it gives is pretty - very pearly and soft NOT glittery or overdone at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stays smooth for a long time.  </li>
            <li>worked better than i expected!!</li>
            <li>This is a new must have for me!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin glow and is one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li>Certainly brightens up an old face!</li>
            <li>Gives a slight shimmer but more of a glow.</li>
            <li>have older skin</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and adds just enough natural glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it and would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t quite as &amp;</li>
            <li>Highly reccommend buying this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone try this method; the luminosity and dewy-ness it gives the skin when combined with your foundation or tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If I shake it vigorously it is a little better.  </li>
            <li>but has little more shine to it than I like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a product junky when it comes to makeup</li>
            <li>Love wish I would of known its super small need to get a bigger size leaves skin luminous</li>
            <li>If you have extremely pale skin you may be able to avoid this step.</li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive to break outs when trying new products, not with this!</li>
            <li>I tried shaking and pumping a few more times but its now just clear liquid coming out.</li>
            <li>It really brightens my eye overall and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li>So it does what it says, but I just wish it was thicker and more similar to the other primers in consistency.</li>
            <li>I love this product - I mix it with my ordinary makeup and it illuminates my face.  </li>
            <li>other reviewers talked about it separating, I&#x27;ve had it over a month and had originally stored it in a make up bag and noticed this too.</li>
            <li>I either mix this with my other primer of put the other primer on first and then add this on top and finish with mineral translucent matte powder.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and there is really all you need under foundation for a little glow without ending up with a face full of sparkles.</li>
            <li>But I was very clever and shook it up several times</li>
            <li>As of right now I would not highly suggest it.</li>
            <li>love the overall look and feel, so far it has had little to no side-effects (I have sensitive skin and if makeup disagrees with me then my face lets me know with in 5 minutes).</li>
            <li>To those who claim it separates, the label clearly states to SHAKE BEFORE EACH APPLICATION.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m just completely oblivious to the results.</li>
            <li>I am going to call L&#x27;Oreal Paris customer service directly and speak to them about this issue.</li>
            <li>add this to foundation for a dewy, natural effect.  </li>
            <li>am 50 years old and my skin looks like the skin of a 30 year old this way.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It gives a natural luminous glow without looking glittery or like a grease ball.</li>
            <li>Ladies, I mix my L&#x27;Oreal BB Foundation Cream with a squirt of this primer and at 70 years young, I receive compliments as to how my skin appears so youthful and is so luminescent ...</li>
            <li>I will say that it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>Then I put it on and my make up completely covered any hint of \\&quot;glow\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I apply directly before my foundation.</li>
            <li>This product is an instant pick-me-up for my face; the effect is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I really cannot speak highly enough of the effect this has on my skin.</li>
            <li>when used on the whole face mixed with foundation , literally illuminates ur skin.</li>
            <li>Not heavy.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t slippy like most silicone based primers, it soaks into your skin and smoothes, all while subtly illuminating your complexion.</li>
            <li>Then take your brush and lightly buff your face, especially around creases and sides of nose and up into your hairline, down around jaw to neck to blend in.</li>
            <li>And the price is right; especially considering a bottle lasts me so long.</li>
            <li>I have a super dry face, and this doesn&#x27;t dry me out at all</li>
            <li>Use it as highlighter and mix it with my makeup to achieve a fresh dewy look, and use less make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very busy licensed esthetician, have several products at my disposal</li>
            <li>I work in a dermatology clinic, and even the doctors commented on how healthy my skin has been looking lately!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m jumping the gun a bit, but like this well enough to get a little excited about it and for now I am going to give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>It is less pink and more of a white pearl color, which is what I was wanting.  </li>
            <li>As reviews have noted, the water, oil, and white in this product separated after only 2 normal uses.  </li>
            <li>All products were good except the feather duster, which was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have anything terrible to say about it or anything super great</li>
            <li>sensitive, dry, super pale translucent skin and this works wonders.</li>
            <li>Gives a soft illusion around the eye area to counter the dark circle and wrinkles of a 45 year old.</li>
            <li>Overall I didn&#x27;t  notice much of a difference, but my outcome may be different from other because like I said, I have difficult skin to work with :]</li>
            <li>It really smoothed out my eye lids and added a little bit to my brow line before I put eye shadow on.</li>
            <li>and I feel makes my whole skin tone look a little lighter.  </li>
            <li>little miracle seems expensive for the size, but it lasts a good while and earns it price every time I use it.&lt;br</li>

            <li> love this as a highlighter!  </li>
            <li> I love this primer!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing ...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried mixing it with my foundation with it being so watery, but it gives a really nice glow though when I use it underneath.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I like E.L.F translucent powder.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I picked this product up.  </li>
            <li> It goes on the skin nicely and it moisturizes the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice primer, but just know that you will have that dewy look.</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s more a primer booster that gives a gorgeously flawless, cakeless fresh looking finish when you know the way to use</li>
            <li> Nice Primer</li>
            <li> Nice highlighter.</li>
            <li> Depends what kind of skin you have and the look you&#x27;re going for I guess.</li>
            <li> I honestly think it&#x27;s my HG product of 2013.</li>
            <li> Just run warm water over the container, for about 1/2 min to 1 minute.  </li>
            <li> ~perfect for me because i rarely wear more than sunscreen and a bit of eyeliner/lip stain/gloss.</li>
            <li> Nice for evening or formal occasions.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal True Match Lumi Healthy Luminous Makeup used with L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer is a perfect combination.</li>
            <li> This is nice for a nice light highlight under makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know who to explain it, just stay away and get something better, there are plenty of nice primers out there and highlighters, try the one stick from Benefit, trust me, you will never want to go cheap again!</li>
            <li> I could have worn just this and looked great haha!  </li>
            <li> Best to use this sparingly other wise</li>
            <li> If this were more of a luminous skin tone color I would love it more.</li>
            <li> I love this product .</li>
            <li> Love this primer.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more when I use it all up</li>
            <li> My skin is combination but more on oily side.</li>
            <li> I am truly satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I will be able to use it before it</li>
            <li> A better value.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like a light creme, it has a nice glow (not glitter, just shimmering glow).</li>
            <li> but, more like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really love the look.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and my foundation goes on better with it</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your moisturizer/sunscreen if you use them and let it set for 15 minutes or more.</li>
            <li> (I love</li>
            <li> it gives ur skin that healthy glow under ur foundation</li>
            <li> I think mixing it in with my foundation gives a more dewy look, but I like it both ways.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this primer-</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I use to buy it from Target but haven&#x27;t been able to find it there for a while.</li>

            <li> It is okay.</li>
            <li> I love this as a primer</li>
            <li> In theory, this product should have been an immediate favorite.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a breakout like that in many years.  </li>
            <li> boo to Magic Lumi</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> is so stunning.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I bought this by accident yesterday when I meant to get the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Concealer.</li>
            <li> Better as a Highlight for nose, browbone and under eyes.</li>
            <li> but I will use it more for highlite my face.</li>
            <li> this primer gives you a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Eyes, chin, top of cheek bones, etc.  </li>
            <li> so I add this to L&#x27;Oreal Paris Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream.</li>
            <li> love it love it, i mix it with my liquid fundation, and it makes my faces looks brighter and smoother, I will also add a shimmer powder on after</li>
            <li> Normally I love this product, but had to get a refund because when I went to use it just water squirted out, even after shaking the heck out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I would like for it to be a bit more shiny or dewy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay primer.</li>
            <li> It does smooth out my skin and leaves a nice pallet for my foundation.</li>
            <li> I have never used a primer and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Love this product, hope company don&#x27;t change or discontinue.</li>
            <li> exactly the results I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> that I accidentally got this and my first impression was so good</li>
            <li> and it really gives you that bright look.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi.</li>
            <li> The product is not oily, my skin breaks out easily and this product does not cause any type of break out.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in my makeup bag and pumps out easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> As for the product itself, I highly recommend it as it is great and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I have used it by itself too and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> However, I mix a half pump of this with my Clinique tinted moisturizer, and my skin looks so flawless!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li> Super shimmery!</li>
            <li> It is great for photos, gives your face a nice light.also good for everyday we a r&#x27;m gives the face nice light, look younger and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Makeup lasts and makes a huge difference with primer usage</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a huge plus.</li>
            <li> On the plus side it does makes one&#x27;s skin smooth and helps to hide some pores and flaws.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this Loreal Lumi Primer in the mail and almost tossed it, but I wasn&#x27;t leaving the house that day</li>
            <li> rubs on like a light lotion.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be so shiny and kind of pearly - it&#x27;s supposed to be that way</li>
            <li> I really liked the product but it separated fast, making it unusable.</li>
            <li> Great buy at only 10$.</li>
            <li> LIGHT FOR WHEN YOU ARE ON THE GO.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s not that cheap for a drug store product.  </li>
            <li> But it makes makeup glide on so smooth.</li>
            <li> Made my eyes burn and didn&#x27;t even help secure my makeup.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy for sure</li>
            <li> It it light weight and makes my skin look brighter.</li>
            <li> I loved the bottle I bought locally but what I received from Amazon was mostly water.  </li>
            <li> I loved the brightening and luminating effect it provides, and as a primer, it did help foundation last longer and apply more evenly.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be the absolute best method for applying different types of foundation!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so excited</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way this genius application wasn&#x27;t my original idea.</li>
            <li> not sure if I&#x27;ve found the best way to apply it yet.</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> This primer is great for those who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> And the &amp;#34;separating&amp;#34; is super easy and quick to fix.</li>
            <li> (Maybe it is a good primer, but it&#x27;s nothing like the other brands I&#x27;ve used, which are thicker and seem to lay a better canvas for</li>
            <li> , then im good to good, with no other make up, look freshed, and glowy, great for a casual day off.</li>
            <li> I use this with my l&#x27;oreal true match lumi foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this product - really adds a glow to my complexion &amp; additional moisture</li>
            <li> Other than that it looks great.</li>
            <li> I love a super dewy face, and nothing gives me that inner glow like Magic Lumi.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen people use it on top of their foundation as a cheek bone highlight or mixed with their foundation to achieve an even more radiant glow.</li>
            <li> Made my face seem super oily and my makeup would slide off during the day.</li>
            <li> , I would not recommend this ti someone with SUPER OILY skin, but yes to anyone with dry/normal or with a teeny bit of oiliness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m highly allergic to most products</li>
            <li> I first put on the BB primer, then I use cover girl olay with a light tint of foundation and then I use this over my make-up on my cheeks, chin and under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and i just am liking it very much!</li>
            <li> Have had many people compliment me about the new &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; I am wearing.</li>
            <li> For the price compared to higher priced department store products, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  </li>
            <li> If you want a nice highlight on your face,.. this is not your product, not only will it make it look greasy</li>
            <li> Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Used product for wedding over weekend and made my make up look very even and surprisingly made a bigger difference than would have thought.</li>
            <li> Useful product.  </li>
            <li> If you do have sensitive skin, try the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Primer instead.  </li>
            <li> I heard about this product and liked how it looked when applied in several on line videos..</li>
            <li> I am unsure why they chose to market it as a primer; I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly useful for that purpose.</li>
            <li> I use it more as a highlighter for my mature skin.  </li>
            <li> love this primer, not oily and leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> my normal Cover Girl make up over it and wah lah!!!  </li>
            <li> I must say I absolutely love the packaging, its easy to apply and mess free</li>
            <li> other users, I loved this product until it separated.</li>
            <li> the right price and</li>
            <li> It does look really pretty at first!</li>
            <li> Love primers in general, but</li>
            <li> I may be adding too much foundation on top of it, but I really do enjoy the lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, whitish at first, blends easily around my entire eye area and POP goes your eyes with or without make up or eye make up</li>
            <li> It peel of if used with certain moisturizers!</li>
            <li> When I first bought it I didn&#x27;t use it right away</li>
            <li> My skin has become more sensitive as I age, and much dryer.  </li>
            <li> I bet this would be amazing on a dry skin person!</li>
            <li> I usually only use it in places where I will put highlight on top of it and a thicker primer on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> I shook several times and more watery liquid came out.  </li>
            <li> Finally on the 3-4th try I was able to get some lotion out.  </li>
            <li> If your dark skinned you need to use this with a light hand it will look a bit chalky, your blending skills have to be magic to fix it if you didn&#x27;t use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> The package is small which is perfect for me once I do not use make-up daily</li>
            <li> I also use the Magic Lumi Concealer/Highlighter, another terrific product comparable to YSL Touche Eclat.</li>
            <li> I was able to use it for about a month and then one day it started pumping out water/oil and clumps of the pearly white color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it under foundation as a primer, mixed with foundation, and as a highlighter on top of cheek bones.  </li>
            <li> This is my first primer I&#x27;ve ever purchased</li>
            <li> (a friend of mine made this comment) and my mother said it must be hot because I&#x27;m sweating bullets.</li>
            <li> but on weekends I just mix it with a dab of moisturizer and use on my entire face for a nice smooth and younger looking complexion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!  </li>
            <li> but it seemed to make my face seem more ghostly white</li>
            <li> Okay, so this isn&#x27;t a primer that will set your make up to last,</li>
            <li> But shake it first-</li>
            <li> at first try, I put this on my hand and it gave a glowing luminous look.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I went to pull the plastic cap off, the entire top came out getting primer all over me, my make up bag and my sink</li>
            <li> I have used this mixed in with my foundation, or used as a highlighter on top of my foundation.  </li>
            <li> The water oil and white are separated and even if i shake it it wont get much better.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning</li>
            <li> shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I had to first wash off the Primer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a primer for the first time &amp; didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, so I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Good coverage and color with a soft natural glow without being obvious.</li>
            <li> There are other similar products out there, many for a lot more coin than this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Lumi Primer gives just enough brightness and silky moisture to set a fresh and clean look to foundation and really covers up those pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s kind of odd that it&#x27;s considered a primer tho.  </li>
            <li> I would consider this a little pricier than most products I buy, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have very freckly fair skin that is somewhat hard to manage.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference and its a watery product.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s like a light lotion with a luminizer mixed in.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and seems to stay on real well.</li>
            <li> although if I apply too much foundation, it masks the glow.</li>
            <li> It is very watery.  </li>
            <li> But it is still very watery and somewhat separated.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference,but I continued to use it because I wanted my skin to have a glow,but instead,I wound up looking shiny</li>
            <li> , I may have been using too much.</li>
            <li> This absolutely should be in your collection if you like the dewy/glowy thing.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning and by mid-day you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It is really shiny when you put on</li>
            <li> but loreal really needs to do something to keep the mixture emulsified</li>
            <li> It did, but also irritated my skin too much.  </li>
            <li> Very luminous.</li>
            <li> I use a brush or my fingertips to gently blend it in.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people also use it as a highlighter, but I am not savvy enough to do this method without looking a bit too shiny; I find that it looks most natural and flattering for me just mixing with my foundation and smoothing on the whole face.</li>
            <li> This is a very sneaky way to force a response.</li>
            <li> My daughter even asked me what I was using because my skin looked so young and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I was in a hurry, not paying much attention, and somehow didn&#x27;t notice this was a primer.</li>
            <li> I really like  this product</li>
            <li> Have too much reflection for the whole face.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li> (I use the Real Techniques sponge to apply foundation -</li>
            <li> OK mixed with makeup - very watery and thins my foundation a lot so not as much coverage which is OK for more casual look.  </li>
            <li> work an afternoon shift, Put my face on, getting ready to go off to work; got a call asking me to work an overnight instead; went to bed to catch a few hours sleep, woke up with makeup as nice looking as though I&#x27;d just put it</li>
            <li> This is a nice dupe for the MAC Strobe Fluid (not the cream, the fluid).  </li>
            <li> The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the shipping time since it takes a little longer than a normal Amazon shipment.</li>
            <li> Now, instead of one smooth item, I have to deal with a clear liquid and a white one, and mix them up in my hands first in order to get an even coverage.</li>
            <li> will say the glow that it gives is pretty - very pearly and soft NOT glittery or overdone at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It stays smooth for a long time.  </li>
            <li> worked better than i expected!!</li>
            <li> This is a new must have for me!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin glow and is one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li> Certainly brightens up an old face!</li>
            <li> Gives a slight shimmer but more of a glow.</li>
            <li> have older skin</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and adds just enough natural glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it and would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t quite as &amp;</li>
            <li> Highly reccommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone try this method; the luminosity and dewy-ness it gives the skin when combined with your foundation or tinted moisturizer</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If I shake it vigorously it is a little better.  </li>
            <li> but has little more shine to it than I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a product junky when it comes to makeup</li>
            <li> Love wish I would of known its super small need to get a bigger size leaves skin luminous</li>
            <li> If you have extremely pale skin you may be able to avoid this step.</li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive to break outs when trying new products, not with this!</li>
            <li> I tried shaking and pumping a few more times but its now just clear liquid coming out.</li>
            <li> It really brightens my eye overall and the cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I recommend this product highly.  </li>
            <li> So it does what it says, but I just wish it was thicker and more similar to the other primers in consistency.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I mix it with my ordinary makeup and it illuminates my face.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers talked about it separating, I&#x27;ve had it over a month and had originally stored it in a make up bag and noticed this too.</li>
            <li> I either mix this with my other primer of put the other primer on first and then add this on top and finish with mineral translucent matte powder.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and there is really all you need under foundation for a little glow without ending up with a face full of sparkles.</li>
            <li> But I was very clever and shook it up several times</li>
            <li> As of right now I would not highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> love the overall look and feel, so far it has had little to no side-effects (I have sensitive skin and if makeup disagrees with me then my face lets me know with in 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> To those who claim it separates, the label clearly states to SHAKE BEFORE EACH APPLICATION.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just completely oblivious to the results.</li>
            <li> I am going to call L&#x27;Oreal Paris customer service directly and speak to them about this issue.</li>
            <li> add this to foundation for a dewy, natural effect.  </li>
            <li> am 50 years old and my skin looks like the skin of a 30 year old this way.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It gives a natural luminous glow without looking glittery or like a grease ball.</li>
            <li> Ladies, I mix my L&#x27;Oreal BB Foundation Cream with a squirt of this primer and at 70 years young, I receive compliments as to how my skin appears so youthful and is so luminescent ...</li>
            <li> I will say that it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li> Then I put it on and my make up completely covered any hint of \\&quot;glow\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I apply directly before my foundation.</li>
            <li> This product is an instant pick-me-up for my face; the effect is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I really cannot speak highly enough of the effect this has on my skin.</li>
            <li> when used on the whole face mixed with foundation , literally illuminates ur skin.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t slippy like most silicone based primers, it soaks into your skin and smoothes, all while subtly illuminating your complexion.</li>
            <li> Then take your brush and lightly buff your face, especially around creases and sides of nose and up into your hairline, down around jaw to neck to blend in.</li>
            <li> And the price is right; especially considering a bottle lasts me so long.</li>
            <li> I have a super dry face, and this doesn&#x27;t dry me out at all</li>
            <li> Use it as highlighter and mix it with my makeup to achieve a fresh dewy look, and use less make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very busy licensed esthetician, have several products at my disposal</li>
            <li> I work in a dermatology clinic, and even the doctors commented on how healthy my skin has been looking lately!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m jumping the gun a bit, but like this well enough to get a little excited about it and for now I am going to give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It is less pink and more of a white pearl color, which is what I was wanting.  </li>
            <li> As reviews have noted, the water, oil, and white in this product separated after only 2 normal uses.  </li>
            <li> All products were good except the feather duster, which was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything terrible to say about it or anything super great</li>
            <li> sensitive, dry, super pale translucent skin and this works wonders.</li>
            <li> Gives a soft illusion around the eye area to counter the dark circle and wrinkles of a 45 year old.</li>
            <li> Overall I didn&#x27;t  notice much of a difference, but my outcome may be different from other because like I said, I have difficult skin to work with :]</li>
            <li> It really smoothed out my eye lids and added a little bit to my brow line before I put eye shadow on.</li>
            <li> and I feel makes my whole skin tone look a little lighter.  </li>
            <li> little miracle seems expensive for the size, but it lasts a good while and earns it price every time I use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on how much time I have, I&#x27;ll either apply this to my moisturized face before my foundation (usually with a stippling brush), or I&#x27;ll mix it in with my foundation and apply that with a damp beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Will probably last me a long time.  </li>
            <li> Used together you have long lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> a small dot really goes a long way ...</li>
            <li> I moved to Colorado this year, and our dry, zero-humidity winter is causing my skin to look pretty dull.</li>
            <li> The product left my face looking pale and ashy underneath my foundation, I didn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;naturally</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews on the net of others saying same thing.  </li>
            <li> I use a combo of cheap make up and expensive make up</li>
            <li> People always think I have no base on…this is my secret!  </li>
            <li> and my make up stayed put all day long.  </li>
            <li> Liittle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and I have never had issues with it separating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying it a few different ways and at different sequences in my makeup application, and at different amounts, and I&#x27;m still waiting to see it glow.</li>
            <li> That one is a little less illuminating, but very hydrating</li>
            <li> bought this at a local drug store and paid almost double than amazon does, but got half off with another Loreal product........</li>
            <li> I will continue to repurchase as long as they make it!</li>
            <li> So I went to buy it from Walgreens for $9.99 (which isn&#x27;t bad for a drug store illuminator since I spent $30 on the Nars illuminator which is amazing btw).</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> but it made dry patches on my face and</li>
            <li> my make up looked all dry.</li>
            <li> beware if you have dry skin not to put in on your dry patches, it will look like death.</li>
            <li> I have some dry patches on one of my eye lids and it didn&#x27;t bother it a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oily in some areas, dry in others)</li>
            <li> But for dry skin</li>
            <li> Very runny and not a good primer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face the way some primers have!</li>
            <li> So I was hoping this would bring a little youthful dewiness and glow back to my face.  </li>
            <li> , big whoop, just shake it a little.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes a little &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; on the areas you want to highlight.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I need a little extra glow</li>
            <li> It did not pick up the dust as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Expensive for drugstore but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected I thought it was matte primer</li>
            <li> I really do not like the consistency of the product.</li>
            <li> so maybe that could&#x27;ve been the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me, but other than that this wouldn&#x27;t be a recommended product from me.</li>
            <li> Other</li>
            <li> Other days I go over it with a powder or liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> But it has a tendency to highlight imperfections, so I avoid using it if I have a zit or other issue.</li>
            <li> After a while (like other reviewers have said) it separated.</li>
            <li> Then it&#x27;s oil slick central.</li>
            <li> I mix a touch with my foundation for a dewy look and other times I use it just as a highlighter.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily compared to my preferred primers, but what I&#x27;ve started doing is just putting a dab in the center of my forehead, under my eyes/high cheek bone area, and the center of my chin.</li>
            <li> Slight irritation since I&#x27;m not really used to wearing it</li>
            <li> I have a problem with my skin being dull in the morning and this definitely brightens my skin tone, but it&#x27;s a tad too watery for me.</li>
            <li> I hard to open it and shake it every time I&#x27;m going to use it.</li>
            <li> Did seem a little overkill to have such a small bottle in a box and not just a pouch.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just average to me.</li>
            <li> but it does cover my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Helps lessen the look of dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with it.</li>
            <li> mentioned it does sometime break down, but I find that it has no effect on the product.</li>
            <li> but I plan on using it a few other ways to see if my opinion may change.</li>
            <li> Like a few of the other reviews, I have noticed some separation on occasion.</li>
            <li> Gives a slight bit of glow.  </li>
            <li> I did use sparingly and still a greasy mess.</li>
            <li> Shaking it helped at first but then stopped, I randomly decided to try running it under cold water before use for a minute or two-completely fixed the problem.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who&#x27;s photo looked bleached out with every little imperfection showing.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but it even seemed to even out my skintone a little</li>
            <li> I get a little shiny but</li>
            <li> A little dab here</li>
            <li> /itch a little bit for a few minutes&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I do not like to wear heavy foundation.  </li>
            <li> few pumps with each use.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money</li>
            <li> It made my face look shiny and a scary pale white.</li>
            <li> It has never let me down!!</li>
            <li> To offset this however I mix it with a small amount of foundation and apply it with sponge.</li>
            <li> so I gave it a shot and thought if my face looked like an oil slick, so be it.  </li>
            <li> Even with using a small amount, I find if I wear it all day</li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> Pump out a small squirt of the Lumi Primer onto your hand and apply it around your face.</li>
            <li> From now on, when I&#x27;m unable to locate my favorites in the stores, I&#x27;m checking with Amazon, especially for those &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; colors of lipsticks and nail colors!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m way past the acne phase of life.</li>
            <li> and it also separated, not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I usually buy department store cosmetics but this works just as well.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal is usually dependable, but this is just so-so.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like using primer because I have dry skin in the worst way.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I found it on sale and am a sucker for anything brightening.</li>
            <li> That sucks because the product wont go on as evenly.</li>
            <li> NO MORE SEPARATION!  </li>
            <li> so I used a very small amount under my MAC foundation</li>
            <li> If you put it under your foundation it your skin look subtly radiant from within.</li>
            <li> NOT good as a highlighter in strategic places.  </li>
            <li> Not good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary of ordering this after reading some of the reviews of the bad odor and separation but my primer is odorless and doesn&#x27;t separate.</li>
            <li> it just looks bad, a weird combination of shine and glitter tone pale,..</li>
            <li> but I guess its been taken of the market.when you can&#x27;t afford the expensive ones this one is close to compare .So</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Within a couple months it was watery and clumpy, useless.</li>
            <li> Useless, I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> see lots of reviews thinking this primer is fairly useless because it gets watery &amp; separated after you have it for a while.  </li>
            <li> Dust on a very thin coat of translucent powder(use</li>
            <li> I have been using a very expensive product by Este Lauder, and I like it, but because of the price I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I satted using it as a base and then decided to onlu use it under and around my eyes</li>
            <li> I had a very bad experience with this product.</li>
            <li> And I HATED IT!</li>
            <li> Ihave a horrible tendency to throw out my receipts, so there I was, stuck with another primer, and miffed about it.</li>
            <li> Awful product.</li>
            <li> But the smell is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this after Estee Lauder discontinued &amp;#34;Spotlight&amp;#34;. I had high hopes for it and would give it 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t quite as &amp;#34;pearl white&amp;#34; tinted. If this were more of a luminous skin tone color I would love it more. To offset this however I mix it with a small amount of foundation and apply it with sponge. If you have extremely pale skin you may be able to avoid this step. On the plus side it does makes one&#x27;s skin smooth and helps to hide some pores and flaws.</li>
            <li> This is nice for a nice light highlight under makeup. too shiny as an all over face primer.</li>
            <li> I love this product . It is great for photos, gives your face a nice light.also good for everyday we a r&#x27;m gives the face nice light, look younger and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Love this primer!  Mix it with my foundation and then apply.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product all over the YouTube beauty community and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. I have a problem with my skin being dull in the morning and this definitely brightens my skin tone, but it&#x27;s a tad too watery for me. I usually only use it in places where I will put highlight on top of it and a thicker primer on the rest of my face. So it does what it says, but I just wish it was thicker and more similar to the other primers in consistency. I haven&#x27;t tried mixing it with my foundation with it being so watery, but it gives a really nice glow though when I use it underneath.</li>
            <li> when I opened and tried it - all that came out was watery liquid.  I shook several times and more watery liquid came out.  Finally on the 3-4th try I was able to get some lotion out.  Do not know if it froze at some point or what?</li>
            <li> Have had many people compliment me about the new &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; I am wearing. Gives a soft illusion around the eye area to counter the dark circle and wrinkles of a 45 year old. Put it on over my eye moisturizer.  Works great for me!</li>
            <li> Love this primer. I have dry skin and it makes me glow. Not oil looking at all. Very beautiful. Will be buying more when I use it all up</li>
            <li> Please, save yourself the misery and DO NOT BUY THIS! If you want a nice highlight on your face,.. this is not your product, not only will it make it look greasy it just looks bad, a weird combination of shine and glitter tone pale,.. I don&#x27;t even know who to explain it, just stay away and get something better, there are plenty of nice primers out there and highlighters, try the one stick from Benefit, trust me, you will never want to go cheap again! And if you cat afford it for all those ,.. a nice cheap one is from remmel,.. their primers are good!</li>
            <li> My skin is combination but more on oily side. I wanted to like this but it made dry patches on my face and my make up looked all dry. won&#x27;t use again.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my foundation for a glow i didn&#x27;t notice that much of a difference and its a watery product. I hard to open it and shake it every time I&#x27;m going to use it. If your dark skinned you need to use this with a light hand it will look a bit chalky, your blending skills have to be magic to fix it if you didn&#x27;t use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am truly satisfied. The package is small which is perfect for me once I do not use make-up daily and I will be able to use it before it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;expires,</li>
            <li> I knew what a primer was, but have NEVER used one.  I got a free sample of this Loreal Lumi Primer in the mail and almost tossed it, but I wasn&#x27;t leaving the house that day so I gave it a shot and thought if my face looked like an oil slick, so be it.  I don&#x27;t use moisturizers and I use oil control make up and face wash.  I put the entire sample on...rubs on like a light lotion.  The luminizing effect was instant...not sparkly, just bright.  I could have worn just this and looked great haha!  Then I put on my normal Cover Girl make up over it and wah lah!!!  It shines through the make up and my make up stayed put all day long.  I use a combo of cheap make up and expensive make up and it didn&#x27;t matter.  This stuff keeps it in place.  I would consider this a little pricier than most products I buy, but it is worth it.  I am so excited, I bought it the same day I sampled it.  AWESOME 5* product.</li>
            <li> i use this primer with foundation it gives nice good dewy look, i would recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a glowing makeup.</li>
            <li> Very runny and not a good primer. It made my face look shiny instead of luminous.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I work 12-16 hours shifts. It has never let me down!!</li>
            <li> This is probably the greatest drugstore primer I&#x27;ve ever found! I usually use higher end brands but after seeing this in an ad, I purchased one. The texture is wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t feel slippery, it&#x27;s like a light lotion with a luminizer mixed in. Some days, I wear this and a dusting of HD Finishing Powder and it&#x27;s all I need, but it is great under foundation, over foundation on the cheekbones, etc. I also use the Magic Lumi Concealer/Highlighter, another terrific product comparable to YSL Touche Eclat. Definitely give this a try, for the price it can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really starting to doubt that primers even work or I&#x27;m just completely oblivious to the results. I have very freckly fair skin that is somewhat hard to manage. Makeup is  nightmare for me. I have a love hate relationship with it. Overall I didn&#x27;t  notice much of a difference, but my outcome may be different from other because like I said, I have difficult skin to work with :]</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but I like E.L.F translucent powder.  A better value.  Just put on your make-up and put the powder selectively over it all.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller and product is excellent. Will order again!!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to be so shiny and kind of pearly - it&#x27;s supposed to be that way I guess but I won&#x27;t get it again.</li>
            <li> All products were good except the feather duster, which was a disappointment.  It did not pick up the dust as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> shake it well, put it on your face, and you got that j-lo glow going. beware if you have dry skin not to put in on your dry patches, it will look like death. moisturize well.</li>
            <li> It goes on like a light creme, it has a nice glow (not glitter, just shimmering glow). The texture is not like a foundation but, more like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I love the overall look and feel, so far it has had little to no side-effects (I have sensitive skin and if makeup disagrees with me then my face lets me know with in 5 minutes). I will be ordering this product again. I really love the look.</li>
            <li> I love this product - I mix it with my ordinary makeup and it illuminates my face.  It is not greasy and seems to stay on real well.</li>
            <li> Love this primer, I am biracial its perfect for me. I bought the primer normally in local stores but I guess its been taken of the market.when you can&#x27;t afford the expensive ones this one is close to compare .So i start ordering it from here. Will def. order again.</li>
            <li> I loved this product to go around my eyes. It really smoothed out my eye lids and added a little bit to my brow line before I put eye shadow on. I have some dry patches on one of my eye lids and it didn&#x27;t bother it a bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other users, I loved this product until it separated. I was able to use it for about a month and then one day it started pumping out water/oil and clumps of the pearly white color. Now it&#x27;s useless. I tried shaking and pumping a few more times but its now just clear liquid coming out. I can hear it slush around in the bottle when I shake it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. I am going to call L&#x27;Oreal Paris customer service directly and speak to them about this issue.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product but it separated fast, making it unusable. Within a couple months it was watery and clumpy, useless. Unless you&#x27;ll be using it up in a short amount of time, I&#x27;d suggest finding another.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I found it on sale and am a sucker for anything brightening. It is a little oily compared to my preferred primers, but what I&#x27;ve started doing is just putting a dab in the center of my forehead, under my eyes/high cheek bone area, and the center of my chin. It is perfection. I can use the same shade of foundation all over with this under it in those areas and it looks like I&#x27;ve used multiple tones of foundation to achieve a HAC look. Even with using a small amount, I find if I wear it all day my face is a lot oilier than if I used a different primer, which is why I&#x27;ve deducted a star. But honestly I don&#x27;t care-its perfect for like a date night or anything like that and I get tons of compliments on my skin when I use it. Worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also other reviewers talked about it separating, I&#x27;ve had it over a month and had originally stored it in a make up bag and noticed this too. Shaking it helped at first but then stopped, I randomly decided to try running it under cold water before use for a minute or two-completely fixed the problem. Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I picked this product up.  I&#x27;ve had it about 3 weeks.  I&#x27;ve used it under foundation as a primer, mixed with foundation, and as a highlighter on top of cheek bones.  Works well as primer - although if I apply too much foundation, it masks the glow. Product is very white and I feel makes my whole skin tone look a little lighter.  OK mixed with makeup - very watery and thins my foundation a lot so not as much coverage which is OK for more casual look.  NOT good as a highlighter in strategic places.  If I use it to highlight my cheeks or brow bone... it is so watery it \\&quot;washes off\\&quot; my foundation.  It is very watery.  Recently the product has \\&quot;separated\\&quot; it comes out of the tube part water, part oil, with white flecks in it.  GROSS and unusable.  If I shake it vigorously it is a little better.  But it is still very watery and somewhat separated.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews on the net of others saying same thing.  Product has not been exposed to heat or anything.  Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the glow that it gives is pretty - very pearly and soft NOT glittery or overdone at all.</li>
            <li> This is my first primer I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I love it. Makeup lasts and makes a huge difference with primer usage</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference,but I continued to use it because I wanted my skin to have a glow,but instead,I wound up looking shiny (a friend of mine made this comment) and my mother said it must be hot because I&#x27;m sweating bullets.Can we say embarrassing? :-/ I have oily skin as it is,so maybe it may work on someone who has drier skin.I did use sparingly and still a greasy mess.Oh we&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> You could buy more expensive - but why?  This works great.  I sometimes mix a dab of it with my foundation to give me a brighter look - but on weekends I just mix it with a dab of moisturizer and use on my entire face for a nice smooth and younger looking complexion.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!  Took years off my complextion.  Definitely going to use auto delivery for this one.  Awesome!!  I&#x27;m highly allergic to most products but this one didn&#x27;t irritate or clog my pores.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great under make-up product - with sunscreen already in it.</li>
            <li> One of the best, if not the best, primers I&#x27;ve ever used. Expensive for drugstore but totally worth it. It goes on the skin nicely and it moisturizes the skin. It&#x27;s just beautiful and luminous. So great.</li>
            <li> I think it minimized my pores a bit and my foundation goes on better with it but it seemed to make my face seem more ghostly white, I may have been using too much. I don&#x27;t have anything terrible to say about it or anything super great, it&#x27;s just average to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this product until I watched a makeup user on YouTube RAVE over the it and refer to it as her \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot;. So I went to buy it from Walgreens for $9.99 (which isn&#x27;t bad for a drug store illuminator since I spent $30 on the Nars illuminator which is amazing btw). I must say I absolutely love the packaging, its easy to apply and mess free so I used a very small amount under my MAC foundation (forgot which one). And I HATED IT! The product left my face looking pale and ashy underneath my foundation, I didn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;naturally flawless\\&quot; dewy look it claims to portray. I tried to work with the prpduct multiple times but it just didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m normally a product junky when it comes to makeup but this s*** had to be returned ASAP. I have combination skin (oily in some areas, dry in others) so maybe that could&#x27;ve been the reason it didn&#x27;t work for me, but other than that this wouldn&#x27;t be a recommended product from me.</li>
            <li> Not as luminous as I was expecting. I have heard a lot of good reviews on it though. I used it just as a primer under my foundation but I plan on using it a few other ways to see if my opinion may change. As of right now I would not highly suggest it.</li>
            <li> Super shimmery! It&#x27;s a nice primer, but just know that you will have that dewy look. It&#x27;s not matte at all.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this isn&#x27;t a primer that will set your make up to last, -it&#x27;s more a primer booster that gives a gorgeously flawless, cakeless fresh looking finish when you know the way to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Apply your moisturizer/sunscreen if you use them and let it set for 15 minutes or more. Apply your regular primer. (I love Monistat Anti-chafe gel- the right price and it works so well.) Dust on a very thin coat of translucent powder(use a stippler brush, if you have it). Pump out a small squirt of the Lumi Primer onto your hand and apply it around your face. Liittle goes a long way. But shake it first- just like it says!&lt;br /&gt;Now put on your foundation. Then take your brush and lightly buff your face, especially around creases and sides of nose and up into your hairline, down around jaw to neck to blend in. Finish up with the rest of your make up.&lt;br /&gt;The Lumi Primer gives just enough brightness and silky moisture to set a fresh and clean look to foundation and really covers up those pores.&lt;br /&gt;I work an afternoon shift, Put my face on, getting ready to go off to work; got a call asking me to work an overnight instead; went to bed to catch a few hours sleep, woke up with makeup as nice looking as though I&#x27;d just put it on.&lt;br /&gt;This little miracle seems expensive for the size, but it lasts a good while and earns it price every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;By the way this genius application wasn&#x27;t my original idea. I got the tip from a nice woman over at makeupalley.com who took the time to share- thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Loving it!</li>
            <li> This product brightens, I use it in specific areas. You can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality.&lt;br /&gt;No need to buy a more expensive brand to get same results.</li>
            <li> add this to foundation for a dewy, natural effect.  This is great.  People always think I have no base on…this is my secret!  Keeps you looking glow-y in pictures too.</li>
            <li> I use under a powder foundation and it still gives me a luminous glow even under it! my skin is sensitive to break outs when trying new products, not with this! it is great! love it!</li>
            <li> The primer was delivered on time and in perfect condition.  Did seem a little overkill to have such a small bottle in a box and not just a pouch.  Used product for wedding over weekend and made my make up look very even and surprisingly made a bigger difference than would have thought.</li>
            <li> The primer is one of the best I have use, it makes your make-up go on easier and it make your make-up look great</li>
            <li> i like it it gives ur skin that healthy glow under ur foundation</li>
            <li> This is a life-saver! I love a super dewy face, and nothing gives me that inner glow like Magic Lumi. Depending on how much time I have, I&#x27;ll either apply this to my moisturized face before my foundation (usually with a stippling brush), or I&#x27;ll mix it in with my foundation and apply that with a damp beauty blender. I think mixing it in with my foundation gives a more dewy look, but I like it both ways. I have a super dry face, and this doesn&#x27;t dry me out at all so that&#x27;s a huge plus. This absolutely should be in your collection if you like the dewy/glowy thing.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face the way some primers have!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year, and I do not use it as a primer. I use the L&#x27;Oreal BB primer and moisturizer. I first put on the BB primer, then I use cover girl olay with a light tint of foundation and then I use this over my make-up on my cheeks, chin and under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 years old and my skin looks like the skin of a 30 year old this way.&lt;br /&gt;Also I am not photogenic. I am one of those people who&#x27;s photo looked bleached out with every little imperfection showing. With this product over my make-up as a highlighter I now take skin perfect photos.&lt;br /&gt;This product is truly a god send.&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned it does sometime break down, but I find that it has no effect on the product. I still run it on in the watery state and get the same results. The product is not oily, my skin breaks out easily and this product does not cause any type of break out. It is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this lumi primer works good with my face my make up last all day without looking oily and I also use it as a highlighter on my cheek bones this is great!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing primer!!!!! I use this with my l&#x27;oreal true match lumi foundation. It gives a natural luminous glow without looking glittery or like a grease ball. I really don&#x27;t like using primer because I have dry skin in the worst way. This primer is great for those who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> When I could no longer find this product in my local stores, I thought I&#x27;d try checking with Amazon!  Absolutely amazing ... I found just what I was looking for and, of course ... more!  From now on, when I&#x27;m unable to locate my favorites in the stores, I&#x27;m checking with Amazon, especially for those &amp;#34;discontinued&amp;#34; colors of lipsticks and nail colors!  NOTE:  Ladies, I mix my L&#x27;Oreal BB Foundation Cream with a squirt of this primer and at 70 years young, I receive compliments as to how my skin appears so youthful and is so luminescent ... exactly the results I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this primer- it isn&#x27;t slippy like most silicone based primers, it soaks into your skin and smoothes, all while subtly illuminating your complexion. Great buy at only 10$.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have very fair skin and freckles and I do not like to wear heavy foundation.  I either mix this with my other primer of put the other primer on first and then add this on top and finish with mineral translucent matte powder.  I have used it by itself too and it works fine.  It lasts a long time and I have never had issues with it separating.</li>
            <li> This highlighter works great! I use to buy it from Target but haven&#x27;t been able to find it there for a while. The only thing that isn&#x27;t great is the shipping time since it takes a little longer than a normal Amazon shipment. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t last the whole day. I apply it in the morning and by mid-day you can&#x27;t really tell. Other than that it looks great.</li>
            <li> This was a suggestion for me and I really like it. It helps fill any lines, smoothes and creates an overall easier way to help contour and coverup</li>
            <li> LIGHT FOR WHEN YOU ARE ON THE GO. USE UNDER POWDER OR UNDER FOUNDATION. IT MAKES APPLICATION EASIER AND LASTING!! GIVES A GLOW IF YOU USE A DIME SIZE AMOUNT</li>
            <li> I do like this product! It makes a shiny glow but with foundation over&lt;br /&gt;it, it looks really good and it covers my pores. The only thing&lt;br /&gt;that I may have a issue with is that there isn&#x27;t enough?&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more because to me it seems you need&lt;br /&gt;a few pumps with each use.  Other then that I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> at first try, I put this on my hand and it gave a glowing luminous look.  Then I put it on and my make up completely covered any hint of \\&quot;glow\\&quot; Also, when I went to pull the plastic cap off, the entire top came out getting primer all over me, my make up bag and my sink so the packaging could also be better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my cheeks and under eye and my make up was falling off...</li>
            <li> Great product!  This is a nice dupe for the MAC Strobe Fluid (not the cream, the fluid).  It is less pink and more of a white pearl color, which is what I was wanting.  I have used this mixed in with my foundation, or used as a highlighter on top of my foundation.  It&#x27;s just gorgeous.  That said, it&#x27;s not that cheap for a drug store product.  MAC Strobe Fluid comes in a $10 size, so keep that in mind when shopping.</li>
            <li> Nice Primer but has little more shine to it than I like.</li>
            <li> This is a great primer for a great price! It is literally luminous when applied makes your make-up glow! It is is like a highlighter and primer in one.</li>
            <li> Use it as highlighter and mix it with my makeup to achieve a fresh dewy look, and use less make-up.</li>
            <li> I use this as a primer in the winter. I have oily skin so in the summer I already look &amp;#34;radiant&amp;#34; (oily) and don&#x27;t need to use this. But it makes makeup glide on so smooth. If you put it under your foundation it your skin look subtly radiant from within. I&#x27;ve also seen people use it on top of their foundation as a cheek bone highlight or mixed with their foundation to achieve an even more radiant glow.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected I thought it was matte primer this has a shimmer.</li>
            <li> I loved the bottle I bought locally but what I received from Amazon was mostly water.  What a waste of money</li>
            <li> I love this product. Gives a slight shimmer but more of a glow. I apply directly before my foundation. To those who claim it separates, the label clearly states to SHAKE BEFORE EACH APPLICATION. By doing so you&#x27;ll never worry about seperation of product. Don&#x27;t hesitate, order.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to use for my skin and this primer the best</li>
            <li> It peel of if used with certain moisturizers!</li>
            <li> I am obessed with this product. I use it under my bronzer and my make-up looks so much better. It brightens your complexion without being greasy. Highly reccommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> It is okay. I really do not like the consistency of the product. It is really shiny when you put on but it does cover my dark circles. Probably will not buy again but that is just me.</li>
            <li> I love this as a primer but it recently separated like another comment stated. The water oil and white are separated and even if i shake it it wont get much better.That sucks because the product wont go on as evenly. i still like it but loreal really needs to do something to keep the mixture emulsified</li>
            <li> Made my eyes burn and didn&#x27;t even help secure my makeup.</li>
            <li> Useful product.  Apply it before putting on L&#x27;Oreal Visible Lift Serum.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I use this primer all over my face. Some days the primer is all I use (with sunscreen). Other days I go over it with a powder or liquid foundation. It goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel like silk. I have oily skin and this primer doesn&#x27;t exacerbate that problem or cause breakouts. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> In theory, this product should have been an immediate favorite.  And it was, for about a week.  I loved the brightening and luminating effect it provides, and as a primer, it did help foundation last longer and apply more evenly.  BUT about a week into using this, my skin protested with tiny acne all over... I&#x27;m way past the acne phase of life. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout like that in many years.  My skin has become more sensitive as I age, and much dryer.  So I was hoping this would bring a little youthful dewiness and glow back to my face.  It did, but also irritated my skin too much.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, I recommend this product highly.  If you do have sensitive skin, try the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Primer instead.  That one is a little less illuminating, but very hydrating and it does add some brightening effect. I wish this would have worked for me, but I found one that my skin likes more…</li>
            <li> I also just purchased this 7/13/2012 and by 7/18/2012 it became watery...the white separates from the oil, I thought it might just need a shake but that didn&#x27;t work either. I bought two so then I opened the unused one to see if it was doing the same thing and it also separated, not sure what happened but I still have the receipt so i&#x27;m returning. I&#x27;m so bummed because i found this in &#x27;style&#x27; magazine and tried the sample and was thrilled, but now this &#x27;separating&#x27; thing isn&#x27;t going to cut it! boo to Magic Lumi</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. I&#x27;m a very busy licensed esthetician, have several products at my disposal and this is one of my favorites. There are other similar products out there, many for a lot more coin than this one. This is my favorite. It gives my skin a radiant, luminous glow. I have used it for about 3 years and LOVE it. Like a few of the other reviews, I have noticed some separation on occasion. Products do that sometimes, big whoop, just shake it a little.</li>
            <li> Nice highlighter. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. I don&#x27;t do touch ups during the day so I don&#x27;t know whether it needs to be reapplied or not.</li>
            <li> Useless, I didn&#x27;t see any results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone over 50 years without knowing I needed a primer. I love the brightness it gives my complexion. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> worked better than i expected!!</li>
            <li> Adds a beautiful sheen and highlight to all looks. Love this product. I never want to run out.</li>
            <li> Very luminous. Made my face seem super oily and my makeup would slide off during the day. I gave it to a friend who has dryer skin than me and she loves it. Depends what kind of skin you have and the look you&#x27;re going for I guess.</li>
            <li> Slight irritation since I&#x27;m not really used to wearing it but that&#x27;s just me.  Helps lessen the look of dark circles under eyes.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product and liked how it looked when applied in several on line videos.. I don;t use a lot..  a small dot really goes a long way ... I like the look  and extend it from under my eye along my cheekbone.It really brightens my eye overall and the cost is reasonable. Easy to carry in my makeup bag and pumps out easily. I use a brush or my fingertips to gently blend it in.</li>
            <li> So impressed with this product! I am unsure why they chose to market it as a primer; I don&#x27;t find it to be particularly useful for that purpose. However, I mix a half pump of this with my Clinique tinted moisturizer, and my skin looks so flawless! I highly recommend everyone try this method; the luminosity and dewy-ness it gives the skin when combined with your foundation or tinted moisturizer is so stunning. I moved to Colorado this year, and our dry, zero-humidity winter is causing my skin to look pretty dull. This product is an instant pick-me-up for my face; the effect is very noticeable. I work in a dermatology clinic, and even the doctors commented on how healthy my skin has been looking lately! I&#x27;ve been using top-of-the-line skin care products for awhile now, but this is the only thing I&#x27;ve changed recently, so I know this is what they are referring to. I know a lot of people also use it as a highlighter, but I am not savvy enough to do this method without looking a bit too shiny; I find that it looks most natural and flattering for me just mixing with my foundation and smoothing on the whole face. I really cannot speak highly enough of the effect this has on my skin. And the price is right; especially considering a bottle lasts me so long. I will continue to repurchase as long as they make it! I honestly think it&#x27;s my HG product of 2013.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have older skin and this gives my complexion a youthful glow.  I like to apply this around the eye area for highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a little &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; on the areas you want to highlight.  I put it under my foundation and my skin goes from drab to FAB!</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be!!! Love it!!! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I find it mixes with. Y makeup for a luminous finish.&lt;br /&gt;It stays smooth for a long time.  This is a very sneaky way to force a response.</li>
            <li> Bought this with my Amazon prime and when opened and used the liquid separates out of the nozzle!  I shook it and it still separates. Tried to return it but Amazon will not let you for some reason. They say it is not returnable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m jumping the gun a bit, but like this well enough to get a little excited about it and for now I am going to give this 5 stars. I bought this by accident yesterday when I meant to get the L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Concealer. I used it for the first time this morning and I felt that it made my face look brighter and smoother. It went on beautifully and made my skin feel so smooth. I have been using a very expensive product by Este Lauder, and I like it, but because of the price I use it sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I accidentally got this and my first impression was so good, I&#x27;m going to go ahead and order the concealer.</li>
            <li> Wow! this primer when used on the whole face mixed with foundation , literally illuminates ur skin. Best to use this sparingly other wise it looks like your face has a veil of glitter snow on ur face.and youll look too x mas winter wonderland.. Better as a Highlight for nose, browbone and under eyes. or mixed to lighten up ur foundation.&lt;br /&gt;was shipped fast! and in excellent packaging!&lt;br /&gt;would buy from this seller again!</li>
            <li> Supposed to receive product every 2 month I have only recieved once Aug 7th</li>
            <li> Bought it for my sister she loved it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  I&#x27;m 64 and use it under my foundation.  My daughter even asked me what I was using because my skin looked so young and fresh.  When I first bought it I didn&#x27;t use it right away and, yes, it did separate.  But I was very clever and shook it up several times and it&#x27;s fine now.</li>
            <li> This is a great proudct for use a highlighter. I satted using it as a base and then decided to onlu use it under and around my eyes and it really gives you that bright look. Worth the buy for sure</li>
            <li> Love wish I would of known its super small need to get a bigger size leaves skin luminous</li>
            <li> This is a white cream that dries to a translucent shine. But it has a tendency to highlight imperfections, so I avoid using it if I have a zit or other issue.</li>
            <li> Bought this at my local drugstore accidentally. I was in a hurry, not paying much attention, and somehow didn&#x27;t notice this was a primer. I thought it was a highlighter! Ihave a horrible tendency to throw out my receipts, so there I was, stuck with another primer, and miffed about it. Set it aside for weeks before I finally decided to give it a shot. And loved it! It gave my face a gorgeous glow! Maybe it&#x27;s just my imagination, but it even seemed to even out my skintone a little bit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, some cons do come with it:&lt;br /&gt;1) Made my skin tingle/itch a little bit for a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;2) After a while (like other reviewers have said) it separated. Now, instead of one smooth item, I have to deal with a clear liquid and a white one, and mix them up in my hands first in order to get an even coverage. This makes for a messier application. And, despite my shaking the container like a mad-woman, I could not get it to rejoin into one item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of caution, I would not recommend this ti someone with SUPER OILY skin, but yes to anyone with dry/normal or with a teeny bit of oiliness.</li>
            <li> This works beautifully. I usually buy department store cosmetics but this works just as well. Def recommend to anyone looking for an illuminating effect</li>
            <li> I really like  this product but I will use it more for highlite my face. Have too much reflection for the whole face. Of course my personal taste.</li>
            <li> Awful product. It made my face look shiny and a scary pale white. It was also greasy! I cant even wear my coverup over it. I had to first wash off the Primer. I had a very bad experience with this product. Good luck to you.</li>
            <li> Great to mix in with foundation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a primer for the first time &amp; didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, so I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s.  I love this product - really adds a glow to my complexion &amp; additional moisture (I&#x27;m 57 so need all the moisture &amp; glow I can get). I would highly recommend this product!  For the price compared to higher priced department store products, I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  It arrived on time -will buy more of this product when I run out!</li>
            <li> I love this primer!! Its not expensive and works perfectly..</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  Love primers in general, but this primer gives you a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Not good for oily skin. I have combo skin, and this stuff looks beautiful for about 20-45 mins. Then it&#x27;s oil slick central. It&#x27;s really gross looking. I get a little shiny but this looks like I dipped my face in oil. And I have to blot and blot and blot. I bet this would be amazing on a dry skin person! It does look really pretty at first!</li>
            <li> As reviews have noted, the water, oil, and white in this product separated after only 2 normal uses.  Loreal should add something to keep the mixture emulsified</li>
            <li> I had forgotten I had this &amp;#34;primer&amp;#34; - it&#x27;s probably been close to a year since I last used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see lots of reviews thinking this primer is fairly useless because it gets watery &amp; separated after you have it for a while.  Yes, it does eventually separate - yuck!  Just run warm water over the container, for about 1/2 min to 1 minute.  Then shake the bottle and voila!  NO MORE SEPARATION!  It&#x27;s back to perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s kind of odd that it&#x27;s considered a primer tho.  I use it more as a highlighter for my mature skin.  (Maybe it is a good primer, but it&#x27;s nothing like the other brands I&#x27;ve used, which are thicker and seem to lay a better canvas for foundation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love this product tho!  I use it simply to brighten different areas of face.  Eyes, chin, top of cheek bones, etc.  I just pat this on with my fingers AFTER foundation (I use the Real Techniques sponge to apply foundation - I find it to be the absolute best method for applying different types of foundation!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this as a highlighter!  It&#x27;s not sparkly at all.  And the &amp;#34;separating&amp;#34; is super easy and quick to fix.</li>
            <li> It it light weight and makes my skin look brighter. That is what I was looking for. My makeup also seems to go on smoother. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I need a little extra glow so I add this to L&#x27;Oreal Paris Magic Skin Beautifier BB Cream. Certainly brightens up an old face!</li>
            <li> bought this at a local drug store and paid almost double than amazon does, but got half off with another Loreal product........believe it or not i asked the girl in the cosmetics department about concealers,etc. i don&#x27;t need the standard eye concealer, and she recommended this and i just am liking it very much! goes on smooth, whitish at first, blends easily around my entire eye area and POP goes your eyes with or without make up or eye make up~perfect for me because i rarely wear more than sunscreen and a bit of eyeliner/lip stain/gloss. i would recommend you try this, you can always return it.</li>
            <li> love it love it, i mix it with my liquid fundation, and it makes my faces looks brighter and smoother, I will also add a shimmer powder on after, then im good to good, with no other make up, look freshed, and glowy, great for a casual day off.</li>
            <li> Nice for evening or formal occasions.  Will probably last me a long time.  Depends on your life style.</li>
            <li> Normally I love this product, but had to get a refund because when I went to use it just water squirted out, even after shaking the heck out of the bottle.  So I will not try to buy this on line.  As for the product itself, I highly recommend it as it is great and well worth the money.  I am just advising you NOT to purchase on line because you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price and amazing product!!!!! thank you</li>
            <li> I would like for it to be a bit more shiny or dewy.</li>
            <li> This is a new must have for me! I adore it! I have sensitive, dry, super pale translucent skin and this works wonders. I mix a touch with my foundation for a dewy look and other times I use it just as a highlighter. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for oily skin, unless only as a cheek bone highlighter. But for dry skin it&#x27;s versital!</li>
            <li> love this primer, not oily and leaves skin feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay primer. You don&#x27;t see any lumosity through your makeup. It helps a tiny bit to add it to your foundation after you&#x27;ve applied it to your face. L&#x27;oreal is usually dependable, but this is just so-so.</li>
            <li> I will admit that this product does what it says. It does smooth out my skin and leaves a nice pallet for my foundation. But the smell is awful. It smells like I&#x27;m putting on a chemical mask. I cant get beyond the smell</li>
            <li> I was a little leary of ordering this after reading some of the reviews of the bad odor and separation but my primer is odorless and doesn&#x27;t separate. I have never used a primer and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. It gives my skin the perfect amount of glimmer to hide the fine lines and it evens out my skin tone nicely. I wear it with or without foundation. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi. It&#x27;s easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve found the best way to apply it yet. I&#x27;ve tried applying it a few different ways and at different sequences in my makeup application, and at different amounts, and I&#x27;m still waiting to see it glow. I may be adding too much foundation on top of it, but I really do enjoy the lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> I love this primer! It makes my skin glow and is one of my new favorites!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace Lancome discontinued item. Was not disappointed at all. Highly recommend. Not heavy. Goes on smoothly and adds just enough natural glow to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have already bought and used 15 bottles since 4 years. and still using it. Love this product, hope company don&#x27;t change or discontinue.</li>
            <li> Good primer. Gives a slight bit of glow.  doesn&#x27;t make my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This is okay as a primer, but great as a highlighter. A little dab here and there is really all you need under foundation for a little glow without ending up with a face full of sparkles.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal True Match Lumi Healthy Luminous Makeup used with L&#x27;Oreal Magic Lumi Primer is a perfect combination. Good coverage and color with a soft natural glow without being obvious. Used together you have long lasting coverage.</li>
