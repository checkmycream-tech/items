            <li>Great colors that should work for anyone.  </li>
            <li>I am olive skin tone and found all colors are great on me.  </li>
            <li>Has great color for the summer.</li>
            <li>A great product for newbies to contouring.</li>
            <li>What a great set.</li>
            <li>Love this palette!!</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Get your matching color (i.e. your own concealer, luminizer, brightener, blush, etc.) and follow the cards!</li>
            <li>The colors are great for my skin tone (fair/medium fair).</li>
            <li>and she couldn&#x27;t wait to get her own as well!</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Is good size to have in</li>
            <li>The powder blush is good,  fairly pigmented.</li>
            <li>The luminizer is good.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m assuming I did good.</li>
            <li>I wanted to hold off reviewing this product until I had a good chance to try it out.</li>
            <li>I tried this on my daughter and she loved it as well</li>
            <li>This has everything you need (if you&#x27;re fair to medium skin).</li>
            <li>I loved, loved, loved the concealer.</li>
            <li>The colors are good for my skin tone and it goes on the skin very smoothly!</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the palette.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, helpful that it came with picture cards for 3 make up looks, wish it had more and maybe</li>
            <li>Good warm tone.</li>
            <li>and it has taken me years to find the right balance of skincare to get it to look flawless.</li>
            <li>So glad I invested!</li>
            <li>As someone that didn&#x27;t start wearing makeup full time until about a year ago it was safe to say I was not the best at picking out product</li>
            <li>Loving Stila \\&quot;the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m honestly waiting to have an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li>The bronzer is so light, it looks good almost any time of year.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to have some cards of instruction, but I love the way there is a great concealer, and a browser with a nice shimmer application for my eyes.</li>
            <li>The concealer is the best I have tried and the blush really lasts and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>SO EASY!</li>
            <li>The concealer is VERY light coverage.</li>
            <li>You apply all your cream based products, then top with your powder products.  </li>
            <li>Putting creams on top of powder causes a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; result.  </li>
            <li>The cream blush and cream illuminator, along with the technique cards, ends up with some cream on top of powder.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have a use for all the products, I&#x27;m really in love with this palette.</li>
            <li>I just got this and cannot express how much I love this palette.</li>
            <li>When I want some more color, I add my bronzer.</li>
            <li>My one concern is the fact that most of these items are creamy (except bronzer veil and powder blush).</li>
            <li>I love the bronzer because it&#x27;s not overly bronze</li>
            <li>and it would take many an application to make it unnatural looking.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments since I started using this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you have about a months supply.</li>
            <li>and I know it wil get quicker as I use it more.</li>
            <li>I love this and use it every day.</li>
            <li>Love this brand.</li>
            <li>This product dries my skin ever more leaving flakes and lines where applied.  </li>
            <li>I got more compliments using this product than I ever have had on anything else.</li>
            <li>I love two faced cosmetics...</li>
            <li>one of the many things I am adding to my collection</li>
            <li>I mostly use the day glow instruction card</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>And I love that it comes with highlight and luminzer.</li>
            <li>love this stuff!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have even gifted it to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;looks</li>
            <li>I love all of their products especially this because the color goes well with any skin type and has perfect textures.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with the instruction cards too.</li>
            <li>Bronzer is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Everything is so easy and smooth to apply.</li>
            <li>Well, summer is over, and I am half way through the concealer and highlighter - the two best features of this product.</li>
            <li>The best part are the little tutorial cards that teach you how to apply.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Too Faced products.</li>
            <li>The cards are a great tutorial guide for three different looks.</li>
            <li>Great product and definitely brightens your face.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li>This product gives your face a natural look and feels good on your face.  </li>
            <li>a brush to go along with it, but other then that works great and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Again, there are three looks to this kit: Classic Radiance, which is more \\&quot;made up\\&quot; or more polished because both blushes are used.</li>
            <li>This is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>(Apply your foundation first, of course, if you need more coverage.)</li>
            <li>that mix pretty well together to give you a bit more varieties.</li>
            <li>Natural and nice for your purse</li>
            <li>Honestly, if the colors don&#x27;t match you (i.e. too light or too dark), the cards are still indispensable!</li>
            <li>It gives you such a youthful glow and with the cards that show you how to apply it for different looks are great!  </li>
            <li>You can look super glamorous or just a quick application when in a hurry, all the possibilities are there.</li>
            <li>This natural palette is great, especially for light contouring.</li>
            <li>Looks natural, yet polished, very light on my face, and quick application.</li>
            <li>was worth the price to leard what the cards taught me.</li>
            <li>and I like to get fresh make-up every 6months.</li>
            <li>Extremely useful palette.</li>
            <li>The price is about $20 over what it&#x27;s really worth.</li>
            <li>I am not very adventurous with make up and this product shows you exactly how to look great.</li>
            <li>my face looks so fresh and clean and glowy in such a nice natural way.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a nice, subtle healthy look</li>
            <li>but I found there&#x27;s not enough of the concealer and brightened as I use more of those two.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying cream products.</li>
            <li>The colors work on many different skin tones.</li>
            <li>love that it gave the instruction cards to help the clueless (me) learn to mix and blend colors for different looks.</li>
            <li>I used it first time this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blends pretty well.</li>
            <li>The smell is like old cheap expired kid makeup and crayons.</li>
            <li>Overall I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the instructions included for different contouring looks.</li>
            <li>I love this so much and would definitely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li>The bronzer has a nice slightly dark brown color.</li>
            <li>The products are easy to apply and last all day.</li>
            <li>I like it very</li>
            <li>There is just a fresh natural glow.</li>
            <li>Is ok not very impress.</li>
            <li>Dries very powder like.</li>
            <li>This is even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>very stylishly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The concealer didn&#x27;t really work well with my skin</li>
            <li>This collection is everything that I need to emphasize, minimize, and brighten my whole look.</li>
            <li>I find that I use the concealer way too fast..</li>
            <li>Honestly, this makes me look like I lost a few pounds.</li>
            <li>I was particularly tickled by the iridescent blush that really works when you blend it with the iridescent highlighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to add a bit of color prior to head out for a busy day.</li>
            <li>I can get better make for less.</li>
            <li>It comes with three instruction cards that are extremely useful and really show you how to use the different products together.</li>
            <li>There are multiple cards with different looks from your basic daily look to more adventurous.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, and others in the Too Faced line.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>The second look is the Day Glow, which is my favorite and the most natural or subtle of the three.</li>
            <li>I did not use the bronzing veil too much, but that&#x27;s probably because I already had a natural tan going without needing any help from this product.</li>
            <li>but I wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the blush choices (powder and a thick lip gloss liquid like blush.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>&quot; palette.&lt;br /&gt;Update -  WOW!  </li>
            <li>natural radiance is correct!</li>
            <li>I have on these two products, light touch with the eyeliner, some mascara and a little finishing power.</li>
            <li>The cream blush is super pigmented so be careful!</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve tried all three looks in three days.</li>
            <li>If you want your makeup to look natural, then go with this.</li>
            <li>I am a 36 year old with dry-ish skin.  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of the whole deal is the fact that the makers of Too Faced are basically forcing you to buy the whole palette again if you run out of concealer (which I will soon enough!)</li>
            <li>natural, gives skin a radiance work alone over BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re new to contouring.</li>
            <li>Too Faced changed all their packaging so you can get the same products for cheaper by getting these ones in the old packaging online.</li>
            <li>I will say i don&#x27;t use the wet blush as much because I use the NARS blush stick.</li>
            <li>From day time to a more dramatic night time.</li>
            <li>its so small, but its worth it, IMO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was worried the cream blush would be too dark, but I was pleasantly surprised, once you blend it, it looks totally natural.</li>

            <li> Looks natural, yet polished, very light on my face, and quick application.</li>
            <li> was worth the price to leard what the cards taught me.</li>
            <li> and I like to get fresh make-up every 6months.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful palette.</li>
            <li> The price is about $20 over what it&#x27;s really worth.</li>
            <li> I am not very adventurous with make up and this product shows you exactly how to look great.</li>
            <li> my face looks so fresh and clean and glowy in such a nice natural way.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a nice, subtle healthy look</li>
            <li> but I found there&#x27;s not enough of the concealer and brightened as I use more of those two.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying cream products.</li>
            <li> The colors work on many different skin tones.</li>
            <li> love that it gave the instruction cards to help the clueless (me) learn to mix and blend colors for different looks.</li>
            <li> I used it first time this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> The smell is like old cheap expired kid makeup and crayons.</li>
            <li> Overall I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the instructions included for different contouring looks.</li>
            <li> I love this so much and would definitely recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> The bronzer has a nice slightly dark brown color.</li>
            <li> The products are easy to apply and last all day.</li>
            <li> I like it very</li>
            <li> There is just a fresh natural glow.</li>
            <li> Is ok not very impress.</li>
            <li> Dries very powder like.</li>
            <li> This is even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> very stylishly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The concealer didn&#x27;t really work well with my skin</li>
            <li> This collection is everything that I need to emphasize, minimize, and brighten my whole look.</li>
            <li> I find that I use the concealer way too fast..</li>
            <li> Honestly, this makes me look like I lost a few pounds.</li>
            <li> I was particularly tickled by the iridescent blush that really works when you blend it with the iridescent highlighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to add a bit of color prior to head out for a busy day.</li>
            <li> I can get better make for less.</li>
            <li> It comes with three instruction cards that are extremely useful and really show you how to use the different products together.</li>
            <li> There are multiple cards with different looks from your basic daily look to more adventurous.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, and others in the Too Faced line.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The second look is the Day Glow, which is my favorite and the most natural or subtle of the three.</li>
            <li> I did not use the bronzing veil too much, but that&#x27;s probably because I already had a natural tan going without needing any help from this product.</li>
            <li> but I wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the blush choices (powder and a thick lip gloss liquid like blush.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> &quot; palette.&lt;br /&gt;Update -  WOW!  </li>
            <li> natural radiance is correct!</li>
            <li> I have on these two products, light touch with the eyeliner, some mascara and a little finishing power.</li>
            <li> The cream blush is super pigmented so be careful!</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve tried all three looks in three days.</li>
            <li> If you want your makeup to look natural, then go with this.</li>
            <li> I am a 36 year old with dry-ish skin.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of the whole deal is the fact that the makers of Too Faced are basically forcing you to buy the whole palette again if you run out of concealer (which I will soon enough!)</li>
            <li> natural, gives skin a radiance work alone over BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re new to contouring.</li>
            <li> Too Faced changed all their packaging so you can get the same products for cheaper by getting these ones in the old packaging online.</li>
            <li> I will say i don&#x27;t use the wet blush as much because I use the NARS blush stick.</li>
            <li> From day time to a more dramatic night time.</li>
            <li> its so small, but its worth it, IMO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was worried the cream blush would be too dark, but I was pleasantly surprised, once you blend it, it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> As I get older (I am 59), I have been consciously trying to wear less makeup, but I still want to look sharp every day at work.</li>
            <li> The price is so high for what little you get.</li>
            <li> Seriously if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product DONT BE - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Apparently \\&quot;salmon\\&quot; or \\&quot;orange\\&quot; correctors are all the rage now for hiding dark under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> I found this look a little harder to do, but still looks natural.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has little cards that have guides and show you different ways to contour!</li>
            <li> I can throw it in my bag or travel case and the magnetic closure keeps it closed.</li>
            <li> You find yellow and green correctors (concealers) everywhere, but the oranges are rare and expensive.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> There is no exact match of the concealer or highlighter in any of their other products that is separately sold.</li>
            <li> Just dab on the creme blush to the  dark under eye area, then follow up with you</li>
            <li> The last look is the Supermodel Sculpt, which intended to carve out some serious bones...</li>
            <li> I use just a little bit of the cream blush (I don&#x27;t use the powder) on the cheek apples and swoosh it up to temples.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the bronzer too often because it&#x27;s a little too shimmery in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product. Goes on well.</li>
            <li> Great product but I found there&#x27;s not enough of the concealer and brightened as I use more of those two. The bronze veil is basically useless. I just use the concealer, brightened and blush.</li>
            <li> This palette is great, packaging is great I can throw it in my bag or travel case and the magnetic closure keeps it closed.</li>
            <li> Always looking for a perfect palette; close, but not quite.  Great colors that should work for anyone.  Helpful cards for application (I was always taught card 3 style for us \\&quot;round face\\&quot; girls).  However, I also learned years ago that you never mix/inter-mingle creams and powders.  You apply all your cream based products, then top with your powder products.  Putting creams on top of powder causes a \\&quot;cakey\\&quot; result.  The cream blush and cream illuminator, along with the technique cards, ends up with some cream on top of powder.  If those two products had been powder (with just cream concealer) this would be an ideal palette.  Loving Stila \\&quot;the natural\\&quot; palette.&lt;br /&gt;Update -  WOW!  Found the PERFECT use for the creme blush.  Apparently \\&quot;salmon\\&quot; or \\&quot;orange\\&quot; correctors are all the rage now for hiding dark under eye circles.  You find yellow and green correctors (concealers) everywhere, but the oranges are rare and expensive.  Just dab on the creme blush to the  dark under eye area, then follow up with you usual routine: concealer, brightener, whatever you like. Now that I have a use for all the products, I&#x27;m really in love with this palette.</li>
            <li> I just got this and cannot express how much I love this palette. I am one of those people who uses very little makeup. Always my eyeliner and lipstick, though. When I want some more color, I add my bronzer. I kept reading about how wonderful this item is and had to order it to try it out. And it has been a wonderful surprise. There are three looks to this palette, each explained visually on instruction cards. Can&#x27;t go wrong. Each step is numbered and coded to each item in the palette. Honestly, if the colors don&#x27;t match you (i.e. too light or too dark), the cards are still indispensable! Get your matching color (i.e. your own concealer, luminizer, brightener, blush, etc.) and follow the cards! If you are medium to olive skin tone, this should work. I am olive skin tone and found all colors are great on me.  To me, this kit has been a blessing in that it has taught me what luminizers, concealers, highlighters are supposed to do and how to apply them. Prior to this kit, I never even considered those things to be of any use. Now, I get it. I have been missing out!  Again, there are three looks to this kit: Classic Radiance, which is more \\&quot;made up\\&quot; or more polished because both blushes are used. Honestly, this makes me look like I lost a few pounds. The second look is the Day Glow, which is my favorite and the most natural or subtle of the three. The last look is the Supermodel Sculpt, which intended to carve out some serious bones...I found this look a little harder to do, but still looks natural.  My one concern is the fact that most of these items are creamy (except bronzer veil and powder blush). I am hoping I won&#x27;t break out. I have acne prone skin and it has taken me years to find the right balance of skincare to get it to look flawless. I figure that if I DO break out, I can find similar items for acne prone skin and follow the cards. I&#x27;m telling you, these cards are priceless!!  So far, I&#x27;ve tried all three looks in three days. All different. All beautiful.</li>
            <li> The cards are a great tutorial guide for three different looks. I loved, loved, loved the concealer. (it&#x27;s all gone now) but I wasn&#x27;t to thrilled with the blush choices (powder and a thick lip gloss liquid like blush. I love the bronzer because it&#x27;s not overly bronze and it would take many an application to make it unnatural looking. I will be searching for the concealer by itself, however.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS!!! I got it yesterday and just tried it this morning. AMAZING! Everything is so easy and smooth to apply. Especially the cremes. This is my first time trying cream products. I thought it would be messy and difficult. -Not the case! SO EASY! I highly recommend. Especially if you&#x27;re new to contouring.</li>
            <li> Too Faced changed all their packaging so you can get the same products for cheaper by getting these ones in the old packaging online. Great product and definitely brightens your face. Easy to use with the instruction cards too.</li>
            <li> The colors work on many different skin tones. The products are easy to apply and last all day. I appreciate the instructions cards.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Compact and easy to use!!!  The colors are good for my skin tone and it goes on the skin very smoothly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Too Faced products. If you want your makeup to look natural, then go with this.</li>
            <li> I love this so much and would definitely recommend it!!!! I have gotten so many compliments since I started using this.</li>
            <li> love that it gave the instruction cards to help the clueless (me) learn to mix and blend colors for different looks. The price is so high for what little you get. If you do your face daily (I do not) I&#x27;m sure you have about a months supply. I can get better make for less. was worth the price to leard what the cards taught me. Will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this product but, was disappointed at how oily everything looked and how awful it smelled.  It is as if this product sat on a shelf for years before it arrived at my door.  The only portions of it that I can use are the bronzer and the matte blush...but, I don&#x27;t think I will...</li>
            <li> Product meets my every expectation.  Very natural looking.  This product gives your face a natural look and feels good on your face.  Would recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Works on any skin tone.  So glad I invested! Use it on a daily basis. Won&#x27;t have to buy anything else for a while!</li>
            <li> After reading some reviews I decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;I had never used this product before &amp; after some trial &amp; error with application I like it very much.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way. I like the: colors, the instructions, &amp; the way the product has lasted.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product &amp; I would purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the reviews and I like to get fresh make-up every 6months. I used with Too Faced Cosmetics Primed and Poreless, 1 Ounce. I used it first time this morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with instructions for 3 applications. From day time to a more dramatic night time. It took very little time for all the steps and I know it wil get quicker as I use it more. I settled on the middle step and even though I applied the 5 products it looks like I am not wearing any make-up. There is just a fresh natural glow. I have on these two products, light touch with the eyeliner, some mascara and a little finishing power. Looks natural, yet polished, very light on my face, and quick application.So for me it ticked all the boxes.</li>
            <li> Is ok not very impress. Is good size to have in you&#x27;re purse all in one in case you need to re-touch.</li>
            <li> Has great color for the summer. The concealer is the best I have tried and the blush really lasts and is easy to apply. It comes with a diagram which shows you how to put it on.. I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Another TooFaced purchase gone AWESOME! Love this palette!! I&#x27;ve been using it every day and will continue to do so-- my face looks so fresh and clean and glowy in such a nice natural way. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I love this and use it every day. The brightener goes on inside and outside the corners of my eyes, and keeps me from looking like a zombie.  The bronzer is so light, it looks good almost any time of year. I use just a little bit of the cream blush (I don&#x27;t use the powder) on the cheek apples and swoosh it up to temples. And I&#x27;m done!  (Apply your foundation first, of course, if you need more coverage.) I always have a back up of this on hand; I&#x27;m worried that it might be discontinued, and there&#x27;s nothing else out there that I like as well. Highly recommend this product, and others in the Too Faced line.</li>
            <li> Natural and nice for your purse</li>
            <li> Love this brand. Extremely useful palette. Perfect for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Bronzer is pretty nice. Good warm tone. The powder blush is good,  fairly pigmented. The cream blush is super pigmented so be careful! It blends pretty well. The concealer is VERY light coverage. Don&#x27;t expect to cover blemishes or scars. Dries very powder like. The luminizer is good. The brightener is not great, which is disappointing because it&#x27;s the whole reason I bought the pallet.  The hugest complaints I have after trying the product is the price and THE SMELL! The smell is like old cheap expired kid makeup and crayons. I&#x27;m honestly waiting to have an allergic reaction. The price is about $20 over what it&#x27;s really worth.</li>
            <li> The colors are great for my skin tone (fair/medium fair). I was worried the cream blush would be too dark, but I was pleasantly surprised, once you blend it, it looks totally natural. I don&#x27;t use the bronzer too often because it&#x27;s a little too shimmery in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the palette.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, helpful that it came with picture cards for 3 make up looks, wish it had more and maybe a brush to go along with it, but other then that works great and lasts most of the day. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I am a 36 year old with dry-ish skin.  This product dries my skin ever more leaving flakes and lines where applied.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this non stop. She likes it so i&#x27;m assuming I did good. Hopefully this helps the rest of yall</li>
            <li> I wanted to hold off reviewing this product until I had a good chance to try it out. Well, summer is over, and I am half way through the concealer and highlighter - the two best features of this product. I did not use the bronzing veil too much, but that&#x27;s probably because I already had a natural tan going without needing any help from this product. I was particularly tickled by the iridescent blush that really works when you blend it with the iridescent highlighter. I got more compliments using this product than I ever have had on anything else. It is truly a quality product provided you know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside of the whole deal is the fact that the makers of Too Faced are basically forcing you to buy the whole palette again if you run out of concealer (which I will soon enough!) or highlighter. There is no exact match of the concealer or highlighter in any of their other products that is separately sold. Too bad.</li>
            <li> This is even better than I expected.  It gives you such a youthful glow and with the cards that show you how to apply it for different looks are great!  I tried this on my daughter and she loved it as well and she couldn&#x27;t wait to get her own as well!</li>
            <li> I love two faced cosmetics...their products are awesome...I saw this and had to get it...one of the many things I am adding to my collection</li>
            <li> these shades are universal I think for any skin tone.  Great for a summer glow! I definitely recommend.  I mostly use the day glow instruction card and it&#x27;s a nice, subtle healthy look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. As someone that didn&#x27;t start wearing makeup full time until about a year ago it was safe to say I was not the best at picking out product and/or glamorizing my face very stylishly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After receiving this palette I literally have become obsessed. It&#x27;s been about 4 months and I have plenty left. I will say i don&#x27;t use the wet blush as much because I use the NARS blush stick. I use the concealer and bronzer daily. The best part are the little tutorial cards that teach you how to apply. Seriously if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product DONT BE - it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is such an amazing product! In fact it&#x27;s probably the best beauty buy I&#x27;ve ever made. I wanted to find a bronzer and blush in one and then I came across this. Even though it is quite pricy I decided to give it a go because I have never tried the too faced brand before and because it also has a concealer, a luminize and a brightener as well a bronzer and two blushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It comes with three instruction cards that are extremely useful and really show you how to use the different products together. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that the powder blush gets in the brightener sometimes. Overall I love this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This has everything you need (if you&#x27;re fair to medium skin). The bronzer has a nice slightly dark brown color. There&#x27;s two blushes, one cream and one powder, that mix pretty well together to give you a bit more varieties. And I love that it comes with highlight and luminzer. The concealer didn&#x27;t really work well with my skin but I can see it working for someone else.</li>
            <li> This is my go to makeup.  It&#x27;s so easy to add a bit of color prior to head out for a busy day.</li>
            <li> I am not very adventurous with make up and this product shows you exactly how to look great. There are multiple cards with different looks from your basic daily look to more adventurous. A great product for newbies to contouring.</li>
            <li> As I get older (I am 59), I have been consciously trying to wear less makeup, but I still want to look sharp every day at work. This collection is everything that I need to emphasize, minimize, and brighten my whole look. I can&#x27;t believe how perfectly it works.</li>
            <li> natural radiance is correct! love this stuff!!&lt;br /&gt;It is my second time buying it for myself and I have even gifted it to my mother.&lt;br /&gt;looks natural, gives skin a radiance work alone over BB cream!&lt;br /&gt;Got a lot of complements while preggers (believe me that my pregnancy glow was not there till I wore this bc I was sick all the time)&lt;br /&gt;WILL buy again!</li>
            <li> What a great set. It&#x27;s fun to have some cards of instruction, but I love the way there is a great concealer, and a browser with a nice shimmer application for my eyes. You can look super glamorous or just a quick application when in a hurry, all the possibilities are there.</li>
            <li> I love all of their products especially this because the color goes well with any skin type and has perfect textures.</li>
            <li> This natural palette is great, especially for light contouring. I find that I use the concealer way too fast.. I mean, come on.. its so small, but its worth it, IMO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has little cards that have guides and show you different ways to contour!</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the instructions included for different contouring looks. What kept it from getting a five was the size. I wish it could have been a bit larger</li>
