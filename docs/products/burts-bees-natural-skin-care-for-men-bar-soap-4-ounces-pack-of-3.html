            <li>Great soap, it works and smells (or lacks smells because it is unscented) good, but tends to go fast in the shower.</li>
            <li>in all I am super happy with the smell and function.  </li>

            <li>For now, I will maintain the 5 star rating, and will add to the review after I&#x27;ve used it for many times, should there be a change.  </li>

            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but when it ran out I did not repurchase it.</li>
            <li>I love getting it in the pack</li>
            <li>And the price is even better</li>
            <li>Glad I&#x27;m not washing myself with a ton of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this soap would be better for that</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay for Burt and his Bees.</li>
            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>For day after day, I have never used a better soap.</li>
            <li>The Mistral soaps might be a better choice.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and bought more after trying it.</li>
            <li>I love it for that, and</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m using natural ingredients while still effectively tackleing my manly stink.</li>
            <li>Great scent and very natural.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for natural soap with no harsh detergents but great cleaning power and great scent, buy this product.</li>
            <li>I smell the light citrus and honey more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a great natural soap.</li>
            <li>Smells good and most of all I like the fact it is natural.</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling this gives me.</li>
            <li>Comes off easy.  </li>
            <li>while rinsing off easily.  </li>
            <li>it is really easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, lathers well, overall a good man&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li>The whole family now uses this soap because of how good it smells and how clean your skin feels.</li>
            <li>Very good substitute for lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t hv the fruity smell that most kid&#x27;s soaps are infused w, but he did admit after using that it has a fresh clean smell :)</li>
            <li>It was fine for me</li>
            <li>PERFECT ON SKIN AND ITS HARD TO FIND, WILL BE GETTING MORE.</li>
            <li>My wife are HUGE Burt&#x27;s Bees fans and have a lot of their products.</li>
            <li>my skin is blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this soap for the last 6 months and have been really happy with it.</li>
            <li>i liked it so much</li>
            <li>Love this soap it lathers very well, lathers even better in the hair.</li>
            <li>It is more strongly scented (Rosemary, predominantly) than Honey Shea which I did not like at first.</li>
            <li>My husband likes fine soaps with clean scents, so I ordered these as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m skin is definitely happier, the scent is pleasant and very mild.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s  enjoyed them and a bar lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells manly and provides a fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great for acne!</li>
            <li>He isn&#x27;t the kind of guy that would normally care about what soap he uses, but he said he loves it.</li>
            <li>Great smell and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>First off, love the smell.</li>
            <li>Slightly pricey, but very good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean - no filmy residue.</li>
            <li>This soap lathers up better than most natural soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>but I do tend to go through bars quicker than I would a bar of one of the more popular brands of regular bar soap.</li>
            <li>Smells like citrus and leaves you feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees soap has kept me as clean as  the Pope</li>
            <li>You really know it&#x27;s good when your wife wants to use it too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and has a pleasant scent, and I always prefer using natural products.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the soap produces a rich satisfying lather.</li>
            <li>Nothing special  except it is overpriced</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good bar soap.</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural smell to it.</li>
            <li>rather than overpowering sweet scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am sure the Dove bar lasts longer, but frankly I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and has a nice natural manly scent but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soap...not a whole lot more</li>
            <li>A tiny bit pricey, but definitely good quality.</li>
            <li>Good scent to it as well, but will not last after washing it off (not an issue with me).</li>
            <li>Washes clean and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>If you find the scent too strong at first give this a try.</li>
            <li>I feel clean after showering, which is always nice and better than some other soaps that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Leaves no residue be hide and you feel fresh and clean?</li>
            <li>Nothing to great, nothing to less, good product overall, gets the job done without all the added chemicals.</li>
            <li>quick delivery/great price.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin with a bit of a waxy feeling, but it goes away quickly after you shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any lingering scent throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also you&#x27;ll burn through a bar fairly quickly if you use it like you would store</li>
            <li>Until I ran out I did not realize how much I love this product, but I bought it at another sight after a search showed Amazon was too high</li>
            <li>I enjoyed more but is a little more costly.</li>
            <li>However, I found a new favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this soap, especially the fact that you can rinse it away easily unlike some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; bars.</li>
            <li>This soap smells and works very well, it is also composed of fine ingredients.</li>
            <li>Clean smell without being perfumed and the overall texture is smooth and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>I have been through dozens looking for something that is either unscented or lightly scented and is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?</li>
            <li>In the end, I&#x27;m just not convinced that its worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients in this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an Ivory user most of my life because I have somewhat sensitive skin and soaps with a lot of perfumes</li>
            <li>skin actually feels more clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the natural soap, he has not had the dry, flakiness; Product suds up well and smells great.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin very smooth and does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li>He says it smells and feels great on his sensitive skin and only wants to use it from now on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any sensitivities or allergies so while this soap washes and rinses very clean, I don&#x27;t have any true benefits to justify the higher price of &#x27;regular&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin smelling fresh and no sticky feeling like many commercial brands.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve recently been changing a lot of things in my life, organic food, more exercise, less TV just an overall better more healthy style of living.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a good masculine smell to it and seems to break down any grime (Anti-perspiration, light grease, etc.)</li>
            <li>like I stunk before) which is pretty</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I buy it for my husband and always make sure he has extra bars so he will bot run out.</li>
            <li>He was hesitant to use it at first bc</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, I use dye and perfume free detergents and fabric softeners because I find the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents detestable and some detergent residuals make me itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>price is really much, much more than a standard bar of soap</li>
            <li>No weird chemical detergents.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>Both are tons better than say Irish Spring (which smells like chemicals and leaves residue on your skin).</li>
            <li>It smelled good but dried my skin.</li>
            <li>Very masculine and clean.</li>
            <li>All natural and clean smelling.....</li>
            <li>It washes off easily, does not dry my skin and does not make my skin itch.</li>
            <li>ive been using this soap for several months, it smells good but the smell doesnt last once you&#x27;re out of the shower, not overpowering</li>
            <li>The smell is awesome, don&#x27;t be afraid to buy its worth it.</li>
            <li>I would say I go through these soaps pretty fast though.</li>
            <li>I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees man soap after a long run of using more mainstream brands.</li>
            <li>It smelled really nice though but probably not worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Because she didn&#x27;t want to smell like a man she would avoid this soap.. which lasted a very long time because the bar was gigantic. :)</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin dry, but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>Since I bike to work and shower there, it makes it easy to also shave in the shower using only one product.</li>
            <li>Smells ok,  but leaves skin so dry that can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I rotate this with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap and Cal Ben&#x27;s pure soap.</li>
            <li>I will say, like any bar soap, you will feel a certain &amp;#34;dryness&amp;#34; after washing it off.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the bar size much more wieldy, the lather is great, I feel clean and just slightly polished after use, thanks to the small bits of exfoliant in the bar</li>
            <li>nicer as in it&#x27;s better to use this product than any of the shampoos I have tried that are available in the typical big box store, as this product has far more natural</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>I really like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>I only wish they were available in stores.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin very well</li>
            <li>all soap bars leave you feeling like you&#x27;ve washed away too much</li>
            <li>He really likes this bar soap.</li>
            <li>When I showered, I also used it to wash my hair, and my head feels much nicer afterwards...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is soap much like I grew up using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve often wondered about the chemicals and dyes they put in soaps and how much of it your body absorbs, which led me to looking for an alternative.  </li>
            <li>very relaxing to smell, when dealing with irate customers in the IT industry.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very oily skin.</li>
            <li>This soap really has it all...</li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t run through it so fast,  </li>
            <li>it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>Musgo Real</li>
            <li>This soap has a very natural smell and is pretty gentle too.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t strong nor does it linger for a long amount of time.  </li>
            <li>and there aren&#x27;t as many uses per bar as with other bars.</li>
            <li>Quite good, as my skin is very sensitive, but I found that I can get 3 ounces of the same soap for nearly the same price at my&lt;br /&gt;local pharmacy, and counting shipping...</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too masculine, but rather pretty woodsy and outdoorsy.</li>
            <li>This all natural soap is great for keeping a man&#x27;s face clear and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too dry like other soaps do, especially if you have a beard.</li>
            <li>For me, yes, but others might feel differently depending on how quickly they use it up.</li>
            <li>The three-pak of these bars came quickly and cheaper than can be bought locally.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit overwhelming but not bad at all, perhaps a little different than I was used to or expecting.</li>
            <li>tried a few other soaps, which I have also liked so far, but this soap is nice for different reasons.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Awesome product...too bad its no longer subscribe and save...</li>
            <li>bought a whole selection of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Soaps just to try them out on my fungul</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;ve since switched to tom&#x27;s of maine natural moisturizing soap and love that, wont go back to burts bees, just doesn&#x27;t moisturize well enough.</li>
            <li>This is my new soap.</li>
            <li>not dry out skin too much</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and the soap always leaves my skin unblemished and unirritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big brawny guy, more the look of a construction iron worker than a hippy.....which is not the typical person to buy soap like this.  </li>
            <li>Trying to go a little more natural in my later years</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>I has a distinctive masculine smell.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients and the results show that they know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a soap as close to natural as I could find and this one fits the ticket.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my son who has extremely sensitive skin and was breaking out after every shower.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get this if you think &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; would help sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Prior to trying Burts I had been using Dove for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking this soap.</li>
            <li>i have used this product for at least 5 years and have been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Not too Girly as far as scent goes-</li>
            <li>reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it breaks down quick.  </li>
            <li>have observed that it does wear down quickly.</li>
            <li>It cleared up all the little pimples he gets on his legs, doesn&#x27;t dry his skin and smells manly :)</li>
            <li>It adds a reviving, soothing and odd smell while its powerful qualities protect the skin from Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d chosen first, just due to size and utility.</li>
            <li>(I have pretty sensitive skin) or make it feel oily or like it doesn&#x27;t rinse off, while at the same time clearing up some minor blemishes on my body that are a constant problem.  </li>
            <li>Only used one bar so far.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately,  there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a local source near me in Minneapolis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li>Citrus oils benefit your skin without extra perfume--just the natural citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for supporting the bees and small business, but unless you enjoy the patchulli scent, which is heavy, this is not the soap for you.</li>
            <li>very soothing to my face, several people have said you face is less dull and more color.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough to use on my sensitive facial skin without causing breakouts or dry spots.</li>
            <li>And I  don&#x27;t normally have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Bars last a good amount of time, and the three pack should last at least a few months.</li>
            <li>Ever since I have switched from a brand name anti-bacterial soap who&#x27;s name begins with &#x27;D&#x27; ial, my allergies have stopped, my skin is softer, just ask my partner and it does not melt away as fast as other soaps.  </li>
            <li>My skin also feels less dry than when I use most other products, although I still do feel it a bit.</li>
            <li>I live in Montana and the weather is quite dry, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion to the Burts Bees folks would be to offer it in a bigger size and try to get the major grocery chains to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep skin soft and does not over dry skin.</li>
            <li>It lasted exactly three weeks of daily heavy use.</li>
            <li>I usually switch between different soaps because of dry skin or it wouldn&#x27;t clean well enough.</li>
            <li>The soap does get you very clean, makes you feel refreshed but the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men Men&#x27;s Bar Soap features Bergamot Oil, a citrus essential oil, it is manifested from the peel of the nearly ripe, odd smelling fruit, Bergomot.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it is a smaller bar that seems to go quickly</li>

            <li> For now, I will maintain the 5 star rating, and will add to the review after I&#x27;ve used it for many times, should there be a change.  </li>

            <li> And the price is even better</li>
            <li> Glad I&#x27;m not washing myself with a ton of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this soap would be better for that</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay for Burt and his Bees.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.</li>
            <li> For day after day, I have never used a better soap.</li>
            <li> The Mistral soaps might be a better choice.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought more after trying it.</li>
            <li> I love it for that, and</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m using natural ingredients while still effectively tackleing my manly stink.</li>
            <li> Great scent and very natural.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural soap with no harsh detergents but great cleaning power and great scent, buy this product.</li>
            <li> I smell the light citrus and honey more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a great natural soap.</li>
            <li> Smells good and most of all I like the fact it is natural.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling this gives me.</li>
            <li> Comes off easy.  </li>
            <li> while rinsing off easily.  </li>
            <li> it is really easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers well, overall a good man&#x27;s soap.  </li>
            <li> The whole family now uses this soap because of how good it smells and how clean your skin feels.</li>
            <li> Very good substitute for lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t hv the fruity smell that most kid&#x27;s soaps are infused w, but he did admit after using that it has a fresh clean smell :)</li>
            <li> It was fine for me</li>
            <li> PERFECT ON SKIN AND ITS HARD TO FIND, WILL BE GETTING MORE.</li>
            <li> My wife are HUGE Burt&#x27;s Bees fans and have a lot of their products.</li>
            <li> my skin is blemish free.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the last 6 months and have been really happy with it.</li>
            <li> i liked it so much</li>
            <li> Love this soap it lathers very well, lathers even better in the hair.</li>
            <li> It is more strongly scented (Rosemary, predominantly) than Honey Shea which I did not like at first.</li>
            <li> My husband likes fine soaps with clean scents, so I ordered these as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skin is definitely happier, the scent is pleasant and very mild.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s  enjoyed them and a bar lasts a good long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells manly and provides a fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great for acne!</li>
            <li> He isn&#x27;t the kind of guy that would normally care about what soap he uses, but he said he loves it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> First off, love the smell.</li>
            <li> Slightly pricey, but very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean - no filmy residue.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up better than most natural soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> but I do tend to go through bars quicker than I would a bar of one of the more popular brands of regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> Smells like citrus and leaves you feeling squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees soap has kept me as clean as  the Pope</li>
            <li> You really know it&#x27;s good when your wife wants to use it too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and has a pleasant scent, and I always prefer using natural products.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the soap produces a rich satisfying lather.</li>
            <li> Nothing special  except it is overpriced</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good bar soap.</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural smell to it.</li>
            <li> rather than overpowering sweet scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sure the Dove bar lasts longer, but frankly I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and has a nice natural manly scent but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soap...not a whole lot more</li>
            <li> A tiny bit pricey, but definitely good quality.</li>
            <li> Good scent to it as well, but will not last after washing it off (not an issue with me).</li>
            <li> Washes clean and smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> If you find the scent too strong at first give this a try.</li>
            <li> I feel clean after showering, which is always nice and better than some other soaps that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Leaves no residue be hide and you feel fresh and clean?</li>
            <li> Nothing to great, nothing to less, good product overall, gets the job done without all the added chemicals.</li>
            <li> quick delivery/great price.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin with a bit of a waxy feeling, but it goes away quickly after you shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any lingering scent throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also you&#x27;ll burn through a bar fairly quickly if you use it like you would store</li>
            <li> Until I ran out I did not realize how much I love this product, but I bought it at another sight after a search showed Amazon was too high</li>
            <li> I enjoyed more but is a little more costly.</li>
            <li> However, I found a new favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, especially the fact that you can rinse it away easily unlike some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; bars.</li>
            <li> This soap smells and works very well, it is also composed of fine ingredients.</li>
            <li> Clean smell without being perfumed and the overall texture is smooth and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I have been through dozens looking for something that is either unscented or lightly scented and is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?</li>
            <li> In the end, I&#x27;m just not convinced that its worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients in this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an Ivory user most of my life because I have somewhat sensitive skin and soaps with a lot of perfumes</li>
            <li> skin actually feels more clean and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the natural soap, he has not had the dry, flakiness; Product suds up well and smells great.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin very smooth and does not dry out skin.</li>
            <li> He says it smells and feels great on his sensitive skin and only wants to use it from now on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any sensitivities or allergies so while this soap washes and rinses very clean, I don&#x27;t have any true benefits to justify the higher price of &#x27;regular&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin smelling fresh and no sticky feeling like many commercial brands.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve recently been changing a lot of things in my life, organic food, more exercise, less TV just an overall better more healthy style of living.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a good masculine smell to it and seems to break down any grime (Anti-perspiration, light grease, etc.)</li>
            <li> like I stunk before) which is pretty</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I buy it for my husband and always make sure he has extra bars so he will bot run out.</li>
            <li> He was hesitant to use it at first bc</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, I use dye and perfume free detergents and fabric softeners because I find the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents detestable and some detergent residuals make me itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> price is really much, much more than a standard bar of soap</li>
            <li> No weird chemical detergents.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> Both are tons better than say Irish Spring (which smells like chemicals and leaves residue on your skin).</li>
            <li> It smelled good but dried my skin.</li>
            <li> Very masculine and clean.</li>
            <li> All natural and clean smelling.....</li>
            <li> It washes off easily, does not dry my skin and does not make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> ive been using this soap for several months, it smells good but the smell doesnt last once you&#x27;re out of the shower, not overpowering</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome, don&#x27;t be afraid to buy its worth it.</li>
            <li> I would say I go through these soaps pretty fast though.</li>
            <li> I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees man soap after a long run of using more mainstream brands.</li>
            <li> It smelled really nice though but probably not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Because she didn&#x27;t want to smell like a man she would avoid this soap.. which lasted a very long time because the bar was gigantic. :)</li>
            <li> It does leave my skin dry, but that&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> Since I bike to work and shower there, it makes it easy to also shave in the shower using only one product.</li>
            <li> Smells ok,  but leaves skin so dry that can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I rotate this with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap and Cal Ben&#x27;s pure soap.</li>
            <li> I will say, like any bar soap, you will feel a certain &amp;#34;dryness&amp;#34; after washing it off.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the bar size much more wieldy, the lather is great, I feel clean and just slightly polished after use, thanks to the small bits of exfoliant in the bar</li>
            <li> nicer as in it&#x27;s better to use this product than any of the shampoos I have tried that are available in the typical big box store, as this product has far more natural</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> I really like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> I only wish they were available in stores.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin very well</li>
            <li> all soap bars leave you feeling like you&#x27;ve washed away too much</li>
            <li> He really likes this bar soap.</li>
            <li> When I showered, I also used it to wash my hair, and my head feels much nicer afterwards...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is soap much like I grew up using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often wondered about the chemicals and dyes they put in soaps and how much of it your body absorbs, which led me to looking for an alternative.  </li>
            <li> very relaxing to smell, when dealing with irate customers in the IT industry.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very oily skin.</li>
            <li> This soap really has it all...</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t run through it so fast,  </li>
            <li> it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> Musgo Real</li>
            <li> This soap has a very natural smell and is pretty gentle too.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t strong nor does it linger for a long amount of time.  </li>
            <li> and there aren&#x27;t as many uses per bar as with other bars.</li>
            <li> Quite good, as my skin is very sensitive, but I found that I can get 3 ounces of the same soap for nearly the same price at my&lt;br /&gt;local pharmacy, and counting shipping...</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too masculine, but rather pretty woodsy and outdoorsy.</li>
            <li> This all natural soap is great for keeping a man&#x27;s face clear and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too dry like other soaps do, especially if you have a beard.</li>
            <li> For me, yes, but others might feel differently depending on how quickly they use it up.</li>
            <li> The three-pak of these bars came quickly and cheaper than can be bought locally.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit overwhelming but not bad at all, perhaps a little different than I was used to or expecting.</li>
            <li> tried a few other soaps, which I have also liked so far, but this soap is nice for different reasons.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...too bad its no longer subscribe and save...</li>
            <li> bought a whole selection of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Soaps just to try them out on my fungul</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;ve since switched to tom&#x27;s of maine natural moisturizing soap and love that, wont go back to burts bees, just doesn&#x27;t moisturize well enough.</li>
            <li> This is my new soap.</li>
            <li> not dry out skin too much</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the soap always leaves my skin unblemished and unirritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big brawny guy, more the look of a construction iron worker than a hippy.....which is not the typical person to buy soap like this.  </li>
            <li> Trying to go a little more natural in my later years</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li> I has a distinctive masculine smell.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients and the results show that they know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soap as close to natural as I could find and this one fits the ticket.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my son who has extremely sensitive skin and was breaking out after every shower.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you think &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; would help sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Prior to trying Burts I had been using Dove for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this soap.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for at least 5 years and have been pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Not too Girly as far as scent goes-</li>
            <li> reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it breaks down quick.  </li>
            <li> have observed that it does wear down quickly.</li>
            <li> It cleared up all the little pimples he gets on his legs, doesn&#x27;t dry his skin and smells manly :)</li>
            <li> It adds a reviving, soothing and odd smell while its powerful qualities protect the skin from Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d chosen first, just due to size and utility.</li>
            <li> (I have pretty sensitive skin) or make it feel oily or like it doesn&#x27;t rinse off, while at the same time clearing up some minor blemishes on my body that are a constant problem.  </li>
            <li> Only used one bar so far.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately,  there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a local source near me in Minneapolis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others</li>
            <li> Citrus oils benefit your skin without extra perfume--just the natural citrus fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for supporting the bees and small business, but unless you enjoy the patchulli scent, which is heavy, this is not the soap for you.</li>
            <li> very soothing to my face, several people have said you face is less dull and more color.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough to use on my sensitive facial skin without causing breakouts or dry spots.</li>
            <li> And I  don&#x27;t normally have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Bars last a good amount of time, and the three pack should last at least a few months.</li>
            <li> Ever since I have switched from a brand name anti-bacterial soap who&#x27;s name begins with &#x27;D&#x27; ial, my allergies have stopped, my skin is softer, just ask my partner and it does not melt away as fast as other soaps.  </li>
            <li> My skin also feels less dry than when I use most other products, although I still do feel it a bit.</li>
            <li> I live in Montana and the weather is quite dry, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion to the Burts Bees folks would be to offer it in a bigger size and try to get the major grocery chains to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep skin soft and does not over dry skin.</li>
            <li> It lasted exactly three weeks of daily heavy use.</li>
            <li> I usually switch between different soaps because of dry skin or it wouldn&#x27;t clean well enough.</li>
            <li> The soap does get you very clean, makes you feel refreshed but the smell is pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men Men&#x27;s Bar Soap features Bergamot Oil, a citrus essential oil, it is manifested from the peel of the nearly ripe, odd smelling fruit, Bergomot.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a smaller bar that seems to go quickly</li>
            <li> Kirk&#x27;s lathers better - but doesn&#x27;t last as long (bar of Kirk&#x27;s last about a week to week and a half, whereas Burt&#x27;s gets at least 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> And I certainly do like that it is without the chemicals, but the only problem is it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li> I feel ridiculous for spending this much money on bar soap,  but I was looking for something natural without a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> He showers and then his skin was white with being dried out from normal soaps such as Ivory, Zest, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I live in a hard water district and traditional soaps don&#x27;t rinse off completely and causes a skin rash.  </li>
            <li> twice as long as regular soap brands.  </li>
            <li> Personally, it smells like earl grey tea.</li>
            <li> and but doesn&#x27;t last long in the shower</li>
            <li> some reviews said they dont last long.</li>
            <li> Two things that stopped me from leaving 5 stars: the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long after you leave the shower and the soap bar doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it cleans well enough while not completely drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> While not exceptionally long lasting, I&#x27;ve used other beeswax soaps that don&#x27;t last as long as these do.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> First, the other soap I purchased came in an extremely large bar that was difficult to handle and smelled of sandalwood.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to those who find some soaps too harsh or overbearing or can&#x27;t find a soap that will clear your skin up.</li>
            <li> It goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;On a week long fishing trip</li>
            <li> and I will be using it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> The bar seems to last about the same amount of time that my previous brand did.</li>
            <li> Not big on the scent but other than that I like everything else about this soap.</li>
            <li> Neither of us have had any dry skin (other than regular winter dryness) while using it.  </li>
            <li> My wife LOVES the smell, and it never leaves my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li> Might be too dry for some people during winter</li>
            <li> I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have naturally  dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t use it every day because it tends to dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> The smell is slightly \\&quot;hippy\\&quot; as I would call it, but not enough to not use it.  </li>
            <li> and your skin becomes dry, but that feeling only lasts for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> This rinses well but leaves my skin very, very dry.</li>
            <li> Just wished they sold it in a bigger quantity than three and the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell different then other soap I have ordered that was a lot less priced.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t realize that some cleansers that claim to clear your skin actually make it worse by clogging your pores or have ingredients that leave residue that attracts dirt.  </li>
            <li> thing to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way with this soap.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s supposed to be for men and other reviewers</li>
            <li> this past summer I forgot to pack a bar of soap and found Burts at the local grocery store.</li>
            <li> My husband will not use any other soap but Burts bees.</li>
            <li> really like this soap, but I have to give it four stars because it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> but I wait until the bar gets down to the nub</li>
            <li> Used mine for a week, showering twice a day, and I&#x27;m down to about 60% of the bar.</li>
            <li> My husband is not the type to care about soap or any other beauty type products, but he LOVES this soap!</li>
            <li> and I would usually have to apply lotion to my dry arms afterwards, and sometimes patches of chest</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and its been 10 degrees or colder out for the past week.  </li>
            <li> It splits in half about half way of use and then again after another half of use.</li>
            <li> less or no causticity.(just a guess).</li>
            <li> For some reason this particular product is difficult to find in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying dozens of soaps lately to find one that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin</li>
            <li> A little pricey for soap, but I need stuff like this now.</li>
            <li> My only disappointing is that it does not last longer.</li>
            <li> AND - I like the round design on the 3-oz. size from my pharmacy,&lt;br /&gt;rather than the rectangular design from this seller.</li>
            <li> By heavy use</li>
            <li> All the extra chemicals in those was irritating my skin too.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not sure why the product nor the other reviews mentioned this, perhaps it&#x27;s crystalized oils, I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as bad as a Lava bar, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it gentle either.</li>
            <li> The only issue for me is the price - it is awfully expensive for 3 bars of soap.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I have a hard time finding this in stores</li>
            <li> Make it oval at least, seller.</li>
            <li> I mean I lather up everything except my hair with it.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle aroma that does not announce your arrival.</li>
            <li> smell not good.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am disappointed in the absence of bay rum soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to burts bees mens soap .  </li>
            <li> I got tired of using body washes, and going through body sponges.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the drying sensation I got from bargain soaps.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Non irritating, rinses well</li>
            <li> Expensive for one soap.</li>
            <li> Their stick deoderant smells like this, but it is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> i am sorry i don&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> He was not impressed.</li>
            <li> The soap didn&#x27;t smell bad until I used it</li>
            <li> is bad if you do not.</li>
            <li> I was sick of all the body washes out there that made me smell like a 16yo.</li>
            <li> I just can&#x27;t get it anymore on subscribe and save. :(</li>
            <li> As a guy I hate perfume in my soap.</li>
            <li> but the scent is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cleans you fresh as a daisy!!  All natural and clean smelling.....try it, you&#x27;ll like it!!</li>
            <li> This men&#x27;s soap has good lather and smells good, too. Leaves your skin smelling fresh and no sticky feeling like many commercial brands. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really like the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I only wish they were available in stores. But the price was really good.</li>
            <li> Great smelling works great on my skin. No stores in the area that carry Burt&#x27;s Bee products carries in stock, postage makes it pricey.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for natural soap with no harsh detergents but great cleaning power and great scent, buy this product. I has a distinctive masculine smell. It&#x27;s clean - no filmy residue. I rotate this with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s bar soap and Cal Ben&#x27;s pure soap.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good bar soap. Smells great, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like the harsher body washes do.</li>
            <li> I must say that I am disappointed in the absence of bay rum soap. However, I found a new favorite. I use it for everything. Do not tell Burt&#x27;s Bees but I wait until the bar gets down to the nub and it becomes my shaving soap. It has a subtle aroma that does not announce your arrival.</li>
            <li> This is a good soapbar. I used it and like it a lot.  Smells good and most of all I like the fact it is natural.</li>
            <li> It smelled good but dried my skin. It is hard to find a good moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> Nothing special  except it is overpriced</li>
            <li> ive been using this soap for several months, it smells good but the smell doesnt last once you&#x27;re out of the shower, not overpowering, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin very well and I would usually have to apply lotion to my dry arms afterwards, and sometimes patches of chest, i&#x27;ve since switched to tom&#x27;s of maine natural moisturizing soap and love that, wont go back to burts bees, just doesn&#x27;t moisturize well enough.</li>
            <li> This is some great stuff!  It has a nice natural smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin and has a pleasant scent, and I always prefer using natural products. The only issue for me is the price - it is awfully expensive for 3 bars of soap. Is it worth it? For me, yes, but others might feel differently depending on how quickly they use it up.</li>
            <li> This is my third product from Burt&#x27;s Bees. All three have been great. All natural ingredients and the results show that they know what they&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Until I ran out I did not realize how much I love this product, but I bought it at another sight after a search showed Amazon was too high, I like getting 6 bars at a time so I know I will not run out again</li>
            <li> Great smell, but not too strong. Perfect for my tastes. I would say I go through these soaps pretty fast though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to burts bees mens soap .  It goes a long way. twice as long as regular soap brands.  Smells refreshing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying dozens of soaps lately to find one that doesn&#x27;t dry my skin (I have pretty sensitive skin) or make it feel oily or like it doesn&#x27;t rinse off, while at the same time clearing up some minor blemishes on my body that are a constant problem.  I found it. I love the way this soap feels and smells(very mild)and my skin is blemish free.  I recommend this to those who find some soaps too harsh or overbearing or can&#x27;t find a soap that will clear your skin up. Some people don&#x27;t realize that some cleansers that claim to clear your skin actually make it worse by clogging your pores or have ingredients that leave residue that attracts dirt.  Burt&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave any residue and it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. Great stuff. I&#x27;ll be trying the body wash next just to see if it works as well; but I think I&#x27;ve found my body soap in the bar and don&#x27;t see myself changing soaps ever again.</li>
            <li> all soap bars leave you feeling like you&#x27;ve washed away too much and your skin becomes dry, but that feeling only lasts for a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;my skin actually feels more clean and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;ll smell great, just light, calming kind of smell. rather than overpowering sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Great scent. My wife even started using it.</li>
            <li> I like the product. I just can&#x27;t get it anymore on subscribe and save. :(</li>
            <li> Smells Great. Personally, it smells like earl grey tea. Actually, the entire men&#x27;s line smells just like this. So no clashing odors between your deodorant and your aftershave or what have you.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been getting compliments,(not like I stunk before) which is pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, My skin feels great and the cost is worth it.</li>
            <li> When I bought this it said (pack of 3) I received one soap. Expensive for one soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...Only used one bar so far.  Not a big fan of the smell</li>
            <li> I got tired of using body washes, and going through body sponges. This is probably the best bar soap I&#x27;ve used. My wife LOVES the smell, and it never leaves my skin dry.  For this price, can&#x27;t beat it (3 pack). My wife are HUGE Burt&#x27;s Bees fans and have a lot of their products. They never disappoint.</li>
            <li> This all natural soap is great for keeping a man&#x27;s face clear and clean, and it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin too dry like other soaps do, especially if you have a beard.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a soap as close to natural as I could find and this one fits the ticket.  It&#x27;s smaller than regular soap but a bit larger than hotel soap.  Works great and my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the soap always leaves my skin unblemished and unirritated. It smells very good and is all natural. I highly recommend this soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit overwhelming but not bad at all, perhaps a little different than I was used to or expecting. I feel clean after showering, which is always nice and better than some other soaps that I&#x27;ve used. My skin also feels less dry than when I use most other products, although I still do feel it a bit. The bar seems to last about the same amount of time that my previous brand did. In the end, I&#x27;m just not convinced that its worth the price.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up better than most natural soaps I&#x27;ve tried.  It has a pleasant smell, but not overpowering.  Gentle enough to use on my sensitive facial skin without causing breakouts or dry spots.</li>
            <li> Everything with the Burt&#x27;s Bees label is quality product. For some reason this particular product is difficult to find in the store. So glad to find it on Amazon. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> Not big on the scent but other than that I like everything else about this soap.</li>
            <li> He really likes this bar soap. Washes clean and smells fresh and clean. Has a nice manly smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave a coating on the skin.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, and my body feels cleaner after usage.  For now, I will maintain the 5 star rating, and will add to the review after I&#x27;ve used it for many times, should there be a change.  When I showered, I also used it to wash my hair, and my head feels much nicer afterwards... nicer as in it&#x27;s better to use this product than any of the shampoos I have tried that are available in the typical big box store, as this product has far more natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is soap much like I grew up using.  That is, the way soap was meant to be.</li>
            <li> Quite good, as my skin is very sensitive, but I found that I can get 3 ounces of the same soap for nearly the same price at my&lt;br /&gt;local pharmacy, and counting shipping...I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s close! AND - I like the round design on the 3-oz. size from my pharmacy,&lt;br /&gt;rather than the rectangular design from this seller. Make it oval at least, seller.</li>
            <li> This soap smells and works very well, it is also composed of fine ingredients. Their stick deoderant smells like this, but it is too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I like the smell after using this soap more then anything.  It gives me that manly smell after a shower.</li>
            <li> Big fan. Lathers well, cleans great. Leaves me smellin&#x27; like the boss.</li>
            <li> My husband is not the type to care about soap or any other beauty type products, but he LOVES this soap! Great smell and washes nicely.</li>
            <li> The soap didn&#x27;t smell bad until I used it then it had an antiseptic smell which stayed with your body for a while. The soap does get you very clean, makes you feel refreshed but the smell is pretty bad. It also takes a few showers before the soap will glide over your skin, first time use it wants to stick to you, not sure why. After that it lathers well and comes off easily.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I will use it if I have nothing else but I doubt I would ever buy it again. Burt needs to go back to the drawing board on the smell or even make it odorless.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers well and smells good.  You really know it&#x27;s good when your wife wants to use it too.</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good! Try it! I buy it for my husband and always make sure he has extra bars so he will bot run out.</li>
            <li> This soap is very good for men with sensitive skin. Keeps skin very smooth and does not dry out skin. Very good substitute for lotion for dry skin</li>
            <li> Great soap, it works and smells (or lacks smells because it is unscented) good, but tends to go fast in the shower.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve recently been changing a lot of things in my life, organic food, more exercise, less TV just an overall better more healthy style of living.  I&#x27;ve often wondered about the chemicals and dyes they put in soaps and how much of it your body absorbs, which led me to looking for an alternative.  I&#x27;m a big brawny guy, more the look of a construction iron worker than a hippy.....which is not the typical person to buy soap like this.  That being said I was worried about how the soap smelled and how it functioned.&lt;br /&gt;All in all I am super happy with the smell and function.  It lathers well, it washes off well.  The smell is slightly \\&quot;hippy\\&quot; as I would call it, but not enough to not use it.  The smell isn&#x27;t strong nor does it linger for a long amount of time.  The more I use it, the more I like it.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I usually switch between different soaps because of dry skin or it wouldn&#x27;t clean well enough. Since buying this and using it for several months I don&#x27;t see the need to look for anything else. Very happy with Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> best price. smell not good. i don&#x27;t like it. i don&#x27;t recommend. i am sorry i don&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> quick delivery/great price. very soothing to my face, several people have said you face is less dull and more color. the smell is so relaxing i have a unopened bar on my desk. very relaxing to smell, when dealing with irate customers in the IT industry.</li>
            <li> Great soap, but I just can&#x27;t justify the price.  I don&#x27;t have any sensitivities or allergies so while this soap washes and rinses very clean, I don&#x27;t have any true benefits to justify the higher price of &#x27;regular&#x27; soaps.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Clean smell without being perfumed and the overall texture is smooth and rinses easily. I even use it on our baby and her skin loves it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell different then other soap I have ordered that was a lot less priced. It doesn&#x27;t work well and but doesn&#x27;t last long in the shower</li>
            <li> wonderful soap, one of my favorites now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the Burt&#x27;s Bees natural men bar soap. I prefer body washes (easier and faster to soap myself), but if I had to use a bar soap, it would probably be this one.</li>
            <li> I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees man soap after a long run of using more mainstream brands. I wanted to switch to get away from all of the chemicals I had been slathering over my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells great, makes me clean, and doesn&#x27;t have those chemicals. It leaves your skin with a bit of a waxy feeling, but it goes away quickly after you shower and doesn&#x27;t leave any lingering scent throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;No Chemicals&lt;br /&gt;Good Scent&lt;br /&gt;Trusted Brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Waxy Feeling After Use</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for the last 6 months and have been really happy with it. Keep skin soft and does not over dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am a Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Shea user so I thought I would give this a try.  It is more strongly scented (Rosemary, predominantly) than Honey Shea which I did not like at first. After using it a couple times I let the bar sit in the soap dish for a week then started using it again and like it. If you find the scent too strong at first give this a try. If you like the scent you will love the soap. After using it for over two months I like it even more. It washes off easily, does not dry my skin and does not make my skin itch.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son who has extremely sensitive skin and was breaking out after every shower. He was hesitant to use it at first bc it doesn&#x27;t hv the fruity smell that most kid&#x27;s soaps are infused w, but he did admit after using that it has a fresh clean smell :)</li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients in this soap. It does leave my skin dry, but that&#x27;s OK bc I have naturally very oily skin. I love the clean feeling this gives me.</li>
            <li> nice soap. something different from your supermarket bars. some reviews said they dont last long. i have found that not to be the case.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Almost no smell.  Comes off easy.  i liked it so much I put it on Subscribe and save.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is that it breaks down quick.  A bar lasts about 3 weeks if you are careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a dude that doesn&#x27;t want to smell like soap all day and doesn&#x27;t want to rub chemicals all over your body in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap. The smell isn&#x27;t too masculine, but rather pretty woodsy and outdoorsy. This soap is not drying to my skin.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Smells good. Works well. And this is the cheapest place I have found it. Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Best men&#x27;s soap I have every used. Leaves no residue be hide and you feel fresh and clean? Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This soap really has it all... keeps your skin soft and feeling fresh and it smells great!  This is my new soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get this if you think &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; would help sensitive skin. Stick to things that specifically say &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin. Good product otherwise I guess</li>
            <li> Smells great and seems to be helping the eczema on my finger, which is the reason I switched from the cheap soaps.  Smells great.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but when it ran out I did not repurchase it. I think that says a lot</li>
            <li> I feel ridiculous for spending this much money on bar soap,  but I was looking for something natural without a bunch of chemicals. I  am totally hooked on this soap. I would give it 5 stars if it didn&#x27;t cost so much and I didn&#x27;t run through it so fast,  but I do tend to go through bars quicker than I would a bar of one of the more popular brands of regular bar soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around, trying to find soap to replace my habitual purchase of whatever is cheapest at the store. I live in Montana and the weather is quite dry, especially in the winter. I was tired of the drying sensation I got from bargain soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried a few other soaps, which I have also liked so far, but this soap is nice for different reasons. First, the other soap I purchased came in an extremely large bar that was difficult to handle and smelled of sandalwood. It was fine for me but my wife occasionally will use the soap bar when she doesn&#x27;t want to use her shower gel. Because she didn&#x27;t want to smell like a man she would avoid this soap.. which lasted a very long time because the bar was gigantic. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that soap I decided the try the Burt&#x27;s Bees soap. Not only was the bar size much more wieldy, the lather is great, I feel clean and just slightly polished after use, thanks to the small bits of exfoliant in the bar (I&#x27;m not sure why the product nor the other reviews mentioned this, perhaps it&#x27;s crystalized oils, I&#x27;m not sure but they are there). Best of all for my wife it doesn&#x27;t smell of sandalwood. I smell the light citrus and honey more than anything else. I know it&#x27;s supposed to be for men and other reviewers say it smells manly but my wife likes it as well and obviously doesn&#x27;t let the manliness deter her from using it occasionally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short I&#x27;d pick this bar again over the Mistral&#x27;s Men&#x27;s soap (Sandalwood and Bamboo) I&#x27;d chosen first, just due to size and utility. Both are good soaps that give you a better cleaning experience without the dryness of bargain soaps.</li>
            <li> My man loves this! He hates body wash- claims to feel soapy all day when he uses it. Anyway, I have a hard time finding this in stores so I am  very happy to find it here.</li>
            <li> Great smell - not too pungent and the bar lasts a good while. Try to keep this bar from soaking in water in the soap dish to preserve the smell for a longer period.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap. He isn&#x27;t the kind of guy that would normally care about what soap he uses, but he said he loves it. It cleared up all the little pimples he gets on his legs, doesn&#x27;t dry his skin and smells manly :)</li>
            <li> Smells like citrus and leaves you feeling squeaky clean. Might be too dry for some people during winter but you&#x27;ll probably use lotion anyways. Two things that stopped me from leaving 5 stars: the smell doesn&#x27;t last too long after you leave the shower and the soap bar doesn&#x27;t last too long. Just cut it up if you want to save on the soap. Used mine for a week, showering twice a day, and I&#x27;m down to about 60% of the bar.</li>
            <li> it lathers ok and rinses fair but the scent is terrible. I&#x27;d stick with dove it is cheaper and does the same job.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, I use dye and perfume free detergents and fabric softeners because I find the &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; scents detestable and some detergent residuals make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Subsequently I am quite picky about what soaps I use. I have been through dozens looking for something that is either unscented or lightly scented and is gentle on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to trying Burts I had been using Dove for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s acceptable,  but I was not overly thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a week long fishing trip this past summer I forgot to pack a bar of soap and found Burts at the local grocery store. I liked it immediately and decided I would get some for home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,  there doesn&#x27;t appear to be a local source near me in Minneapolis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have observed that it does wear down quickly. I received my order from Amazon on Sept 19. It lasted exactly three weeks of daily heavy use. By heavy use I mean I lather up everything except my hair with it. If I was concentrating on just the basics it might go farther.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure the Dove bar lasts longer, but frankly I really don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m skin is definitely happier, the scent is pleasant and very mild. My only suggestion to the Burts Bees folks would be to offer it in a bigger size and try to get the major grocery chains to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a winner and I will be using it as long as they keep making it.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this soap. It lathers well and has a nice natural manly scent but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li> It splits in half about half way of use and then again after another half of use. Otherwise very good.</li>
            <li> Great feeling and smelling soap--all natural ingredients make this a superb buy!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I live in a hard water district and traditional soaps don&#x27;t rinse off completely and causes a skin rash.  This rinses well but leaves my skin very, very dry.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this soap and he smells great. He satyrs it cleans very well. I love getting it in the pack so I can always have a spare on hand.</li>
            <li> Great soap! And the price is even better</li>
            <li> Smells like a bit of rosemary but not in a girly way. Glad I&#x27;m not washing myself with a ton of chemicals. Great soap, even for the price.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this soap. His skin looks and feels nice. The soap has a nice scent and leathers well. He likes it.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin. I was hoping this soap would be better for that but it wasn&#x27;t really. It smelled really nice though but probably not worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I have used two bars of this soap and also Burt&#x27;s Bees Men&#x27;s Body Wash. I found that using the soap version left my skin itchy at places. I have naturally  dry skin. I don&#x27;t have the same issue with the body wash containing probably the same ingredients but less or no causticity.(just a guess). I continue to use Burt&#x27;s Bees Men&#x27;s Body Wash with great satisfaction.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great and the bar lasts quite a while.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to another bar soap. Smells awesome and leaves you feeling actually clean</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Skin Care for Men Men&#x27;s Bar Soap features Bergamot Oil, a citrus essential oil, it is manifested from the peel of the nearly ripe, odd smelling fruit, Bergomot. It adds a reviving, soothing and odd smell while its powerful qualities protect the skin from Burt&#x27;s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not tested on animals or Bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a whole selection of Burt&#x27;s Bees Natural Soaps just to try them out on my fungul collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is really much, much more than a standard bar of soap but it&#x27;s okay for Burt and his Bees.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap on the planet. Great, manly smell. No weird chemical detergents. Rinses clean. I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Smells like SPA!!! My guy uses this everyone time he showers and he loves the smell and so do I!</li>
            <li> The three-pak of these bars came quickly and cheaper than can be bought locally. Burt&#x27;s Bees soap has kept me as clean as  the Pope In Rome  for years now.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  Absolutely love this soap!</li>
            <li> Great smell and moisture.  Good clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s got a good masculine smell to it and seems to break down any grime (Anti-perspiration, light grease, etc.) while rinsing off easily.  It&#x27;s a soap...not a whole lot more I can say about it!</li>
            <li> Best natural mans soap since Burt cancelled the tomato line.&lt;br /&gt;Smells manly and provides a fresh clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Great for acne!</li>
            <li> Nothing to great, nothing to less, good product overall, gets the job done without all the added chemicals.</li>
            <li> Awesome product...too bad its no longer subscribe and save...</li>
            <li> This is a natural soap that has an excellent lather.  Citrus oils benefit your skin without extra perfume--just the natural citrus fragrance.  For day after day, I have never used a better soap.</li>
            <li> We went through this soap too quickly to justify the expense, although it was a good soap. The Mistral soaps might be a better choice.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bee makes a good all around men&#x27;s soap. The price is reasonable and the soap produces a rich satisfying lather. My only disappointing is that it does not last longer.</li>
            <li> I was sick of all the body washes out there that made me smell like a 16yo. All the extra chemicals in those was irritating my skin too. This soap has a very natural smell and is pretty gentle too. I went ahead and bought more after trying it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.</li>
            <li> Not that I am an expert to begin with, but this is the best smelling soap I have ever used. I love it for that, and it it makes my bathroom smell like it just by sitting in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I don&#x27;t use it every day because it tends to dry my skin out. It&#x27;s not quite as bad as a Lava bar, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it gentle either.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, lathers well, overall a good man&#x27;s soap.  The bar could be a bit bigger, which is why it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very good soap.  Has a nice refreshing citrus smell.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Ever since I have switched from a brand name anti-bacterial soap who&#x27;s name begins with &#x27;D&#x27; ial, my allergies have stopped, my skin is softer, just ask my partner and it does not melt away as fast as other soaps.  I&#x27;m hooked.  In fact, I&#x27;m ordering 12 bars after I post this review.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a variety of men-targeted soap and this is by far the best for the price. Bars last a good amount of time, and the three pack should last at least a few months.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for at least 5 years and have been pleased with it.  pleasant scent and it cleans well.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, especially the fact that you can rinse it away easily unlike some &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; bars. Scent is nice as well.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.  This soap is excellent as a bath soap and a shaving soap.  Since I bike to work and shower there, it makes it easy to also shave in the shower using only one product. Slightly pricey, but very good.</li>
            <li> Great scent and very natural.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Nice ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Lathers well&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry out skin too much&lt;br /&gt;No palm oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It is too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soap, but I have to give it four stars because it is so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love this soap it lathers very well, lathers even better in the hair. It doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long but i take two showers a day. The smell is awesome, don&#x27;t be afraid to buy its worth it.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lasts a long time. I have felt my skin smoother</li>
            <li> Smells manly. I enjoyed the smell and how it faintly stayed on your skin. Musgo Real I enjoyed more but is a little more costly.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees makes a great natural soap. While not exceptionally long lasting, I&#x27;ve used other beeswax soaps that don&#x27;t last as long as these do. There&#x27;s a good manly scent here without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> My husband likes fine soaps with clean scents, so I ordered these as a stocking stuffer. He&#x27;s  enjoyed them and a bar lasts a good long time. A tiny bit pricey, but definitely good quality.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis and this soap almost changed my life. it is really easy on the skin. Love the smell. I will keep buying them until the end of time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soap. And I certainly do like that it is without the chemicals, but the only problem is it does dry out my skin a little.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and a nice sized bar. A little pricey for soap, but I need stuff like this now. Non irritating, rinses well and I don&#x27;t itch later on.</li>
            <li> Great soap that smells good and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> First off, love the smell. Very masculine and clean. Otherwise, it cleans well enough while not completely drying out my skin. It&#x27;s good to know I&#x27;m using natural ingredients while still effectively tackleing my manly stink.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li> very good. will come back again</li>
            <li> As a guy I hate perfume in my soap. This soap has a very light and earthy smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way with this soap.It doesn&#x27;t take a lot to build up a good lather. Also you&#x27;ll burn through a bar fairly quickly if you use it like you would store bought soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the price I&#x27;ll continue to use this soap regularly.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this soap - he hates it when we run out!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I&#x27;ve been an Ivory user most of my life because I have somewhat sensitive skin and soaps with a lot of perfumes make me itch. Trying to go a little more natural in my later years so we gave Burt&#x27;s a try. The whole family now uses this soap because of how good it smells and how clean your skin feels. Definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great aroma and texture.  I can definitely tell I&#x27;m not using some cheaper store brand soap.  The square shape is nice and easy to hold onto.  I also think it lasts a bit longer than a bar of soap bought at the traditional mega-mart.</li>
            <li> I alternate between this stuff and Kirk&#x27;s Castille. Both are tons better than say Irish Spring (which smells like chemicals and leaves residue on your skin). Kirk&#x27;s smells more mild, whereas Burt&#x27;s has an awesome and refreshing citrus smell - that is pleasant without being overpowering. Kirk&#x27;s lathers better - but doesn&#x27;t last as long (bar of Kirk&#x27;s last about a week to week and a half, whereas Burt&#x27;s gets at least 2 weeks).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for supporting the bees and small business, but unless you enjoy the patchulli scent, which is heavy, this is not the soap for you.</li>
            <li> My husband will not use any other soap but Burts bees.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Husband. He showers and then his skin was white with being dried out from normal soaps such as Ivory, Zest, etc. Using the natural soap, he has not had the dry, flakiness; Product suds up well and smells great. Not too Girly as far as scent goes- which he was worried about.</li>
            <li> Good soap.  I love the smell.  Just wished they sold it in a bigger quantity than three and the price was a little lower.</li>
            <li> ORGANIC, PERFECT ON SKIN AND ITS HARD TO FIND, WILL BE GETTING MORE.</li>
            <li> My son is off in another state going to college. I sent him this in a care package and he LOVES it. He is picky on his soap / body washes. He says it smells and feels great on his sensitive skin and only wants to use it from now on. Thumbs up</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Lathers very nice.  I will say, like any bar soap, you will feel a certain &amp;#34;dryness&amp;#34; after washing it off.  But it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and its been 10 degrees or colder out for the past week.  Good scent to it as well, but will not last after washing it off (not an issue with me).</li>
            <li> This soap makes you smell like a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good if you like the smell of trees.&lt;br /&gt;This is bad if you do not.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use. Its great! Smells good but isn&#x27;t overpowering. Its very nice, we like it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this bar soap for my husband and I started using it too!  It is gentle enough on my sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of chemicals in it.  Neither of us have had any dry skin (other than regular winter dryness) while using it.  My only complaint is that it is a smaller bar that seems to go quickly and there aren&#x27;t as many uses per bar as with other bars.</li>
            <li> Smells ok,  but leaves skin so dry that can&#x27;t use it. And I  don&#x27;t normally have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband.  He was not impressed.</li>
