            <li>It smells great as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice on my skin too.</li>

            <li>It feels great as a face wash, and as a shampoo it is great because it lathers nicely.</li>

            <li>This is an amazing product which can be used for everything in my shower routine.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I purchased from Earth Fare, but wrote a review here because Amazon is so popular.</li>
            <li>Smells good and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>The peppermint smell is very light, I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed it if I didn&#x27;t know it was peppermint.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it in your hair, i&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>love it as a face wash.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, my entire family uses it.</li>
            <li>and i do love pepperment</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, but I love it on my face and in the shower.</li>
            <li>not so sure it works on some stuff</li>
            <li>I love this soap.  </li>
            <li>It has a medium lather, wish it were more</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but the peppermint is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>This company is amazing---they make natural, chemical free, fair trade products in large sizes with incredibly affordable prices.  </li>
            <li>smells good, but dispenser clots too fast, will look for something else...</li>
            <li>I am very surprised as though I have ordered many items from the co-op and all have been exceptionally good.</li>
            <li>dr Bronners soap seems to be the best so far, but it burns the eyes, cuts and intimate parts...</li>
            <li>I have fine shoulder length hair that has some wave to it.</li>
            <li>but IT IS a sulfate free shampoo</li>
            <li>My face after one night is so smooth.</li>
            <li>It also came really fast and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it (as I am with most new products) and truly wanted to love it as well.</li>
            <li>Super gentle but effective.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m familiar with the black soap drying out the skin; you just have to be sure to follow up with a great moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent is very refreshing and it rinses clear.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronners 18-1 peppermint castille is just a loose liquid wise but lathers so much better.</li>
            <li>Try this soap if you love having a simple and effective beauty regime.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see more scents such as the earthy one mentioned by another reviewer.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, and enjoy the tingle, but as relates to my hair, it takes to much to make it lather</li>
            <li>so I can add my own essential oils.  </li>
            <li>love how soft and detangled my hair is after I use this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but so far I have enjoyed using the Alaffia brand.</li>
            <li>It really works to make my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>confess I like this better than Dr Bronner&#x27;s as it feels a little more luxurious but still all-natural.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and break out easily.</li>
            <li>I first tried the citrus when it was on sale at Whole Foods and liked it enough to buy it again and try the Peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the smell is very intense.</li>
            <li>Most sulfate free shampoos have a hard time removing certain cones!!!</li>
            <li>SO even better the soap will last for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have observed no ill side effects at all but rather have determined that my skin is improving in tone, texture, and softness.</li>
            <li>If you exfoliate regularly, I wouldn&#x27;t use this soap more than once a day.</li>
            <li>For a week and a half I have been looking especially pretty and clean.</li>
            <li>Huge bonus with the environmental and social cause benefits</li>
            <li>but it did just fine compared to traditional shampoos).</li>
            <li>Makes a nice little off-beat gift.</li>
            <li>The hair may feel a little stringy after but you should use a good leave in conditioner(I like giavonni direct leave in).</li>
            <li>It cleanses and is gentle.</li>
            <li>Very liquidy.  </li>
            <li>This soap is very versatile, we wash hair and body.</li>
            <li>I got it fast</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I feel it has helped me with my psoriasis and is very soothing to my skin.</li>
            <li>It lathers gently and rinses well.</li>
            <li>so I dont have much to compare it to</li>
            <li>This product is very liquidy and does not lather well with a rag or when used alone .</li>
            <li>I also use it as a shampoo after a deep conditioning and it is fantastic on my 4b hair.</li>
            <li>I was struggling with pretty persistent acne, but this product really helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I mainly co-wash my hair, but when I feel like I need a deeper washing, I would use something like this.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely fuller, shinier, and only needs a wash once a week, so I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t run out while overseas.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve been to numerous dermatologists many times over, and everything I tried only seemed to be a temporary fix for an ongoing problem.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li>That being said, also buy a high quality, alcohol-free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would not use this as a body wash because it is just not thick</li>
            <li>If you have a build up of dead skin on your face as I did, twice of day would probably be okay for ~3 days</li>
            <li>but you live and learn.  </li>
            <li>I can already tell a difference in my very sensitive skin after just one use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does the trick!  </li>
            <li>is the first product that I can tell is actually working on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have to say that my 52 year old clear skin is no longer clear.</li>
            <li>It also helps clear up razor bumps.</li>
            <li>I am natural and I use this in my hair and on my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and my blemishes are gone.</li>
            <li>wash our hands frequently around here and</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t ask too much (as far as suds go).</li>
            <li>I had to mix it with the pepperming castille soap in order to not waste it it by throwing in trash.</li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to to pump black soap into your hands, but it quickly washes off and leaves a squeaky clean feeling.</li>
            <li>At least, that&#x27;s my personal experience :-)</li>
            <li>It helps to clear up and prevent my back acne.  </li>
            <li>: just got a Cuisipro 83758018 13.2-Ounce Foam Pump, works well with the African soap so far.</li>
            <li>It gently cleanses my face leaving my skin smooth as well as reduces the excessive oils I typically have.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying any black soap product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also the only body wash I can use on my decolletage and back because my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I combined those with my usual Shea butter and coconut oil regiment and my hair is soft and moisturized this morning!!!!!</li>
            <li>The latest outbreak was pretty bad, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to heal for weeks.</li>

            <li> The transition wasn&#x27;t fun, my scalp was sulking for chemicals, and it showed with serious limpness and the feeling of leftover residue.</li>
            <li> I buy this at whole foods usually.  </li>
            <li> I did try using it as a shampoo but found that it left weird residue that made my hair oily, but regardless fantastic</li>
            <li> tend to get random, mild outbreaks of deep acne.</li>
            <li> (I am 27 years old with the issues of pale dry skin and hormonal breakouts)</li>
            <li> My skin is not as dry and itchy after use.</li>
            <li> I will just stick to using it on my face daily and see if there is a difference in the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonya</li>

            <li> this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like a lot of other products.</li>
            <li> This is not at all what I expected from an Alaffia product.</li>
            <li> I actually have to wash much less!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break me out the way other body washes and lotions do.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I buy this at whole foods usually.  I have sensitive skin and it does the trick!  It cleanses and is gentle.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. I was struggling with pretty persistent acne, but this product really helped my skin clear up. I did try using it as a shampoo but found that it left weird residue that made my hair oily, but regardless fantastic</li>
            <li> I am natural and I use this in my hair and on my skin. It feels great as a face wash, and as a shampoo it is great because it lathers nicely.I am satisfied with my purchase thus far(I have only used it once in my hair but it did just fine compared to traditional shampoos). I mainly co-wash my hair, but when I feel like I need a deeper washing, I would use something like this. The hair may feel a little stringy after but you should use a good leave in conditioner(I like giavonni direct leave in). I combined those with my usual Shea butter and coconut oil regiment and my hair is soft and moisturized this morning!!!!! Give it a try. If you don&#x27;t like it in your hair, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;ll love it as a face wash. I would not use this as a body wash because it is just not thick enough(you would waste it by using too much).</li>
            <li> Got rid of my dandruff in just about 5 times of shampooing.Nice product.</li>
            <li> This is not at all what I expected from an Alaffia product. Very liquidy.  Will never order again. I am very surprised as though I have ordered many items from the co-op and all have been exceptionally good. They need to re-think this one.</li>
            <li> This African soap is about the only shampoo I can use on my hair. It is perfect for me, and I love it!</li>
            <li> Though I did not purchase this from Amazon, I wanted to write a review on it anyway. I bought it at Whole Foods a few days ago. I was excited to try it (as I am with most new products) and truly wanted to love it as well. I have to say that my 52 year old clear skin is no longer clear. I have blackheads after using this soap! I used it a few times and after using it again this morning, I will keep it off of my face. We&#x27;ll see what happens with the rest of my body as I have been using it as a back &#x27;scrub&#x27; as well. I did try to wash my bangs with it but did not like the feel after using it.&lt;br /&gt;now to find something to remove the blackheads I got after using this on my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, my entire family uses it. This soap is very versatile, we wash hair and body. I even use it on my toddler who&#x27;s has eczema. The scent is very refreshing and it rinses clear. My skin is not as dry and itchy after use. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was delighted by ingredients.... but it doesnot foam, and leaved dark residue on the sink... smells good, but dispenser clots too fast, will look for something else... dr Bronners soap seems to be the best so far, but it burns the eyes, cuts and intimate parts...&lt;br /&gt;Next step I will try to pour african black soap in the foaming dispenser to c how it works...but i will have to dilute with water... Bronners soap goes bad very fast if diluted with water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: just got a Cuisipro 83758018 13.2-Ounce Foam Pump, works well with the African soap so far. Have to dilute it 50-50 wit water though. SO even better the soap will last for a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE QUESTION IS: why manufacturer can not provide the bottle with a foam pump? That would be awesome.</li>
            <li> This is ONLY soap I trust enough to use on my face. I have sensitive skin and break out easily. As soon as I started using this, my breakouts cleared up. I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works on hair, but it did wonders for my skin. I prefer the citrus smell to the peppermint but the peppermint is pretty good too. Alaffia products have a fan for life!</li>
            <li> I was put off by the texture and i do love pepperment but the smell is very intense. I wont be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I use it on my face and body in the shower and it leaves my skin smooth and happy.  I buy the Unscented so I can add my own essential oils.  This company is amazing---they make natural, chemical free, fair trade products in large sizes with incredibly affordable prices.  HIghly recommend for everyone.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a body wash, with a loofa.  It helps to clear up and prevent my back acne.  The peppermint smell is very light, I wouldn&#x27;t have noticed it if I didn&#x27;t know it was peppermint.</li>
            <li> I got it fast and I will definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I use it as a face wash, body wash, and shampoo. I&#x27;ve struggled with acne and after just a few uses my skin is already clearer and very radiant. It also helps clear up razor bumps. 6 stars!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I feel it has helped me with my psoriasis and is very soothing to my skin. would recommend</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, and enjoy the tingle, but as relates to my hair, it takes to much to make it lather and then it still does not lather...I will just stick to using it on my face daily and see if there is a difference in the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonya</li>
            <li> Really different soap. Takes a little getting used to to pump black soap into your hands, but it quickly washes off and leaves a squeaky clean feeling. Makes a nice little off-beat gift.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product which can be used for everything in my shower routine. I wash my face, body, and hair with this and shave with it. For a week and a half I have been looking especially pretty and clean. My skin is soft and my blemishes are gone. Simplicity is ideal for me and this is one of my all time favorite beauty products now. It lathers gently and rinses well. I have observed no ill side effects at all but rather have determined that my skin is improving in tone, texture, and softness. (I am 27 years old with the issues of pale dry skin and hormonal breakouts) I do not know what the negative reviews are about...Try this soap if you love having a simple and effective beauty regime. This product has no faults.</li>
            <li> I have fine shoulder length hair that has some wave to it. I previously used L&#x27;Oreal for years. I switched to Alaffia because I&#x27;m about to move to Europe where the prices triple for the L&#x27;Oreal products, and I thought this big bottle was going to last me the seven months I would be gone. The transition period lasted a month, and now I&#x27;ve never been this impressed with my hair. It&#x27;s definitely fuller, shinier, and only needs a wash once a week, so I&#x27;m confident I won&#x27;t run out while overseas. The transition wasn&#x27;t fun, my scalp was sulking for chemicals, and it showed with serious limpness and the feeling of leftover residue. That is all gone, and now the adjustment I have to make is getting used to actual volume and strength. Huge bonus with the environmental and social cause benefits, this can&#x27;t be beat for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ABS initially but I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months and within a week, it was getting rid of my stubborn, under-the-chin and under-the-surface acne. It&#x27;s also the only body wash I can use on my decolletage and back because my skin is so sensitive. Doesn&#x27;t break me out the way other body washes and lotions do. Great for shaving, too. Apply with hands, not with loofah/scrubber/washcloth.</li>
            <li> This soap is incredible. We use it in the kitchen and bathrooms as a hand soap, in the shower as a body soap and as a shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;We wash our hands frequently around here and this soap doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like a lot of other products. Super gentle but effective.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair, but I love it on my face and in the shower. I had to buy a second bottle, because my husband tried it and never gave it back!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;I have natural kinky THICK hair that is almost IMPOSSIBLE to manage.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product that I can tell is actually working on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love how soft and detangled my hair is after I use this product.&lt;br /&gt;It lathers up well and the smell is not strong at all.&lt;br /&gt;I use black soap on the regular so I&#x27;m familiar with the black soap drying out the skin; you just have to be sure to follow up with a great moisturized afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;I use shea butter.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying any black soap product so I dont have much to compare it to but so far I have enjoyed using the Alaffia brand. Smells good and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> smells good not so sure it works on some stuff</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve been to numerous dermatologists many times over, and everything I tried only seemed to be a temporary fix for an ongoing problem. I came across this soap because I was desperate to find a solution that didn&#x27;t require yet another trip to the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to get random, mild outbreaks of deep acne. The latest outbreak was pretty bad, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to heal for weeks. I used this soap twice a day for a week, and by the end of the week I noticed a vast improvement. The scars were healing, the hard painful nodules were gone, and some of my other unrelated blemishes were gone or much lighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, there are a couple warnings I would give about using this product. If you exfoliate regularly, I wouldn&#x27;t use this soap more than once a day. If you have a build up of dead skin on your face as I did, twice of day would probably be okay for ~3 days but eventually you will be in pain. Overuse will cause your skin to dry out and become raw. That being said, also buy a high quality, alcohol-free moisturizer. Your face will thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I first tried the citrus when it was on sale at Whole Foods and liked it enough to buy it again and try the Peppermint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I confess I like this better than Dr Bronner&#x27;s as it feels a little more luxurious but still all-natural. As an aside, I realized this helped alleviate hot flashes that I usually get after a bath and/or workout.  The peppermint makes my skin feel balanced and refreshed without being over-stimulated.  At least, that&#x27;s my personal experience :-)</li>
            <li> would be tingling but it was not I only smell a little peppermint in the bottle if I had to reorder I would not this product is a joke but you live and learn.  I just hate sometimes a learning situation cost you money</li>
            <li> For those of you that don&#x27;t like this as a shampoo... You are probably using silicone hair products!! Most sulfate free shampoos have a hard time removing certain cones!!! I&#x27;ve been on a silicone free regimen and this shampoo has given me the best hair days. I actually have to wash much less! It&#x27;s very nice on my skin too. It has a medium lather, wish it were more but IT IS a sulfate free shampoo so I can&#x27;t ask too much (as far as suds go). I&#x27;d love to see more scents such as the earthy one mentioned by another reviewer. Great product!</li>
            <li> I buy this again and again. It is great stuff. It really works to make my skin squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Omg. I get acne that time of month i try everything. My ftiends bf uses this so i thought i would try it. My face after one night is so smooth. I&#x27;m never buying any other soap. It also came really fast and packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> This product is very liquidy and does not lather well with a rag or when used alone . tried to use on dreadlocks with the same results. I had to mix it with the pepperming castille soap in order to not waste it it by throwing in trash. Will not purchase again . Dr. Bronners 18-1 peppermint castille is just a loose liquid wise but lathers so much better.</li>
            <li> I purchased from Earth Fare, but wrote a review here because Amazon is so popular. I am so pleased with this product! I can already tell a difference in my very sensitive skin after just one use. I can&#x27;t wait to see how well it will work in the future. I have struggled with acne and blotchy skin for years and I&#x27;m so grateful for this awesome product. I also used the bar form (made by another company) as body wash and my skin feels great.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I love it. It gently cleanses my face leaving my skin smooth as well as reduces the excessive oils I typically have. I also use it as a shampoo after a deep conditioning and it is fantastic on my 4b hair. It smells great as well.</li>
