            <li>The pump was working great until day 4, now I have to life weights before I try to use it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered three items of the the Revaleskin line and the night cream was from BD Great Buys.  </li>

            <li>It is a great moisturizer, recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>The savings is great through Amazon but some time ago I made two purchases of the night cream and day cream with spf and both had expiration dates that were alomost a year old.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>

            <li>I used this product in good faith.  </li>
            <li>The night cream, revaleskin, is good</li>

            <li>Does good job of refreshing skin over night.</li>

            <li>Has a nice scent</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin, this product didn&#x27;t bother it at all (great!).  </li>
            <li>I have tried all kinds of antioxidants and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>I know it sounds too good to be true, but for me it has worked better than Obagi, Retin A, and at home chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>At 67 with a lifetime of sun exposure, I am really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I got this because I had recently checked out allure magazine&#x27;s best of 2009</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance.</li>
            <li>but after the two weeks, the dispenser on the top started to stick.  </li>
            <li>Many times, I had to push the top with my palms with my weight on it to get the product out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for several years and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Love them both.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products</li>
            <li>The price is more than I would like to pay</li>
            <li>As someone who has used Revalesking Night Cream for 3 years - I can say I love it, you will definately see a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 months and love it....</li>
            <li>Surprizingly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The derm charges way more than I found through Shaindy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I wake up with a better glow to my skin -</li>
            <li>I love the Revaleskin line for my roseacea.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I love this night cream.</li>
            <li>My skin looks better</li>
            <li>Also, stay out of the sun, not because of this product, but because that is the most damaging element to you skin!!!!!You will see results in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am using the 1.5 percent serum and the night cream twice a day and have reordered to be sure I won&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>They have improved the top</li>
            <li>It smells okay.</li>
            <li>but i dont think it is better than skin ceuticals.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a night cream feel and look this good on my face right off the bat.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is very light, not greasy feeling at all.  </li>
            <li>I love that this is not a super-thick night cream and have seen results very quickly.</li>
            <li>Like I said in the beginning, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it, but to me it&#x27;s a very good sign that I like it so much just after one try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer - and I really can&#x27;t tell yet if it has good anti-aging results</li>
            <li>I am very sure the positive reviews are fictitious.</li>
            <li>And what I do smell is a very mild herbal scent.</li>
            <li>It has without a doubt improved my skins texture, reduced redness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>It feels good and smells good and just  a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li>A huge difference in price and drive time.</li>
            <li>This, along with a daily routine that includes CE Feurlic in the morning, NIA 24 Skin Strengthening cream and a retinol cream at night, I would&#x27;ve been happy just to maintain the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>to cant say enough how great it makes my skin look</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has a light finish that isn&#x27;t overly lotion-y.</li>
            <li>And my skin looks and feels smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>but I can vouch for the fantastic results on my redness.</li>
            <li>Their toll free number directs you to their website.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really light.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on my skin and over time has definitely reduced aging/sun damaged brown spots.  </li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>A good product to use every morning after your shower to keep your face skin looking healthy especially if you spend time in the sun.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and for the first couple of weeks, the product came out fine and the material inside seemed to be okay</li>
            <li>Some of the brown spots disappeared and others became much lighter and could more easily be covered with make-up.</li>
            <li>Love how fast &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product from my dermatologist for fading some of the sun spots that were beginning to appear on my face.</li>
            <li>I did not see any significant difference.</li>
            <li>Even though the products are pricey, to me they are worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I am 71 years old and my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li>The entire line of Revaleskin products are superior.</li>
            <li>The other two- intensive treatment and cleansing cream- were great from the packaging to the material inside it but</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first couple of nights seemed fine - the product absorbed well, but had a funky smell.  </li>
            <li>The pump is very cheap and you have to press down just so for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t an easy way to unscrew the lid to get into the bottle because it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>I first purchased this lotion at the doctors and was really excited to find it online at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>But, the smell is a bit strong, and while not unpleasant it also isn&#x27;t particularly enticing.</li>
            <li>I was using Prevage MD but developed an allergy to it after the formula was changed; I&#x27;ve switched to Revaleskin Day Cream, Night Cream and Facial Cleanser and am very happy with these products so far.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel so smooth my wrinkles have gotten smaller</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>This felt good, and I had not allergic problems with the coffeeberry, but saw no real change in my skin, after finishing it.  </li>
            <li>I use the night cream every night on freshly cleaned skin.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective product for uneven pigmentation.  </li>
            <li>Seems just right and the coffeeberry minimizes pores and redness.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the Intense Recovery Treatment from this same vendor because it is also recommended by my dermatologist and I have liked the results.</li>
            <li>With a regular routine started Jan. 2013, I am astonished and pleased with the improvement.</li>
            <li>Just received this today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>They were very prompt in getting it to me, and I appreciate that!</li>
            <li>It is gentle and it smooths your skin without break outs and keeps the wrinkles away!</li>
            <li>Revaleskin is a product I had been wanting to try and was pleased when the REAL AGE health tips recommended it through a medical doctor they have on staff.  </li>
            <li>the one from BD Great Buys was first of all, in a language other than english.   </li>
            <li>After reading so much positive press and reviews on the product, I decided to save up and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does absorb FAST!</li>
            <li>This was the first time she really saw changes from a cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a facial moisturizer go on so smoothly and absorb so fast.</li>
            <li>but if it really would fade some of those brown spots on my face I would try anything.</li>
            <li>I have high hopes!</li>
            <li>I just purchased the intense therapy version to use on my hands as they also have redness.</li>
            <li>But the bottle for the intense Recovery Treatment broke.</li>
            <li>The coffeeberry seems to give skin a real glow.  </li>
            <li>It really evens out my complexion and my skin feels toner.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I wash my face to get ready for bed.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles at this point, but this product really has made a difference.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It really reduces redness.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really how much until I ran out for a month and was using something else.</li>
            <li>sometimes too much.</li>
            <li>For the money spent I am sure there r other products much better.</li>
            <li>I like this product better than any other night creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li>However, the price still bothered me so when I needed some more I checked on line and found it through Amazon at about $25 less.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>(and there were MANY including some VERY expensive brands), this cream gave the most visible results!</li>
            <li>It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and</li>
            <li>I feel like it is BD Great Buys who are selling questionable products.  </li>
            <li>Not very creamy or rich-</li>
            <li>When I contacted the manufacturer, US CosmeceuTechs in Richmond, Va about it, they said that I had to contact the vendor to get a new one, not them.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive nose, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this at night for several months now and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance and this still works for me.</li>
            <li>Plus, it makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of the few reviews about the strong scent...</li>
            <li>I put it on several evenings and mornings without any large improvement.  </li>
            <li>Originally received this from my dermatologist and saw it on amazon for less money.</li>
            <li>and I was surprised.</li>
            <li>When you are spending this much on a product - you need to know the supplier will back you up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking antibiotics and using topical prescription meds, but one thing that has really made a difference for me is the Revaleskin product line.  </li>
            <li>The complete Revale line of skin care was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothe and makes my skin feel so soft immediately.</li>
            <li>Well, I can&#x27;t see a difference, and who knows if it is really preventing any future damage?  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this product has not hurt my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and has very FEW fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Got this product because I ran out of a more expensive moisturizer for night time and was interested in seeing what the coffeeberry would do for me.</li>
            <li>I use this regularly and the redness that is normally in my skin has all but disappeared.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it at all.</li>
            <li>I was going to wait at least a couple weeks to write my review, but I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and I am not young.  </li>
            <li>My skin has been dry of late (weather, age, heat, A/C), and it is hard to find something that&#x27;s rich enough but not too rich for the skin.</li>
            <li>pump was initially VERY frustrating to deal with though, but I just ended-up twisting the pump to different directions, and I found some sort of \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; which now allows the cream to REALLY come out...</li>

            <li> It feels good and smells good and just  a little dab will do ya.</li>
            <li> A huge difference in price and drive time.</li>
            <li> This, along with a daily routine that includes CE Feurlic in the morning, NIA 24 Skin Strengthening cream and a retinol cream at night, I would&#x27;ve been happy just to maintain the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> to cant say enough how great it makes my skin look</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has a light finish that isn&#x27;t overly lotion-y.</li>
            <li> And my skin looks and feels smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> but I can vouch for the fantastic results on my redness.</li>
            <li> Their toll free number directs you to their website.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really light.  </li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin and over time has definitely reduced aging/sun damaged brown spots.  </li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> A good product to use every morning after your shower to keep your face skin looking healthy especially if you spend time in the sun.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it and for the first couple of weeks, the product came out fine and the material inside seemed to be okay</li>
            <li> Some of the brown spots disappeared and others became much lighter and could more easily be covered with make-up.</li>
            <li> Love how fast &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product from my dermatologist for fading some of the sun spots that were beginning to appear on my face.</li>
            <li> I did not see any significant difference.</li>
            <li> Even though the products are pricey, to me they are worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I am 71 years old and my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> The entire line of Revaleskin products are superior.</li>
            <li> The other two- intensive treatment and cleansing cream- were great from the packaging to the material inside it but</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first couple of nights seemed fine - the product absorbed well, but had a funky smell.  </li>
            <li> The pump is very cheap and you have to press down just so for it to be effective.  </li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t an easy way to unscrew the lid to get into the bottle because it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> I first purchased this lotion at the doctors and was really excited to find it online at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> But, the smell is a bit strong, and while not unpleasant it also isn&#x27;t particularly enticing.</li>
            <li> I was using Prevage MD but developed an allergy to it after the formula was changed; I&#x27;ve switched to Revaleskin Day Cream, Night Cream and Facial Cleanser and am very happy with these products so far.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel so smooth my wrinkles have gotten smaller</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This felt good, and I had not allergic problems with the coffeeberry, but saw no real change in my skin, after finishing it.  </li>
            <li> I use the night cream every night on freshly cleaned skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product for uneven pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> Seems just right and the coffeeberry minimizes pores and redness.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the Intense Recovery Treatment from this same vendor because it is also recommended by my dermatologist and I have liked the results.</li>
            <li> With a regular routine started Jan. 2013, I am astonished and pleased with the improvement.</li>
            <li> Just received this today and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> They were very prompt in getting it to me, and I appreciate that!</li>
            <li> It is gentle and it smooths your skin without break outs and keeps the wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> Revaleskin is a product I had been wanting to try and was pleased when the REAL AGE health tips recommended it through a medical doctor they have on staff.  </li>
            <li> the one from BD Great Buys was first of all, in a language other than english.   </li>
            <li> After reading so much positive press and reviews on the product, I decided to save up and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does absorb FAST!</li>
            <li> This was the first time she really saw changes from a cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a facial moisturizer go on so smoothly and absorb so fast.</li>
            <li> but if it really would fade some of those brown spots on my face I would try anything.</li>
            <li> I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> I just purchased the intense therapy version to use on my hands as they also have redness.</li>
            <li> But the bottle for the intense Recovery Treatment broke.</li>
            <li> The coffeeberry seems to give skin a real glow.  </li>
            <li> It really evens out my complexion and my skin feels toner.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my face to get ready for bed.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles at this point, but this product really has made a difference.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It really reduces redness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really how much until I ran out for a month and was using something else.</li>
            <li> sometimes too much.</li>
            <li> For the money spent I am sure there r other products much better.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any other night creams I have tried.  </li>
            <li> However, the price still bothered me so when I needed some more I checked on line and found it through Amazon at about $25 less.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> (and there were MANY including some VERY expensive brands), this cream gave the most visible results!</li>
            <li> It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and</li>
            <li> I feel like it is BD Great Buys who are selling questionable products.  </li>
            <li> Not very creamy or rich-</li>
            <li> When I contacted the manufacturer, US CosmeceuTechs in Richmond, Va about it, they said that I had to contact the vendor to get a new one, not them.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive nose, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night for several months now and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance and this still works for me.</li>
            <li> Plus, it makes my skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of the few reviews about the strong scent...</li>
            <li> I put it on several evenings and mornings without any large improvement.  </li>
            <li> Originally received this from my dermatologist and saw it on amazon for less money.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised.</li>
            <li> When you are spending this much on a product - you need to know the supplier will back you up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking antibiotics and using topical prescription meds, but one thing that has really made a difference for me is the Revaleskin product line.  </li>
            <li> The complete Revale line of skin care was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothe and makes my skin feel so soft immediately.</li>
            <li> Well, I can&#x27;t see a difference, and who knows if it is really preventing any future damage?  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, and this product has not hurt my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and has very FEW fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Got this product because I ran out of a more expensive moisturizer for night time and was interested in seeing what the coffeeberry would do for me.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and the redness that is normally in my skin has all but disappeared.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it at all.</li>
            <li> I was going to wait at least a couple weeks to write my review, but I&#x27;m so excited</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and I am not young.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been dry of late (weather, age, heat, A/C), and it is hard to find something that&#x27;s rich enough but not too rich for the skin.</li>
            <li> pump was initially VERY frustrating to deal with though, but I just ended-up twisting the pump to different directions, and I found some sort of \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; which now allows the cream to REALLY come out...</li>
            <li> It seems to restore your skin&#x27;s natural pigment, lightening dark spots &amp; returning color to white scars.  </li>
            <li> My fiancé has been using this cream for a long time and finds it to be very solid.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will work over time, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I&#x27;m normally used to for a night cream!  </li>
            <li> My skin has been clear, less flaky and truly re-energized.</li>
            <li> 3 messages later on their website (over a 3 week period)and all have gone unanswered.    </li>
            <li> Maybe I just got the only bad one but for the cost it should work better.</li>
            <li> which I guess some might like, but I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no better or worse than your average face cream, just cost more.</li>
            <li> My skin is less red and flaky, and doesn&#x27;t itch and burn like it used to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not particularly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It does the job other products were not doing for aging dry spot skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unacceptable to charge that much money for a product and fail on something so basic like a pump.</li>
            <li> It has appreciably changed the texture of my skin, creating a creamy complexion which I never would have expected.</li>
            <li> When I opened it up the wrinkled box, the label on the bottle was completely askew, coming off the edges.   </li>
            <li> Does have a slightly strong scent, but i don&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I saw no positive effect.</li>
            <li> … The only downfall is it&#x27;s a little expensive and it smells a little funny.</li>
            <li> and my dermatologist has me on a regiment of alternating this cream and a retinol cream, every other night.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and visibly smoother, even after the first night&#x27;s use, and I have always used really expensive products.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line this product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have not experienced any itching or blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old and have been using this product for approximately 4 years.  </li>
            <li> I need a little moisturizer though</li>
            <li> I am not sure that what I previously wrote went thru.</li>
            <li> In addition to the unsatisfactory results of the cream, there are other problems; the pump-action delivery system does not deliver, the vacuum fails, the cap falls off.</li>
            <li> I was left with expensive debris.</li>
            <li> I HAVE returned cosmetics in the past just because of their scent.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The worst product I ever purchased, it last few days even thought you paid so much money for it.</li>
            <li> I will say that the pump is awful, you would think something as little as the pump wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with such a high end beauty product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously about to destroy the bottle and move the cream into something else.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is very hard to push down to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> Having rosacea it is hard to find a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin-</li>
            <li> I am slow to learn.  </li>
            <li> At $108 I thought it was rather expensive for a little bottle of face cream</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s hard to come by!</li>
            <li> I have very delicate skin</li>
            <li> I wish the container would be improved.&lt;br /&gt;The product is too expensive to lose some (and you do)</li>
            <li> when the cotainer fails</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product for three reasons:  </li>
            <li> But, buyer beware - Skinmedix will not stand behind items you purchase from them!  </li>
            <li> Expensive department store brands and cheaper drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> This is dangerous since the products are used daily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells bad.  </li>
            <li> However, I was doubtful but because it was being recommended by my dermatologist I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> and I was to stupid to get it to work!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish the container would be improved.&lt;br /&gt;The product is too expensive to lose some (and you do) when the cotainer fails</li>
            <li> At 67 with a lifetime of sun exposure, I am really pleased with this product. I&#x27;ve tried the best of them. This, along with a daily routine that includes CE Feurlic in the morning, NIA 24 Skin Strengthening cream and a retinol cream at night, I would&#x27;ve been happy just to maintain the condition of my skin. With a regular routine started Jan. 2013, I am astonished and pleased with the improvement.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel so smooth my wrinkles have gotten smaller to cant say enough how great it makes my skin look, I even have a glow. Wonderful product</li>
            <li> I got this because I had recently checked out allure magazine&#x27;s best of 2009 and they recommended it. Now I&#x27;m a believer! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product from my dermatologist for fading some of the sun spots that were beginning to appear on my face. At $108 I thought it was rather expensive for a little bottle of face cream but if it really would fade some of those brown spots on my face I would try anything. However, I was doubtful but because it was being recommended by my dermatologist I decided to give it a try. Well, it did work! Some of the brown spots disappeared and others became much lighter and could more easily be covered with make-up. However, the price still bothered me so when I needed some more I checked on line and found it through Amazon at about $25 less. I&#x27;m happier when I look in the mirror, and my wallet!</li>
            <li> I was using Prevage MD but developed an allergy to it after the formula was changed; I&#x27;ve switched to Revaleskin Day Cream, Night Cream and Facial Cleanser and am very happy with these products so far.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it will work over time, but doesn&#x27;t moisturize as much as I&#x27;m normally used to for a night cream!  Not very creamy or rich- which I guess some might like, but I have dry skin so I like my night creams to be thicker.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is very hard to push down to dispense the product. Maybe I just got the only bad one but for the cost it should work better.</li>
            <li> On the recommendation of my Dermatologist, I purchased Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry 1.7 oz. I bought this four times.  I am slow to learn.  I used this product in good faith.  After all, a physician recommended I do so.  I saw no positive effect. In addition to the unsatisfactory results of the cream, there are other problems; the pump-action delivery system does not deliver, the vacuum fails, the cap falls off. I was left with expensive debris.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product alternately with retin A nightly for 1.5 years. It has appreciably changed the texture of my skin, creating a creamy complexion which I never would have expected.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001185D3O Revaleskin by Revaleskin: Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry 1.7 oz]]    This is a wonder-worker. Seems to melt away the wrinkles  while you sleep. It feels good and smells good and just  a little dab will do ya. It is the best I&#x27;ve found for  wrinkles, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of night cream from my Dermatologist. Two applications and the lip lines around my mouth were going away. My husband was so impressed that he bought me a set of Revaleskin cleaner, day cream and night cream. I am very happy with the results. I am 71 years old and my skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin, this product didn&#x27;t bother it at all (great!).  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and haven&#x27;t noticed any results yet, so the verdict is still out on that.  The pump was working great until day 4, now I have to life weights before I try to use it.  I&#x27;m seriously about to destroy the bottle and move the cream into something else.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this product for three reasons:  It smells bad.  The pump is very cheap and you have to press down just so for it to be effective.  I have seen no beneficial results from using this product.</li>
            <li> The night cream, revaleskin, is good but I cannot get it out of the dispenser. I thought I was saving money by ordering this through amazon, but the revaleskin company does not stand by their product. They sent me one e-mail telling me that they had a revolutionary dispenser and I was to stupid to get it to work!  They did not follow up with me, or offer any resolution.</li>
            <li> I like this night cream a lot. It goes on smoothly and has a light finish that isn&#x27;t overly lotion-y. But, the smell is a bit strong, and while not unpleasant it also isn&#x27;t particularly enticing.</li>
            <li> Just received this today and used it for the first time. I was going to wait at least a couple weeks to write my review, but I&#x27;m so excited I can&#x27;t wait!&lt;br /&gt;1. The scent: practically non-existant! I almost didn&#x27;t buy this because of the few reviews about the strong scent... But I&#x27;m glad I gave it a chance. I can barely smell it at all. And what I do smell is a very mild herbal scent. I have a very sensitive nose, too. I HAVE returned cosmetics in the past just because of their scent.&lt;br /&gt;2. It really does absorb FAST! I&#x27;ve never had a facial moisturizer go on so smoothly and absorb so fast. And my skin looks and feels smooth and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;3. Like I said in the beginning, this is the first time I&#x27;ve used it, but to me it&#x27;s a very good sign that I like it so much just after one try. I&#x27;ve never had a night cream feel and look this good on my face right off the bat. I have high hopes!</li>
            <li> I have been using the eye replenishing therapy for several months. I did not see any significant difference. I put it on several evenings and mornings without any large improvement.  I have been using for over 6 months and would rather have a refund. Bottom line this product is not worth the money. I am very sure the positive reviews are fictitious. For the money spent I am sure there r other products much better.</li>
            <li> I ordered three items of the the Revaleskin line and the night cream was from BD Great Buys.  The other two- intensive treatment and cleansing cream- were great from the packaging to the material inside it but the one from BD Great Buys was first of all, in a language other than english.   When I opened it up the wrinkled box, the label on the bottle was completely askew, coming off the edges.   I decided to try it and for the first couple of weeks, the product came out fine and the material inside seemed to be okay but after the two weeks, the dispenser on the top started to stick.  Many times, I had to push the top with my palms with my weight on it to get the product out.  Even though the discount was good, why does a $60 product feel like something from the dollar store?  I feel like it is BD Great Buys who are selling questionable products.  The recovery cream and the cleanser are amazing in material and the packaging. It never gave me any problem.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly and the redness that is normally in my skin has all but disappeared. I just purchased the intense therapy version to use on my hands as they also have redness. I don&#x27;t use this as a moisturizer - and I really can&#x27;t tell yet if it has good anti-aging results but I can vouch for the fantastic results on my redness.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that what I previously wrote went thru. I have used this product for several years because it is recommended by my dermatologist.I have liked the results. I also ordered the Intense Recovery Treatment from this same vendor because it is also recommended by my dermatologist and I have liked the results. But the bottle for the intense Recovery Treatment broke. When I contacted the manufacturer, US CosmeceuTechs in Richmond, Va about it, they said that I had to contact the vendor to get a new one, not them. So, how about it, Amazon vendor? I have never had a Revale skin product bottle break before and I was surprised.</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizing cream both day and night.  The only difference between the day and night creams is that the day has SPF in it.  It goes on easily and is very light, not greasy feeling at all.  The coffeeberry seems to give skin a real glow.  I&#x27;ve used this brand for several years and have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer every morning and evening along with the Coffeeberry extract eye cream (which is used all over my face and neck).  Love them both.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have not experienced any itching or blemishes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products but I keep coming back to Revaleskin.  It does what it claims.  I always get complements on my skin and astonishment at my age.  My skin looks 10 years younger. Because of the cost, I don&#x27;t use all their products. The price is more than I would like to pay but I have found that using just the night cream is enough for me.</li>
            <li> As someone who has used Revalesking Night Cream for 3 years - I can say I love it, you will definately see a difference.  But, buyer beware - Skinmedix will not stand behind items you purchase from them!  A pump on a bottle of Revaleskin that I bought misfunctioned immediately after opening, so I tried to contact Skinmedix to get a replacement.  Their toll free number directs you to their website.  3 messages later on their website (over a 3 week period)and all have gone unanswered.    When you are spending this much on a product - you need to know the supplier will back you up.  Skinmedix is not that supplier!!</li>
            <li> Excellent face cream.  I combine it with retin A ad find that is a good combo for me.</li>
            <li> The worst product I ever purchased, it last few days even thought you paid so much money for it. i will never buy it again from that vendor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 months and love it....a superior antioxidant backed up by science.</li>
            <li> Surprizingly pleased with the results. Didn&#x27;t give my hyper-sensitive skin a problem. Works well on my puffy eyes. Saw the results in one application. I need a little moisturizer though so I put my kinerase over it which I&#x27;ve been using for years over it.</li>
            <li> I am  a very  happy  to use Revaleskin</li>
            <li> I love this antioxidant cream! I have tried all kinds of antioxidants and this is by far the best! I can actually see the results.  It really evens out my complexion and my skin feels toner.  I gave my mom a bottle and she loves this Revaleskin night cream. This was the first time she really saw changes from a cream. I have no problem with the scent...it&#x27;s really light.  Of all the facial products I used (and there were MANY including some VERY expensive brands), this cream gave the most visible results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had rosacea for over 15 years.  I&#x27;ve been taking antibiotics and using topical prescription meds, but one thing that has really made a difference for me is the Revaleskin product line.  I started out using the night cream (though i use it in the morning after cleansing), and recently began using the cleanser.  Both were recommended by my dermatologist and aesthetician.  My skin is less red and flaky, and doesn&#x27;t itch and burn like it used to.  Even though the products are pricey, to me they are worth every penny!  Does have a slightly strong scent, but i don&#x27;t find it unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I have Roseacea and was recommended this product by my dermatologist. It has without a doubt improved my skins texture, reduced redness and fine lines. I have had friends ask me what I have done to my face. Amazon is about $20 cheaper than my dermatologist and the quality appears the same. I will say that the pump is awful, you would think something as little as the pump wouldn&#x27;t be an issue with such a high end beauty product.</li>
            <li> Got this product because I ran out of a more expensive moisturizer for night time and was interested in seeing what the coffeeberry would do for me. My skin has been dry of late (weather, age, heat, A/C), and it is hard to find something that&#x27;s rich enough but not too rich for the skin. I&#x27;ve been using this at night for several months now and like it very much. Seems just right and the coffeeberry minimizes pores and redness. I will get this again.</li>
            <li> After reading so much positive press and reviews on the product, I decided to save up and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of nights seemed fine - the product absorbed well, but had a funky smell.  Then the pump just locked up and stopped working.  There wasn&#x27;t an easy way to unscrew the lid to get into the bottle because it&#x27;s very airtight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say I returned it.  It&#x27;s unacceptable to charge that much money for a product and fail on something so basic like a pump.</li>
            <li> This is a product my dermatologist recommended to help soothe any redness in my skin as I have a tendency toward rosacea. The derm charges way more than I found through Shaindy&#x27;s. They were very prompt in getting it to me, and I appreciate that!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing skin product. That is why I Love It! I hope you try it and have the same results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  My skin is sensitive and I am not young.  The complete Revale line of skin care was recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my face to get ready for bed.  Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> The best night cream ever!  I hope this will always be manufactured.  It is gentle and it smooths your skin without break outs and keeps the wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> Revateskin definitely smoothes lines and wrinkles. Diminishes under eye shadows and circles. Skin looks and feels smoothe and even toned.</li>
            <li> My fiancé has been using this cream for a long time and finds it to be very solid. It is a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Does good job of refreshing skin over night.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my skin… The only downfall is it&#x27;s a little expensive and it smells a little funny.</li>
            <li> These is recommended by my dermatologist and does help in replenishing your skin.  It makes your skin feel very refreshed.</li>
            <li> I first purchased this lotion at the doctors and was really excited to find it online at Amazon.  A huge difference in price and drive time.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by a facial plastic surgeon and I have actually seen a difference in the depth of my wrinkles on my face. I&#x27;m in my mid-50&#x27;s so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles at this point, but this product really has made a difference. I also use this cream on my neck and chest area and it has even helped the wrinkles there so I think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This felt good, and I had not allergic problems with the coffeeberry, but saw no real change in my skin, after finishing it.  I&#x27;m looking for results!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I have been using for years.  Feels great on my skin and over time has definitely reduced aging/sun damaged brown spots.  Originally received this from my dermatologist and saw it on amazon for less money.</li>
            <li> I love that this is not a super-thick night cream and have seen results very quickly. I wake up with a better glow to my skin - I&#x27;m 41 and that&#x27;s hard to come by! My skin has been clear, less flaky and truly re-energized. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Revaleskin is a product I had been wanting to try and was pleased when the REAL AGE health tips recommended it through a medical doctor they have on staff.  However, when I received my order, I discovered that the product contains parabens, which can cause cancer.  As a result, I have not and will not use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product once a week for a few months and really like it. It goes on smoothe and makes my skin feel so soft immediately.</li>
            <li> This product has not made a difference in my skin that I can see.  My dermatologist recommended that I add an anti-oxidant serum to my skin care regimen and said that this would fill that gap.  Well, I can&#x27;t see a difference, and who knows if it is really preventing any future damage?  I have sensitive skin, and this product has not hurt my skin.  This is why I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> This product has a chemical ordor. I love the Revaleskin line for my roseacea.  I used to use the day and night cream.</li>
            <li> This is my second time to order and I really like this product.  My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> This is a great night cream that is lower priced than a lot of over priced dept store creams.  It is light and absorbs well.  My skin is firmer from using this cream.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream. I use it as a moisturizer day and night. It really reduces redness. I didn&#x27;t really how much until I ran out for a month and was using something else. Yikes, red nose and cheeks returned. It is a great moisturizer, recommended by my dermatologist. I have very sensitive skin and am allergic to fragrance and this still works for me. I have been using it for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I like this product better than any other night creams I have tried.  It can be used in the daytime as well.  Skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li> The entire line of Revaleskin products are superior. The savings is great through Amazon but some time ago I made two purchases of the night cream and day cream with spf and both had expiration dates that were alomost a year old.&lt;br /&gt;Once the exp dates were scratched off. This is dangerous since the products are used daily.&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased the intensive recovery treatment, eye replenishing therapy and night and day creams from Dermstore.com where they guarantee the products. It&#x27;s your money and it&#x27;s your skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally HUNDREDS of anti-wrinkle creams, serums, masks, you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it.  Expensive department store brands and cheaper drug store brands.  This product is the BEST I have ever used.  I&#x27;m 58 years old and have been using this product for approximately 4 years.  My skin looks better then it did 10 years ago.  People think I&#x27;m 10 years younger than I am.  I use the night cream every night on freshly cleaned skin. I NEVER go to bed with make up on.  My skin is so soft and has very FEW fine lines.  Also, stay out of the sun, not because of this product, but because that is the most damaging element to you skin!!!!!You will see results in a couple of weeks.  Absolutely the best product I have ever used.  Worth every penny!!!</li>
            <li> This product was recommend by our dermatologist.  It does the job other products were not doing for aging dry spot skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective product for uneven pigmentation.  It seems to restore your skin&#x27;s natural pigment, lightening dark spots &amp; returning color to white scars.  I know it sounds too good to be true, but for me it has worked better than Obagi, Retin A, and at home chemical peels.  Plus, it makes my skin very soft.  I am using the 1.5 percent serum and the night cream twice a day and have reordered to be sure I won&#x27;t run out.  I sincerely hope this review helps someone else!</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time. Revaleskin Night Cream with Coffeeberry is a bisque colored cream that you apply nightly. It&#x27;s no better or worse than your average face cream, just cost more. I recommend trying either another brand or a different product.</li>
            <li> I have been using revaleskin for about 1 year.  I am very happy with it.  Having rosacea it is hard to find a product that works well and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin- kinda can&#x27;t go without it  (at this price I stocked an extra bottle)</li>
            <li> I have very delicate skin and my dermatologist has me on a regiment of alternating this cream and a retinol cream, every other night.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and when I checked back in with the doctor recently he still recommended it.</li>
            <li> Use nightly to help prevent aging spots.. In newer conatiners now. They have improved the top so  that product does not coagulate .</li>
            <li> A good product to use every morning after your shower to keep your face skin looking healthy especially if you spend time in the sun.</li>
            <li> Expensive but I will scrimp,elsewhere, but not on night cream. Even got my husband hooked on it. Smoothed out my skin on face and arms</li>
            <li> This product is great. It has a bit of a different (not bad, just not ordinary) sent and it is a bit tacky for a few minutes after application, but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I cannot say I see any benefits. It smells okay. It&#x27;s not particularly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent but i dont think it is better than skin ceuticals.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.  My skin is so much better. Love how fast &amp; easy to use. I recommend this</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for 3 months now, and I apply it after cleansing my face with MD Forte&#x27;s Facial Cleanser III.  My skin is softer and visibly smoother, even after the first night&#x27;s use, and I have always used really expensive products.  I alternate this 1% coffeeberry night cream with MD Forte&#x27;s Facial Cream III so that I get the benefits of glycolic acid to stimulate collagen renewal/synthesis, and 1% coffeeberry&#x27;s antioxidant effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump was initially VERY frustrating to deal with though, but I just ended-up twisting the pump to different directions, and I found some sort of \\&quot;sweet spot\\&quot; which now allows the cream to REALLY come out...sometimes too much.</li>
