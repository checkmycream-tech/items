            <li> Hard to use, but when used correctly it helps manage my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The brush was what I expected. When I received it, one of the brushes was broken off. I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back because then I&#x27;d have to wait even longer for it then what I already waited. And it did take a while.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure what it is supposed to do. Makes my straight hair kinda staticky. But if I use it with product is smoothed fly away hairs wonderful. Overall pretty good</li>
            <li> It came broken and I don&#x27;t even want to order a new one because it looks soo cheap. I would do better making my own .</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that will give you good arm exercise when trying to straighten it. Noticed somebody at the local salon using this and I decided to try it out myself. Worked like a charm! So much easier to handle hair without worrying that it is too hot to touch. Also provide enough tension to hair so straightening is more even and helps with soothing frizz.</li>
            <li> It works well.  I wish that it had options to hold open or closed but it must be hand held shut to use.  It seems to be more durable than other that I have used.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a vented one. But it is of good qaulity.</li>
            <li> perfect product for achieving salon style straight hair! love it very much.</li>
            <li> My mom liked it she has very thick hair and it helps her to flaten it easier and faster but it kind of looks like it&#x27;ll break fast we&#x27;ll have to see so far its a good item</li>
            <li> I am waiting on a new brush , because the other one was defected , they responded fast and made it an easy process once I recieved the brush I will follow up thankyou</li>
            <li> Great disappointment. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Arrived broken, threw it in the garbage :(</li>
            <li> This is good! and seller Vkteck is reliable company.</li>
            <li> I like this brush but the next time I get one of these I will get the one with air vents.</li>
            <li> i had been using plastic ones that kept breaking but not this one.</li>
