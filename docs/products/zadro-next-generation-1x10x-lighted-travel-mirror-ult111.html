            <li>The mirrors are perfect and stay put.  </li>
            <li>It is well lighted, the arm extends to a convenient height, and the magnification is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution.  </li>
            <li>and it is so perfect.  </li>
            <li>but I am still on the look-out for the perfect travel mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great product &amp; seller was great to work with!</li>
            <li>The 10X is great for close make up application and eye contact use.</li>
            <li>I do not consider this to be a great at home makeup mirror, though it could function as one.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is great for home and traveling.</li>
            <li>I use this at home and this is a great travel mirror.  </li>
            <li>Great travel mirror.</li>
            <li>mirror is great but couldn&#x27;t use the plug I bought for it even though it said it was designed for use with that model number.</li>
            <li>Great concept and like the flexibilty of the mirror, but the switch to turn it off &amp; on is a bit temperamental and doesn&#x27;t work all the time</li>
            <li>so I just used it with a table lamp and it worked out great.</li>
            <li>And while the mirror can use batteries, it isn&#x27;t as bright.</li>
            <li>The materials used is sturdy and the design is superior.</li>
            <li>Good lighting.</li>
            <li>Good price and good service.</li>
            <li>The light and height is just perfect for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice travel mirror - lighting is probably great for the majority of users - I prefer more light</li>
            <li>But if you just need one to throw in your carry on bag while traveling, this fits the bill quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have one of these and traveled with a friend who really liked it.  </li>
            <li>IT WAS KIND OF YOUR OPTION.</li>
            <li>So good I was able to tweeze my eyebrows without glasses.</li>
            <li>Nice quality mirror</li>
            <li>Awesome high quality makeup mirror.</li>
            <li>I have not found any travel mirror that is this bright and easy to take along.</li>
            <li>looking for a suitable replacement for years.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I can see very well, the light is very bright but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to worry about lighting and mirrors in hotel bathrooms any more.</li>
            <li>I wish the lights on this mirror were more like that.  </li>
            <li>Find something better.</li>
            <li>The bathroom lights would be better which defeats the purpose of me getting this.</li>
            <li>: Since I use it mostly as a mounted mirror (rather than travel) the 1x mirror just gets in the way.</li>
            <li>But I have tried numerous travel mirrors and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re OK...</li>
            <li>7.x inches... don&#x27;t expect magic here.  </li>
            <li>the top broke off within 1 week of use.</li>
            <li>OK I thought, the box states it has a lifetime bulb.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it.  </li>
            <li>I had the prior version of this and it was awesome.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use the plug if you don&#x27;t want to.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my 8th unit in as many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xt6bandit</li>
            <li>I am buying more as gifts.  </li>
            <li>: There are many.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like candlelight.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to carry so many batteries all the time.  </li>
            <li>I found another one (also Zadro) that I ordered from Amazon and like it much better.  </li>
            <li>Perfect mirror to travel with for long trips.  </li>
            <li>The 10X mirror is really good for &amp;#34;close-up work&amp;#34; and the light is bright enough (it is brighter than the lights on most makeup mirrors).  </li>
            <li>There needs to be an additional light on the top mirror.</li>
            <li>And, it does not provide very good light with only batteries.  </li>
            <li>It folds up for easy storage and travel.</li>
            <li>And the normal mirror was a good quality</li>
            <li>I do like this mirror, mostly like that it extends higher than most...</li>
            <li>The light on my normal makeup mirror is yellowish and not super bright, it&#x27;s perfect.  </li>
            <li>This is a good travel mirror except that it&#x27;s very dimly lit.</li>
            <li>The light and magnification are more than adequate.  </li>
            <li>: Even light.</li>
            <li>Cheap.</li>
            <li>Mirror is free from distortion&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Magnifying 5-inch Mirror Light, and learned why I should have stuck with this one.  </li>
            <li>Light -  </li>
            <li>She was pleasantly surprised at how bright it was and</li>
            <li>The light on the mirror is bright enough to see and I just love having the clock on this</li>
            <li>the bottom mirror has a 10X with light.  </li>
            <li>The reason is the light lasts forever</li>
            <li>Now the light lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>I just wish there was a light on the 1X mirror.</li>
            <li>All my life I have needed to examine my eyebrows and smooth my face EVERY day.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t accept this mirror if it was free.</li>
            <li>I have to replace it every couple of years because the light goes out around the bottom part that lights up eventually</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flat and lightweight and great for travel.</li>
            <li>To use this &amp;#34;warranty&amp;#34; you have to pay shipping to the mfg, enclose the original receipt (why???</li>
            <li>the two mirrors work well together and the light provides the right amount of light.</li>
            <li>The lights on it are bright white and do not help at all.  </li>
            <li>Even though I bought this for when I travel, I keep it on the counter of my guest bath full time.  </li>
            <li>The lights supply just enough extra illumination, but the magnified mirror is really great!  </li>
            <li>the normal mirror is on the bottom and the zoom mirror is on the top.  </li>
            <li>Although the product looked well-constructed and sturdy in the photos, the non-magnifying mirror was cheaply attached to the magnifying mirror by a mickey mouse swivel joint which broke within the first month of use.  </li>
            <li>(The light didn&#x27;t work the first time I receive it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>The normal mirror (non-magnified is on top).</li>
            <li>You have to crouch down like a hunchback to use it no matter how many times you adjust the mirror and to add insult to injury --- the image is warped!!</li>
            <li>I like this mirror however wish the top mirror which is a standard mirror had light around it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young 36 year old with good eyesight</li>
            <li>The mirror must have been designed back when Knots Landing was a popular TV show.</li>
            <li>It folds up flat and will fit in the most crowded suitcase.  </li>
            <li>The mirrors are in the right position - with the magnified on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this mirror several years ago, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The LED light is of a different quality than the old type; however, it is harsher and that&#x27;s better for my purposes.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror and buying another one just recently, but do not buy the adaptor because it does not have a place to insert it.  </li>
            <li>The first mirror I purchased had an adaptor</li>
            <li>The lighted ring is actually on the 10x mirror, which I mostly just use for eye makeup anyway - so the LEDs didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>More than likely there will be, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>The light is so dim.</li>
            <li>Also, have not been able to get the clock set properly.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s pretty much it.  </li>
            <li>and I could barely see myself in this mirror with the light turned on.</li>
            <li>I really wanted one that lit up too.  </li>
            <li>the whole thing is now in pieces.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is okay but not very compact for travel.</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li>The mirrors extend to a reasonable height.  </li>
            <li>My wife really likes the mirror.</li>
            <li>Very well lit.  </li>
            <li>I also travel much of the time.  </li>
            <li>Being spoiled by having a great big makeup mirror at home with 10x and many lighting options, I knew some sacrifices would have to be made to make it small enough to travel, but I was pleasantly surprised as how well this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only re-ordered it because I thought the light would be super bright, but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li>I FEEL THAT THE OLDER ONES YOU COULD PLUG IN.</li>
            <li>Advertised as &#x27;natural sunlight&#x27; but actually casts a greenish light.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this portable mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirrors themselves are great - just weird configuration.</li>
            <li>I like that there is a normal mirror and a 10X mirror</li>
            <li>Reasonably good product but a poorly designed swivel</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying a new Zadro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>new model has no a/c plug or adapter.</li>
            <li>I have used this mirror for over 10 years and needed a new one and this version beats them all.  </li>
            <li>This new version isn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li>Liked this mirror a lot and used it for everyday makeup applications but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>But it does fold up to a reasonable size and when extended the batteries are enough weight to keep the whole contraption steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too dim to be of any use.</li>
            <li>The mirror works on battery power only which is a real disadvantage.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the old one.  </li>
            <li>Just like my old one.</li>
            <li>I always have my cell phone near by.</li>
            <li>The LED white light is rather harsh, so you must keep in mind while applying makeup that it won&#x27;t look quite the same in natural lighting.  </li>
            <li>The light is a dull almost bluish hue, which I wouldn&#x27;t think would be helpful with makeup.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mirror for anyone especially for those who have the daily issue of face maintenance.</li>
            <li>With the earlier models, the main issue I had was how fast the batteries would wear down.  </li>
            <li>I use the 1X for general and the 10X for eye makeup and plucking.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why there is a clock, which I completely forgot about until it started beeping at me, and I don&#x27;t like that the regular mirror is unlit.</li>
            <li>Apparently Zadro has updated this product since 2007.</li>
            <li>It cost as much as the old version and worked less than 1 year.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;plug&#x27; is very large and heavy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy about having to use batteries; but since the LED bulbs use so little electricity, the mirror is quite bright.</li>
            <li>So when you set it on the counter the normal mirror that I want to use is on the bottom and impossible to see in unless to set it on top of something that&#x27;s high up.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted quite a few years.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the normal mirror is on the bottom and the zoom mirror is on the top.  </li>
            <li> Although the product looked well-constructed and sturdy in the photos, the non-magnifying mirror was cheaply attached to the magnifying mirror by a mickey mouse swivel joint which broke within the first month of use.  </li>
            <li> (The light didn&#x27;t work the first time I receive it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> The normal mirror (non-magnified is on top).</li>
            <li> You have to crouch down like a hunchback to use it no matter how many times you adjust the mirror and to add insult to injury --- the image is warped!!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror however wish the top mirror which is a standard mirror had light around it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 36 year old with good eyesight</li>
            <li> The mirror must have been designed back when Knots Landing was a popular TV show.</li>
            <li> It folds up flat and will fit in the most crowded suitcase.  </li>
            <li> The mirrors are in the right position - with the magnified on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this mirror several years ago, I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> The LED light is of a different quality than the old type; however, it is harsher and that&#x27;s better for my purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror and buying another one just recently, but do not buy the adaptor because it does not have a place to insert it.  </li>
            <li> The first mirror I purchased had an adaptor</li>
            <li> The lighted ring is actually on the 10x mirror, which I mostly just use for eye makeup anyway - so the LEDs didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> More than likely there will be, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> The light is so dim.</li>
            <li> Also, have not been able to get the clock set properly.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s pretty much it.  </li>
            <li> and I could barely see myself in this mirror with the light turned on.</li>
            <li> I really wanted one that lit up too.  </li>
            <li> the whole thing is now in pieces.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is okay but not very compact for travel.</li>
            <li> so doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  </li>
            <li> The mirrors extend to a reasonable height.  </li>
            <li> My wife really likes the mirror.</li>
            <li> Very well lit.  </li>
            <li> I also travel much of the time.  </li>
            <li> Being spoiled by having a great big makeup mirror at home with 10x and many lighting options, I knew some sacrifices would have to be made to make it small enough to travel, but I was pleasantly surprised as how well this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only re-ordered it because I thought the light would be super bright, but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I FEEL THAT THE OLDER ONES YOU COULD PLUG IN.</li>
            <li> Advertised as &#x27;natural sunlight&#x27; but actually casts a greenish light.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this portable mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirrors themselves are great - just weird configuration.</li>
            <li> I like that there is a normal mirror and a 10X mirror</li>
            <li> Reasonably good product but a poorly designed swivel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a new Zadro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> new model has no a/c plug or adapter.</li>
            <li> I have used this mirror for over 10 years and needed a new one and this version beats them all.  </li>
            <li> This new version isn&#x27;t even close.  </li>
            <li> Liked this mirror a lot and used it for everyday makeup applications but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> But it does fold up to a reasonable size and when extended the batteries are enough weight to keep the whole contraption steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too dim to be of any use.</li>
            <li> The mirror works on battery power only which is a real disadvantage.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the old one.  </li>
            <li> Just like my old one.</li>
            <li> I always have my cell phone near by.</li>
            <li> The LED white light is rather harsh, so you must keep in mind while applying makeup that it won&#x27;t look quite the same in natural lighting.  </li>
            <li> The light is a dull almost bluish hue, which I wouldn&#x27;t think would be helpful with makeup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mirror for anyone especially for those who have the daily issue of face maintenance.</li>
            <li> With the earlier models, the main issue I had was how fast the batteries would wear down.  </li>
            <li> I use the 1X for general and the 10X for eye makeup and plucking.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there is a clock, which I completely forgot about until it started beeping at me, and I don&#x27;t like that the regular mirror is unlit.</li>
            <li> Apparently Zadro has updated this product since 2007.</li>
            <li> It cost as much as the old version and worked less than 1 year.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;plug&#x27; is very large and heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about having to use batteries; but since the LED bulbs use so little electricity, the mirror is quite bright.</li>
            <li> So when you set it on the counter the normal mirror that I want to use is on the bottom and impossible to see in unless to set it on top of something that&#x27;s high up.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted quite a few years.</li>
            <li> This lighted mirror is large enough to use at home and small enough for travel.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it 2 times but it seems adequate, not great.  </li>
            <li> My wife has used a Zadro mirror for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality, only batteries for power supply, light source is about half of the previous model, power button worked intermittently, clock never worked.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is that a single screw holds the upper mirror in place and it gets loose a lot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need to be as big as it is, and I don&#x27;t care about the little clock that is built in.  </li>
            <li> ( I don&#x27;t use the little digital clock</li>
            <li> but overall the plastic fell apart after just a few uses and</li>
            <li> Not very functional.</li>
            <li> The one we had used had an A/C adapter which was heavy and added extra weight to our luggage when traveling.  </li>
            <li> I got what I expected.</li>
            <li> It is just what I expected.</li>
            <li> She was a little doubtful about the light from the new travel mirror</li>
            <li> I only with the magnification was a little less, but would still recommend it.  </li>
            <li> My other mirror I bought years ago does and it has a spot to insert the adaptor.  </li>
            <li> I have propped mirrors on tissue boxes, moved lights in dark rooms and other things to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not worth the $30 plus dollars I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Then you are already $15.00 down, so why not pay the addl fee???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A travel necessity when traveling with other women !</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is a little heavier than I would like.  </li>
            <li> With batteries it weighs almost a pound and a half.</li>
            <li> for return shipping (probably half of what they pay for it in China).  </li>
            <li> so I could care less about it.)  </li>
            <li> The package looked like it had been opened previously.  </li>
            <li> COULD BE A LITTLE BRIGHTER, BUT THE TRAVELING WITH IT,CAN&#x27;T BE BEAT.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few months and it is getting a little wobbly.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavy with batteries</li>
            <li> I use a makeup mirror everyday at home and wanted one I could take with me when I travel.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is way to heavy to \\&quot;lug\\</li>
            <li> It broke after a few month.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use the heavy adapter which added weight to the suitcase when traveling.  </li>
            <li> Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Also, it is a bit heavy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m using it everyday because of the 10X magnification.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit odd looking, but not unattractive and small and compact</li>
            <li> no more bulky, heavy a/c adapted to deal with.</li>
            <li> on a week&#x27;s trip, I usually had to replace the batteries which got rather costly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is designed to fail in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem is there is not a better competitive product of its type on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> It lasted for a really long time and them the lights failed</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t change the bulb--at least I couldn&#x27;t figure out how&lt;br</li>
            <li> I called the company and complained.  </li>
            <li> At least, on the two I received.</li>
            <li> Why did the company waste resources on a useless clock?</li>
            <li> Instructions are very confusing.</li>
            <li> Not great for travel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stated weight is false and misleading.</li>
            <li> The 10X magnifying mirror is completely distorted and useless!!!</li>
            <li> Still, I took it on a trip to Japan, and it was a life saver for all those poorly lit rooms with no magnifying mirror!</li>
            <li> , I have to hold it which makes it difficult to hold it and put on make-up.  </li>
            <li> And often hotels have bad lighting and crumby mirrors.</li>
            <li> Sooo disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulb in mine died this month when I stupidly dunked it in water.</li>
            <li> Base -  </li>
            <li> Piece of crap - can&#x27;t believe I paid over $50 for a piece of plastic that cost - maybe - $3.00 to make.  </li>
            <li> I hate that part.  </li>
            <li> I hate it!!!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap mirror which I returned --- twice!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do like this mirror, mostly like that it extends higher than most... I only with the magnification was a little less, but would still recommend it.  Can&#x27;t get the clock to set properly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I ever traveled without this mirror.  Perfectly meets my needs and I don&#x27;t have to worry about lighting and mirrors in hotel bathrooms any more.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mirror to take on a trip I was going on.  I use a makeup mirror everyday at home and wanted one I could take with me when I travel.  I really wanted one that lit up too.  There were mixed reviews that I read on this mirror but I still got it.  I like that there is a normal mirror and a 10X mirror but that&#x27;s pretty much it.  The lights on it are bright white and do not help at all.  The light on my normal makeup mirror is yellowish and not super bright, it&#x27;s perfect.  I wish the lights on this mirror were more like that.  Another thing I didn&#x27;t like is unlike the picture shown of this mirror the normal mirror is on the bottom and the zoom mirror is on the top.  So when you set it on the counter the normal mirror that I want to use is on the bottom and impossible to see in unless to set it on top of something that&#x27;s high up.  I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this.  Find something better.</li>
            <li> The magnifying mirror works well but overall the plastic fell apart after just a few uses and the whole thing is now in pieces.  Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> This mirror is way to heavy to \\&quot;lug\\&quot; around the world in a suitcase. It&#x27;s stated weight is false and misleading. With batteries it weighs almost a pound and a half. I returned the one that I purchased for a refund.</li>
            <li> This mirror is okay but not very compact for travel. I have had it for a few months and it is getting a little wobbly. Maybe I just need to tighten a screw? The mirrors themselves are great - just weird configuration.</li>
            <li> This is a good travel mirror except that it&#x27;s very dimly lit. I searched the internet to see if anyone else had this same problem, but I couldn&#x27;t find anyone who did. So maybe I got a dud? The light is a dull almost bluish hue, which I wouldn&#x27;t think would be helpful with makeup. The bathroom lights would be better which defeats the purpose of me getting this. I did use only batteries...maybe it&#x27;s brighter with an adapter? Anyone else have this problem?</li>
            <li> Liked this mirror a lot and used it for everyday makeup applications but it didn&#x27;t last. It broke after a few month. Had to replace it with counter model that plugs into wall.</li>
            <li> This travel mirror is larger and heavier than I would like. I don&#x27;t know why there is a clock, which I completely forgot about until it started beeping at me, and I don&#x27;t like that the regular mirror is unlit. Still, I took it on a trip to Japan, and it was a life saver for all those poorly lit rooms with no magnifying mirror!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Even light. Diameter of the mirror is big enough. Wwings out from the wall. Folds in to compact size. Bulb lasted 6 years. Cheap. Mirror is free from distortion&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Since I use it mostly as a mounted mirror (rather than travel) the 1x mirror just gets in the way. (I just took it off and that solved that problem.) The &#x27;plug&#x27; is very large and heavy. Not great for travel. And while the mirror can use batteries, it isn&#x27;t as bright. You can&#x27;t change the bulb--at least I couldn&#x27;t figure out how&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bulb in mine died this month when I stupidly dunked it in water. (7/2013). I decided to try a different mirror because of two of my &#x27;cons&#x27;-- I couldn&#x27;t change the bulb and removing the 1x mirror. I got a Floxite Fl-510 10x Magnifying 5-inch Mirror Light, and learned why I should have stuck with this one.  I&#x27;m buying a new Zadro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** Update. Apparently Zadro has updated this product since 2007. Now it uses LED bulbs and there is no AC option. The LED light is of a different quality than the old type; however, it is harsher and that&#x27;s better for my purposes. I&#x27;m not happy about having to use batteries; but since the LED bulbs use so little electricity, the mirror is quite bright.</li>
            <li> Superb. I can see very well, the light is very bright but doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blind&amp;#34; me. Am ordering additional for gifts.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror and buying another one just recently, but do not buy the adaptor because it does not have a place to insert it.  My other mirror I bought years ago does and it has a spot to insert the adaptor.  For those who use batteries for this produce which brand is the best?</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this mirror several years ago, I was thrilled.  It was just perfect for applying makeup and traveling.  The first mirror I purchased had an adaptor and I did not use batteries.  It lasted for a really long time and them the lights failed and I could not find replacement lights.  I have ordered the same mirror several times and each time the lights lasted a shorter time.  The newer mirrors that I purchased did not come with an adaptor but I used the one that I already had.  And, it does not provide very good light with only batteries.  I am going to order a different mirror and see how that works as I feel I am not getting a quality product for my money.</li>
            <li> Awesome high quality makeup mirror. The 10X is great for close make up application and eye contact use. The materials used is sturdy and the design is superior. I highly recommend this portable mirror.</li>
            <li> Even though I bought this for when I travel, I keep it on the counter of my guest bath full time.  It&#x27;s a bit odd looking, but not unattractive and small and compact so doesn&#x27;t take up much space.  It folds up flat and will fit in the most crowded suitcase.  The lights supply just enough extra illumination, but the magnified mirror is really great!  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a way to get it eye level. Not very functional.</li>
            <li> The mirrors are in the right position - with the magnified on the bottom.  The mirrors extend to a reasonable height.  The only negative is that it is a little heavier than I would like.  But I have tried numerous travel mirrors and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> the two mirrors work well together and the light provides the right amount of light. Can be used as a travel mirror.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m approaching this review in hopes that someone like myself will read it when they are searching for a TRAVEL mirror... I do not consider this to be a great at home makeup mirror, though it could function as one.  But if you just need one to throw in your carry on bag while traveling, this fits the bill quite nicely.  Being spoiled by having a great big makeup mirror at home with 10x and many lighting options, I knew some sacrifices would have to be made to make it small enough to travel, but I was pleasantly surprised as how well this does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Light -  The version I received has LED lights, powered by a handful of AAA batteries.  There does not appear to be a jack for an external power source.  The LED white light is rather harsh, so you must keep in mind while applying makeup that it won&#x27;t look quite the same in natural lighting.  The lighted ring is actually on the 10x mirror, which I mostly just use for eye makeup anyway - so the LEDs didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mirrors - They&#x27;re OK... 7.x inches... don&#x27;t expect magic here.  They&#x27;re mirrors and they get the job done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Base -  It doesn&#x27;t need to be as big as it is, and I don&#x27;t care about the little clock that is built in.  But it does fold up to a reasonable size and when extended the batteries are enough weight to keep the whole contraption steady.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion - If you just need to replace a legit makeup mirror for travel purposes, and you don&#x27;t want to go without lighting and a 10x mirror.. just buy this one and move on.</li>
            <li> I have one of these and traveled with a friend who really liked it.  Bought this as a gift. Good lighting.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great for home and traveling. It is the 2nd one I bought. Perfect for putting makeup on. The price is right too.</li>
            <li> My wife has used a Zadro mirror for a long time.  The one we had used had an A/C adapter which was heavy and added extra weight to our luggage when traveling.  She was a little doubtful about the light from the new travel mirror would be insufficient since it only uses batteries. She was pleasantly surprised at how bright it was and no more bulky, heavy a/c adapted to deal with.</li>
            <li> Portable battery operated wife loves it!!!</li>
            <li> COULD BE A LITTLE BRIGHTER, BUT THE TRAVELING WITH IT,CAN&#x27;T BE BEAT. I FEEL THAT THE OLDER ONES YOU COULD PLUG IN. IT WAS KIND OF YOUR OPTION. THE NEWER ONES THEY DON&#x27;T PLUG IN.</li>
            <li> I use this at home and this is a great travel mirror.  The light on the mirror is bright enough to see and I just love having the clock on this so always know what time it is!</li>
            <li> the top broke off within 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> Very good product just as it was described! My wife really likes the mirror. Good price and good service. Shipped on time.</li>
            <li> This product worked well until the bulb burned out.  OK I thought, the box states it has a lifetime bulb.  Guess what?  To use this &amp;#34;warranty&amp;#34; you have to pay shipping to the mfg, enclose the original receipt (why??? if is lifetime), and enclose a $10.00 check.  for return shipping (probably half of what they pay for it in China).  Then they will contact you and say whether there is an additional fee.  More than likely there will be, I suppose.  Then you are already $15.00 down, so why not pay the addl fee???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new model has no a/c plug or adapter.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great travel mirror.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; seller was great to work with!</li>
            <li> I had one of these mirrors for about  6 years now.  I love everything about it.  ( I don&#x27;t use the little digital clock so I could care less about it.)  The mirrors are perfect and stay put.  I use the 1X for general and the 10X for eye makeup and plucking.  Very well lit.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My father in-law has a (colostomy) bag and, so I got him one to put on the counter to assist with changing that, and he was soooo grateful.  The light and height is just perfect for him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get one!</li>
            <li> I like this mirror however wish the top mirror which is a standard mirror had light around it.  the bottom mirror has a 10X with light.  Comes with a velvet case for travel.</li>
            <li> Too dim to be of any use. Advertised as &#x27;natural sunlight&#x27; but actually casts a greenish light. Returning it.</li>
            <li> This is mirror has definitely been improved with the addition of the LED bulb.  I have used this mirror for over 10 years and needed a new one and this version beats them all.  The reason is the light lasts forever and you don&#x27;t need to use the heavy adapter which added weight to the suitcase when traveling.  With the earlier models, the main issue I had was how fast the batteries would wear down.  on a week&#x27;s trip, I usually had to replace the batteries which got rather costly.  Now the light lasts forever.  It&#x27;s flat and lightweight and great for travel.</li>
            <li> The 10X mirror is really good for &amp;#34;close-up work&amp;#34; and the light is bright enough (it is brighter than the lights on most makeup mirrors).  I just wish there was a light on the 1X mirror.</li>
            <li> I had to return this item for replacement.  The package looked like it had been opened previously.  I could not get the LED clock to work.  Still waiting for the replacement.</li>
            <li> Although the product looked well-constructed and sturdy in the photos, the non-magnifying mirror was cheaply attached to the magnifying mirror by a mickey mouse swivel joint which broke within the first month of use.  Also an AC adapter advertised separately as being an accessory to the mirror was misleading.  The mirror works on battery power only which is a real disadvantage.  Would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Perfect mirror to travel with for long trips.  I put it in my checked luggage babe using the box it was sent in.  So good I was able to tweeze my eyebrows without glasses.</li>
            <li> I had the prior version of this and it was awesome.  I bought this to replace the old one.  This new version isn&#x27;t even close.  It has the same name but it is NOT the same product.  I called the company and complained.  They said too bad-this is the same thing.  I would never recommend this.  It cost as much as the old version and worked less than 1 year.  I only used it about once a week.  Poor quality, only batteries for power supply, light source is about half of the previous model, power button worked intermittently, clock never worked.  Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> mirror is great but couldn&#x27;t use the plug I bought for it even though it said it was designed for use with that model number. There&#x27;s no place on the mirror for the plug.</li>
            <li> This lighted mirror is large enough to use at home and small enough for travel.  The light and magnification are more than adequate.  Love the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use the plug if you don&#x27;t want to.  This is the second one I buy.  The first one lasted quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap - can&#x27;t believe I paid over $50 for a piece of plastic that cost - maybe - $3.00 to make.  I won&#x27;t be taken again.  There ought to be a law - you should be embarrassed.  I hate it!!!</li>
            <li> I got what I expected. Reasonably good product but a poorly designed swivel assy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is designed to fail in a short period of time. Needs to be stiffened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem is there is not a better competitive product of its type on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been looking for a suitable replacement for years. Can&#x27;t find one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 8th unit in as many years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;xt6bandit</li>
            <li> Just like my old one.</li>
            <li> All my life I have needed to examine my eyebrows and smooth my face EVERY day.  The magnification, lighting and height of the mirror were always a struggle.  I also travel much of the time.  I have propped mirrors on tissue boxes, moved lights in dark rooms and other things to get the job done.  This mirror SOLVES all these issues.  It is well lighted, the arm extends to a convenient height, and the magnification is perfect.  It folds up for easy storage and travel. I have purchased five:  One always in my travel bag, two for my winter home, one for my summer house, and one for my daughter. I am buying more as gifts.  I highly recommend this mirror for anyone especially for those who have the daily issue of face maintenance.</li>
            <li> A travel necessity when traveling with other women ! And often hotels have bad lighting and crumby mirrors. This is the perfect solution.  It is a little heavy with batteries but I carry it in my hand luggage.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap mirror which I returned --- twice!!!! (The light didn&#x27;t work the first time I receive it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: 1. You can see your entire face in the mirror. 2. The normal mirror (non-magnified is on top). At least, on the two I received. And the normal mirror was a good quality mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: There are many. 1. The light is so dim. It&#x27;s more like candlelight. I&#x27;m a young 36 year old with good eyesight and I could barely see myself in this mirror with the light turned on. There needs to be an additional light on the top mirror. 2. The clock. Why did the company waste resources on a useless clock? The mirror must have been designed back when Knots Landing was a popular TV show. Who needs a clock on a mirror these days? I always have my cell phone near by. And the clock didn&#x27;t even work on mine. Every time you adjusted the mirror, the clock had to be reset. Plus, the alarm went off every hour!!! 3. The 10X magnifying mirror is completely distorted and useless!!! You have to crouch down like a hunchback to use it no matter how many times you adjust the mirror and to add insult to injury --- the image is warped!! And no, I am not that ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line: I wouldn&#x27;t accept this mirror if it was free. I only re-ordered it because I thought the light would be super bright, but I was so wrong. Not worth the $30 plus dollars I paid for it. I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve owned. This one broke second time I used it. Won&#x27;t stay up when extended and on/off button cracked off. Now I get a puncture wound when I try to turn it on. Sooo disappointed. Wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I have used this same mirror style for 10 years.  I have to replace it every couple of years because the light goes out around the bottom part that lights up eventually but I travel for my job constantly and it is so perfect.  I do wish they would go back to having an AC outlet so I don&#x27;t have to carry so many batteries all the time.  I hate that part.  It use to have an adapter and a place to plug it in.  I have not found any travel mirror that is this bright and easy to take along.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this for travel yet, I use it in my make-up case in my gym bag.  I have only used it 2 times but it seems adequate, not great.  I have to use it at a stand-up counter so I can&#x27;t sit it on the counter, I have to hold it which makes it difficult to hold it and put on make-up.  Also, it is a bit heavy.  It will work but I am still on the look-out for the perfect travel mirror.  Also, have not been able to get the clock set properly.  Instructions are very confusing.</li>
            <li> Great concept and like the flexibilty of the mirror, but the switch to turn it off &amp; on is a bit temperamental and doesn&#x27;t work all the time</li>
            <li> This unit works for me. The only complaint is that a single screw holds the upper mirror in place and it gets loose a lot.</li>
            <li> Nope, nope, nope.  I like Zadro mirrors, but this one is heavy, bulky and very poorly-lit.  I found another one (also Zadro) that I ordered from Amazon and like it much better.  This one is going back.</li>
            <li> It is just what I expected. I bought it for travel but I&#x27;m using it everyday because of the 10X magnification.</li>
            <li> Very nice travel mirror - lighting is probably great for the majority of users - I prefer more light so I just used it with a table lamp and it worked out great. Nice quality mirror</li>
