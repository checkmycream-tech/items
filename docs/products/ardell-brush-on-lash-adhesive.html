    <ol>

            <li>Best eye lash glue</li>
            <li>best glue i have ever used, and you don&#x27;t have to wait 30 seconds for the glue to get tacky before you apply your lashes -</li>
            <li>This is one of the best and eyelash adhesives I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>im so very happy</li>
            <li>This is the best adhesive for lashes.</li>
            <li>It works way better!!!!</li>
            <li>Very good for me</li>
            <li>It also does not stay very good, you have to put a lot.</li>
            <li>THIS WAS SO EASY TO USE !!!</li>

            <li>It arrived on time and it does what its supposed to a great job at it too</li>
            <li>It is great for gluing on jewels etc.</li>
            <li>but this works great since some days</li>
            <li>This is a great product for day use of lashes.  </li>
            <li>The applicator is wonderful but the product is flakey and will not withstand water or any kind of moisture.</li>
            <li>i cant say anything but love it!!</li>
            <li>so I like this brand a lot better!!</li>
            <li>Use good but just entering the eye is burning, and this disadvantage.</li>
            <li>The fumes are strong and the glue does not stick!!</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it before when i purchased it from a store, but having it delivered at a cheaper price is much better..!</li>
            <li>Revlon and duo are way better!</li>
            <li>but for now I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li>so im totally loving that</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own if you&#x27;re going out for awhile or dancing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very diappointed, revlong makes the best eyelash glue!</li>
            <li>As good as any of the cheap glues.  </li>
            <li>The brush is better than most.</li>
            <li>Love this lash glue</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not horrible.</li>
            <li>I use it as a top coat after glueing though.</li>
            <li>It is ok...</li>
            <li>I used this once, and I need more use of it.  </li>
            <li>I really do love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>i love this eyelash glue.</li>
            <li>If you are needing it in a hurry this is not the best seller, I did get it almost 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li>I use this more often to do art makeup.</li>
            <li>That said, I love it &amp; am bummed to be almost all out of it.</li>
            <li>A brush works much better. .</li>
            <li>So Love the DUO</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great glue, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t clump or get too sticky</li>
            <li>i love the fact that this product is latex free and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor..</li>
            <li>Easy to apply you</li>
            <li>Dries promptly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>When I would apply the lash glue, it seemed to work just fine.</li>
            <li>No glue that burns my eyes is worthy!</li>
            <li>I do love this product very much; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else for my lashes; I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have not had any irritation and the lash goes right on and stays all night!</li>
            <li>My lashes did not last a good two hours.</li>
            <li>Also works super well to glue gems on your face and body.</li>
            <li>First time using eyelashes and glue, I thought this product was ok (considering first time ever using anything like it).</li>
            <li>It has a strong odor and is very flaky.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t dry gummy like most lash glues.</li>
            <li>It gives off some pretty strong fumes at first so wait</li>
            <li>I love the clear brush on adhesive.  </li>
            <li>Probably not meant for that type of application, but i have sensitive eyes and this has been ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not gooey where it dries in seconds, even if its still liquidy you can apply lashes right away to eyelid &amp;</li>
            <li>as a top coat it really gives the extra strong hold.</li>
            <li>It is better for individual lashes or accent lashes than full strip.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>SO FIRST</li>
            <li>get it exactly where you want it</li>
            <li>I FOUND THE PERFECT FAKE EYELASH GLUE -</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything!</li>
            <li>it would most likely have to be reapplied every hour or two.</li>
            <li>I fell asleep with it with a not so good fake lash (cheap ones from ebay) &amp; to my surprise the lashes where still on!</li>
            <li>I am not sensitive to many things</li>
            <li>In dry times it holds (without being rubbed/messed with/touched) for about 16 hours at the most</li>
            <li>This glue dries in about 20/30 seconds and is ready to wear.</li>
            <li>So much easier than the glue</li>
            <li>This adhesive is great for securing lashes but the only problem I incurred was that it dried too fast.</li>
            <li>it doesnt really stick to my eye very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically like watered down clear nail polish, it smells very strong and burns your eyes very much, even if it doesn&#x27;t get in your eye</li>
            <li>I bought this due to the applicator, and so far I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>There are so many other adhesives you can use.</li>
            <li>Plus, if you already have the eyelashes on and one side comes loose, you can easily brush a little more on and re-secure it.</li>
            <li>It is reminiscent of cheap clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>I have not really noticed any strong odor either.</li>
            <li>I love this adhesive because of the little brush.  </li>
            <li>I never dreamed this stuff would work so well and so fast the first week I thought I was just seeing what I wanted to see the second week</li>
            <li>The problem I am having is I either don&#x27;t use enough adhesive or it drys by the time I get the lashes in the right place.  </li>
            <li>will try the Revlon or the new Duo</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s already clear, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it showing up, and the brush makes it much easier to apply the glue to the lashes than trying to apply it directly from a tube.</li>
            <li>Granted, my eyes can be really sensitive, but if you have sensitive eyes too, you should really steer clear of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do not waste your money on this preoduct!</li>
            <li>That said, this product really has very little smell and goes on the lashes smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Not to harsh and easy to remove</li>
            <li>but it is latex free which does mess</li>
            <li>Someone might only look for this if they wear fake lashes a lot, but this is also great for those of us who don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that its clear.</li>
            <li>and it is clear when it dries</li>
            <li>turns to CLEAR.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear</li>
            <li>it is semi-difficult to get the old glue off.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I apply directly to mu lash line.</li>
            <li>my eyes are too sensitive for the duo.</li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t see how much you&#x27;ve put on, but there definitely is NO LATEX in the product or my eyes would have swollen shut.</li>
            <li>but it only lasts a few seconds other than that its a good product</li>
            <li>this is so much better than the regular small glue tubes you get in the store.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this glue to work and tried it many times, but every single time was a failure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sticky and still requires dry time</li>
            <li>It dry fast so as soon as u put it on the lash, apply the lash to your eye lids.</li>
            <li>I use it sometimes when there is no other option.</li>
            <li>Apparently they take their time shipping out their orders.</li>
            <li>I love this for false lashes.</li>
            <li>Once I took my lashes off, and attempted to remove the glue from the lash bad in order to be able to use that pair of lashes again, it almost seemed like this lash glue had hardened to what seemed like what super glue dries too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s opposite of Ardell such as: No Smell, Does not hurt on skin, you can see the white glue &amp; can wipe excess off to avoid going into the eye, it turns clear,</li>
            <li>I tried a tube with a tubular tip applicator and trew it away after the first use because it is so messy.</li>
            <li>But other than that I think this product is good for bigginers and learning the ways of fake lashes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long on</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a really watery adhesive, so it&#x27;s hard to know when you have enough on the lash.</li>
            <li> Most Ardell Glues are disappointing so don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> When you do get it to stick it does not stick for long.</li>
            <li> and once they would stick they wouldn&#x27;t stay on for long .</li>
            <li> The other adhesives for lashes last longer but build up on the lashes.</li>
            <li> It would be dry by the time I bring lashes to my eye.</li>
            <li> It also forms visible white clumps when dried.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d beware of getting it wet (think dunking your head underwater) unless you want to see if your falsies float</li>
            <li> So be careful not to touch your lashes until this stuff dries.</li>
            <li> If using that method be careful.</li>
            <li> No white, messy adhesive to cover.</li>
            <li> I went with this glue over the others due to the lack of latex.</li>
            <li> yaya I lost literallychunks of my eyelashes due to medications</li>
            <li> I will be trying other glues just to compare..</li>
            <li> Not much could be simpler than this product!</li>
            <li> Stronger and longer-lasting than any other lash glue I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it does what it says...being new to wearing false lashes</li>
            <li> I am new to the world of false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, there was a really unpleasant odor/vapor that came from it that wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes so much.</li>
            <li> I fail because I can&#x27;t get the glue from the little tube that comes with the lashes to go on right, and sometimes when I&#x27;ve went to apply it, it had already dried up somehow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to see the clear glue running down from the fake lash to your eye if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor but nothing I can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> There was a little smell to the glue</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> it has to be a few seconds before applying to the eyelid</li>
            <li> Just a mess when I put it on it dripped a little !</li>
            <li> Gets crusty, flakes off, just super annoying all around.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its waterproof</li>
            <li> I know when I used duo it would keep falling off and after that I used a different brand and that one burned my eyes when I put my fake lashes on</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also a really small window of time between when it starts to get tacky and when it hardens completely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you need to shake the glue, or if maybe I&#x27;m using the glue wrong, but I don&#x27;t prefer this glue over regular eyelash glue that comes in a tube.</li>
            <li> I was taking in the past.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to get the hang of using this stuff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard and when it dries feels like plastic</li>
            <li> a bit before you put it near your eyes, but its not that bad.</li>
            <li> It sucks does not stick</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as Duo, Benefit or Revlon.</li>
            <li> Just brush it on the false eyelashes and apply.</li>
            <li> It can burn if you try to apply the lashes while the glue is still wet, and it does smell slightly bad!</li>
            <li> This is a very poor product</li>
            <li> It SMELLS BAD like TOXIC (Like Nail Polish or Worse).</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> It does work though, and it doesn&#x27;t make It impossible to remove the lashes after</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> it just makes them water so bad.</li>
            <li> I truly hate this product.</li>
            <li> I HATE THIS</li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> I accidentally got some in my eye and it hurt so bad!</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed with the finished product because lets face it ..</li>
            <li> It kept my fake lashes on and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> This stuff in my opinion is horrible!</li>
            <li> Very bad!</li>
            <li> This is the worst one , it does not stick at all !</li>
            <li> Horribly quality.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As good as any of the cheap glues.  The brush is better than most.</li>
            <li> Love this lash glue i cant say anything but love it!! Im not sure if its waterproof but it is latex free which does mess w my eyes this doesnt and its like once they r one they dont want to come off so im totally loving that</li>
            <li> This is a very poor product&lt;br /&gt;- It stings the eyes&lt;br /&gt;-Poor quality adhesive&lt;br /&gt;-Hard to remove</li>
            <li> I really wanted this glue to work and tried it many times, but every single time was a failure.  This glue is like water, it does not stick whatsoever.  It also forms visible white clumps when dried.  Terrible.</li>
            <li> its great!!! It kept my fake lashes on and it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes!!! I know when I used duo it would keep falling off and after that I used a different brand and that one burned my eyes when I put my fake lashes on so I like this brand a lot better!!</li>
            <li> This stuff in my opinion is horrible! I bought this thinking it was going to be as wonderful as the Revlon precision lash adhesive. I was wrong! It has a strong odor and is very flaky. It is reminiscent of cheap clear nail polish. My lashes did not last a good two hours. Also, the adhesive you can flick off your eyelids and it turns crusty after a couple of hours. I truly hate this product.</li>
            <li> Dont waist your money on it. It sucks does not stick and it&#x27;s way too liquidity. When you do get it to stick it does not stick for long.</li>
            <li> Just a mess when I put it on it dripped a little !i got two and I like the low pice thNks amazon!</li>
            <li> Do not buy! It does not stick at all!</li>
            <li> Best eye lash glue I have ever used. Nordstrom Rack stopped carrying it and I am so glad I found it on here!</li>
            <li> best glue i have ever used, and you don&#x27;t have to wait 30 seconds for the glue to get tacky before you apply your lashes - just put the glue on, and place you lashes! will definitely be getting this again.</li>
            <li> The lashes wont stay on. And the adhesive burns my eyelid.</li>
            <li> It was really hard to get the hang of using this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It is a really watery adhesive, so it&#x27;s hard to know when you have enough on the lash. There&#x27;s also a really small window of time between when it starts to get tacky and when it hardens completely.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there was a really unpleasant odor/vapor that came from it that wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal if it didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes so much. Granted, my eyes can be really sensitive, but if you have sensitive eyes too, you should really steer clear of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not horrible. Once you get a feel for it, it works alright. I use it sometimes when there is no other option.</li>
            <li> Someone might only look for this if they wear fake lashes a lot, but this is also great for those of us who don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve wanted to wear some for Halloween every year and every year I fail because I can&#x27;t get the glue from the little tube that comes with the lashes to go on right, and sometimes when I&#x27;ve went to apply it, it had already dried up somehow. This adhesive was great. It&#x27;s already clear, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it showing up, and the brush makes it much easier to apply the glue to the lashes than trying to apply it directly from a tube. Plus, if you already have the eyelashes on and one side comes loose, you can easily brush a little more on and re-secure it. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lashes on great.. I use it as a top coat after glueing though. It doesn&#x27;t last as long on it&#x27;s own if you&#x27;re going out for awhile or dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as a top coat it really gives the extra strong hold.</li>
            <li> Very bad! Almost no adhesive at all! DO NOT buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you need to shake the glue, or if maybe I&#x27;m using the glue wrong, but I don&#x27;t prefer this glue over regular eyelash glue that comes in a tube. When I would apply the lash glue, it seemed to work just fine. Once I took my lashes off, and attempted to remove the glue from the lash bad in order to be able to use that pair of lashes again, it almost seemed like this lash glue had hardened to what seemed like what super glue dries too. If you are someone that likes to use a pair of lashes multiple times, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money on this preoduct! does not work! burns your skin and eyes!Was very diappointed, revlong makes the best eyelash glue!</li>
            <li> Bought this at a beauty store and it burns your eyes and lids. It&#x27;s hard and when it dries feels like plastic</li>
            <li> I went with this glue over the others due to the lack of latex. This glue dries in about 20/30 seconds and is ready to wear. It does NOT seem the stickiest stuff in the world so I&#x27;d beware of getting it wet (think dunking your head underwater) unless you want to see if your falsies float ;) In dry times it holds (without being rubbed/messed with/touched) for about 16 hours at the most so I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best and eyelash adhesives I&#x27;ve ever purchased. I&#x27;ve used it before when i purchased it from a store, but having it delivered at a cheaper price is much better..!</li>
            <li> Burns my eyes! The fumes are strong and the glue does not stick!! Revlon and duo are way better!</li>
            <li> THIS UUGG SO FIRST IT BURNED MY EYES SO BAD AND MY EYELASHES STAYED ON FOR 5 MINS SAVE YOUR MONEY I HATE THIS</li>
            <li> Great glue, goes on clear and doesn&#x27;t clump or get too sticky</li>
            <li> So much easier than the glue</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the applicator, and so far I am loving it.  My only gripe would be that when you go to reuse your eyelashes it is semi-difficult to get the old glue off.</li>
            <li> This adhesive is great for securing lashes but the only problem I incurred was that it dried too fast. It would be dry by the time I bring lashes to my eye.</li>
            <li> It is ok...The hold Isn&#x27;t all that though, and it burns your eyes if it drops in there and stuffs.</li>
            <li> This is the worst one , it does not stick at all ! And it has glue strings hanging from it at all times when trying to apply .</li>
            <li> Use good but just entering the eye is burning, and this disadvantage.</li>
            <li> I am not sensitive to many things but this burns my eyes like nothing else. I don&#x27;t get it in my eye, but I guess it&#x27;s from where it&#x27;s so close to my eyes it just makes them water so bad. It does work though, and it doesn&#x27;t make It impossible to remove the lashes after</li>
            <li> yaya I lost literallychunks of my eyelashes due to medications I was taking in the past. I never dreamed this stuff would work so well and so fast the first week I thought I was just seeing what I wanted to see the second week wow I have all my lashes and they are longer stronger im so very happy thank u. doesn&#x27;t itch or hurt if u o get some in the eye lol</li>
            <li> It has a slight odor but nothing I can&#x27;t handle. It&#x27;s very sticky and still requires dry time only that&#x27;s after you put the lashes on. So be careful not to touch your lashes until this stuff dries.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as Duo, Benefit or Revlon. I can&#x27;t get it to stick with anything, not even individual clusters, which you&#x27;d think would be easier. Gets crusty, flakes off, just super annoying all around. Waste of money. Buy another brand.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and it does what its supposed to a great job at it too the only thing I guess I dont like is when you apply it on the lashes and then put the lashes on it kinda burns but it only lasts a few seconds other than that its a good product</li>
            <li> Eyelash glue does not maintain its adhesive over liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I used this once, and I need more use of it.  I like the fact that its clear.</li>
            <li> I read several reviews on this item before I made a decision on buying...when I received this product I immediately tried it with my silken lashes...the reviews were spot on...There was a little smell to the glue but I chalked it up to being a glue product and how no matter what brand you decide on the smell will be there anyway...it didn&#x27;t bother me....The glue needs to be liberally put on the rim of the lash...it has to be a few seconds before applying to the eyelid so the lash will stick properly. As for flaking...it was there at the end of the night when i was about to take it off...as for falling off and having to reapply the glue...didn&#x27;t have to do it...I like this product...it does what it says...being new to wearing false lashes I will be trying other glues just to compare..but for now I&#x27;m pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this adhesive because of the little brush.  I am new to the world of false eyelashes.  The problem I am having is I either don&#x27;t use enough adhesive or it drys by the time I get the lashes in the right place.  I do not feel this is the products fault...I will get the hand of it eventually If I keep practicing.  That said, this product really has very little smell and goes on the lashes smoothly.  I really do love it and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the clear brush on adhesive.  Easy to apply you get it exactly where you want it and it is clear when it dries</li>
            <li> No glue that burns my eyes is worthy! Never use this product!! There are so many other adhesives you can use.</li>
            <li> Very good for me .. get the job done ...</li>
            <li> i love this eyelash glue. this is so much better than the regular small glue tubes you get in the store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this last adhesive for a while and all of a sudden the beauty supply I use stop carrying it and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally so I tried Amazon. I do love this product very much; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else for my lashes; I strongly recommend this product. If you are needing it in a hurry this is not the best seller, I did get it almost 2 weeks later. Apparently they take their time shipping out their orders. I was in dire straits and needed this to take with me on a trip out of town, but it did not make it to me in time.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS SO EASY TO USE !!!</li>
            <li> I use this more often to do art makeup. It is great for gluing on jewels etc. It is better for individual lashes or accent lashes than full strip. That said, I love it &amp; am bummed to be almost all out of it. I hope it arrives soon.</li>
            <li> I tried a tube with a tubular tip applicator and trew it away after the first use because it is so messy. A brush works much better. .</li>
            <li> I love this for false lashes. I apply directly to mu lash line. I have not had any irritation and the lash goes right on and stays all night! If using that method be careful. Probably not meant for that type of application, but i have sensitive eyes and this has been ok and I have used for over a year.</li>
            <li> Horribly quality. Doesn&#x27;t hold lashes</li>
            <li> I still use the white duo one but this works great since some days my eyes are too sensitive for the duo. It dry fast so as soon as u put it on the lash, apply the lash to your eye lids.</li>
            <li> This product Stings when applied on Skin. It also does not stay very good, you have to put a lot. I accidentally got some in my eye and it hurt so bad! It&#x27;s hard to see the clear glue running down from the fake lash to your eye if you are not careful. It SMELLS BAD like TOXIC (Like Nail Polish or Worse). It dries up fast &amp; looses it&#x27;s stickiness, lashes comes off after a few hours, need to re-apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will try the Revlon or the new Duo - I&#x27;ve seen one without the formaldehyde ingredient. I like Duo the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINALLY I FOUND THE PERFECT FAKE EYELASH GLUE - It&#x27;s the DUO BRUSH ON GLUE - WHITE turns to CLEAR. It&#x27;s opposite of Ardell such as: No Smell, Does not hurt on skin, you can see the white glue &amp; can wipe excess off to avoid going into the eye, it turns clear, It&#x27;s not gooey where it dries in seconds, even if its still liquidy you can apply lashes right away to eyelid &amp; it sticks. It lasts all day &amp; no re-apply needed. I fell asleep with it with a not so good fake lash (cheap ones from ebay) &amp; to my surprise the lashes where still on! It does not hurt to remove. So Love the DUO HATE THE ARDELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your Money! Most Ardell Glues are disappointing so don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Does the job hurts like a butch to take off if some gets on the lashes</li>
            <li> This is a great product for day use of lashes.  It only lasts one day and washes off with water.  The other adhesives for lashes last longer but build up on the lashes.</li>
            <li> all tho i love the fact that this product is latex free and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.. i am very disappointed with the finished product because lets face it .. it doesn&#x27;t do much of anything! could not get the lashes to stay on and once they would stick they wouldn&#x27;t stay on for long .</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it doesn&#x27;t dry gummy like most lash glues. It gives off some pretty strong fumes at first so wait a bit before you put it near your eyes, but its not that bad. Also works super well to glue gems on your face and body.</li>
            <li> it doesnt really stick to my eye very well i had to keep re-aplying it all day</li>
            <li> This is the best adhesive for lashes. Not to harsh and easy to remove</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work. The glue does not hold. Save your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically like watered down clear nail polish, it smells very strong and burns your eyes very much, even if it doesn&#x27;t get in your eye but it irritated my eyelids a lot. Also does not last at all it would most likely have to be reapplied every hour or two. I would suggest duo instead. It works way better!!!!</li>
            <li> First time using eyelashes and glue, I thought this product was ok (considering first time ever using anything like it). The applicator is wonderful but the product is flakey and will not withstand water or any kind of moisture. It can burn if you try to apply the lashes while the glue is still wet, and it does smell slightly bad! But other than that I think this product is good for bigginers and learning the ways of fake lashes.&lt;br /&gt;  Chandell Arsenault&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Just brush it on the false eyelashes and apply. Not much could be simpler than this product! No white, messy adhesive to cover. Dries promptly and is easy to use. This is my second tube of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Used it last night.  It&#x27;s clear so you can&#x27;t see how much you&#x27;ve put on, but there definitely is NO LATEX in the product or my eyes would have swollen shut.</li>
            <li> Stronger and longer-lasting than any other lash glue I&#x27;ve used. I have not really noticed any strong odor either. I hope they&#x27;ll never discontinue this.</li>
    </ol>
