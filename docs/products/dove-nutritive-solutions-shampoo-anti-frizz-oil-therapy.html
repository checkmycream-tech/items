    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>but for me it worked and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed by this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works best with blow-drying, but even plumps up air-dried curls!</li>
            <li>great product.  </li>
            <li>Gives great volume and lift.</li>
            <li>It also had a great smell to it.</li>
            <li>It does NOTHING for adding moisture, but it works great for the volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, that stuff is great.</li>
            <li>If anything, you might be happy with the moisture effect it has rather than the root lift it doesn&#x27;t quite deliver.</li>
            <li>Now I apply a fair amount</li>
            <li>product smells really good, but just did not perform well for me at all.</li>
            <li>It smells really good</li>
            <li>very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love the look of my hair after using this .my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>I love the root lift spray!</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I just wish more stores sold it -- like Target!  </li>
            <li>I love this and am super happy to have found it!  </li>
            <li>I have that amazing airy feeling at my roots that is indicative of volume for me.  </li>
            <li>I thought it did a nice job with my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, and this product didn&#x27;t work well for me at all.  </li>
            <li>This is a very light hold spray/mist.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice inexpensive volumizer for fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>So many of these claims are just that nothing but claims...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want a lot of poof or height and am able to get the look</li>
            <li>No you will not get a ton of lift on the top, from this product.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap and it may make a difference in your hair!</li>
            <li>For me, the root lift spray was just OK.</li>
            <li>, I will find that it holds better.  </li>
            <li>This product may work better for others.</li>
            <li>I really love this root lifter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for more ways to add volume to my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product smells nice and gave my roots a nice lift, which was surprising since I have very long hair.</li>
            <li>Really nothing good to say about this.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, kind of like downy fabric softener, soft and clean smell, with a nice feel, not sticky or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, isn&#x27;t sticky once its on your hair and doesn&#x27;t freeze it in place.  </li>
            <li>This bottle fits well in my hand and I can easily push the button</li>
            <li>Surprising from a usually decent product line.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice, clean and fresh smelling.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine so it should work well.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair and ton of it.  </li>
            <li>This gives me a natural volume &amp; it has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Sprayed at the roots, this root lift spray not only gives a nice boost but it smells wonderful like most (not the dry oil conditioner!)</li>
            <li>My hair everyday has been just like what my perfect hair days are.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice gentle styling spray.</li>
            <li>She likes the light scent of the product and the light lift it provides.</li>
            <li>Even after sleeping, the product still provides some light lift.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light fragrance, not heavily perfumed.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and it does a great job of gently moisturizing my hair before I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>Not good-left my hair feeling super greasy and did not lift at all.</li>
            <li>When I first began using Dove, the first benefit I noticed from the product was that my hair was a bit softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>This really does the job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Also has a very noticeable cheap air freshener like smell.</li>
            <li>Dove rarely disappoints, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying out just to see.</li>
            <li>My fine hair is so flat at the top</li>
            <li>Mostly the benefit here is that it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave things exceptionally stiff.</li>
            <li>I stopped using the product for some time and went back to my tried and true Tigi Catwalk and got more noticeable lift from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference when I did not use it Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>She has had great success with the more expensive [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have finely textured hair that prefers to lay flat unless I put forth a strong effort in making it do otherwise.</li>
            <li>First, it has a light fresh scent that I actually enjoyed, but if you use other hair products you may not like the mix of scents.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well enough on fine hair, but I&#x27;m not convinced that a special hair product is needed for this purpose.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this spray I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>Regular mouse works better.</li>
            <li>When I first put this in my hair, I had noticeable volume increase.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well to add a bit of lift to the root area of my hair.  </li>
            <li>or my current favorite root</li>
            <li>Personally for my hair type I noticed more fullness and lift with the foam than I did with this product.  </li>
            <li>She has tried many different root lifters at similar price points, but this is her favorite.</li>
            <li>that was a bit better, but really, I don&#x27;t see much difference besides a little better hold, like I would get with using a hairspray.</li>
            <li>I plan to try it a few more times, maybe with a light teasing to go along with it</li>
            <li>I believe this stuff if a very light hairspray and it works wonders on my very long thin..flat..hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the Dove root lift for a longer length of time, it seemed to be less effective on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is quite strong, and persisted until I washed my hair the following morning.</li>
            <li>but I noticed reviewers with fine hair say the same.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find much lift.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Dove.</li>
            <li>I have to give a three star neutral rating to as I did not see it has much effect on my hair at all.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really give my hair the promised lift</li>
            <li>From my daughter: I really like all the Dove hair and skin care products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
            <li>I really have no way of knowing because there aren&#x27;t any directions on the product about how to apply, when to apply, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After sleeping with this spray in my hair, my hair is really yucky.</li>
            <li>Cheap enough to try or replace your high-end product!</li>
            <li>Applying this product at the top of my head and near the roots before I blow dry and style it gives it enough lift to keep it looking more bouncy and alive.</li>
            <li>But unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference except for a very light hold which is the only good thing about it.  </li>
            <li>You can probably find similarly effective stuff for a little less money (or more per container) if you want, but on the other hand this seems to do a little better for softness and scent than most</li>
            <li>If your hair is fine or thin, it may hold better.</li>
            <li>I like the lighter fragrances of this new Dove line of hair care products, but this root lift spray doesn&#x27;t seem to do all that much for my hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s possible that this works better with short hair than longer hair like I have.</li>
            <li>I found this spray to do a decent job at adding some volume without changing the appearance of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a ton of money on all price levels of product and I have never found anything that does that (and holds for any length of time) with fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally pin straight hair.</li>
            <li>and i don&#x27;t get any stickiness or shine that I get when using normal hair</li>
            <li>but it also didn&#x27;t make it more limp or oily looking.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, long hair that&#x27;s always flat, so I&#x27;m in search of a product that&#x27;ll do exactly what this one claims.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried applying this root lift spray on wet and on dry hair, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my teenage daughter who has long, fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>I do however like their new</li>
            <li>I  thought it was pleasant and subtle enough not to be a problem.</li>
            <li>At least it is a cheap product, so it may still be worth a try for you or someone in your family...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if that meant on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li>I was curious to try this product out because I do enjoy Dove shampoos and conditioners and also recently tried [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>and I was surprised.  </li>
            <li>It kept my hair soft and in place.</li>
            <li>The results were nearly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Recently I got a much shorter cut, so thought I would try this out to see if it helped with lift.  </li>
            <li>Dove Root Lift Spray is basically a light hair spray to be applied to the roots before blow-drying with a round brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also flip my head upside down and blow dry to help give more lift and body.</li>
            <li>I have never used a root lift product before, and while this did everything it claimed, I feel like I prefer a more simple hair care/styling routine, so once this runs out, I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>This root lift spray made my hair hard to dry - kind of like when you don&#x27;t rinse out all of the conditioner</li>
            <li>For reference, my hair is very long, layered, wavy/curly, but thin and fairly lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have waist length blonde hair that can be pretty flat if I don&#x27;t add anything to it.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it on dry hair and lifted and sprayed at the roots, then brushed.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t think the directions were as clear enough as they could have been.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I ordered it last month and it is already almost completely gone.</li>
            <li>It took forever to dry and nothing really was different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see much as far as results go, and when I sprayed on dry hair it left a strange grease shine.  </li>
            <li>With this product I didn&#x27;t notice more than a very subtle improvement to my hair in fullness and body.</li>
            <li>The directions aren&#x27;t clear whether to use it on damp or dry hair.  </li>

            <li> I have spent a ton of money on all price levels of product and I have never found anything that does that (and holds for any length of time) with fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally pin straight hair.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t get any stickiness or shine that I get when using normal hair</li>
            <li> but it also didn&#x27;t make it more limp or oily looking.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, long hair that&#x27;s always flat, so I&#x27;m in search of a product that&#x27;ll do exactly what this one claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried applying this root lift spray on wet and on dry hair, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who has long, fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> I do however like their new</li>
            <li> I  thought it was pleasant and subtle enough not to be a problem.</li>
            <li> At least it is a cheap product, so it may still be worth a try for you or someone in your family...</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if that meant on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> I was curious to try this product out because I do enjoy Dove shampoos and conditioners and also recently tried [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> and I was surprised.  </li>
            <li> It kept my hair soft and in place.</li>
            <li> The results were nearly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Recently I got a much shorter cut, so thought I would try this out to see if it helped with lift.  </li>
            <li> Dove Root Lift Spray is basically a light hair spray to be applied to the roots before blow-drying with a round brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also flip my head upside down and blow dry to help give more lift and body.</li>
            <li> I have never used a root lift product before, and while this did everything it claimed, I feel like I prefer a more simple hair care/styling routine, so once this runs out, I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This root lift spray made my hair hard to dry - kind of like when you don&#x27;t rinse out all of the conditioner</li>
            <li> For reference, my hair is very long, layered, wavy/curly, but thin and fairly lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have waist length blonde hair that can be pretty flat if I don&#x27;t add anything to it.  </li>
            <li> I first tried it on dry hair and lifted and sprayed at the roots, then brushed.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t think the directions were as clear enough as they could have been.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I ordered it last month and it is already almost completely gone.</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry and nothing really was different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see much as far as results go, and when I sprayed on dry hair it left a strange grease shine.  </li>
            <li> With this product I didn&#x27;t notice more than a very subtle improvement to my hair in fullness and body.</li>
            <li> The directions aren&#x27;t clear whether to use it on damp or dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The lift is subtle (not crazy volume).  </li>
            <li> intent when ordering this product was to give my hair some volume at the front because it always sits so flat against my head.</li>
            <li> This probably seems a little absurd, but I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m supposed to use this product, so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t do much may be my own fault.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and heavy but after blow drying I am often left with little of the fullness up top, so I was curious to try this spray.</li>
            <li> it looks like I&#x27;ve had a hat on all day long.</li>
            <li> So, the next day, I was careful to use the conditioner sparingly</li>
            <li> it being rather long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to give you &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; hair, but it does add lift, even for long hair (mid-back length).</li>
            <li> You cannot just spray it on dry roots and expect them to plump up.</li>
            <li> and I was hoping this spray would help with root lift specially on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> The instructions don&#x27;t say whether to use this on damp hair or dry hair, so I tried it</li>
            <li> and you try to blow dry it</li>
            <li> the remaining root lift spray, I tend to use it when my hair has been feeling slightly dry</li>
            <li> My hair is curly, but tends to be rather flat due to</li>
            <li> I only noticed a few times that when I sprayed too much my hair got a little stiff, but it was never sticky or flaky.</li>
            <li> It just said spray in hair without specifying if it should be wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I tried using less of it, but I still had the same results.</li>
            <li> I simply spray at the roots, blow dry and flip my hair a few times, hit with some heat and that seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat disappointing since I didn&#x27;t notice any added body or fullness in my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired this root lift spray on my hair when it&#x27;s wet and dry, and I just don&#x27;t get much of any results from it.</li>
            <li> I have thick medium textured straight hair and blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of lift in my short A-line cut, but nothing that could replace backcombing (which isn&#x27;t the healthiest option for hair, so I don&#x27;t do it—</li>
            <li> I tried it on wet and went the blow drying route -</li>
            <li> Since this one didn&#x27;t say wet hair, I used it on my hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple application, no real skill or tricks involved.</li>
            <li> My hair was fuller at the roots, not flat against my scalp as usual.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally try hair lifting sprays because my hair is thick and heavy and the weight usually pulls it flat at the roots.  </li>
            <li> She sprays it on wet hair and turns her head upside down while blow drying to maximize the lift.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other root lifters that need to be used on wet hair and blow dried to get the desired effect.  </li>

            <li> It also does not weigh it down.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product.  Does not weigh your hair down</li>
            <li> This really does the job and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not good-left my hair feeling super greasy and did not lift at all. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> very pleased.  After losing all my hair to chemo, what came back was limp and impossible.  This product actually added body and lift to the hair and I was surprised.  So many of these claims are just that nothing but claims...but for me it worked and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Gives great volume and lift. Also gives my hair enough texture to hold a curl. Nothing has ever helped my hair hold a curl like this has.</li>
            <li> lift root while moisture scalp. Besides, it makes my hair smoother. I forgot to spray it for twice. I can see a huge difference when I did not use it Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I believe this stuff if a very light hairspray and it works wonders on my very long thin..flat..hair. But keep in mind its no miracle. You cannot just spray it on dry roots and expect them to plump up. You have to apply it to towel dried roots before blow drying. I also flip my head upside down and blow dry to help give more lift and body. Now I apply a fair amount and i don&#x27;t get any stickiness or shine that I get when using normal hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that in order to get serious volume, I would suspect you would also need to tease you hair. This gives me a natural volume &amp; it has a light pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am applying it incorrectly but I don&#x27;t find much lift.  My hair is fine so it should work well.  I guess it could be stronger.</li>
            <li> Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Root Lift Spray gets rid of my plastered hair look. My fine hair is so flat at the top it looks like I&#x27;ve had a hat on all day long. Applying this product at the top of my head and near the roots before I blow dry and style it gives it enough lift to keep it looking more bouncy and alive. Not plastered to my head. I don&#x27;t want a lot of poof or height and am able to get the look I&#x27;m after. I like the fruity fragrance and that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy hair and ton of it.  No product has ever worked so well for me.  My hair everyday has been just like what my perfect hair days are.  No you will not get a ton of lift on the top, from this product.  I am a hair product junkie.  I have spent a ton of money on all price levels of product and I have never found anything that does that (and holds for any length of time) with fine hair.  I love this and am super happy to have found it!  Thanks, Dove.</li>
            <li> I have thick medium textured straight hair and blow dry with a round brush. A liberal application of this gave no noticeable lift.&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe my hair is too heavy but I noticed reviewers with fine hair say the same. Also has a very noticeable cheap air freshener like smell. Really nothing good to say about this. Surprising from a usually decent product line.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hair care products in the last few months thanks to the Amazon Vine program.  This root lift spry by Dove I have to give a three star neutral rating to as I did not see it has much effect on my hair at all.  It didn&#x27;t really give my hair the promised lift but it also didn&#x27;t make it more limp or oily looking.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with leave in hair conditioners and when needed a bit of hair spray for the time being.  As for thescent of this product I  thought it was pleasant and subtle enough not to be a problem.</li>
            <li> From my daughter: I really like all the Dove hair and skin care products. This product smells nice and gave my roots a nice lift, which was surprising since I have very long hair. I only noticed a few times that when I sprayed too much my hair got a little stiff, but it was never sticky or flaky. I have never used a root lift product before, and while this did everything it claimed, I feel like I prefer a more simple hair care/styling routine, so once this runs out, I&#x27;m not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a nice gentle styling spray. It kept my hair soft and in place. I thought it did a nice job with my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very light hold spray/mist.  My hair is fine/med texture and about 2 inches below my shoulders.  It is wavy and I was hoping this spray would help with root lift specially on dry hair.  But unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference except for a very light hold which is the only good thing about it.  Didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I experimented with this after using the matching shampoo and conditioner. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair&#x27;s volume. So, the next day, I was careful to use the conditioner sparingly (I was a little worried that it may have weighed-down my hair). The results were nearly the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price, if you are inclined to give this a try, you should. It is cheap and it may make a difference in your hair!</li>
            <li> This probably seems a little absurd, but I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m supposed to use this product, so the fact that it doesn&#x27;t do much may be my own fault. I really have no way of knowing because there aren&#x27;t any directions on the product about how to apply, when to apply, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My intent when ordering this product was to give my hair some volume at the front because it always sits so flat against my head. My hair is curly, but tends to be rather flat due to it being rather long. I&#x27;ve tried applying this root lift spray on wet and on dry hair, and I honestly can&#x27;t tell the difference between when I use it and when I don&#x27;t. If I&#x27;m getting any volume, it&#x27;s from fluffing my hair with a brush, but I don&#x27;t think that this product is helping. My hair does look glossy when I use it, so that is a plus.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the pithy instructions which didn&#x27;t really help to tell how to use the product. I first tried it on dry hair and lifted and sprayed at the roots, then brushed. It took forever to dry and nothing really was different. I tried it on wet and went the blow drying route - that was a bit better, but really, I don&#x27;t see much difference besides a little better hold, like I would get with using a hairspray. It&#x27;s possible I could be doing it wrong and it&#x27;s possible that this works better with short hair than longer hair like I have. For me, the root lift spray was just OK.</li>
            <li> I love the root lift spray! It worked so well. It also had a great smell to it. It also held all day (about 6 hours) and I didn&#x27;t have to do anything extra but use it! Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat disappointing since I didn&#x27;t notice any added body or fullness in my fine hair.  I also didn&#x27;t think the directions were as clear enough as they could have been.  It just said spray in hair without specifying if it should be wet or dry hair. I&#x27;ve used other root lifters that need to be used on wet hair and blow dried to get the desired effect.  Since this one didn&#x27;t say wet hair, I used it on my hair dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t smell weird nor is it sticky, but it just didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> The instructions don&#x27;t say whether to use this on damp hair or dry hair, so I tried it both ways-- and it didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference in either case. I have fine, long hair that&#x27;s always flat, so I&#x27;m in search of a product that&#x27;ll do exactly what this one claims. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll have to keep looking!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally try hair lifting sprays because my hair is thick and heavy and the weight usually pulls it flat at the roots.  The first time I tried this spray I could tell a difference.  My hair was fuller at the roots, not flat against my scalp as usual.  It&#x27;s easy to use, isn&#x27;t sticky once its on your hair and doesn&#x27;t freeze it in place.  It has a nice light fragrance, not heavily perfumed. I&#x27;m impressed by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have waist length blonde hair that can be pretty flat if I don&#x27;t add anything to it.  I found this spray to do a decent job at adding some volume without changing the appearance of my hair.  It does NOTHING for adding moisture, but it works great for the volume.&lt;br /&gt;(don&#x27;t try their foam version, it&#x27;s horrid!!!)</li>
            <li> This root lift spray made my hair hard to dry - kind of like when you don&#x27;t rinse out all of the conditioner and you try to blow dry it and it just gets kinda gunky. I tried using less of it, but I still had the same results. It makes my hair get too matted, also. After sleeping with this spray in my hair, my hair is really yucky. Its like it kind of just clumped together in a nasty matted up mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried using some of it in the bulk of my hair and closer to the ends and it did give some body there, but I do not like the texture it gives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stays sort of sticky on the hair, especially when used at the roots and frizzy/dry looking and sticky when used in the bulk of the hair. Weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this again. For reference, my hair is very long, layered, wavy/curly, but thin and fairly lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells really good, but just did not perform well for me at all. I tried using it with and without gel or mousse and still just could not find a way to make it work out well for me.</li>
            <li> I like the lighter fragrances of this new Dove line of hair care products, but this root lift spray doesn&#x27;t seem to do all that much for my hair. Regular mouse works better. I do however like their new [[ASIN:B00HM6IV6K Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam]], which gives my hair body, a bit of lift and just a touch of texture to help it hold it&#x27;s style. I&#x27;ve tired this root lift spray on my hair when it&#x27;s wet and dry, and I just don&#x27;t get much of any results from it. Not enough that I would get another bottle. But the Dove Leave In Foam, that stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick, heavy hair with a slight bit of a wave.  I have a terrible time getting lift at the roots, probably because of the weight of the hair pulling it back down.  Recently I got a much shorter cut, so thought I would try this out to see if it helped with lift.  I love the fragrance, kind of like downy fabric softener, soft and clean smell, with a nice feel, not sticky or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;.  I did notice a bit of lift immediately after drying the hair, but within about an hour it looks the same as always.  I plan to try it a few more times, maybe with a light teasing to go along with it, I will find that it holds better.  If your hair is fine or thin, it may hold better.</li>
            <li> When I first put this in my hair, I had noticeable volume increase. However, as the day wore on, my hair was flattened quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have fine hair, and it does a great job of gently moisturizing my hair before I blow dry.  It also does not weigh it down.  The lift is subtle (not crazy volume).  Also does not leave hair sticky, greasy, or crunchy.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> Dove rarely disappoints, and this is no exception. I have naturally pin straight hair. Sprayed at the roots, this root lift spray not only gives a nice boost but it smells wonderful like most (not the dry oil conditioner!) of Dove&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple application, no real skill or tricks involved. I simply spray at the roots, blow dry and flip my hair a few times, hit with some heat and that seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well to add a bit of lift to the root area of my hair.  The scent is nice, clean and fresh smelling.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or crunchy where I use it.  It&#x27;s a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes my fingers are a little achy in the morning and it can be hard to push down some spray.  This bottle fits well in my hand and I can easily push the button so I get the product where I want it.</li>
            <li> I love the look of my hair after using this .my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> Picked up this product for my daughter. She has tried it out, but says it doesn&#x27;t have any benefit. She stopped using it after several uses and then gave it to a friend to try. She told me not to get it again. Oh well. At least it is a cheap product, so it may still be worth a try for you or someone in your family...</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dove moisture root lift on and off for a while, keeping an eye out for any noticeable differences between when I use it, when I don&#x27;t, and when I use a competitor&#x27;s product. When I first began using Dove, the first benefit I noticed from the product was that my hair was a bit softer and more manageable. There was a little bit of lift in my short A-line cut, but nothing that could replace backcombing (which isn&#x27;t the healthiest option for hair, so I don&#x27;t do it—plus I&#x27;m awful at it!) or my current favorite root lifter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Dove root lift for a longer length of time, it seemed to be less effective on my hair. I have finely textured hair that prefers to lay flat unless I put forth a strong effort in making it do otherwise. I stopped using the product for some time and went back to my tried and true Tigi Catwalk and got more noticeable lift from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the remaining root lift spray, I tend to use it when my hair has been feeling slightly dry and I want it to look softer. This product may work better for others. For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying out just to see. If anything, you might be happy with the moisture effect it has rather than the root lift it doesn&#x27;t quite deliver.</li>
            <li> I really love this root lifter.  It smells really good and it&#x27;s so light-weight.  I have that amazing airy feeling at my roots that is indicative of volume for me.  I just wish more stores sold it -- like Target!  I&#x27;m going to check at Walgreens this week since I&#x27;m all but out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for more ways to add volume to my hair.  Even though it is thick, it can sometimes still look limp.  I was curious to try this product out because I do enjoy Dove shampoos and conditioners and also recently tried [[ASIN:B00HM6IV6K Dove Hair Styling Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam, 5.1 Ounce]].  Personally for my hair type I noticed more fullness and lift with the foam than I did with this product.  With this product I didn&#x27;t notice more than a very subtle improvement to my hair in fullness and body.</li>
            <li> Dove Root Lift Spray is basically a light hair spray to be applied to the roots before blow-drying with a round brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well enough on fine hair, but I&#x27;m not convinced that a special hair product is needed for this purpose.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my teenage daughter who has long, fine straight hair. She has tried many different root lifters at similar price points, but this is her favorite. In fact, I ordered it last month and it is already almost completely gone. She likes the light scent of the product and the light lift it provides. She sprays it on wet hair and turns her head upside down while blow drying to maximize the lift. Even after sleeping, the product still provides some light lift. It&#x27;s not going to give you &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; hair, but it does add lift, even for long hair (mid-back length).</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and heavy but after blow drying I am often left with little of the fullness up top, so I was curious to try this spray. First, it has a light fresh scent that I actually enjoyed, but if you use other hair products you may not like the mix of scents.  The directions simply say to spray on roots and brush through.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if that meant on wet or dry hair so I tried both.  I really didn&#x27;t see much as far as results go, and when I sprayed on dry hair it left a strange grease shine.  I think I will continue looking for something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finding this to be pretty similar in effectiveness to other styling products. Mostly the benefit here is that it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t leave things exceptionally stiff. You can probably find similarly effective stuff for a little less money (or more per container) if you want, but on the other hand this seems to do a little better for softness and scent than most</li>
            <li> This is a nice inexpensive volumizer for fine curly hair. Works best with blow-drying, but even plumps up air-dried curls! Cheap enough to try or replace your high-end product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave hair sticky</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, and this product didn&#x27;t work well for me at all.  The directions aren&#x27;t clear whether to use it on damp or dry hair.  So, I tried it both ways.  Both times, the roots of my hair looked greasy, even though I used very little of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a personal preference, but I didn&#x27;t like the scent of this product at all.  It is quite strong, and persisted until I washed my hair the following morning.</li>
            <li> My wife tried the Dove Hair Styling Root Spray Lift multiple times, hoping to find an inexpensive alternative to what she currently uses. She was very disappointed with this product, saying it just makes her hair feel heavy and look dirty. She has had great success with the more expensive [[ASIN:B00CBD0M8Y Toni&amp;Guy Casual Sculpting Powder]]. She is throwing out the rest of this.</li>
