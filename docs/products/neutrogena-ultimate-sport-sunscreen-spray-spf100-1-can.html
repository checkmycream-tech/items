            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of blocking sun damage.</li>
            <li>Thank you neutrogena, you have ruined what might have been a very nice review and a bathing suit.</li>
            <li>For me it&#x27;s a excellent product , because it&#x27;s not greasy when you aply in your skin , and in spray  better</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant too.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>FAIR SKINNED PEOPLE LIKE ME</li>
            <li>I bought this sunblock and I love it!</li>
            <li>Thanks to this wonderful spray</li>
            <li>I burn very easily</li>
            <li>guess I&#x27;ve tried around ten sunscreens now, and while this one isn&#x27;t amazing, it&#x27;s the best of what I&#x27;ve used up to this point.</li>
            <li>would be better to send in the box .....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried this product before, but SPF 100 sounded a lot better than the SPF30 I was carrying.    </li>
            <li>Since sun&#x3D; wrinkles and skin cancer, I am glad a product like this exists.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe to use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found with most suncreens</li>
            <li>It does leave my skin looking a bit shinier, but it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; type shiny than &amp;#34;greaseball&amp;#34; type shiny.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen was OK.</li>
            <li>In AZ, where it&#x27;s normal to play in 110F, we definitely need sunscreen and this product is very nice and very effective.</li>
            <li>it was nicely packed and exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pasty and I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I like this product, light, not greasy, practical,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now my hands are completely free of age spots.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve been set free.</li>
            <li>thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li>Easy to put on and does the job right.</li>
            <li>full sun protection, i rub it on my hands put it on my face, put my make up on</li>
            <li>It was useful over three years in removing the age spots from my hands caused by use of a tanning medication that continued to create darkening because of the area exposed to light.  </li>
            <li>Mildly sweet and that... synthetic sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>It is  a prefect sun proteccion cream ,and th e delive ry was quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is really powerful stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s kind of greasy when applied on my back.</li>
            <li>I am looking at it right now Sunblock, picture sunblock.</li>
            <li>Have you not heard of the customer is right?</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t use creams again... ;)</li>
            <li>am aware that not everyone knows the difference between sunscreen and sunblock</li>
            <li>We used this sunblock on a week long theme park vacation with outstanding results.</li>
            <li>I love that this has such a high SPF and is non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to go..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t burn and didn&#x27;t get too much of a tan.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to spray on sunscreen.</li>
            <li>so economic werever</li>
            <li>One star is too much.</li>
            <li>Keep in m ind, it takes 30 minutes to fully &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and so it needs to be applied more than every two hours, to be active in that amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide should be your main ingredients for sunblock.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunblock I&#x27;ve used, that actually makes me look better while I&#x27;m wearing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had a mild burn once while using this, and it was because I was updating it every two hours.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECCOMEND</li>
            <li>you wouldn&#x27;t leave home without your wallet, and now that the uv in georgia is up to a 4, don&#x27;t leave home without a light spray of sunscreen, it works miracles and PREVENTS aging completely on African American women...</li>
            <li>Need to reapply every few hrs if in full sun or sweating profusely, but works pretty darn well.</li>
            <li>, I like it that it is high spf but a clear spray, not a lotion.</li>
            <li>A little bit shiny on my skin but other than that its good</li>
            <li>If I put cologne on top of it, it&#x27;s instantly smothered, unlike every other spray on sunscreen</li>
            <li>Just spent a full day on location in the desert where it was 110 degrees in the shade and the sun was blaring all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly well above average.rage.</li>
            <li>I always trust Neutrogena products for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only had to re-apply to twice, and it lasted a whole day of swimming, and sweating.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re all natural or not.</li>
            <li>I am rather olive skinned and tan very well, so I know it definitely does not do ANYTHING to protect my skin.</li>
            <li>Naturally I would think thats what</li>
            <li>I mean, I look 19 all over, and I don&#x27;t darken at all when the sun gets stronger, so i am in love with this product and recommend stocking up, for the upcoming season</li>
            <li>I burn very easily, and Im not talking a little pink.</li>
            <li>Keeps my lily white rear from getting burned in the high desert.</li>
            <li>I would say it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as the rated time if you&#x27;re in intense sun(and probably sweating).</li>
            <li>the product arrived much faster than i expected it to.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product a couple of times so far</li>
            <li>The white on my suit is now orange and so far nothing has worked to get it out.    </li>
            <li>is the first one that doesn&#x27;t look oily after about a half hour(especially if I bead my face with a paper towel after about 20-30 minutes).</li>
            <li>so you have no excuse not to wear it!!</li>
            <li>I applied on my 5 year old son and myself to be at the beach and only managed to get the only burn I have had in twenty years.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I applied on my 5 year old son and myself to be at the beach and only managed to get the only burn I have had in twenty years.</li>
            <li> This one stops smelling like sunscreen after about 15-20 minutes for other people, and I can&#x27;t even smell it by sniffing my skin directly after about an hour.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short:  </li>
            <li> On the upside, it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> After spending 7 days on the beach in Montego Bay, I got back to NYC as pale as I was before I left.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, I see some white heads.</li>
            <li> I spent 7 hours at the lake yesterday, applied faithfully every 2 hours , and I&#x27;m just as lily-white now</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with any other sunscreen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating this low because the name of the product is wrong, and the description(which IS on the back of the bottle)</li>
            <li> I did not get burn at all this summer,I did not even turn a little pink, it is summer time</li>
            <li> IT ALSO IS LESS OFFENSIVE TO THE EYES THAN OTHER PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> skin is sensitive and usually breaks out with sunscreen, and I work hard to keep my skin lighter</li>
            <li> My husband had been using the Coppertone Ultra Guard, but hated the sticky film it left behind, and after a round of golf, couldn&#x27;t wait to &amp;#34;shower and SCRUB this stuff off of me!&amp;#34; During a golf tournament, he was introduced to the Neutrogena sunscreen spray -- loved it, and called me from the tournament to say &amp;#34;order</li>
            <li> I do not get tan at all, I will get burned so much that actually will get sick and get fever from my burns.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but if it keeps us from burning and getting skin cancer</li>
            <li> I spray myself everyday before I go on my lunch time walks</li>
            <li> No more having to wait until dark to swim!</li>
            <li> The sprays I&#x27;ve tried in the past, always leave my face looking greasy and oily for hours.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am pale, very pale!</li>
            <li> Not a great trait to have living in the sunny desert.</li>
            <li> So disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the application instructions - never got in the water, didn&#x27;t sweat and got one of the worst burns of my life.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff works well, I like it that it is high spf but a clear spray, not a lotion.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done. I work in field and get baked by sun. This product smells and feel great. A little bit shiny on my skin but other than that its good</li>
            <li> I like this product, light, not greasy, practical,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;provides full sun protection, i rub it on my hands put it on my face, put my make up on&lt;br /&gt;and I&#x27;m ready to go.. hahahah&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great product! won&#x27;t use creams again... ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> would be better to send in the box ..... because it Recivier beaten and poured me a lot of product ............</li>
            <li> Just spent a full day on location in the desert where it was 110 degrees in the shade and the sun was blaring all day.  I burn very easily so I always use sunblock.   I&#x27;d never tried this product before, but SPF 100 sounded a lot better than the SPF30 I was carrying.    To make a long story short:  Thanks to this wonderful spray I&#x27;m the same color today as I was the day before we left - pasty white.</li>
            <li> the product arrived much faster than i expected it to. it was nicely packed and exactly what i needed. just before softball practice to.  thank you so much! :)</li>
            <li> Took this to Cancun. It didn&#x27;t disappoint. Easy to put on and does the job right. I didn&#x27;t burn and didn&#x27;t get too much of a tan. Since sun&#x3D; wrinkles and skin cancer, I am glad a product like this exists.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but if it keeps us from burning and getting skin cancer it&#x27;s worth it. The smell is pleasant too. It is not over bearing.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I always trust Neutrogena products for my sensitive skin. I have only used this product a couple of times so far but I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s a excellent product , because it&#x27;s not greasy when you aply in your skin , and in spray  better</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is phenominal. It&#x27;s so much easier to spray on sunscreen. I wish the seller would offer a 3 or 4 pack at a discount.</li>
            <li> This did do as it said and protected me from getting sunburned, however it also ruined a blue and white bathing suit I&#x27;ve had for years!    NO where on the label did it say it may stain clothes but boy did it ever. The white on my suit is now orange and so far nothing has worked to get it out.    I have never had a problem with any other sunscreen and I&#x27;ve worn this suit for years without a problem till now. Thank you neutrogena, you have ruined what might have been a very nice review and a bathing suit. This will be the last time I ever use one of their products.</li>
            <li> you wouldn&#x27;t leave home without your wallet, and now that the uv in georgia is up to a 4, don&#x27;t leave home without a light spray of sunscreen, it works miracles and PREVENTS aging completely on African American women...

In AZ, where it&#x27;s normal to play in 110F, we definitely need sunscreen and this product is very nice and very effective.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist and I bought a number.  I understand the FDA will not allow anymore labeling abve SPF50 and this will be off the market.  I use it in conjunction with my UVB treatments to thoroughly cover my hands, face, and ears.  It was useful over three years in removing the age spots from my hands caused by use of a tanning medication that continued to create darkening because of the area exposed to light.  Now my hands are completely free of age spots.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It Works 100% it blocks sun 100%  and i recomend this product to every one It&#x27;s safe to use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product---Keeps my head from getting fried !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating this low because the name of the product is wrong, and the description(which IS on the back of the bottle) is even further misleading..makes you think you&#x27;re getting sunBLOCK, but you&#x27;re not.&lt;br /&gt;I am aware that not everyone knows the difference between sunscreen and sunblock, some don&#x27;t even know there is a difference, but they are not the same thing at all.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is sensitive and usually breaks out with sunscreen, and I work hard to keep my skin lighter but I still tan and even burn sometimes with sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just beware before you buy and double check ingredients. Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide should be your main ingredients for sunblock.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the application instructions - never got in the water, didn&#x27;t sweat and got one of the worst burns of my life. So disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection for all family members. We used this sunblock on a week long theme park vacation with outstanding results.</li>
            <li> It is  a prefect sun proteccion cream ,and th e delive ry was quickly. so economic werever tomorrowthe end .</li>
            <li> This is really powerful stuff.  After spending 7 days on the beach in Montego Bay, I got back to NYC as pale as I was before I left.  My co-workers did not even believe I was away on vacation.  I only had to re-apply to twice, and it lasted a whole day of swimming, and sweating.  This is the type of sunblock you don&#x27;t have to rub in, just spray and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Keeps my lily white rear from getting burned in the high desert. Need to reapply every few hrs if in full sun or sweating profusely, but works pretty darn well.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. I CAN STAY IN THE SUN FOR HOURS ON END AND NOT SHOW ANY SIGNS(BURNS) OF BEING OUT IN THE SUN. IT ALSO IS LESS OFFENSIVE TO THE EYES THAN OTHER PRODUCTS. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND IT FOR FAIR SKINNED PEOPLE LIKE ME</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found with most suncreens it&#x27;s a trade off between being greasy or being pore clogging. All of the creams I&#x27;ve tried, break me out. Doesn&#x27;t matter if they&#x27;re all natural or not. After a few uses, I see some white heads. The sprays I&#x27;ve tried in the past, always leave my face looking greasy and oily for hours.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first one that doesn&#x27;t look oily after about a half hour(especially if I bead my face with a paper towel after about 20-30 minutes). It does leave my skin looking a bit shinier, but it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; type shiny than &amp;#34;greaseball&amp;#34; type shiny. This is the only sunblock I&#x27;ve used, that actually makes me look better while I&#x27;m wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;As for durability and protection... I would say it doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as the rated time if you&#x27;re in intense sun(and probably sweating). If it&#x27;s sunny and you&#x27;re sweating, I&#x27;d reapply after 90 minutes or so. I&#x27;ve only had a mild burn once while using this, and it was because I was updating it every two hours. Keep in m ind, it takes 30 minutes to fully &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; and so it needs to be applied more than every two hours, to be active in that amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I will cover the smell. Well, it smells like sunscreen. Mildly sweet and that... synthetic sunscreen smell. On the upside, it doesn&#x27;t last long. One thing that made me stop using the Neutrogena Helioplex suncreen, was because it made me smell like sunscreen for several hours. If I reapplied it, it never went away. This one stops smelling like sunscreen after about 15-20 minutes for other people, and I can&#x27;t even smell it by sniffing my skin directly after about an hour. If I put cologne on top of it, it&#x27;s instantly smothered, unlike every other spray on sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ve tried around ten sunscreens now, and while this one isn&#x27;t amazing, it&#x27;s the best of what I&#x27;ve used up to this point. If you have similar concerns to mine, you should give it a shot. It&#x27;s certainly well above average.rage.</li>
            <li> I burn very easily, and Im not talking a little pink. No, I&#x27;m talking lobster red after 30 minutes. Any SPF below 75 is just like using baby oil. Not a great trait to have living in the sunny desert. After my last sunburn, my doctor told me to buy this product. It works! I spent 7 hours at the lake yesterday, applied faithfully every 2 hours , and I&#x27;m just as lily-white now as I was the day before. I feel like I&#x27;ve been set free. No more having to wait until dark to swim!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was OK. I still got burned on Daytona Beach, even reapplying it every 30 minutes. Also, it&#x27;s kind of greasy when applied on my back.</li>
            <li> One star is too much. I applied on my 5 year old son and myself to be at the beach and only managed to get the only burn I have had in twenty years. I am rather olive skinned and tan very well, so I know it definitely does not do ANYTHING to protect my skin. I am now applying burn meds on my son and myself.</li>
            <li> I am pale, very pale! I do not get tan at all, I will get burned so much that actually will get sick and get fever from my burns. I bought this sunblock and I love it! I did not get burn at all this summer,I did not even turn a little pink, it is summer time and I am still as white as snow.</li>
            <li> I bought this item thinking it was SUNBLOCK. In the listing it says SUNBLOCK and the picture says SUNBLOCK. Naturally I would think thats what im getting in the mail. I got Sunscreen. Which is completely different. When I contacted the seller, instead of giving me what I paid for they tell me its listed as sunscreen. I am looking at it right now Sunblock, picture sunblock. No where on here does it say sunscreen. Have you not heard of the customer is right? I would not be complaining if I had indeed received the correct ITEM!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pasty and I love this stuff. Even if it feels like you&#x27;re burning it&#x27;s still working. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Use it daily in Las Vegas as we go swimming. Does a great job of blocking sun damage. Would not go into my pool without this product applied 30 minutes before. Kent Oram</li>
            <li> My friend ask me to order sunblock and I receive sunscreen. Now she doesn&#x27;t want it. I am going to have to use it.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen for going in the water.</li>
            <li> I love that this has such a high SPF and is non-greasy.  I spray myself everyday before I go on my lunch time walks and I don&#x27;t have to worry about it making my skin clammy or staining my clothing while it dries.</li>
