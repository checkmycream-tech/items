    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

            <li>I don&#x27;t use the brow lifts (I don&#x27;t have bangs to cover them), but the neck lifts are great!</li>
            <li>A good purchase.</li>
            <li>The brow strips are very easy to apply, but you have to have bangs or a hairstyle that covers the area on the top of your forehead.  </li>
            <li>Please read the fine print!</li>
            <li>Scotch tape works better.</li>
            <li>You might do better with duct tape.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;m glad a lot of people have not discovered these, or made them work.</li>
            <li>The smaller tapes work best for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get better at it.  </li>
            <li>They told extra skin in place perfectly.</li>
            <li>My daughters and I did have a good laugh when I tried them out to wear for my youngest daughter&#x27;s wedding.</li>
            <li>Unless of course, you want a good laugh.</li>
            <li>I watched the \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video, which made it all look easy.</li>
            <li>Well, this product is a huge dissappointment.</li>
            <li>It is extremely important, I find, to apply alcohol to the area where you plan to place the tapes.  </li>
            <li>When pictures were being taken of me helping my daughter get ready for her wedding, the light reflecting off the tapes from the camera flash were hilarious.</li>
            <li>This product might be ok if you don&#x27;t have much \\&quot;jowling\\&quot; and you have another person to hold your \\&quot;lifted skin\\&quot; while you struggle with the tape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product.  </li>
            <li>It dries the skin adequately so that the tapes stay on longer.</li>
            <li>I got some of this stuff a long time ago and it worked pretty good for getting your picture taken etc</li>
            <li>When I want to feel fresh and awake I will wear these.</li>
            <li>This product proves miracle fixes don&#x27;t exist.  </li>
            <li>However, unless you have just the right hairstyle, these are going to show.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the right hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>They seem to slip and if it is hot by the end of the day, they come of off.  </li>
            <li>I did not use the eye-lift piece and cannot testify to how they work but the other piece, for chin and neck, worked beautifully - and lasted for any entire day!  </li>
            <li>I have ordered them in the past and they were good and made of a&lt;br /&gt;different material.  </li>
            <li>They boost my confidence so much that I really want to wear them every day.</li>
            <li>The neck strips really DO make a difference.  </li>
            <li>Save up and get the real thing.</li>
            <li>thanks anyway</li>
            <li>They take the place of a face lift of weight loss and really work.</li>
            <li>I was curious, because on the show, it really did look easy.  </li>
            <li>I was so happy with the Secret Lift tapes, which come with small bands to pull and hold the skin back, that I thought, wow, if a tape can do that without the bands that would be GREAT.</li>
            <li>You can feel the strips after application, but for me it&#x27;s worth it, because the strips really do help pull back the excess skin under my neck.  </li>
            <li>I chalked  my purchase up to my strong desire to do something non-invasive about my neck, but it is certainly not the solution.</li>
            <li>It WOULD really be nice if the tape did not have to be hidden by hair, but I just keep my hair long.</li>
            <li>When you need a little lift these do the job and were easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Cover them with hair and noone knows the clear tape is there.</li>
            <li>I do not buy mine from Amazon, but go directly to their website and get a discount for a monthly purchase.</li>
            <li>These apparently are knock offs and do not work.  </li>
            <li>Even if they would stay fixed, the tapes are so SHINY and the reflection is so obvious</li>
            <li>Pretend it&#x27;s a bandaid, and sloooowly pull back creating tension, while pulling off the long part of the paper backing, and pulling steadily up and back, stick to the skin between the back of your ear and the hairline.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy this product again, It used to be made of a translucent very flexible tape that hid pretty well behind the hair, but what I got was a hard and very shiny piece of clear plastic, almost like the plastic in which mascara is packaged.</li>

            <li> Hard to get your eyebrows exactly even.</li>
            <li> You have to have long hair below your ears to cover the strips, so I don&#x27;t think this would work at all for someone with short hair.  </li>
            <li> Kind of expensive for everyday use</li>
            <li> although I didn&#x27;t give it a go for that long.  </li>
            <li> Then remove the short end of the paper backing, and carefully stick in place under/slightly in front of earlobe.</li>
            <li> I mean really, they didn&#x27;t think to make them in a matte finish?</li>
            <li> But the tapes are very hard to work with, and they do not stick well enough to give any real lift.</li>
            <li> Wash the area well with soap and water and dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Wipe the area with alcohol and let dry.</li>
            <li> I found that the tape was a bit hard to peel back and ended up messing up several before I figured out to wiggle the backing back and forth before removing and applying.  </li>
            <li> They lift the jowls and loose neck skin</li>
            <li> That way I look younger than the other 60+ year-olds!</li>

            <li> I got some of this stuff a long time ago and it worked pretty good for getting your picture taken etc but this one has lousy glue on it.  Scotch tape works better.</li>
            <li> No Happy!  These are very hard to apply with getting the sticky tabs off.  The eyebrow lifters need to be larger. Very disappointed because they do not say on all day. They seem to slip and if it is hot by the end of the day, they come of off.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after recieveing the Secret Lift tapes. I was so happy with the Secret Lift tapes, which come with small bands to pull and hold the skin back, that I thought, wow, if a tape can do that without the bands that would be GREAT. Well, this product is a huge dissappointment. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s all me. I watched the \\&quot;how to\\&quot; video, which made it all look easy. But the tapes are very hard to work with, and they do not stick well enough to give any real lift. At least that is my experience. I am sending them back. I went to the site for the Secret Lift tapes and odered 2 refills. They boost my confidence so much that I really want to wear them every day. This product might be ok if you don&#x27;t have much \\&quot;jowling\\&quot; and you have another person to hold your \\&quot;lifted skin\\&quot; while you struggle with the tape. I don&#x27;t know.....</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s still on the market. I thought I&#x27;d been a total sucker to have bought it. The tapes were impossible to get on and didn&#x27;t stay on. Plus they were impossible to conceal.  I chalked  my purchase up to my strong desire to do something non-invasive about my neck, but it is certainly not the solution. I wish I&#x27;d had access to reviews before I bought this item.</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a local afternoon t.v. talk show.  I was curious, because on the show, it really did look easy.  The brow strips are very easy to apply, but you have to have bangs or a hairstyle that covers the area on the top of your forehead.  The neck strips really DO make a difference.  It took some practice to learn to apply the neck strips properly.  I found that the tape was a bit hard to peel back and ended up messing up several before I figured out to wiggle the backing back and forth before removing and applying.  You have to have long hair below your ears to cover the strips, so I don&#x27;t think this would work at all for someone with short hair.  You can feel the strips after application, but for me it&#x27;s worth it, because the strips really do help pull back the excess skin under my neck.  Kind of expensive for everyday use, I just wish the price were lower.  Overall, it performs as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a literal piece of crap, does not work, and is most visible to the  naked eye.  Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy this product again, It used to be made of a translucent very flexible tape that hid pretty well behind the hair, but what I got was a hard and very shiny piece of clear plastic, almost like the plastic in which mascara is packaged. It didn&#x27;t stay, and was unusable. Rather than pay shipping to return them I threw them in the trash! I am so sorry the product is something so different and awful now!  Arlene</li>
            <li> Please read the fine print! This was not what the wife expected so were back to the drawing board, oh well</li>
            <li> On the plus side, these were sticky enough to stay put without any embarrassing mishaps.  However, unless you have just the right hairstyle, these are going to show.  I don&#x27;t have the right hairstyle.  I could wear them...but not out of the house.  One step out of the house with any breeze whatsoever, and these things were fully exposed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.  It is difficult to use and doesn&#x27;t work.  Save up and get the real thing.</li>
            <li> These apparently are knock offs and do not work.  I hope I can get a credit on all of them, even though one package is open, but&lt;br /&gt;unuseable.  Four packs inall.  a real waste of time and money.  I have ordered them in the past and they were good and made of a&lt;br /&gt;different material.  Julie Coulombe  916 483 8808</li>
            <li> When I want to feel fresh and awake I will wear these. a temp.fix for days when Im tired or lack of sleep</li>
            <li> I just could not get this to work , wish I could . So unless you can get some one to help you it&#x27;s kinda stickie , not for me thanks anyway</li>
            <li> This product proves miracle fixes don&#x27;t exist.  This product looks like you&#x27;ve scotch-taped your face, so accept your appearance or visist a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> No.  Could not get the neck to work properly - I went through a few of these babies trying to get it to work properly.  You might do better with duct tape.  The forehead one is not too bad - although I didn&#x27;t give it a go for that long.  Hard to get your eyebrows exactly even.</li>
            <li> Never worked..Just never sent them back</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the brow lifts (I don&#x27;t have bangs to cover them), but the neck lifts are great! They lift the jowls and loose neck skin I developed in my late 50&#x27;s. You have to be patient and careful. And you must have hair at least 1 inch longer than your earlobes. And no tucking your hair behind your ears, or the shine from the tape will show. Wash the area well with soap and water and dry thoroughly. Wipe the area with alcohol and let dry. Then remove the short end of the paper backing, and carefully stick in place under/slightly in front of earlobe. Pretend it&#x27;s a bandaid, and sloooowly pull back creating tension, while pulling off the long part of the paper backing, and pulling steadily up and back, stick to the skin between the back of your ear and the hairline. It may take a few times to get the gist of it, but now I can do it in seconds. And Skin-So-Soft oil will take of any residue, at night. You just have to wash all the oil off well before using another set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just can&#x27;t believe all the bad reviews! It WOULD really be nice if the tape did not have to be hidden by hair, but I just keep my hair long. I do not buy mine from Amazon, but go directly to their website and get a discount for a monthly purchase. Sometimes I&#x27;m glad a lot of people have not discovered these, or made them work. That way I look younger than the other 60+ year-olds!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product.  The smaller tapes work best for me.  I have trouble with the larger tapes but it&#x27;s a matter of experimenting a little bit with these.  I&#x27;ll get better at it.  It is extremely important, I find, to apply alcohol to the area where you plan to place the tapes.  It dries the skin adequately so that the tapes stay on longer.</li>
            <li> JUST DIDN&#x27;T WORK DIDN&#x27;T STICK AND HAVE USE PRODUCTS SIMILAR TO THIS</li>
            <li> I am an actress in NYC and use these for auditions since I&#x27;ve gained weight. They told extra skin in place perfectly. Cover them with hair and noone knows the clear tape is there. You do not feel it. Even Cher wears this stuff. They cause her with the wind blowing her hair back and them showing. They take the place of a face lift of weight loss and really work.</li>
            <li> The tapes are awful. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you use alcohol prep beforehand or not, the tapes fall off within an hour or 2. Even if they would stay fixed, the tapes are so SHINY and the reflection is so obvious, it&#x27;s impossible to conceal them. My daughters and I did have a good laugh when I tried them out to wear for my youngest daughter&#x27;s wedding. When pictures were being taken of me helping my daughter get ready for her wedding, the light reflecting off the tapes from the camera flash were hilarious.What was the manufacturer of this trash thinking? I mean really, they didn&#x27;t think to make them in a matte finish? DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS AWFUL PRODUCT. Unless of course, you want a good laugh.</li>
            <li> hated it not enough stick.</li>
            <li> As promised!  The product is a little difficult to use but once you get it, it works well.  Thank you</li>
            <li> When you need a little lift these do the job and were easy to apply.  I did not use the eye-lift piece and cannot testify to how they work but the other piece, for chin and neck, worked beautifully - and lasted for any entire day!  A good purchase.</li>
            <li> Harder to use than advertised.  I will keep trying and hopefully will get the hang of it.  Hard to peel off backing.</li>
            <li> These were a waste of money I could have saved towards a face lift.  I are cumbersome to out on.  After the thrid try I was tempted to ask for help, however that defeats the purpose.  They will not stick!  The instructions recommend using rubbing alcohol, did that still fell off in a matter of minutes.</li>
