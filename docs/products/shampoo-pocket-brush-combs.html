            <li>I bought these for my 7 year old who wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job at cleaning his scalp in the shower.</li>
            <li>You should get the bundle of four its a the better deal.</li>
            <li>Will buy more after I wear them out.</li>
            <li>and it does a better job than using fingertips alone.</li>
            <li>Love these palm brushes...especially in a four set because theyre inexpensive</li>
            <li>They are still usable, and if they were what I had ordered I would have given more stars.</li>
            <li>The ones I received are more like the photo of the hand using the brush.</li>
            <li>I used this style of pocket brush years ago and hadn&#x27;t been able to find a replacement.</li>
            <li>So I am glad I was able to purchase them online</li>
            <li>These are perfect for &#x27;slicking&#x27; my hair back to put into a ponytail.  </li>
            <li>And these were the same ones I use to get .very happy with this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>simple product that fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li>Fitting is for all fingers not just one.</li>
            <li>My husband was so excited I got these for him!</li>
            <li>Worth the price for sure!</li>

            <li>These are handy compact and fit in the pocket easily and they do the work of a hair brush to a certain degree</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted, fast delivery, great product - works very well and lives up to expectations - very happy with the entire experience</li>
            <li>And if you have facial hair works great for that also.</li>
            <li>They were a cheap knockoff of the original but for the price, I will give them a try.</li>
            <li>Allows me to keep their coat clean and excess hair removed</li>
            <li>It takes the place of a full sized brush.  </li>
            <li>exactly as advertised and for me a perfect hair grooming tool which I suspect will last far longer than I will have hair.</li>
            <li>He wears his hair short and these are perfect for his short hair!</li>
            <li>Kind of sharp if you ask me and could be more smoother on the tips which seem to dig</li>
            <li>Works good for long hair cats.</li>
            <li>I choose to rate this because this Shampoo Pocket Brush it actually handy, I remember back dayz in the 80&#x27;s my father and I would go to the barbershop on the weekends.</li>
            <li>As soon he gets his fresh cut, they would have pocket brush their.</li>
            <li>Friends make fun of it, but then borrow it when their hair gets messed up.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair all nice and neatly combed back.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective for shorter hair.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for these for several years as they are great for relatively short hair.  </li>
            <li>But since the product received didn&#x27;t match the product pictured, I cannot bring myself to rate this any higher.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Glad I found an alternate source.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that I would not be able to find a replacement after looking in local stores.  </li>
            <li>I use gel sometimes and this is perfect for the slick back look.</li>
            <li>Love to keep these on hand for brushing pets and when hair is short and growing out.</li>
            <li>I wanted the single finger comb as pictured but received the thicker multi-fingered comb instead ( which was also experienced by an earlier reviewer)  </li>
            <li>Thanks again for the right stuff and fast shipment</li>
            <li>seriously doubt this is the same product many reviewers bought and gave good review.</li>
            <li>He loves combing his hair on his own these days after buying these little combs.</li>
            <li>The bristles are kinda hard but good product.</li>
            <li>I currently have one such pocket comb bought few years ago and decided to buy this as there were many good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They hold up very well being in cargo pant pocket all day.  </li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>really seems to like it.  </li>
            <li>great concept but poor product.</li>
            <li>it is harder to find these in stores now a days.. :)</li>
            <li>Used to be that you would see these on a display at the barber shop; not so much anymore.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly in my back pocket</li>
            <li>Whether you&#x27;re in public, special occasion or events, etc.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t break but it is easy to loose them</li>
            <li>It may be old school, but I keep one in my back pocket, and therefore it&#x27;s always available.  </li>
            <li>Decent pack of combs for the price.  </li>
            <li>Thank You for following thru in what was I expecting although the Amazon web site shows two different types I Generally feel we as buyers are looking for the picture of four instead of the one that fits the whole hand since its its more convenient and smaller to carry in our pockets.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair short so was happy to locate it in your isting as they are difficult to find.</li>
            <li>, naturally all depends on your hair.</li>
            <li>They are a whole hand type and the bristles are smaller than that of the pocket brushes I am used to.</li>
            <li>I was able to ream the finger hole with a sharp pin knife and file the sharp edge.</li>
            <li>Just take it easy, teeth are somewhat hard and could scratch skin if not careful.</li>
            <li>These pocket brushes come in two styles, (1) the thinner profile brush with single finger loop pictured, and (2) the thicker profile brush with full width (multi finger) loop shown on some other models on the Amazon website.</li>
            <li>This is an old school comb, works like a charm for short hair.</li>
            <li>but the single finger loop is bit small (specially if your ring size &amp;#62;10.5)</li>

            <li> but the single finger loop is bit small (specially if your ring size &amp;#62;10.5)</li>
            <li> They remind me of my highschool days when I used to slick my hair back but now as an older guy in the year 2000&#x27;s...</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long.</li>
            <li> These combs are no longer sold in stores; even though, I have been using these for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The one with the one center middle finger insert are harder to locate  </li>
            <li> which is why I wanted the thinner single fingered comb.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend for long, thin hair as they don&#x27;t clear tangles that well unless they are pressing against the scalp and they don&#x27;t last as long clearing tangles in long hair.</li>
            <li> have short hair and a beard and these little jewels</li>
            <li> Otherwise, not much else to say.  </li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected.</li>
            <li> However, the new ones seem to be of less quality and the little handles tear with very little use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Going through other reviews, I think the product and the picture has been changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work but the ends are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Too small to actually use.</li>
            <li> these are smaller and the finger hole is small and sharp around the edges.</li>
            <li> The brush is a little rough, but it massages the scalp well.</li>
            <li> comb is much smaller than regular size, hole to hold is too small, sharp points, extremely low quality useless product.</li>
            <li> but it is too thick to put in a back pocket</li>
            <li> Points are a bit sharp, though, so you don&#x27;t want to press down too hard on your scalp (or face for beard use).  </li>
            <li> : points are a little sharp, can be scratchy if you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small (even for my small fingers) &amp; the teeth are sharp.</li>
            <li> the bristles are hard and sharp</li>
            <li> They were not what I was expecting as the usual combs.</li>
            <li> With this I don&#x27;t have to pack a bulky brush, just this small item that hides away.  </li>
            <li> Purchased for nostalgic reason remembering when as a child at local barbershop combs always hanging at barbershop windows for sale</li>
            <li> My problem with this product is it is hard plastic that just scratches my scalp instead of brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> , I have thick hair</li>
            <li> This is an low quality badly designed product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using these for years, but they&#x27;ve become difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> These are handy compact and fit in the pocket easily and they do the work of a hair brush to a certain degree but their compactness makes them easy and effective, naturally all depends on your hair.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small (even for my small fingers) &amp; the teeth are sharp. however they do the job.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. He loves combing his hair on his own these days after buying these little combs.</li>
            <li> This is an old school comb, works like a charm for short hair. And if you have facial hair works great for that also.</li>

Just a piece of junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously doubt this is the same product many reviewers bought and gave good review. I would request Amazon to review this.</li>
            <li> These are great, they came well shipped and on time. They do there job, I have thick hair and they work like a charm. I would totally recommend this product. You should get the bundle of four its a the better deal.</li>
            <li> Pros: good quality. durable plastic. works well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: points are a little sharp, can be scratchy if you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> The bristles are so short they do not reach the scalp. go to you local pharmacy and buy one there! GARBAGE!!</li>
            <li> I use them instead of a comb.  They hold up very well being in cargo pant pocket all day.  Will buy more after I wear them out.</li>
            <li> I choose to rate this because this Shampoo Pocket Brush it actually handy, I remember back dayz in the 80&#x27;s my father and I would go to the barbershop on the weekends. As soon he gets his fresh cut, they would have pocket brush their. I know is a shampoo brush, but I guess my father and I make it handy as pocket brush instead. Is very handy when you are on the go... Whether you&#x27;re in public, special occasion or events, etc. Try it you never regret it!</li>
            <li> I had one of these that lasted about 10+ years. However, the new ones seem to be of less quality and the little handles tear with very little use.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 7 year old who wasn&#x27;t doing a very good job at cleaning his scalp in the shower. Since I got these, there have been no sweaty scalp issues when he showers. I actually started using one and it does a better job than using fingertips alone. You get 4 for the price &amp; I believe it&#x27;s a fair deal at $5 (shipping included).</li>
            <li> Love these palm brushes...especially in a four set because theyre inexpensive and I have one in my van,second vehicle, work truck and restroom. They remind me of my highschool days when I used to slick my hair back but now as an older guy in the year 2000&#x27;s... I got the George Clooney look hairstyle combed forward which still is great using my palmbrush!!</li>
            <li> got these for my husband he loves them.</li>
            <li> the bristles are hard and sharp</li>
            <li> I wear my hair short so was happy to locate it in your isting as they are difficult to find.</li>
            <li> They were not what I was expecting as the usual combs. They work but the ends are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Just like i remembered them</li>
            <li> VERY HANDY POCKET COMBS</li>
            <li> I really like these. The brush is a little rough, but it massages the scalp well. It fits in the back pocket.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t break but it is easy to loose them</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted, fast delivery, great product - works very well and lives up to expectations - very happy with the entire experience</li>
            <li> These pocket brushes come in two styles, (1) the thinner profile brush with single finger loop pictured, and (2) the thicker profile brush with full width (multi finger) loop shown on some other models on the Amazon website. I ordered these specifically because I was after the brush pictured, which I&#x27;ve been using for maybe 40 years and no longer have a local source for. The ones that arrived with the order are the the multi-finger loop type, which I could just as well buy at my local Walgreens.  They are still usable, and if they were what I had ordered I would have given more stars. But since the product received didn&#x27;t match the product pictured, I cannot bring myself to rate this any higher.</li>
            <li> It seems to help this one neighborhood cat who seemed to want to have himself petted and groomed with my finger nails.  Opted to get this and have been using...really seems to like it.  Just take it easy, teeth are somewhat hard and could scratch skin if not careful.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever...can fit in a pocket or anywhere.  would recommend to anyone with short curly hair. will order again.</li>
            <li> Works good for long hair cats. Allows me to keep their coat clean and excess hair removed</li>
            <li> Too small to actually use. thought by the picture they were like the ones I&#x27;ve bought at my local barber .... NOT!</li>
            <li> It may be old school, but I keep one in my back pocket, and therefore it&#x27;s always available.  Friends make fun of it, but then borrow it when their hair gets messed up.</li>
            <li> Have used this style of brush on my short, somewhat wiry, hair for decades. Nothing works better for it and their compactness is very handy. These brushes tend to eventually split and break but they are inexpensive so still great value. Don&#x27;t recommend for long, thin hair as they don&#x27;t clear tangles that well unless they are pressing against the scalp and they don&#x27;t last as long clearing tangles in long hair.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be the ones in the photo I received a different type didn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised and for me a perfect hair grooming tool which I suspect will last far longer than I will have hair.</li>
            <li> My husband was so excited I got these for him! He wears his hair short and these are perfect for his short hair! They arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Thanks!</li>
            <li> As advertised. Prompt delivery.  Fair pricing.  The finger hole could be larger.</li>
            <li> These are very useful and make wonderful tuck in gifts.  I use mine a lot and grieve when I lose one.</li>
            <li> There are two pictures in this listing, showing different product designs. The ones I received are more like the photo of the hand using the brush. My problem with this product is it is hard plastic that just scratches my scalp instead of brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> Great deal &amp; shipped extremely fast!</li>
            <li> dad loves these and only could find them on amazon</li>
            <li> Decent pack of combs for the price.  Points are a bit sharp, though, so you don&#x27;t want to press down too hard on your scalp (or face for beard use).  Otherwise, not much else to say.  Worth the price for sure!</li>
            <li> Others we have found were not as big as these nor were they of the same quality.  Product as described.</li>
            <li> Kind of sharp if you ask me and could be more smoother on the tips which seem to dig in.&lt;br /&gt;Gonna look in my local Walgreens to see what they may have.&lt;br /&gt;Good for pets I would think!</li>
            <li> I like the product BUT....!  You don&#x27;t get four from this company/person!  They/he will only send you ONE (1), not  the four advertised in the picture.</li>
            <li> Perfect to fit in my ditty bag for travelling.  It takes the place of a full sized brush.  With this I don&#x27;t have to pack a bulky brush, just this small item that hides away.  It takes virtually no space.</li>
            <li> I used this style of pocket brush years ago and hadn&#x27;t been able to find a replacement. when I saw these I figured they&#x27;d be the same. they aren&#x27;t. these are smaller and the finger hole is small and sharp around the edges. I was able to ream the finger hole with a sharp pin knife and file the sharp edge. but I don&#x27;t expect them to last very long. great concept but poor product.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for me, because I prefer using these comb brushes to fix my hair with. So I am glad I was able to purchase them online it is harder to find these in stores now a days.. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years as a portable brush that you can stick in your pocket. Used to be that you would see these on a display at the barber shop; not so much anymore. Glad I found an alternate source.</li>
            <li> The item that you see in the photo is in fact, a Shampoo brand pocket brush - this is not what I received.  I have had the Shampoo so I know what it is like - it is made from a softer material than the brushes I was sent.  They were a cheap knockoff of the original but for the price, I will give them a try.</li>
            <li> These combs are no longer sold in stores; even though, I have been using these for a very long time. Needed to replace the ones that I have had for years. They are perfect replacements and I received them within a week of being ordered. Order these with trust.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Everything was as I had hoped. NO problems at all!</li>
            <li> Have them in my travel bag, car they work great!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for &#x27;slicking&#x27; my hair back to put into a ponytail.  It gets my hair all nice and neatly combed back.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen these since I was a kid I&#x27;ve always loved them ! And these were the same ones I use to get .very happy with this product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great value for great price</li>
            <li> very pleased with your product</li>
            <li> The bristles are kinda hard but good product.</li>
            <li> Received item promptly, but was not the items pictured. I received the style with the loop around the edge rather than the finger loop in the middle. The ones which have the loop around the edge seem to break easier.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I expected. From the picture it looks like these pocket combs are the one finger type but they are not. They are a whole hand type and the bristles are smaller than that of the pocket brushes I am used to.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t the ones I thought I ordered pictured in this review.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years, but they&#x27;ve become difficult to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair and a beard and these little jewels help me stave off bed-face every morning. Plus I keep a couple handy for grooming my dogs&#x27; beards after meals and playtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple product that fits my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> I wanted the single finger comb as pictured but received the thicker multi-fingered comb instead ( which was also experienced by an earlier reviewer)  I could used the multi-fingered comb but it is too thick to put in a back pocket which is why I wanted the thinner single fingered comb.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured! Fitting is for all fingers not just one.</li>
            <li> Thank You for following thru in what was I expecting although the Amazon web site shows two different types I Generally feel we as buyers are looking for the picture of four instead of the one that fits the whole hand since its its more convenient and smaller to carry in our pockets. The one with the one center middle finger insert are harder to locate  thats why I came to you guys. Thanks again for the right stuff and fast shipment</li>
            <li> My barber gave me one years ago and it finally wore out.  I was concerned that I would not be able to find a replacement after looking in local stores.  I&#x27;m glad I found it here!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and this pushes it where I want. I use gel sometimes and this is perfect for the slick back look.</li>
            <li> Good pocket brush. its acceptable price. but the single finger loop is bit small (specially if your ring size &amp;#62;10.5)</li>
            <li> easy  to  travel with,  effective with or without shampoo,  well  priced  in  a  4 pack(  the plastic  rips  easily  so  4  pack ideal)</li>
            <li> Purchased for nostalgic reason remembering when as a child at local barbershop combs always hanging at barbershop windows for sale</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for several years as they are great for relatively short hair.  They fit perfectly in my back pocket so I always have my comb with me.  The &amp;#34;strap&amp;#34; that fits over your finger is the &amp;#34;weak link&amp;#34; so having four will definitely be a plus.</li>
            <li> real handy to keep in your pocket or packed in an over night bag, made well and easey to use</li>
            <li> Simple and effective for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> Love to keep these on hand for brushing pets and when hair is short and growing out. Great item at a great price here at Amazon in Jan. 2015.</li>
