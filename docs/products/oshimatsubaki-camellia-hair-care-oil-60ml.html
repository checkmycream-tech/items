            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any scent on this, which is good.  </li>

            <li>Hair is wonderful: easy to comb, flows freely in the wind, and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li>It greatly fends off free radicals and keeps scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li>detangling was amazing</li>
            <li>I decided to try this camellia oil since I had read such great things about it, and am so happy I did!  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say that it is now growing in after about a month of nightly use.</li>
            <li>Camellia oil is very popular in japan, thanks to it&#x27;s nourishing properties and great quality.  </li>
            <li>I put a couple drops on the end of my hair after a shower which makes my drier ends feel healthy and moisturized and gives a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>Have used on my skin and face does not cause breakouts absorbs easily!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly what it said it was - the best award winning camellia oil you can get.</li>
            <li>It is very light.</li>
            <li>This specific product is 100% pure japan camellia oil, which is great because the best camellia oil is the one from the seeds of camellia flowers in japan , not the camellia from china.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I think it is the best facial oil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to</li>
            <li>Just use it as I said above, and you&#x27;ll see the amazing results!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started using Aubrey Organics \\&quot;White Camellia Oil shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; and they are great too!</li>

            <li>I love this oil--</li>
            <li>I spend most of my time in the ocean.  </li>
            <li>I have mostly 3b hair w/3c</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the one he reaches for most often.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>One of the better camellia oils.</li>
            <li>Made my hair healthy and shiny</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I used to Google and YouTube this oil, but found that not too many curlies were using this -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>it moisturizes the dermal layers on more than just the top level.  </li>
            <li>i will be keeping it, i LOVE the bottle</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I use it in all of my hair products and my hair is fabulously moisturized and conditioned!</li>
            <li>and I think I will order the camellia oil in water to carry in my purse with me throughout the day to use whenever I think my hair needs a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about five weeks now, and love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love them both.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I needed something to make my hair sleek and shiny, give it more nutrients and help with dandruff.</li>
            <li>it was just okay.</li>
            <li>This oil is amazing and quickly went to the top in my pick of oils.</li>
            <li>For dry hair and scalp this is the best and SAFEST medicine you can buy with money.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get more unadulterated or purer than this.</li>
            <li>It does not give you that slip in wet hair when blow drying but results are great!</li>
            <li>not greasy, easily absorbs.</li>
            <li>It gets frizzy really easily</li>
            <li>The smell isnt too strong and it will help the hair after a while of use.</li>
            <li>I also mix some with a couple drops of tea tree oil in a fine mist mini spray bottle and apply to my scalp as needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my hair before, so this was fun and interesting to try out.</li>
            <li>It locks in the moisture in my hair and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my scalp itch free and moisturized which can promote hair growth.</li>
            <li>Also camellia oil is a great facial moisturizer too (if you have oily skin  like I do use sparingly)---Great</li>
            <li>, Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before)</li>
            <li>;)Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to</li>
            <li>, Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before)</li>
            <li>this Hair Oil has no smell at all, and for me (very fine straight hair)</li>
            <li>and I must say that it works great on dry hair.</li>
            <li>This product is odorless, and a tip I would like to share is to mix it with your favorite essential oil, like lavender or rose,(just a few drops) to have a great smelling hair oil completely natural and safe!!!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for some great natural moisture that is light, easily absorbed and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>My full review is on the Mei brand a competitor</li>
            <li>I got this oil because I had read that this type of oil was good for aiding in hair growth and I am not only trying to grow out the hair on my head, but my eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no bad reaction to this oil whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>My husband has mild rosacea  </li>
            <li>I have 2b/2c wavy hair and am so happy that this product does not weigh it down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>knew that this was fragrance-free and usually buy products with light fragrances since I&#x27;m a smell junkie, but I&#x27;m still super pleased with this formulation of camellia oil, and the lack of fragrance means that it plays nicely with perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice gloss to my dry ends that catches the light.</li>
            <li>This is not 100% pure as it contains some sort of light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>have some head skin problems like flakes, so this oil make your skin more soft and shining</li>
            <li>It works well for me and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is worth a try.    </li>
            <li>my product absorbed faster or appeared to&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>it all absorbed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth getting a bottle if you&#x27;re on the fence about it.</li>
            <li>Mixed it with coconut oil nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other oils, this one really is so nice and light -- and yet using it leaves my hair</li>
            <li>Thanks to the high oleic acid in this oil, (most compatible w/human skin)</li>
            <li>My heart goes out for the people in Japan right now.</li>
            <li>I know some people just cannot deal with oil on their face, but for my skin type (which is rather oily but only breaks out if I don&#x27;t give it enough moisture) it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>Like the oil very much it leaves my hair with lots of shine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s light and works better for my hair than any other oil besides argan (sometimes I mix those two together).  </li>
            <li>We have tried many products that were too oily or not enough.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of this oil, which has lasted about two years.  </li>
            <li>The bottle will last many months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this oil and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li>I know a higher brand name selling tsubaki oil (camillia seed oil)</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>At first you may not think it&#x27;s working, but once the oil penetrates into your hair you&#x27;ll realize the difference.</li>
            <li>The results has been amazing and I Highly recommend this product if you have dry hair.  </li>
            <li>but it really is just an all around pretty bottle.</li>
            <li>A very light oil that makes your hair soft and easy to comb through, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>no more split end and make my hair more smoothly.</li>
            <li>It certainly makes my hair look healthier and keeps the frizz smoothed out.</li>
            <li>after using a couple, like coconut, macadamia I really liked them, but wanted something lighter and less greasy that would give me high shine and moisture, until I found this!</li>
            <li>I found a 100% pure bottle of Camellia oil much much cheaper</li>
            <li>This oil is very efficient and works for my straight and fine hair as well as my BF&#x27;s coarse wurly hair.</li>
            <li>use enough if not to oily hair can be a problem, but is order free and dosen&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>and i ended up using too much to the point where people asked me if i had just taken a shower.     </li>
            <li>although I don&#x27;t really make it a habit to use on my face.</li>
            <li>But once in a while, when I am feeling really dehydrated, I&#x27;ll rub from head to toe</li>
            <li>Love it but be careful not to over-use (will lead to oily hair).</li>
            <li>If I put too much, I find that it makes my hair greasy looking (</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this multi-purpose oil!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product because it is multipurpose.</li>
            <li>This reseller has been kind enough to offer a couple of instructions in English on how you can use the Camellia Oil.</li>
            <li>All of these ways work wonders for dry hair, just dont mix oil with high heat, and your hair will be safe.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a tsubaki oil product for my face and also heard that it was good for hair, The price on Amazon is reasonable compared to similar products at Sephora and other high-end stores</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the results when my hair dried (left it on for 30 min and washed normally with shampoo/conditioner)</li>
            <li>Prior to using this product I could barely run a comb, brush, nor my fingers through even after showering with top rated conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>If other oils (coconut, olive, sweet almond, etc.) haven&#x27;t done the job for you, camellia oil might be just right.</li>
            <li>I mix this with a styling cream and blow dry my hair out and this leaves it shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I mainly like to use it for the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>A friend gave this to me and I have been using it for a couple months now, and it&#x27;s my main go-to now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Oshima brand is pure and natural.  </li>
            <li>Ive heard really convincing things about this type of oil and have purchased a few brands but none stack up to this one.</li>
            <li>The bottle size is generous and oil comes in heavy glass bottle which I love.</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a lovely, healthy glow without feeling greasy (even though I have oily skin), and I&#x27;ve noticed that small blemishes seem to shrink and fade a little quicker for me without being emphasized by flakiness</li>
            <li>This product is lightweight you may have to reapply before you go to bed to avoid super dry hair.  </li>
            <li>but it did soak in eventually, but this oil seems like it would be better for someone with thick or very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li>Also, you can add this oil to your shampoos, conditioners,deep conditioners &amp; as a hot oil treatment or as your daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i used WAY to much the first time, which caused my hair to look a bit still wet.</li>
            <li>This is the only camellia oil that seems to be pure.</li>
            <li>it is also fragrance free, which was disappointing for me because i love the smell of camellia.</li>
            <li>And I started trying natural oils to see if they made what I was looking for..</li>
            <li>I use this on my hair after a shower, and when it dries, it leaves my hair soft without looking greasy or stringy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair extremely soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li>It just makes my hair look and feel soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>People sensitive to fragrance will also appreciate that this has no smell.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how really soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>like to use it since I use complicated hairstyle and feels so good, and hair stays put,&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>As a facial oil, I&#x27;ve noticed the fine lines becoming less and less obvious on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have had some compliments on my hair and it does feel less dry on the top and the ends.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t know how much to apply and would apply too much only to find that less is best,except when applying the oil after shampooing when your hair is proned to soak up all the moisture it can get and even too much is not enough.</li>
            <li>However, once your hair is dry and all the natural oils mix with the camellia oil, you&#x27;ll realize you have put too much.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my lashes with a Qtip and my lashes are longer, but not extremely.</li>
            <li>Way worth the money compared to other salon products I formerly purchased.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for others who have long hair.</li>
            <li>Or when I wont use any heat on my hair, and wear my hair naturally, I will wash my hair, and after the shower put some drops of camellia oil on my damp hair, and let it air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tired of using harmful corporate products on my hair that most of the time don&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!  </li>
            <li>I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially for colder weather, it is not to heavy and light enough not to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair and just work 2-3 drops into my ends and lightly pass my hands over the rest of my hair afterwards...</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, no noticeable scent, only need a little.</li>

            <li> but it still seems like an good oil, just not for my hair type...</li>
            <li> Fragrance free and the best part of this oil?</li>
            <li> The oil smells really good</li>
            <li> smells good, feels good, I advise everyone to try it.</li>
            <li> This is a good oil</li>
            <li> It was a really good choice to switch to use this camellia hair care oil.</li>
            <li> Very interesting.</li>
            <li> I need more !</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product would recommended it to anyone that has frizzy hair and price is reasonable too !!</li>
            <li> Hair is wonderful: easy to comb, flows freely in the wind, and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li> It greatly fends off free radicals and keeps scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> detangling was amazing</li>
            <li> I decided to try this camellia oil since I had read such great things about it, and am so happy I did!  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say that it is now growing in after about a month of nightly use.</li>
            <li> Camellia oil is very popular in japan, thanks to it&#x27;s nourishing properties and great quality.  </li>
            <li> I put a couple drops on the end of my hair after a shower which makes my drier ends feel healthy and moisturized and gives a nice shine.  </li>
            <li> Have used on my skin and face does not cause breakouts absorbs easily!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what it said it was - the best award winning camellia oil you can get.</li>
            <li> It is very light.</li>
            <li> This specific product is 100% pure japan camellia oil, which is great because the best camellia oil is the one from the seeds of camellia flowers in japan , not the camellia from china.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I think it is the best facial oil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to</li>
            <li> Just use it as I said above, and you&#x27;ll see the amazing results!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using Aubrey Organics \\&quot;White Camellia Oil shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; and they are great too!</li>
            <li> Just use it as I said above, and you&#x27;ll see the amazing results!!!   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using Aubrey Organics \\&quot;White Camellia Oil shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; and they are great too!</li>
            <li> I love this oil--</li>
            <li> I spend most of my time in the ocean.  </li>
            <li> I have mostly 3b hair w/3c</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the one he reaches for most often.</li>
            <li> Its ok</li>
            <li> One of the better camellia oils.</li>
            <li> Made my hair healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I used to Google and YouTube this oil, but found that not too many curlies were using this -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes the dermal layers on more than just the top level.  </li>
            <li> i will be keeping it, i LOVE the bottle</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I use it in all of my hair products and my hair is fabulously moisturized and conditioned!</li>
            <li> and I think I will order the camellia oil in water to carry in my purse with me throughout the day to use whenever I think my hair needs a bit more moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about five weeks now, and love it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love them both.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I needed something to make my hair sleek and shiny, give it more nutrients and help with dandruff.</li>
            <li> it was just okay.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing and quickly went to the top in my pick of oils.</li>
            <li> For dry hair and scalp this is the best and SAFEST medicine you can buy with money.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get more unadulterated or purer than this.</li>
            <li> It does not give you that slip in wet hair when blow drying but results are great!</li>
            <li> not greasy, easily absorbs.</li>
            <li> It gets frizzy really easily</li>
            <li> The smell isnt too strong and it will help the hair after a while of use.</li>
            <li> I also mix some with a couple drops of tea tree oil in a fine mist mini spray bottle and apply to my scalp as needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my hair before, so this was fun and interesting to try out.</li>
            <li> It locks in the moisture in my hair and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my scalp itch free and moisturized which can promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> Also camellia oil is a great facial moisturizer too (if you have oily skin  like I do use sparingly)---Great</li>
            <li> , Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before)</li>
            <li> ;)Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to</li>
            <li> , Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before)</li>
            <li> this Hair Oil has no smell at all, and for me (very fine straight hair)</li>
            <li> and I must say that it works great on dry hair.</li>
            <li> This product is odorless, and a tip I would like to share is to mix it with your favorite essential oil, like lavender or rose,(just a few drops) to have a great smelling hair oil completely natural and safe!!!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for some great natural moisture that is light, easily absorbed and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> My full review is on the Mei brand a competitor</li>
            <li> I got this oil because I had read that this type of oil was good for aiding in hair growth and I am not only trying to grow out the hair on my head, but my eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no bad reaction to this oil whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> My husband has mild rosacea  </li>
            <li> I have 2b/2c wavy hair and am so happy that this product does not weigh it down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> knew that this was fragrance-free and usually buy products with light fragrances since I&#x27;m a smell junkie, but I&#x27;m still super pleased with this formulation of camellia oil, and the lack of fragrance means that it plays nicely with perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice gloss to my dry ends that catches the light.</li>
            <li> This is not 100% pure as it contains some sort of light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> have some head skin problems like flakes, so this oil make your skin more soft and shining</li>
            <li> It works well for me and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is worth a try.    </li>
            <li> my product absorbed faster or appeared to&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> it all absorbed.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth getting a bottle if you&#x27;re on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with coconut oil nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other oils, this one really is so nice and light -- and yet using it leaves my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks to the high oleic acid in this oil, (most compatible w/human skin)</li>
            <li> My heart goes out for the people in Japan right now.</li>
            <li> I know some people just cannot deal with oil on their face, but for my skin type (which is rather oily but only breaks out if I don&#x27;t give it enough moisture) it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> Like the oil very much it leaves my hair with lots of shine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s light and works better for my hair than any other oil besides argan (sometimes I mix those two together).  </li>
            <li> We have tried many products that were too oily or not enough.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of this oil, which has lasted about two years.  </li>
            <li> The bottle will last many months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this oil and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I know a higher brand name selling tsubaki oil (camillia seed oil)</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> At first you may not think it&#x27;s working, but once the oil penetrates into your hair you&#x27;ll realize the difference.</li>
            <li> The results has been amazing and I Highly recommend this product if you have dry hair.  </li>
            <li> but it really is just an all around pretty bottle.</li>
            <li> A very light oil that makes your hair soft and easy to comb through, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> no more split end and make my hair more smoothly.</li>
            <li> It certainly makes my hair look healthier and keeps the frizz smoothed out.</li>
            <li> after using a couple, like coconut, macadamia I really liked them, but wanted something lighter and less greasy that would give me high shine and moisture, until I found this!</li>
            <li> I found a 100% pure bottle of Camellia oil much much cheaper</li>
            <li> This oil is very efficient and works for my straight and fine hair as well as my BF&#x27;s coarse wurly hair.</li>
            <li> use enough if not to oily hair can be a problem, but is order free and dosen&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> and i ended up using too much to the point where people asked me if i had just taken a shower.     </li>
            <li> although I don&#x27;t really make it a habit to use on my face.</li>
            <li> But once in a while, when I am feeling really dehydrated, I&#x27;ll rub from head to toe</li>
            <li> Love it but be careful not to over-use (will lead to oily hair).</li>
            <li> If I put too much, I find that it makes my hair greasy looking (</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this multi-purpose oil!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it is multipurpose.</li>
            <li> This reseller has been kind enough to offer a couple of instructions in English on how you can use the Camellia Oil.</li>
            <li> All of these ways work wonders for dry hair, just dont mix oil with high heat, and your hair will be safe.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a tsubaki oil product for my face and also heard that it was good for hair, The price on Amazon is reasonable compared to similar products at Sephora and other high-end stores</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the results when my hair dried (left it on for 30 min and washed normally with shampoo/conditioner)</li>
            <li> Prior to using this product I could barely run a comb, brush, nor my fingers through even after showering with top rated conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> If other oils (coconut, olive, sweet almond, etc.) haven&#x27;t done the job for you, camellia oil might be just right.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a styling cream and blow dry my hair out and this leaves it shinny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I mainly like to use it for the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> A friend gave this to me and I have been using it for a couple months now, and it&#x27;s my main go-to now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Oshima brand is pure and natural.  </li>
            <li> Ive heard really convincing things about this type of oil and have purchased a few brands but none stack up to this one.</li>
            <li> The bottle size is generous and oil comes in heavy glass bottle which I love.</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a lovely, healthy glow without feeling greasy (even though I have oily skin), and I&#x27;ve noticed that small blemishes seem to shrink and fade a little quicker for me without being emphasized by flakiness</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight you may have to reapply before you go to bed to avoid super dry hair.  </li>
            <li> but it did soak in eventually, but this oil seems like it would be better for someone with thick or very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> Also, you can add this oil to your shampoos, conditioners,deep conditioners &amp; as a hot oil treatment or as your daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i used WAY to much the first time, which caused my hair to look a bit still wet.</li>
            <li> This is the only camellia oil that seems to be pure.</li>
            <li> it is also fragrance free, which was disappointing for me because i love the smell of camellia.</li>
            <li> And I started trying natural oils to see if they made what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair after a shower, and when it dries, it leaves my hair soft without looking greasy or stringy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair extremely soft and silky feeling.</li>
            <li> It just makes my hair look and feel soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> People sensitive to fragrance will also appreciate that this has no smell.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how really soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> like to use it since I use complicated hairstyle and feels so good, and hair stays put,&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> As a facial oil, I&#x27;ve noticed the fine lines becoming less and less obvious on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have had some compliments on my hair and it does feel less dry on the top and the ends.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t know how much to apply and would apply too much only to find that less is best,except when applying the oil after shampooing when your hair is proned to soak up all the moisture it can get and even too much is not enough.</li>
            <li> However, once your hair is dry and all the natural oils mix with the camellia oil, you&#x27;ll realize you have put too much.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my lashes with a Qtip and my lashes are longer, but not extremely.</li>
            <li> Way worth the money compared to other salon products I formerly purchased.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for others who have long hair.</li>
            <li> Or when I wont use any heat on my hair, and wear my hair naturally, I will wash my hair, and after the shower put some drops of camellia oil on my damp hair, and let it air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tired of using harmful corporate products on my hair that most of the time don&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!  </li>
            <li> I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially for colder weather, it is not to heavy and light enough not to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and just work 2-3 drops into my ends and lightly pass my hands over the rest of my hair afterwards...</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, no noticeable scent, only need a little.</li>
            <li> This one was most moisturizing at night and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, but it&#x27;s on the thick and heavy side.</li>
            <li> but  I always had to reapply often since my hair sucked them up in a minute, and then after a day or two I had a really greasy mess!  </li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m using it as a natural product to keep my hair dark..</li>
            <li> so soft and helps cut down on frizz.  </li>
            <li> if you blow dry with oil use low heat, if you flat iron your hair, use the oil after not before)  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be trying it on dry hair next.</li>
            <li> It comes in a convenient bottle that is difficult to spill the oil from (good for clumsy people like me.)</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, absorbs well, don&#x27;t need a lot to get a smooth effect out of skin, and does not leave an oily smell behind like other oils like avocado oil - which didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have fine 2C waves, and have tried out a lot of hair oils and products in the past that have ended up being too heavy and that have weighed down my hair.  </li>
            <li> Days later I still have softness, sheen, shine, and hang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious as to how this would do with the maxiglide or caruso.</li>
            <li> Even for guys with dry hair, a few drops after shampooing makes hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The oil is what I would call a dry oil, I can slather it on at night and it leaves no residue on my sheets.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem has always been that my hair is dry, no matter all the treatments I made to it.  </li>
            <li> I also bought lots of \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; serums, like redken, and paul mitchell to relieve my dry hair and make it shinny</li>
            <li> I recommend someone with dry thirsty hair to try.</li>
            <li> I have dry course curly hair.</li>
            <li> my skin and allow it to dry a bit, and then follow it up w/lotion.  </li>
            <li> The dry patches I get during winter are gone after 1 use.  </li>
            <li> If the scalp gets too dry and starts itching just one application of a couple of drops stops that immediately.</li>
            <li> I used this product on dry and wet hair.</li>
            <li> -- it didn&#x27;t make my hair look like it was still greasy like some products have done in the past, it wasn&#x27;t frizzy but it also wasn&#x27;t weighed down at all, and it was SO SOFT!</li>
            <li> lots of hang and minimal shrinkage&lt;</li>
            <li> I use this oil as an overnight treatment, and also mix a few drops in with my daily leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I also use this to help soften rough and hardened cuticles (at bedtime) and it&#x27;s worked like a charm.  </li>
            <li> and it was still slightly wet looking</li>
            <li> I either apply it to my ends when my hair is wet from the shower or I apply it to the ends and over frizzy bits when my hair is</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> - I haven&#x27;t noticed this with any other oils.</li>
            <li> The other day I cowashed and decided to use this to seal</li>
            <li> Has no smell to clash with other hair/body fragrances.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The skin appears softer and brighter in the morning, and at times my dark spots or dark circles seem less noticeable</li>
            <li> I massage Tsubaki Camellia Oil into my scalp to help with dandruff, then brush it down to the ends of my hair, leave it in for an hour, and wash it out.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a thick glass bottle which is what I think all oils should be packed in to avoid plastic chemical contamination and leakage, not only is the bottle heavy duty</li>
            <li> but whenever i use this i have less greys..</li>
            <li> (i am asia, and my hair started to grey in my late 20s and being a health nut</li>
            <li> However, I need something a little heavier for my edges and nape.  </li>
            <li> Just a little does the trick.  </li>
            <li> If I put too little, I have a tendency to overdo it.  </li>
            <li> but 60ml is just too little for the price.</li>
            <li> After straightening my hair I take about 5 drops(you could use less if you have thin or short hair) and apply to my hair concentrating on the ends.</li>
            <li> I use this Oil after my hair is blow dried</li>
            <li> That green stuff stunk up my sheets, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy on my hair, but my mom, who has bleached hair, swears by it.</li>
            <li> have to admit I was a bit heavy handed.  </li>
            <li> it was to heavy.</li>

            <li> This product is perfect for people need oily hair&lt;br /&gt;I have some head skin problems like flakes, so this oil make your skin more soft and shining&lt;br /&gt;I like to use it since I use complicated hairstyle and feels so good, and hair stays put,&lt;br /&gt;Just use enough if not to oily hair can be a problem, but is order free and dosen&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;Make your head ichi or stinky like olive oil~ is great product thought I with came in more quantity! I need more !</li>
            <li> Ive heard really convincing things about this type of oil and have purchased a few brands but none stack up to this one. This is the only camellia oil that seems to be pure. The oil is what I would call a dry oil, I can slather it on at night and it leaves no residue on my sheets. It doesn&#x27;t have any sort of odor which is a big selling point to me. I gave it 5 stars because of its all around versatility, packaging and of course it&#x27;s price. I use it on may face without any worry of a breakout, I use it all over my body to moisturize and it is currently the only hair product that I use.It leaves a nice gloss to my dry ends that catches the light. Love it.  It also comes in a thick glass bottle which is what I think all oils should be packed in to avoid plastic chemical contamination and leakage, not only is the bottle heavy duty but it really is just an all around pretty bottle. As for the price? Around 20 bux is a great deal when you consider you can replace about 4 to 5 products with just this one. Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something for my daughter&#x27;s hair.  We have tried many products that were too oily or not enough.  This product is the one that we&#x27;ve been searching for.  It is never too oily.  I will be buying more soon!!</li>
            <li> USE SPARINGLY. i have very thick hair and i ended up using too much to the point where people asked me if i had just taken a shower.     it is also fragrance free, which was disappointing for me because i love the smell of camellia.</li>
            <li> This hair oil ensures that every day is a good hair day - no frizz allowed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my skin and hair and it works great.  This is not 100% pure as it contains some sort of light fragrance.  I found a 100% pure bottle of Camellia oil much much cheaper [...]</li>
            <li> This Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Hair Care Oil is great.  It gives shine to your hair, makes it look healthier and if you curl your hair, the curl  holds longer.  This is a good product to have!</li>
            <li> The product came on time. I think it is the best facial oil I have ever used.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> This Oshima Tsubaki camellia hair oil is fantastic!!!  I am in Love with it, I am a latina with 3a-3b hair, and have a lot of hair! My biggest problem has always been that my hair is dry, no matter all the treatments I made to it.  I also bought lots of \\&quot;high-end\\&quot; serums, like redken, and paul mitchell to relieve my dry hair and make it shinny but  I always had to reapply often since my hair sucked them up in a minute, and then after a day or two I had a really greasy mess!  No Way, no more serums I said! And I started trying natural oils to see if they made what I was looking for..after using a couple, like coconut, macadamia I really liked them, but wanted something lighter and less greasy that would give me high shine and moisture, until I found this! Camellia Oil!! Yes, Just what I was looking for!!!&lt;br /&gt; Camellia oil is very popular in japan, thanks to it&#x27;s nourishing properties and great quality.  This Oil is lighter than coconut and macadamia, but gives a lot more shine and softness without the greasiness you can get with these others!!  This specific product is 100% pure japan camellia oil, which is great because the best camellia oil is the one from the seeds of camellia flowers in japan , not the camellia from china.  This product is odorless, and a tip I would like to share is to mix it with your favorite essential oil, like lavender or rose,(just a few drops) to have a great smelling hair oil completely natural and safe!!!  I use this Oil after my hair is blow dried ( I don&#x27;t belive it should be used before, I&#x27;ve learned oil with heat means fried hair! so whatch out! if you blow dry with oil use low heat, if you flat iron your hair, use the oil after not before)  Or when I wont use any heat on my hair, and wear my hair naturally, I will wash my hair, and after the shower put some drops of camellia oil on my damp hair, and let it air dry naturally.  All of these ways work wonders for dry hair, just dont mix oil with high heat, and your hair will be safe.  Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to, Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before) I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!  Just use it as I said above, and you&#x27;ll see the amazing results!!!  p.s. I&#x27;ve also started using Aubrey Organics \\&quot;White Camellia Oil shampoo and conditioner\\&quot; and they are great too! ;)Also, my hair has grown longer since using this camellia oil, (because my ends dont split like they used to, they are coated and protected in  this healthy oil, and because of this, I can grow it longer without having to cut it every 3 months like I used to, Now I am 6 months till I have my first trim, and my ends are a lot more healty than before) I Highly recomend this Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Seed Oil,  for any women with dry coarse hair, that lacks moisture and shine!

            <li> I like this product. It works well for me and worth the money. I will recommend it to other people.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair after a shower, and when it dries, it leaves my hair soft without looking greasy or stringy. Very interesting. I also tried on my face, and it didn&#x27;t break me out- although I don&#x27;t really make it a habit to use on my face. But once in a while, when I am feeling really dehydrated, I&#x27;ll rub from head to toe and I haven&#x27;t had any problems. I like to carry this when I travel- sort of an all-in-one product. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue, absorbs well, don&#x27;t need a lot to get a smooth effect out of skin, and does not leave an oily smell behind like other oils like avocado oil - which didn&#x27;t moisturize my skin at all. That green stuff stunk up my sheets, too.</li>
            <li> This oil makes my hair soooo.......softand shiny! I recommend someone with dry thirsty hair to try. You will love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of this oil, which has lasted about two years.  I love this oil--it&#x27;s light and works better for my hair than any other oil besides argan (sometimes I mix those two together).  I find that I can use quite a bit of it without it making my hair feel overly greasy, and it has great shine and detangling properties.  If other oils (coconut, olive, sweet almond, etc.) haven&#x27;t done the job for you, camellia oil might be just right.</li>
            <li> Usage: 2 weeks during the cooling start of a season in California     This product contains instructions that are in Japanese. This reseller has been kind enough to offer a couple of instructions in English on how you can use the Camellia Oil. I used this product on dry and wet hair. This product is lightweight you may have to reapply before you go to bed to avoid super dry hair.  The product is made in a container which does a good job controlling the amount of oil that you will put into your hands. The fragrance is neutral. It is worth a try.    Made in Japan</li>
            <li> Used this product for one year.  The results has been amazing and I Highly recommend this product if you have dry hair.  Background:  between work and leisure I spend most of my time in the ocean.  Saltwater is and has been very brutal on my hair.  Prior to using this product I could barely run a comb, brush, nor my fingers through even after showering with top rated conditioners.  This is solution!  Hair is wonderful: easy to comb, flows freely in the wind, and leaves no oily residue.</li>
            <li> This adds a great deal of shine without looking greasy. It greatly fends off free radicals and keeps scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> I have mostly 3b hair w/3c at my edges or hairline and nape. I absolutly love this oil! It is the perfect balance for my hair. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel too greasy. I use it after I wash it. I mainly like to use it for the ends of my hair. It makes my hair extremely soft and silky feeling. However, I need something a little heavier for my edges and nape.  -This product is from Tokyo. My heart goes out for the people in Japan right now. I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy on my hair, but my mom, who has bleached hair, swears by it. I&#x27;ve used it on my skin at night and I&#x27;m happy with results. The skin appears softer and brighter in the morning, and at times my dark spots or dark circles seem less noticeable - I haven&#x27;t noticed this with any other oils. It&#x27;s way to thick to use it as a day-time moisturizer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used argan oil (josie maran), olive, grape seed, sunflower, apricot, dior, nuxe, darphin, l&#x27;occitane, coconut and avocado oils. This one was most moisturizing at night and didn&#x27;t cause any breakouts, but it&#x27;s on the thick and heavy side. My husband has mild rosacea  and it&#x27;s the one he reaches for most often.</li>
            <li> Its ok but it doesn&#x27;t make a big difference in my hair. Maybe its my texture. I would rather buy grapeseed oil or jojoba</li>
            <li> One of the better camellia oils.The smell isnt too strong and it will help the hair after a while of use.This oil  got rid of my boyfriends dandruff immediately after applying and also made his hair shiny*&lt;br /&gt;Helps seal my ends for protection</li>
            <li> Perfect! Made my hair healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> This product evokes images of women with waist-length hair harvesting camellia seeds on Ohshima island. Even for guys with dry hair, a few drops after shampooing makes hair soft and manageable. The bottle will last many months. You can&#x27;t get more unadulterated or purer than this. Try it!</li>
            <li> It is a very good product would recommended it to anyone that has frizzy hair and price is reasonable too !!</li>
            <li> This oil is excellent! I use it on my hair and on my skin. It&#x27;s not greasy and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I almost hate to type this because I don&#x27;t want he secret to get out, but this is my new HG hair product.  I bought this in &#x27;11 and am just trying it now.  I used to Google and YouTube this oil, but found that not too many curlies were using this - so I pushed it aside.  The other day I cowashed and decided to use this to seal and ...wow...wow...wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. detangling was amazing&lt;br /&gt;2. curl/wave definition for days&lt;br /&gt;3. lots of hang and minimal shrinkage&lt;br /&gt;4. my product absorbed faster or appeared to&lt;br /&gt;5. shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit I was a bit heavy handed.  I applied multiple drops of this to my hair in sections and despite that...it all absorbed. I can touch my hair and nothing greasy comes off on my hand.  Days later I still have softness, sheen, shine, and hang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious as to how this would do with the maxiglide or caruso.</li>
            <li> Love it but be careful not to over-use (will lead to oily hair). A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have dry course curly hair. I mix this with a styling cream and blow dry my hair out and this leaves it shinny and smooth. It does not give you that slip in wet hair when blow drying but results are great! Have used on my skin and face does not cause breakouts absorbs easily!</li>
            <li> i donno how it does it but whenever i use this i have less greys.. so i&#x27;m using it as a natural product to keep my hair dark..(i am asia, and my hair started to grey in my late 20s and being a health nut i&#x27;m reluctant to use chemical dyes) this does not keep all greys away. but controls it with acceptable results.. so it&#x27;s good alternative to using chemical hair dyes.</li>
            <li> The best product for my hair</li>
            <li> I use this oil as an overnight treatment, and also mix a few drops in with my daily leave in conditioner.  I have 2b/2c wavy hair and am so happy that this product does not weigh it down or make it feel greasy.  Just a little does the trick.  It just makes my hair look and feel soft and shiny.  I&#x27;m in love with this oil and will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> A friend gave this to me and I have been using it for a couple months now, and it&#x27;s my main go-to now.&lt;br /&gt;Especially for colder weather, it is not to heavy and light enough not to weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> I have been using a tsubaki oil product for my face and also heard that it was good for hair, The price on Amazon is reasonable compared to similar products at Sephora and other high-end stores so I decided to give it a try. It certainly makes my hair look healthier and keeps the frizz smoothed out. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week or so, so time will tell if it has any long-term benefits for my hair. I&#x27;ve never used an oil on my hair before, so this was fun and interesting to try out. Definitely worth getting a bottle if you&#x27;re on the fence about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now and am extremely pleased with it. After straightening my hair I take about 5 drops(you could use less if you have thin or short hair) and apply to my hair concentrating on the ends. It locks in the moisture in my hair and makes my hair smooth and shiny. I also mix some with a couple drops of tea tree oil in a fine mist mini spray bottle and apply to my scalp as needed. It helps keep my scalp itch free and moisturized which can promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> This has become my HG (holy grail) for moisturizing skin.  I apply this as a body oil after a shower.  I pat this on (not slathering) my skin and allow it to dry a bit, and then follow it up w/lotion.  Result:  moisturized skin that lasts!  Thanks to the high oleic acid in this oil, (most compatible w/human skin) it moisturizes the dermal layers on more than just the top level.  I also use this to help soften rough and hardened cuticles (at bedtime) and it&#x27;s worked like a charm.  I&#x27;ve had no bad reaction to this oil whatsoever.  I didn&#x27;t find any scent on this, which is good.  As a facial oil, I&#x27;ve noticed the fine lines becoming less and less obvious on my face.  The dry patches I get during winter are gone after 1 use.  I follow this up w/a facial lotion to help seal in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredient is 100% Camillia seed oil.  I know a higher brand name selling tsubaki oil (camillia seed oil) but it&#x27;s mixed w/other ingredients.  This Oshima brand is pure and natural.  I&#x27;m still on trial and error, when it comes to using this on my hair.  If I put too much, I find that it makes my hair greasy looking (oddly enough it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy---just looks it).  If I put too little, I have a tendency to overdo it.  Still finding the happy medium.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this multi-purpose oil!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly what i was looking for. this Hair Oil has no smell at all, and for me (very fine straight hair) it was to heavy. i used WAY to much the first time, which caused my hair to look a bit still wet. (which was my fault) the second time i used 1 drop and it was still slightly wet looking but it did soak in eventually, but this oil seems like it would be better for someone with thick or very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was disappointed but it still seems like an good oil, just not for my hair type... i will be keeping it, i LOVE the bottle and i may find a different way to use it. i&#x27;ll be trying it on dry hair next.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  I am getting more!</li>
            <li> big improvement with my hair! no more split end and make my hair more smoothly. Highly recommended for others who have long hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product not just for my hair but my skin as well!  I put a couple drops on the end of my hair after a shower which makes my drier ends feel healthy and moisturized and gives a nice shine.  I also work 2 drops into my face after toner and before moisturizer at night (like a serum).  It gives my skin a lovely, healthy glow without feeling greasy (even though I have oily skin), and I&#x27;ve noticed that small blemishes seem to shrink and fade a little quicker for me without being emphasized by flakiness I&#x27;m tempted to over-exfoliate.  This may not work on everyone&#x27;s skin though...I know some people just cannot deal with oil on their face, but for my skin type (which is rather oily but only breaks out if I don&#x27;t give it enough moisture) it&#x27;s been great.  Have been using this every night for a few weeks and have not had a breakout from it.  As with any oil though, use sparingly throughout hair concentrating on the ends so it doesn&#x27;t look greasy.  I have very thick hair and just work 2-3 drops into my ends and lightly pass my hands over the rest of my hair afterwards...Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for some great natural moisture that is light, easily absorbed and not too greasy.  People sensitive to fragrance will also appreciate that this has no smell.  :)</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly what it said it was - the best award winning camellia oil you can get.</li>
            <li> If the scalp gets too dry and starts itching just one application of a couple of drops stops that immediately. For dry hair and scalp this is the best and SAFEST medicine you can buy with money. Fragrance free and the best part of this oil? it is not oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it after bath for scalp/hair moisturizing purposes, once in a few days and it is doing wonders. It can also be used as oil treatment before bath.</li>
            <li> This thing lasts FOREVER and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts! I love it! Way worth the money compared to other salon products I formerly purchased.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my hair and also face. The oil smells really good but 60ml is just too little for the price. It didn&#x27;t really do anything for me. Unless you want to use it as an Aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, no noticeable scent, only need a little. not greasy, easily absorbs. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a few weeks and I must say that it works great on dry hair. At first you may not think it&#x27;s working, but once the oil penetrates into your hair you&#x27;ll realize the difference. When I first started using it, I didn&#x27;t know how much to apply and would apply too much only to find that less is best,except when applying the oil after shampooing when your hair is proned to soak up all the moisture it can get and even too much is not enough. However, once your hair is dry and all the natural oils mix with the camellia oil, you&#x27;ll realize you have put too much.But even then, it does not leave your hair greasy either.Now that I know how to use this oil for my hair it is one of my staple products. Also, you can add this oil to your shampoos, conditioners,deep conditioners &amp; as a hot oil treatment or as your daily moisturizer. I use it in all of my hair products and my hair is fabulously moisturized and conditioned! After reviewing this product, I&#x27;m going to order another bottle and I think I will order the camellia oil in water to carry in my purse with me throughout the day to use whenever I think my hair needs a bit more moisture.Also camellia oil is a great facial moisturizer too (if you have oily skin  like I do use sparingly)---Great stuff![[ASIN:B000OW9QCW Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Hair Care Oil - 60ml]][[ASIN:B000OWEYNI Oshima Tsubaki Camellia Oil in Water - 150ml]]</li>
            <li> I have fine 2C waves, and have tried out a lot of hair oils and products in the past that have ended up being too heavy and that have weighed down my hair.  I decided to try this camellia oil since I had read such great things about it, and am so happy I did!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about five weeks now, and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other oils, this one really is so nice and light -- and yet using it leaves my hair so soft and helps cut down on frizz.  I use it two ways:  I either apply it to my ends when my hair is wet from the shower or I apply it to the ends and over frizzy bits when my hair is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser only lets you dispense a few drops at a time, but that&#x27;s really all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that this was fragrance-free and usually buy products with light fragrances since I&#x27;m a smell junkie, but I&#x27;m still super pleased with this formulation of camellia oil, and the lack of fragrance means that it plays nicely with perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great, great product!</li>
            <li> A very light oil that makes your hair soft and easy to comb through, without weighing it down. Has no smell to clash with other hair/body fragrances. I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Ok. I love this product. I&#x27;ve tired this and the Mei brand. Love them both. Both work great. This oil is amazing and quickly went to the top in my pick of oils. My full review is on the Mei brand a competitor but yes I do recommend this and my mom loves it too.</li>
            <li> smells good, feels good, I advise everyone to try it.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how really soft and manageable this stuff is. Mixed it with coconut oil nice.</li>
            <li> Like the oil very much it leaves my hair with lots of shine</li>
            <li> I got this oil because I had read that this type of oil was good for aiding in hair growth and I am not only trying to grow out the hair on my head, but my eyebrows as well. Well, the eyebrows are doing great. I have thin hair on the end of my brows and I can honestly say that it is now growing in after about a month of nightly use. It is very light. I have also used it on my lashes with a Qtip and my lashes are longer, but not extremely. I also mix this oil with grapefruit oil and other carrier oils and spray on my hair but hard to tell if this has had any effect there because I keep my hair in protective style in braided beehive and have hair growth from non-manipulation as well, but I will def. keep using it. The bottle size is generous and oil comes in heavy glass bottle which I love. I will def. be ordering this bottle again soon even though I still have quite a bit left. Love it!</li>
            <li> This oil is very efficient and works for my straight and fine hair as well as my BF&#x27;s coarse wurly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of long, fine, wavy hair. It gets frizzy really easily and my ends are always drying out, so I decided to try this oil. I was really happy with the results when my hair dried (left it on for 30 min and washed normally with shampoo/conditioner) -- it didn&#x27;t make my hair look like it was still greasy like some products have done in the past, it wasn&#x27;t frizzy but it also wasn&#x27;t weighed down at all, and it was SO SOFT! I love this stuff. Definitely going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I needed something to make my hair sleek and shiny, give it more nutrients and help with dandruff. I bought this camelia oil hoping it would help. I&#x27;m tired of using harmful corporate products on my hair that most of the time don&#x27;t even work. I massage Tsubaki Camellia Oil into my scalp to help with dandruff, then brush it down to the ends of my hair, leave it in for an hour, and wash it out. I have had some compliments on my hair and it does feel less dry on the top and the ends. I really like this product because it is multipurpose. It comes in a convenient bottle that is difficult to spill the oil from (good for clumsy people like me.)</li>
            <li> This is a good oil I just got it yesterday and used it as a pre poo and left it in overnight.  I also put some in my cleansing cream (hair rules) this morning.  This left my hair very suble and it dried softer.  I also put a few drops on my face and I saw the difference in just a few minutes.  This is great oil.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky. It doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> As soon as I put a few drops to my hair, my hair looks shiny and silky. I used to use &amp;#34;AVEDA&amp;#34; hair product and it was just okay. It was a really good choice to switch to use this camellia hair care oil. This product works with my hair the best.</li>
