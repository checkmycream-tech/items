            <li> Suffering&lt;br /&gt; Fighting fine, thin hair for years has eased!  I use this regularly and along with another shampoo on occasion and there has been a noticeable difference!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a tough time finding hair products without parabens that work well for my fine, thin hair. Biomega has been great. I particularly like this volume shampoo and the moisture mist.</li>

            <li> This shampoo is great for colored hair.  Not too harsh, making color last longer. First time I tried this was at the beauty shop, now I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo once my stylist used it on my hair in the salon. I loved the results and how it smelled. My hair has thinned, so anytime I can find a product that gives me volume, I am all for it. This is definitely worth purchasing!</li>
            <li> I use many of these products and love them all.  Shampoo is good and lasts quite a long time.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to use it.</li>
            <li> I love biomega shampoo and conditioner. A salon recommended this product to me and as soon as I used it. I fell in love.</li>
            <li> Great volumizing shampoo for color treated, fine, thin hair.  Does not strip hair of color, but plumps hair for easy styling.</li>
            <li> Have short, fine and colored hair, always looking for new products to help manage my hair.  This is my new favorite shampoo, it is light and smells wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t lather much but it sure cleans and volumizes.  Wish I had bought a bigger bottle, about to replinish!</li>
            <li> This is great to use as a weekly clarifying shampoo even though I don&#x27;t think they market it that way.  It&#x27;s a bit too harsh for daily use in my opinion though but this whole line is great.</li>
            <li> This might be a little expensive but if you need volume and sleek hair this is the way to go. It is a large amount too.</li>
            <li> I would not say it adds volume but it does control flyaway hair in a dry climate.  Gentle, good on color.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo, bought first time at hair salon, price was better from Amazon.  Light scent, no scalp dryness, works well on fine, graying hair.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive nose like I do, beware! This shampoo has a strong perfume odor. The smell is just overwhelming to me and quite unpleasant. It also made my hair fly-away and dry. I did not like this product.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo so far for fine hair,I  work in a salon &amp; have tried many.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product.Anyone with fine thinning hair should try this,I cant speak&lt;br /&gt;for thick hair,but i think it would be good also.</li>

            <li> Left hair shiny and with more volume.  Also seemed to hold style for a few days without washing everyday. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Used to love this stuff, used it for awhile and loved that I could get it her but I think they&#x27;ve somehow changed the formula recently. It makes my scalp break out now. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This made my hair flatter actually - only after one use.  I asked to return it and the seller refused since it had been opened.  How do you know if you like it unless you try it?</li>
            <li> I have used this for a couple of years and I love it! I gives my hair lots of body.</li>
            <li> Wife loves my hair after using this shampoo. Leaves my hair clean and smelling good.  Hair has more body when you use this shampoo.</li>
