            <li>It&#x27;s an amazing color.</li>
            <li>Might be perfect for a teenager or even a college student but just too much for me.</li>
            <li>Guess they figured out how popular of a cult-hit it is.</li>

            <li>love eye shadow and milani is yummy</li>
            <li>I love this eye shadow - it glides on.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I discovered this eye shadow at CVS and love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eye shimmer.</li>
            <li>I love this shade.  </li>
            <li>Costs a bit more than I remember</li>
            <li>but hey - I&#x27;d pay alot more to get this</li>
            <li>This shadow starts out shiny and glittery, but when you use up the top layer, it is not as shiny, which is just fine.</li>
            <li>every person I&#x27;ve told about this that has tried it agrees that it&#x27;s the best, hands down.</li>
            <li>Milani&#x27;s website has this for $7.99 with free shipping on orders over $25.</li>
            <li>SO useful!</li>
            <li>After the first use the uber sparkle has disappeared , you are left with a great every-day glimmer that works everywhere:  </li>
            <li>so much:&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box it has a top layer that looks REALLY sparkly.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect amount of shear color and subtle sparkle.  </li>
            <li>All the reviews here are right on point..</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find it on amazon, I was having a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li>Its nice to wear alone or to build with other colors.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find these glittery e/s on sale that I completely missed that &amp;#34;Glitter Overspray&amp;#34; was written on the display.  </li>
            <li>brow bone, lids, cheekbones(careful - too much is too much!)</li>
            <li>bright pink sticker that was on the actual product..</li>
            <li>and I use it wet sometimes for a more intense look.</li>
            <li>Using wet gives me more control.  </li>
            <li>Very discret color but vibrant.</li>
            <li>Now, years later - Albertsons is gone, the local Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry the Milani brand any more.......</li>
            <li>This eye shadow is such a pretty sparkly gold!</li>
            <li>Use this everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>I cant buy it anywhere close to where I live so ordering it through amazon</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I first tripped over this eyeshadow while shopping for grocerys at the local Albertsons.  </li>
            <li>, d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;,  and for evening I use it wet for super shine lids.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Milani offers that with this product to be able to use wet or dry.</li>
            <li>I love the angled brush as well, makes it easier to get into the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>It looks so pretty, but its actually only shimmery/ sparkly on the outermost layer then the rest of the eye shadow underneath is nothing how it looks on the outside.</li>
            <li>Application was a nightmare - the glitter falls everywhere &amp; sticks to your cheeks/underneath your eyes but barely stays on your lids!  </li>
            <li>I originally got this eye shadow a few months back at a drug store, it is the prettiest shadow!</li>
            <li>This barely shows up at all on my lid,</li>
            <li>but when you apply you barely sees the shimmer..</li>
            <li>Milani shadows are really vibrant and last a long time.</li>
            <li>and I can use it as a base under other colors for added sparkle or I can use it alone &amp; it looks great!  </li>
            <li>Its very flattering, not glittery, just a little bit of shimmer.</li>

            <li> I bought this from target a while ago and was sad when target discontinued selling it:(  Happy to find it again!  </li>
            <li> Not all shadows can be used wet,</li>
            <li> so sad because it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> What a total waste of $!</li>
            <li> ; look but with a little shine to make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find in my little town, Thank you.</li>
            <li> You can even use it below the bottom lashes for some subtle glam and umph.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like there is a thin coat of sparkle on the outside :(  </li>
            <li> When I received it I was shocked at just how glittery it is.  </li>
            <li> I use it as my base shadow &amp; under my brows.</li>
            <li> I was very sad when none of the stores by me (darn you, Walgreens!) carried this brand anymore.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I knew this product had some glitter to it when I looked at it online.  Wow!  When I received it I was shocked at just how glittery it is.  Might be perfect for a teenager or even a college student but just too much for me.</li>
            <li> Lovely color! It&#x27;s almost been a year and I am still using it. A lot of product in this case!</li>
            <li> Love it. Looks shimmery but not over the top.</li>
            <li> This is my second one!  Love It!</li>
            <li> This shadow starts out shiny and glittery, but when you use up the top layer, it is not as shiny, which is just fine. I use this shade for daytime to highlight the edges of the eyes. You can even use it below the bottom lashes for some subtle glam and umph. Milani shadows are really vibrant and last a long time.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed!! It looks so pretty, but its actually only shimmery/ sparkly on the outermost layer then the rest of the eye shadow underneath is nothing how it looks on the outside. It&#x27;s like there is a thin coat of sparkle on the outside :(  so sad because it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this shadow. I always get compliments on my makeup.</li>
            <li> All the reviews here are right on point.. Beautiful shade for any skin tone. Only thing that I would comment on was the &amp;#34;50% off&amp;#34; bright pink sticker that was on the actual product.. So it&#x27;s a discontinued product</li>
            <li> It is beautiful and I love it. At the end of the day, you may have some glitter on your face, but it looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> I finally found it again !!!! I use to buy at cvs, but they stopped carring this shadow . Finally I can buy it again. It&#x27;s an amazing color. I love it.!!!!!! Also it lasts a long time because I use it every day and it lasts about 4-5 months. !!!!!!!! Well for me lol . I love this shadow they just need to bring it back in stores.!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try it out</li>
            <li> I originally got this eye shadow a few months back at a drug store, it is the prettiest shadow! I use it as my base shadow &amp; under my brows. Its very flattering, not glittery, just a little bit of shimmer. Its nice to wear alone or to build with other colors. I love the angled brush as well, makes it easier to get into the hard to reach areas. I was so happy to find it on amazon, I was having a hard time finding it in stores. Its a wonderful shadow, goes on smooth &amp; lasts all day &amp; into the night.</li>
            <li> I love love love this eye shadow!:) I cant buy it anywhere close to where I live so ordering it through amazon worked out for me. This eye shadow is such a pretty sparkly gold! It looks amazing in the sun or light! People notice thats for sure</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find these glittery e/s on sale that I completely missed that &amp;#34;Glitter Overspray&amp;#34; was written on the display.  Application was a nightmare - the glitter falls everywhere &amp; sticks to your cheeks/underneath your eyes but barely stays on your lids!  I tried patting it on as well as sweeping it on but no matter what I did, the glitter fell like rain.  Once I accepted the fact that it wouldn&#x27;t be a good glittery light gold e/s, I figured it&#x27;d be a decent base or highlight shade - ugh, wrong again!  This barely shows up at all on my lid, even w/primer.  What a total waste of $!</li>
            <li> love eye shadow and milani is yummy</li>
            <li> I love this eye shadow - it glides on. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> beach sand- best highlighting shadow EVER. beautiful and the perfect highlighter on every skin tone. I use it on the inner corners and brow bone. every person I&#x27;ve told about this that has tried it agrees that it&#x27;s the best, hands down. I was very sad when none of the stores by me (darn you, Walgreens!) carried this brand anymore. and even sadder when the price for this shadow increased on Amazon from about $8 to over $17. Guess they figured out how popular of a cult-hit it is. hint: Milani&#x27;s website has this for $7.99 with free shipping on orders over $25. Don&#x27;t pay $17 dollars for it!</li>
            <li> I discovered this eye shadow at CVS and love it. It is the perfect amount of shear color and subtle sparkle.  Great for every day wear to work.</li>
            <li> Good shade as highlighter and I use it wet sometimes for a more intense look. Milani offers that with this product to be able to use wet or dry. Not all shadows can be used wet,</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eye shimmer. It is hard to find in my little town, Thank you.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow will brighten your eyes with a hint of glitter. Very discret color but vibrant. Use it alone or in the middle of your eyelid to get a shiny look !</li>
            <li> I was hoping to see a pearly effect. but when you apply you barely sees the shimmer..&lt;br /&gt;disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this shade.  It goes on great and I can use it as a base under other colors for added sparkle or I can use it alone &amp; it looks great!  I will continue to order this product!</li>
            <li> I love the shine to this eye shadow and the color is beautiful. Good for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look but with a little shine to make your eyes pop.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> I first tripped over this eyeshadow while shopping for grocerys at the local Albertsons.  Now, years later - Albertsons is gone, the local Walgreens doesn&#x27;t carry the Milani brand any more.......&lt;br /&gt;To the Rescue: Amazon saves me again!&lt;br /&gt;I was SOooo delighted to find Milani Runway Eyes shadow here. Costs a bit more than I remember but hey - I&#x27;d pay alot more to get this eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s why I like it so much:&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box it has a top layer that looks REALLY sparkly. After the first use the uber sparkle has disappeared , you are left with a great every-day glimmer that works everywhere:  brow bone, lids, cheekbones(careful - too much is too much!), d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;,  and for evening I use it wet for super shine lids.&lt;br /&gt;This one shadow is always in my purse and in my suitcase.  SO useful! üëç&amp; a great value üí∞</li>
            <li> I bought this from target a while ago and was sad when target discontinued selling it:(  Happy to find it again!  Brightens your eyes and it is a great daytime eye shadow.  Using wet gives me more control.  I then blend with a brush if there are flaws.</li>
