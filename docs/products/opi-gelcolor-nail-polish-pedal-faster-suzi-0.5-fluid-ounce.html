            <li>on well and cures great!</li>
            <li>Great coverage in 2 coats, great color.</li>
            <li>Good product, BUT</li>
            <li>I like gel polish as it lasts without peeling off or chipping and this is just as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with OPI products.  </li>
            <li>But love the color!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This color is best on people who have naturally dark skin, like an olive complexion or if you have a great tan!!!</li>
            <li>I have my own kit and have been doing my own nails for some time.</li>
            <li>So this color does not look like the top.  </li>
            <li>Would be much better if it was a frost instead.  </li>
            <li>I love the OPI colors</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more OPI polish.  </li>
            <li>Love OPI Gelcolor.</li>
            <li>This is actually my favorite Gelcolor and had been searching for it for some time.</li>
            <li>I love this color.</li>
            <li>love opi gel</li>
            <li>I was happy that it was on a significant sale from its original price and came VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>Howert, OPI is my favorite polish and I am sure this will be fine when it is used.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about gel polish!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work so well with UV light.  </li>
            <li>looks great with a french nail</li>
            <li>Beautiful light pink shimmer.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t rate the product as I didn&#x27;t realize I needed a special light to set the polish.</li>
            <li>This newest of the gel colors for shellac manicures is beautiful; pink and sparkly and goes on well.</li>
            <li>and they definitely have much more selections than CND, but with the OPI polish, it chipped and my nails broke or chipped more easily.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shade of OPI Polish.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice soft color that is not over bearing.</li>
            <li>I have professional looking manis from the comfort of my own home.  </li>
            <li>Not a bad color</li>
            <li>Vdry pretty light link.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Fun for spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Thanks to seller for quick deliver.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly how it looks.  </li>
            <li>Would help if there was more of a description to include this information as I bought several colors and 4 out of 5 of them had the glitter/shimmer which are unusable for me.</li>
            <li>A nice pink with sparkles.</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly as depicted online, which I was a bit worried about.  </li>
            <li>This is a truly glamorous, timeless color, very flattering for all.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>TOO MUCH GLITTER/SHIMMER.  </li>
            <li>Pedal Faster Suzi is not a matte finish, very pearly.  </li>
            <li>The consistency seems to be better than that of other gels I&#x27;ve tried so I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would not be used by older women.  </li>
            <li>OPI is a high quality nail polish that carries over to their gel color.</li>
            <li>but it is a light pink with a sparkle in it.</li>
            <li>Office-safe yet pretty enough for an evening out on the town.</li>
            <li>Very pretty color, pink and shimmery.</li>
            <li>very pretty pink with a hint of sparkle-  </li>
            <li>The product goes on smooth and lasts a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I did initially used 2 coats and it was still a little bit too light, so I did end up using 3</li>
            <li>This is a nice color, not overly pink or overly translucent and hard to see.  </li>
            <li>but I am thinking it will even be better when I get the OPI Base &amp; Top coat.</li>
            <li>Consistency is silky smooth upon application, and the subtle shimmer gives the gel polish staying power (pro tip:</li>
            <li>In sum: a light silvery-pink base mixed with fine silver glitter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually a sparkly clear pink.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a truly glamorous, timeless color, very flattering for all. In sum: a light silvery-pink base mixed with fine silver glitter. Consistency is silky smooth upon application, and the subtle shimmer gives the gel polish staying power (pro tip: glitter polish usually lasts longer than opaque or sheer solid colors). Office-safe yet pretty enough for an evening out on the town.</li>
            <li> Vdry pretty light link.</li>
            <li> It is a lighter pink with a shimmer. I put 2 coats on for a fuller coverage. But love the color!</li>
            <li> So this color does not look like the top.  It&#x27;s actually a sparkly clear pink.  It makes your nails shine with just a hint of pink and sparkle... almost like you&#x27;re wearing a pink sparkly glass slipper on your nails.  Yep... that&#x27;s exactly how it looks.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color, not overly pink or overly translucent and hard to see.  What I didn&#x27;t realize is that once it&#x27;s on, it looks like a glitter polish and not just a shiny frost.  Although I like the shine and the color, not overly fond of the glitter look.  Would be much better if it was a frost instead.  Hence the 3 stars.  I did initially used 2 coats and it was still a little bit too light, so I did end up using 3 coats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4-7-13 - After wearing the OPI colors for several weeks now and I have to say that I&#x27;m switching back to CND.  I love the OPI colors and they definitely have much more selections than CND, but with the OPI polish, it chipped and my nails broke or chipped more easily. Definitely not as good of quality as CND.  For this color, I just reordered the CND Strawberry Smoothie.</li>
            <li> Very pretty color, pink and shimmery. OPI is a high quality nail polish that carries over to their gel color.</li>
            <li> OPI products are always quality. The gel lasts long and the color doesn&#x27;t fade or change like some other gels polishes do. Note: It is a sheer color with shimmer.</li>
            <li> This newest of the gel colors for shellac manicures is beautiful; pink and sparkly and goes on well. The consistency seems to be better than that of other gels I&#x27;ve tried so I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shade of OPI Polish.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Good product, BUT TOO MUCH GLITTER/SHIMMER.  Would not be used by older women.  Would help if there was more of a description to include this information as I bought several colors and 4 out of 5 of them had the glitter/shimmer which are unusable for me.</li>

            <li> I like gel polish as it lasts without peeling off or chipping and this is just as good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The tricky thing about wearing gel....is not knowing the \\&quot;true\\&quot; color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice soft color that is not over bearing.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very pretty.  I am very pleased with OPI products.  I will be purchasing more OPI polish.  Lasts for 2 weeks.  I am using with CND Base &amp; Top coat but I am thinking it will even be better when I get the OPI Base &amp; Top coat.</li>
            <li> Like the polish but it is a light pink with a sparkle in it. Not a bad color I just wish it was a darker pink,</li>
            <li> Love OPI Gelcolor. Great coverage in 2 coats, great color. Fun for spring and summer. A nice pink with sparkles.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing wrong with the seller or how long it took to get to me, the color is awful on me. It totally washes me out. when I added color to my nails it made all the difference in the world. Pedal Faster Suzi is not a matte finish, very pearly.  This color is best on people who have naturally dark skin, like an olive complexion or if you have a great tan!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work so well with UV light.  Maybe it needs the OPI dryer.</li>
            <li> very pretty pink with a hint of sparkle-  looks great with a french nail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to OPI Gelcolor. I have my own kit and have been doing my own nails for some time. This is actually my favorite Gelcolor and had been searching for it for some time. I was happy that it was on a significant sale from its original price and came VERY quickly. I have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about gel polish!  I have professional looking manis from the comfort of my own home.  The colors are exactly as depicted online, which I was a bit worried about.  The product goes on smooth and lasts a few weeks.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful light pink shimmer. Goes on thin so a few coats will be needed.</li>
            <li> I love this color. Subtle with just the right amount of sparkle.</li>
            <li> love it! looks likes princess rule but heavier pink, and not so transluscent!&lt;br /&gt;goes on well and cures great! love opi gel</li>
