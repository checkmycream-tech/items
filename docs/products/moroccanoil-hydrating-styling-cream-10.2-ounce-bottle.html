            <li>This product seems to contain more water than anything else.  </li>
            <li>This is not an authentic MoroccanOil product.  </li>

            <li>This is my favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it was recommended by my stylist and I love him for it.</li>
            <li>Also the smell is great and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it made my ends a bit more manageable</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;She was so excited and thrilled.</li>
            <li>This is a top seller because it works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I have been using this great product for a long time and it seemed like a good idea to order it online to save money.  </li>
            <li>It is excellent to control the curls of my daughter&#x27;s hair and left it soft and with a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>First purchased at Saks, but the retail option is just as good.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good creme.  </li>
            <li>So far i have been able to use on all of my clients, with great results.</li>
            <li>There are many imitations, none as good as the real thing.</li>
            <li>And i was looking all over the place for it am the type of girl that likes to try different products and let me just say dis is the best product i have ever tried it make ur hair smooth with shine</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the smell much more than the oil (of which I was not a fan of the smell).  </li>
            <li>Product does what it offers to do &amp; smells great</li>
            <li>Use on wet hair for best results.</li>

            <li>I love Moroccan products to keep my hair smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>if I like it better than the oil, it might not be as light as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>This is a great, lightweight product that leaves hair soft, shiny and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li>Its lightweight, smells amazing and keeps my hair looking great (not oily) all day long.</li>

            <li>Not only does it leave your hair with this tremendous shine, manageability but also smells so good!!!  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; light weight leave in spray which has great reviews, but I love this product WAY more.  </li>
            <li>thing that impressed me with the Wen Cleansing Conditioner which this product doesn&#x27;t do, is allow me to get away with washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccan Oil, but I don&#x27;t get the original one because it&#x27;s strictly oil and can make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>.It seems to rinse off my hands easily instead of the scrubbing wash I tried to remove the oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Buying it here is easy, and the price is on-point with buying it in a store or salon.</li>
            <li>It seems to hydrate and making de tangling easy and smells yum.</li>
            <li>It is a strong smell</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first to use it because I have very fine hair and most products make me look greasy.</li>
            <li>and it does smell great, but for the price and claim, I was expecting so much more than something that smells nice and makes my hair a little softer.    </li>
            <li>She has such beautiful hair and this is what she likes to use.</li>
            <li>First product I&#x27;ve ever bought after a trim because it helps with static tremendously!!</li>
            <li>With Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream I can wash my hair with ANY shampoo and conditioner and still get perfect hair (efficiently cuts down my monthly spending).  </li>
            <li>Use it from the ears down is best and this way your hair won&#x27;t turn out greasy.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fine and looks fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy hair-</li>
            <li>I have think fine hair</li>
            <li>and I fine it does give my hair the body I need to do my hair.</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream works for my fine curly hair to keep it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry ends, and super nice scent.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had another that I was able to use and didn&#x27;t have to return.  </li>
            <li>Gives my hair a little shine and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge product junkie and have tried everything from Neutrogena to Ms. Jesse for my 4c hair</li>
            <li>and there was a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of moisturizing without being too heavy and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>:) I have long and some what frizzy hair and it makes it look amazing!</li>
            <li>this is a great hair care product for daily use.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel smooth and silky when I use it</li>
            <li>My hair feels so moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>and It&#x27;s a 10), all serum or light oil mist based.</li>
            <li>The cream is luxurious and light.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth, and shiny but also adds consistency to the curl.</li>
            <li>It looks smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>It does a great job especially in the drying winter months.</li>
            <li>mix with the MorcoccanOil Light treatment.</li>
            <li>Hair is smooth and silky immediately after washing and applying the cream.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice to feel and styling much easier.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>I had to use heat to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump in your hair.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful hair lotion to use everyday.</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy and smooth again.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>The styling cream keeps moisture in hair but is light and not oily.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because my hairdresser put it on my hair and it smelled beautifully for a long time!</li>
            <li>The smell was not horrible but it just didnt smell right</li>
            <li>I first used this product at a friend&#x27;s house in a pinch and loved it so much I purchased it myself.  </li>
            <li>Smell is so unique.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of products!</li>
            <li>&quot; friendly.</li>
            <li>I love this product since the first time I tried.</li>
            <li>Its a fun way to start the day!</li>
            <li>Their deep conditioner is however one of the best professional products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Another great product used for my transition of going natural &amp; it has been very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy thick hair and this product makes my hair smooth and forms my waves perfectly!</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft, smelling very nice and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>In the process of figuring out how to have this situation made right!</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and boy, was she right!  </li>
            <li>It makes your hair super soft and keeps your hair looking healthy!  </li>
            <li>Every time I blow-dryed my hair, it would come out nice and straight and smooth, but within a couple of hours...not so much.</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying ONE&#x27; N ONLY shampoo and Cndtr in Sallys same thing mOROCCANOIL sulfate free and all... awesome products!  </li>
            <li>Using this cream doesn&#x27;t really seem to make much more of a difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks good from one washing to the next washing.</li>
            <li>I will try any product once, but the good ones get a second purchase.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, I have very thick/coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product, since I use it my hair is very well protected for the continued use of blowers and heated hair rollers.</li>
            <li>A great deal of this product spilled outside of the container, making a large portion unusable.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand, I mistakenly ordered the Hydrating cream I wanted to order the Curl, however I was not disappointed it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Whoever invented this stuff is pure genius!!</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh with a touch of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>I work it mostly near the ends of my hair, which are the dryer areas, then gloss over the top  of my hair lightly to smooth fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK - I found out it has some chemicals in it that I don&#x27;t love (essentially liquid plastics)</li>
            <li>Product delivered quickly</li>
            <li>If the original seller told me thy didn&#x27;t have a replacement right away  </li>
            <li>Very hydrating and keeps the hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li>This is a product I use on a regular basis, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this now:-)</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t help that I live in the most humid environment,</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my slightly curly hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well, easy to use,</li>
            <li>I really love Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream because it leaves my hair soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li>I was hooked after the first try!  </li>
            <li>Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Amazing product:) my hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I use it with the extra volume shampoo, conditioner, and hairspray  as well as the treatment oil and my hair has never been so healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy!</li>
            <li>This cream is light and very hydrating without being greasy.</li>
            <li>really keeps it smooth</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a while, I really like it because it make my hair looks like smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using the moroccan oil hair line, it really hydrates my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and has totally reformed my frizz.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen Hair Care Products and while I liked the result of the cleaning conditioner, I had a problem with a low level</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite hair products to use to detangle and keep my hair hydrated.</li>
            <li>:) This styling cream added softness, shine, definition, soft hold and most importantly, is the only thing that has ever taken my frizz away.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell (it reminds me of Comet Cleanser)</li>
            <li>Been using this since 2010 and love the way it leaves my natural hair as well as weaves...</li>
            <li>I thought MoroccanOil had more of a clear look???  </li>
            <li>It is worth it, get it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Only product I&#x27;ve found to be effective on my type hair.</li>
            <li>With just a couple of squirts of this magic stuff my attitude has completely changed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how or why this product is worth $32.00.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it...</li>
            <li>Packaged well, seems fresh and creamy as it should be and not watery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>If you have thick hair this product is brilliant.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>that was a nice combination, but not enough to where i would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get tired of the delicious smell of this styling cream.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the Moroccan hair oil and the product came on time( right before Christmas)  and as described.  </li>
            <li>The comb slides right through without tangles.</li>
            <li>I ordered it from this seller and it came very quickly and brand new, unopened.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks more healthy, less hassle</li>
            <li>My hair is much stronger and brighter ... recommend the use of the full range ...</li>
            <li>I use this product all the time, don&#x27;t let this seller fool you, first of all it didn&#x27;t came in a box the real product comes in an original box and</li>
            <li>I have dry, curly, frizzy hair and this stuff tames it nicely.  </li>
            <li>The MoroccanOil has finally tamed it so that my hair looks beautifully styled all day long.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny for soft frizz free hair all the time.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I go through it quickly, but I absolutely swear by it,</li>
            <li>Cream is excellent and worth every penny but the supplier I used sent the wrong product.</li>
            <li>I quickly came to Amazon and found it much cheaper than at the salon and ordered it.</li>
            <li>This is the best hydration cream on the market for people with thin hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I feel like my hair is more rebellious without the cream and with it helps to tame it a bit better.</li>
            <li>Not only does it feel conditioned, it also feels thicker and fuller with a very smooth volume.  </li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>This has made me forget all about my last favorite-this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>that gunk is worth $50/pound, but as usual, Amazon has a good price, and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere cheaper.  </li>
            <li>You can always apply a bit more after you are done blow drying,  if you need extra control.  </li>
            <li>But, SiL said the cream was better and used it in my hair the last time she cut it.  </li>
            <li>First product review I&#x27;ve ever written, but had to comment on this product.</li>
            <li>This cream gave it back its shine and makes it feel smooth, natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>but if I were my friend I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d give it a 4 or even a 5 possibly...</li>
            <li>Try Macadamian Oil, Nexxus, or Mixed Chicks Products for a better quality leave-in cream.</li>
            <li>Never fails.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much and will order again soon!</li>
            <li>A friend bought me my first bottle from a beauty supply store, the type of store that you need a  beautican license to even get in the door.</li>
            <li>I have thin/wavy hair, pretty oily and it frizzes</li>
            <li>Sure the bottle was the same</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products</li>
            <li>One pump of this fabulous product and my hair is left soft, smooth, conditioned, and full of body, with a glorious scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use conditioner any more short hair and highlighted and also colored 1 pump</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It works ok, not the same product that I buy in the salon.</li>
            <li>Funny how that works.</li>
            <li>A girl friend bought my first bottle and I have thanked her time and time again.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this in Las Vegas in a shop downstairs of the Bellagio because I had forgotten to pack any hair products.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try it because of all the great reviews, but quite honestly not worth anywhere near the $$$.</li>
            <li>I was sure I had selected the Oil and obviously not...</li>
            <li>It styles ok the first day of use, but the second day hair gets funky, like gooey.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my hair after having radiation and it was excellent in restoring my hair.you only need to use a small amount each time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this when they first stared carrying it in the salon</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and frizz free for days.</li>
            <li>just so you guys know this is my first time writing a review</li>
            <li>Much better than paying salon prices for something you can only purchase in the salon.</li>
            <li>Was recommended to me by a friend with very curly hair but worked on my wavy hair too!</li>
            <li>Thanks for asking me!</li>
            <li>Great hair product for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I first heard of the product from my hairdresser</li>
            <li>But overall, I&#x27;m not in love.  </li>
            <li>but first I mix it with the Moroccan oil hair treatment to protect, moisturize and speed up drying time for my hair.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t use this product without adding an oil when my hair dries, which basically means it&#x27;s not adding any benefit other than that amazing</li>
            <li>Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream is normally an orange color, what I received was a light peach/cream colored product - it looked as though they blended the actual product with some cheap lotion.    </li>
            <li>It made my blow dried hair soft, manageable and shiny and it smelled great too which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>We use this on my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair and keeps them soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I love my long hair and I am willing to buy the products to take care of it.  </li>
            <li>it treats my dead ends really well,  plus, it smells really really good.</li>
            <li>soft hair that is smooth to the touch and very \\&quot;hair-playing\\</li>
            <li>It is soft, manageable, and doesn&#x27;t look damaged at all since I do use a blow dryer and flat iron on top of everything else!</li>
            <li>oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow</li>
            <li>I used more than the bottle instructed-- a full pump and a half and spread it throughout my hair taking care to get the ends.</li>
            <li>this product is definitly worth the 10 more i would have payed if i bought at a professional in person salon, which is the only way you should buy it or any Moroccan oil products to avoid knock offs.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re doing the math right now to see how old I am, right?</li>
            <li>I am a high volume platinum blonde, so this works wonders for people with greater than 7 levels of lift.</li>
            <li>It was the first time that I could ever wrap my hair after washing my hair myself    If you&#x27;re hair issues sound similar to mine</li>
            <li>I use it more as a leave in conditioner, when I blow dry and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>BTW, I used it both on dry hair and on damp hair - it works either way, but slightly better with damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I found when I used it, I could easily recreate the same style from the salon.   </li>
            <li>As mentioned above, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I even tried to add pure Moroccan oil to it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wanna live without it anymore!!</li>
            <li>I live in the desert and this is the only hair product the gets out static.</li>
            <li>It worked really well, so I scored a jug on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend for any hair type!</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will get a greasy look if you apply too much product to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I had heard much about these products and decided to test.</li>
            <li>and this product really helps style and hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying this on Amazon, but having tried it out, it&#x27;s the real deal (bought from BeautyWorld, 7/2013).</li>
            <li>Works wonders and I highly recommend you try it out!</li>
            <li>However, if you have straight hair and you want to curl it</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>thanks, that&#x27;s a creme -</li>
            <li>Whatever the concoction they&#x27;ve sent is, the product absolutely does not work like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>But very pricey.</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than if I had bought it anywhere in Connecticut.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Smells really good&lt;br /&gt;Helps with some of the frizziness, but not all of it.</li>
            <li>It is NOT the real Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>makes hair very manage when blow drying.</li>
            <li>I have curly/frizzy hair, and this product really helps keep it at bay.</li>
            <li>My hair is manageable thanks to the products I purchased.</li>
            <li>now, I am doubting as to whether this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Very upsetting.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very curly.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the efficiency and honesty.</li>
            <li>It has really help my hair.  </li>
            <li>The product I was shipped was not the real Moroccan Oil product.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to go along with those who said it may not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Purchased from amazon.com (not another seller on amazon), so it&#x27;s the actual product and not some cheap stuff in the moroccanoil bottle.</li>
            <li>SO I can&#x27;t really say</li>
            <li>It was very over priced for what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I noticed that it&#x27;s the Moroccan OIL that really does the trick with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, you can get Argon Oil for much cheaper at Target, which I would recommend - it works just as well as this brand.</li>
            <li>This really wakes it up and controls the curl.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely fashion, thanks</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and just buy the real product at the salon or from the Moroccan oil website.</li>
            <li>Works well for whether I want curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>I use this product along with Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream.  </li>
            <li>They work very well together.</li>
            <li>It seems to really help protect the hair from styling heat damage and it really smooths my hair.</li>
            <li>Watch how much you use to avoid an overly greasy look.</li>
            <li>and it was just too much.</li>
            <li>dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li>I dont really use the product it gave a really shiny look</li>
            <li>I feel like it has really protected my hair from the heat of the blow dryer, straightener, and curling iron.</li>
            <li>I must have put too much on because it made my hair look oily.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of heavy</li>
            <li>It smells good and keeps hair soft when I rub it on a few times a week.</li>
            <li>All in all, it makes it super easy to achieve the messy, rolled-out-of-bed look</li>
            <li>My hair is actually silky,.something that no other product has been able to achieve.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend buying this product (and any other quality hair/skin product) from a SALON, even if it means you have to pay more.</li>
            <li>This product re hydrates and moisturises the hair better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li>Love the other Moroccan products also.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different hair products over the years to combat the frizziness that inevitably befalls those of us w/ curly hair, but this is the first one I can say really makes a significant difference AND is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, apply before blow dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, below shoulder length hair that I blow dry straight.</li>
            <li>Mine is fine, but thick, and can easily be damaged.  </li>
            <li>This styling cream is very light and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>this type of brand normally has a certain smell and helps hair, but this was bought online and is a knockoff, smells to chemically.</li>
            <li>I also use moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner, I think all three work really well together and highly recommend them all.</li>
            <li>When I got in mail it was not in a box but a Fedex envelope with tape on the top holding the squirt handle down</li>
            <li>I have very fine, fly-away hair, and even though it&#x27;s long the MN winters leave my hair full of static and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li>in fact, I&#x27;m smelling my hair right now and can barely tell.</li>
            <li>in fact, I&#x27;m smelling my hair right now and can barely tell.</li>
            <li>The product I received barely had a fragrance and just didn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li>You get more product for less price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My curls are more defines and less frizz.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and slightly shinier when I use this hydrating cream.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, since I found such success with this product, I am going to try the intense hydrating mask and the restorative hair mask.     </li>
            <li>The particular types of silicone are known to cause cancer when looked up on line.</li>
            <li>all time classic.</li>
            <li>This worked like magic especially now that it is short, goes to my neck.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy, makes my hair so soft, and helps me maintain my smooth style after I flat iron.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy, but the waves have been pure frizz with all of the damage &amp; gray.</li>
            <li>My hair is in-between curly and wavy but is very dry that it needs something to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>Soft!!  </li>
            <li>Some people have said the smell is a little &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li>Some people have said the smell is a little &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li>Gives you a little healthy shine.</li>
            <li>The price was cheaper than other sites and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product - it never lets me down!  </li>
            <li>All I need to do is massage a pea sized amount into my hair while wet, style as usual, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li>This product makes your hair very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>As someone w/ hair that is very curly &amp; frizzy on humid days, which are far too frequent in Raleigh, NC, this has been a real life-saver for me.  </li>
            <li>I normally purchase the Moroccan oil for my unruly hair.</li>
            <li>it takes few more days to go to the bauty parlor....</li>
            <li>It might cost a few more $</li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair that gets tangled easily</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my hair so soft without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job on my dry, course, frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The product does not weigh my hair down, and it makes my hair smell very nice (got quite a few complements about nice-smelling hair from people I hug).   </li>
            <li>I was in need of a new bottle of the oil</li>
            <li>This is my new go-to styling cream.</li>
            <li>It was in brand new condition, wrapped in plastic so the pump wouldn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>I ordered it through Amazon from a new company called Beyond Blush</li>
            <li>and I started noticing that I had some new growth I had at the crown of my head</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to contact seller to send me a new pump, but no way to do that.  </li>
            <li>IF anybody reads these from Amazon, I hope they would send me a new pump</li>
            <li>I recieved this product expecting to get a brand new bottle like from the salon but was dissapointed when that was not the case.</li>
            <li>She put a few spay of this on my hair and like magic my hair looked alive.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight but effective, I have thick curly and unruly hair and this tames it in soft wavy curls and no frizz.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t grease up or weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the hair very soft, shiny and lots of body.</li>
            <li>I ordered Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream and they sent me very old product and the label</li>
            <li>When I compared the list of ingredients I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>I use after my conditioner in the shower and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sitting here now with SOFT hair!  </li>
            <li>will leave your hair shine and soft!</li>
            <li>Her normal frizz ball hair was tamed and soft.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s exactly the same product.</li>
            <li>The smell is a little strong but fades after blow-drying your hair.</li>
            <li>It adds moisture and light control without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and it helps keep my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first day, whether I use it on wet hair before blow drying or on dry to smooth frizziness, my hair feels like it has a gunky residue on it.  </li>
            <li>Price was right on target for what I pay at hair dressers, however, had to pay a little more this time around due to shipping.</li>
            <li>Though I liked this product a lot, I&#x27;m not sure how essential the Moroccan Oil shampoo and their corresponding repair conditioner are.</li>
            <li>Both the cream and the oil offer less frizzies and flyaways and overall better grooming, styling, and manageability for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It actually works, unlike many unsuccessful products I have used previously.  </li>
            <li>, I almost feel like this was a half used bottle and something was added to make it seem like it was new and full.</li>
            <li>the price is great.don&#x27;t be afraid to spend a little more to get a good quality product.</li>
            <li>it would have made me a happy customer instead of an unhappy upset one.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, and was looking for a product that will eliminate frizz and add moisture to my hair, but at the same time leave my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I use it with a clear gel for hold.  </li>
            <li>Their products have a lovely, distinct smell, and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;spearmint bubble gum&amp;#34; (sorry).</li>
            <li>I still have some of my old stuff.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>Leaves hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>My friend who has naturally curly hair uses this product (i found it through her) and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I have the thickest and longest hair and it is naturally curly.</li>
            <li>and it makes it extremely soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>my hair because it&#x27;s too much of a nuisance and my hair is very fragile</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair SO soft.</li>
            <li>I bought this three years ago and am writing this review now to say it is the real thing because I recently purchased this one http://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Hydrating-Styling-Cream-16-9-Ounce/dp/B001AMMSMK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1438454258&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;moroccanoil+styling+cream that turned out to be counterfeit.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, wavy hair that is much curlier in some sections than others.</li>
            <li>I am also in doubt as to the authenticity, because the pump looks different than it does on the real bottles in the salons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would check the ingredient if you use mostly natural products since this does have chemical.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps for days, not greasy just natural</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Considerable savings over retail shops</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so manageable and has grown soooo much since using on regular basis</li>
            <li>The styling cream makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and ordered directly from MoroccanOil.com.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and this product defines my curls.</li>
            <li>I think this is an old bottle.</li>
            <li>SOFT AND MANAGEABLE THROUGH MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li>it make my hair soft fix..</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and shine.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle, helps to shape your hair to how you want it, appears thicker with much body.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looked warn and old, also one of the bar codes looked to be purposefully scratched off.</li>
            <li>I end up using more of this product for the same result and my hair is messy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>haha), to about the middle of my back and recently cut off almost 10&amp;#34;, to come up right around my collarbone.</li>
            <li>i have a dry to normal hair and it takes few more days to go to the salon.</li>
            <li>I just massage 2-3 squirts of Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream into wet hair right after showering (concentrating on the ends).</li>
            <li>This product makes my thick hair easy to manage and feel so soft!</li>
            <li>I was a user of Moroccan Oil for the last several years ever since it was first used in my hair by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>I have medium to thick hair and blow dry my hair most days straight</li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this product over the regular oil I usually get, but I&#x27;m not in love.  </li>
            <li>Made my dry hair look positively luxurious.</li>
            <li>highly recommend both this brand and specific product!</li>
            <li>This product is costly, but worth it, plus ill make my money back , with return clients, because they are so pleased with there hair.</li>
            <li>and it feels like my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li>At first, the substance in the new bottle appeared similar to the old product (I still had some left over), but after a few pumps of the cream, it became watery and I noticed that it was much lighter in color than the old one (from the salon).</li>
            <li>only need a little bit and it keeps hair smooth and sleek even on humid days.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;oh great, another expensive product that&#x27;s not really gonna work great.\\</li>
            <li>I am very upset that I paid $32 dollars for a 10 ounce bottle of Moroccan styling cream, and the bottle simply will not open.  </li>
            <li>that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Evidently, either Moroccanoil has changed the ingredients for this product, or only bootleg versions are currently available.  </li>
            <li>It curls well with tools such as an iron or rollers, isn&#x27;t limp, just wonderfully soft and full.  </li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week (only when I blow dry) and the 10.2-ounce bottle has lasted me more than six months.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and a little</li>
            <li>helps to keep my curly hair smooth but hard to detangle.</li>
            <li>Using just a little on wet hair each time you shampoo leaves hair soft, smooth, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it for frequent flat-iron and blow-dryer users like me.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, coarse, naturally curly, frizzy, colored hair.  </li>
            <li>It does NOTHING for my hair and barely has any Argon Oil at all.</li>
            <li>I gave her one last year and was surprised that she wanted it again this year.  </li>
            <li>I tried this at my daughter in law and found that it left my permed hair soft and</li>
            <li>it looks and feels the same, but the smell is completely off.</li>
            <li>Helps my natural hair especially humid days.</li>
            <li>I normally purchase this MoroccanOIl  product at a local salon, but decided to go with this this seller on Amazon since it was cheaper than buying it locally.</li>
            <li>Like most people I would just grab the straightening iron to get the frizz out, but in return making my problem worse.</li>
            <li>My hair was dull and as dry as hay after too many color treatments.</li>
            <li>This works great, less expensive than buying through a salon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply to wet or dry hair, (wet especially), and makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>I usually apply this product  right before I&#x27;m ready to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>i have a dry to normal hair....</li>
            <li>Then I normally air dry it</li>
            <li>I normally have dry hair.</li>
            <li>Contrary to some other comments I read, this is exactly the same product I have purchased in stores.</li>
            <li>No more frizz with the hot humid weather here in Houston Texas !</li>
            <li>you need very little - my hair tends to be very dry, so I use a bit more, but if you have normal hair you would want to use less.  </li>
            <li>This cuts down the frizz and makes my hair much softer and easier to style</li>
            <li>It allows me to wear my hair with a little more body than usual hair styling products.</li>
            <li>The bottle I ordered was more of a thin greasy texture instead of the thick creamy  texture you normally get with a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>I also put it along my hairline so that my new growth would dry flat.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the quality is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the quality is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>I was so desperate that I ignored the price tag, and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>First day after is about the same, but the second day my hear feels heavy.</li>
            <li>1 pump is enough to coat my hair which I let dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I can also control how tight the curls are by how much I scrunch my hair while still damp.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to all women who have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair prone to breakage and frizzing, and I was tired of always having hair that went frizzy</li>
            <li>Mine is healing from over processed thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Like Moroccan Oil, a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too  much at first.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Best deep conditioner for my curly hair</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> This product seems to contain more water than anything else.  </li>
            <li> This is not an authentic MoroccanOil product.  </li>
            <li> I still love Amazon, and will continue to purchase products from here.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the moroccan oil, so i thought i would give this a try.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it was recommended by my stylist and I love him for it.</li>
            <li> Also the smell is great and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it made my ends a bit more manageable</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;She was so excited and thrilled.</li>
            <li> This is a top seller because it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this great product for a long time and it seemed like a good idea to order it online to save money.  </li>
            <li> It is excellent to control the curls of my daughter&#x27;s hair and left it soft and with a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> First purchased at Saks, but the retail option is just as good.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good creme.  </li>
            <li> So far i have been able to use on all of my clients, with great results.</li>
            <li> There are many imitations, none as good as the real thing.</li>
            <li> And i was looking all over the place for it am the type of girl that likes to try different products and let me just say dis is the best product i have ever tried it make ur hair smooth with shine</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the smell much more than the oil (of which I was not a fan of the smell).  </li>
            <li> Product does what it offers to do &amp; smells great</li>
            <li> Use on wet hair for best results.</li>
            <li> so I have tried every product under the sun to make my hair healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan products to keep my hair smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> if I like it better than the oil, it might not be as light as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> This is a great, lightweight product that leaves hair soft, shiny and frizz-free.  </li>
            <li> Its lightweight, smells amazing and keeps my hair looking great (not oily) all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this light weight styling cream esp for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave your hair with this tremendous shine, manageability but also smells so good!!!  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; light weight leave in spray which has great reviews, but I love this product WAY more.  </li>
            <li> thing that impressed me with the Wen Cleansing Conditioner which this product doesn&#x27;t do, is allow me to get away with washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil, but I don&#x27;t get the original one because it&#x27;s strictly oil and can make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> .It seems to rinse off my hands easily instead of the scrubbing wash I tried to remove the oil.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buying it here is easy, and the price is on-point with buying it in a store or salon.</li>
            <li> It seems to hydrate and making de tangling easy and smells yum.</li>
            <li> It is a strong smell</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first to use it because I have very fine hair and most products make me look greasy.</li>
            <li> and it does smell great, but for the price and claim, I was expecting so much more than something that smells nice and makes my hair a little softer.    </li>
            <li> She has such beautiful hair and this is what she likes to use.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve ever bought after a trim because it helps with static tremendously!!</li>
            <li> With Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream I can wash my hair with ANY shampoo and conditioner and still get perfect hair (efficiently cuts down my monthly spending).  </li>
            <li> Use it from the ears down is best and this way your hair won&#x27;t turn out greasy.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fine and looks fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot</li>

            <li> Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream works for my fine curly hair to keep it from frizzing.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry ends, and super nice scent.</li>

            <li> Gives my hair a little shine and it smells great!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge product junkie and have tried everything from Neutrogena to Ms. Jesse for my 4c hair</li>
            <li> and there was a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of moisturizing without being too heavy and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> :) I have long and some what frizzy hair and it makes it look amazing!</li>
            <li> this is a great hair care product for daily use.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel smooth and silky when I use it</li>
            <li> My hair feels so moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s a 10), all serum or light oil mist based.</li>
            <li> The cream is luxurious and light.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth, and shiny but also adds consistency to the curl.</li>
            <li> It looks smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> It does a great job especially in the drying winter months.</li>
            <li> mix with the MorcoccanOil Light treatment.</li>
            <li> Hair is smooth and silky immediately after washing and applying the cream.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice to feel and styling much easier.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> I had to use heat to smooth it out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump in your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hair lotion to use everyday.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy and smooth again.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> The styling cream keeps moisture in hair but is light and not oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hairdresser put it on my hair and it smelled beautifully for a long time!</li>
            <li> The smell was not horrible but it just didnt smell right</li>
            <li> I first used this product at a friend&#x27;s house in a pinch and loved it so much I purchased it myself.  </li>
            <li> Smell is so unique.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of products!</li>
            <li> &quot; friendly.</li>
            <li> I love this product since the first time I tried.</li>
            <li> Its a fun way to start the day!</li>
            <li> Their deep conditioner is however one of the best professional products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Another great product used for my transition of going natural &amp; it has been very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy thick hair and this product makes my hair smooth and forms my waves perfectly!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft, smelling very nice and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> In the process of figuring out how to have this situation made right!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and boy, was she right!  </li>
            <li> It makes your hair super soft and keeps your hair looking healthy!  </li>
            <li> Every time I blow-dryed my hair, it would come out nice and straight and smooth, but within a couple of hours...not so much.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying ONE&#x27; N ONLY shampoo and Cndtr in Sallys same thing mOROCCANOIL sulfate free and all... awesome products!  </li>
            <li> Using this cream doesn&#x27;t really seem to make much more of a difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks good from one washing to the next washing.</li>
            <li> I will try any product once, but the good ones get a second purchase.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, I have very thick/coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product, since I use it my hair is very well protected for the continued use of blowers and heated hair rollers.</li>
            <li> A great deal of this product spilled outside of the container, making a large portion unusable.  </li>
            <li> I love this brand, I mistakenly ordered the Hydrating cream I wanted to order the Curl, however I was not disappointed it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Whoever invented this stuff is pure genius!!</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh with a touch of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> I work it mostly near the ends of my hair, which are the dryer areas, then gloss over the top  of my hair lightly to smooth fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such a great product.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK - I found out it has some chemicals in it that I don&#x27;t love (essentially liquid plastics)</li>
            <li> Product delivered quickly</li>
            <li> If the original seller told me thy didn&#x27;t have a replacement right away  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating and keeps the hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use on a regular basis, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this now:-)</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t help that I live in the most humid environment,</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my slightly curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well, easy to use,</li>
            <li> I really love Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream because it leaves my hair soft and manageable!  </li>
            <li> I was hooked after the first try!  </li>
            <li> Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Amazing product:) my hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I use it with the extra volume shampoo, conditioner, and hairspray  as well as the treatment oil and my hair has never been so healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> This cream is light and very hydrating without being greasy.</li>
            <li> really keeps it smooth</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, I really like it because it make my hair looks like smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the moroccan oil hair line, it really hydrates my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and has totally reformed my frizz.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen Hair Care Products and while I liked the result of the cleaning conditioner, I had a problem with a low level</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite hair products to use to detangle and keep my hair hydrated.</li>
            <li> :) This styling cream added softness, shine, definition, soft hold and most importantly, is the only thing that has ever taken my frizz away.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell (it reminds me of Comet Cleanser)</li>
            <li> Been using this since 2010 and love the way it leaves my natural hair as well as weaves...</li>
            <li> I thought MoroccanOil had more of a clear look???  </li>
            <li> It is worth it, get it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Only product I&#x27;ve found to be effective on my type hair.</li>
            <li> With just a couple of squirts of this magic stuff my attitude has completely changed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how or why this product is worth $32.00.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it...</li>
            <li> Packaged well, seems fresh and creamy as it should be and not watery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this product is brilliant.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> that was a nice combination, but not enough to where i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get tired of the delicious smell of this styling cream.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I ordered the Moroccan hair oil and the product came on time( right before Christmas)  and as described.  </li>
            <li> The comb slides right through without tangles.</li>
            <li> I ordered it from this seller and it came very quickly and brand new, unopened.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks more healthy, less hassle</li>
            <li> My hair is much stronger and brighter ... recommend the use of the full range ...</li>
            <li> I use this product all the time, don&#x27;t let this seller fool you, first of all it didn&#x27;t came in a box the real product comes in an original box and</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly, frizzy hair and this stuff tames it nicely.  </li>
            <li> The MoroccanOil has finally tamed it so that my hair looks beautifully styled all day long.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny for soft frizz free hair all the time.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> I go through it quickly, but I absolutely swear by it,</li>
            <li> Cream is excellent and worth every penny but the supplier I used sent the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I quickly came to Amazon and found it much cheaper than at the salon and ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hydration cream on the market for people with thin hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair is more rebellious without the cream and with it helps to tame it a bit better.</li>
            <li> Not only does it feel conditioned, it also feels thicker and fuller with a very smooth volume.  </li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> This has made me forget all about my last favorite-this is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> that gunk is worth $50/pound, but as usual, Amazon has a good price, and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere cheaper.  </li>
            <li> You can always apply a bit more after you are done blow drying,  if you need extra control.  </li>
            <li> But, SiL said the cream was better and used it in my hair the last time she cut it.  </li>
            <li> First product review I&#x27;ve ever written, but had to comment on this product.</li>
            <li> This cream gave it back its shine and makes it feel smooth, natural and healthy.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> but if I were my friend I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d give it a 4 or even a 5 possibly...</li>
            <li> Try Macadamian Oil, Nexxus, or Mixed Chicks Products for a better quality leave-in cream.</li>
            <li> Never fails.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much and will order again soon!</li>
            <li> A friend bought me my first bottle from a beauty supply store, the type of store that you need a  beautican license to even get in the door.</li>
            <li> I have thin/wavy hair, pretty oily and it frizzes</li>
            <li> Sure the bottle was the same</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products</li>
            <li> One pump of this fabulous product and my hair is left soft, smooth, conditioned, and full of body, with a glorious scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioner any more short hair and highlighted and also colored 1 pump</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works ok, not the same product that I buy in the salon.</li>
            <li> Funny how that works.</li>
            <li> A girl friend bought my first bottle and I have thanked her time and time again.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this in Las Vegas in a shop downstairs of the Bellagio because I had forgotten to pack any hair products.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try it because of all the great reviews, but quite honestly not worth anywhere near the $$$.</li>
            <li> I was sure I had selected the Oil and obviously not...</li>
            <li> It styles ok the first day of use, but the second day hair gets funky, like gooey.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my hair after having radiation and it was excellent in restoring my hair.you only need to use a small amount each time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this when they first stared carrying it in the salon</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and frizz free for days.</li>
            <li> just so you guys know this is my first time writing a review</li>
            <li> Much better than paying salon prices for something you can only purchase in the salon.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by a friend with very curly hair but worked on my wavy hair too!</li>
            <li> Thanks for asking me!</li>
            <li> Great hair product for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I first heard of the product from my hairdresser</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m not in love.  </li>
            <li> but first I mix it with the Moroccan oil hair treatment to protect, moisturize and speed up drying time for my hair.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t use this product without adding an oil when my hair dries, which basically means it&#x27;s not adding any benefit other than that amazing</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream is normally an orange color, what I received was a light peach/cream colored product - it looked as though they blended the actual product with some cheap lotion.    </li>
            <li> It made my blow dried hair soft, manageable and shiny and it smelled great too which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> We use this on my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair and keeps them soft and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I love my long hair and I am willing to buy the products to take care of it.  </li>
            <li> it treats my dead ends really well,  plus, it smells really really good.</li>
            <li> soft hair that is smooth to the touch and very \\&quot;hair-playing\\</li>
            <li> It is soft, manageable, and doesn&#x27;t look damaged at all since I do use a blow dryer and flat iron on top of everything else!</li>
            <li> oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow</li>
            <li> I used more than the bottle instructed-- a full pump and a half and spread it throughout my hair taking care to get the ends.</li>
            <li> this product is definitly worth the 10 more i would have payed if i bought at a professional in person salon, which is the only way you should buy it or any Moroccan oil products to avoid knock offs.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re doing the math right now to see how old I am, right?</li>
            <li> I am a high volume platinum blonde, so this works wonders for people with greater than 7 levels of lift.</li>
            <li> It was the first time that I could ever wrap my hair after washing my hair myself    If you&#x27;re hair issues sound similar to mine</li>
            <li> I use it more as a leave in conditioner, when I blow dry and straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> BTW, I used it both on dry hair and on damp hair - it works either way, but slightly better with damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I found when I used it, I could easily recreate the same style from the salon.   </li>
            <li> As mentioned above, I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I even tried to add pure Moroccan oil to it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wanna live without it anymore!!</li>
            <li> I live in the desert and this is the only hair product the gets out static.</li>
            <li> It worked really well, so I scored a jug on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend for any hair type!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will get a greasy look if you apply too much product to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> I had heard much about these products and decided to test.</li>
            <li> and this product really helps style and hydrate my hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this on Amazon, but having tried it out, it&#x27;s the real deal (bought from BeautyWorld, 7/2013).</li>
            <li> Works wonders and I highly recommend you try it out!</li>
            <li> However, if you have straight hair and you want to curl it</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> thanks, that&#x27;s a creme -</li>
            <li> Whatever the concoction they&#x27;ve sent is, the product absolutely does not work like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> But very pricey.</li>
            <li> The price was much lower than if I had bought it anywhere in Connecticut.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Smells really good&lt;br /&gt;Helps with some of the frizziness, but not all of it.</li>
            <li> It is NOT the real Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> makes hair very manage when blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have curly/frizzy hair, and this product really helps keep it at bay.</li>
            <li> My hair is manageable thanks to the products I purchased.</li>
            <li> now, I am doubting as to whether this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Very upsetting.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very curly.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the efficiency and honesty.</li>
            <li> It has really help my hair.  </li>
            <li> The product I was shipped was not the real Moroccan Oil product.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to go along with those who said it may not be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> Purchased from amazon.com (not another seller on amazon), so it&#x27;s the actual product and not some cheap stuff in the moroccanoil bottle.</li>
            <li> SO I can&#x27;t really say</li>
            <li> It was very over priced for what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it&#x27;s the Moroccan OIL that really does the trick with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, you can get Argon Oil for much cheaper at Target, which I would recommend - it works just as well as this brand.</li>
            <li> This really wakes it up and controls the curl.  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion, thanks</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real Moroccan oil.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and just buy the real product at the salon or from the Moroccan oil website.</li>
            <li> Works well for whether I want curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I use this product along with Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream.  </li>
            <li> They work very well together.</li>
            <li> It seems to really help protect the hair from styling heat damage and it really smooths my hair.</li>
            <li> Watch how much you use to avoid an overly greasy look.</li>
            <li> and it was just too much.</li>
            <li> dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure.</li>
            <li> I dont really use the product it gave a really shiny look</li>
            <li> I feel like it has really protected my hair from the heat of the blow dryer, straightener, and curling iron.</li>
            <li> I must have put too much on because it made my hair look oily.  </li>
            <li> It is kind of heavy</li>
            <li> It smells good and keeps hair soft when I rub it on a few times a week.</li>
            <li> All in all, it makes it super easy to achieve the messy, rolled-out-of-bed look</li>
            <li> My hair is actually silky,.something that no other product has been able to achieve.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend buying this product (and any other quality hair/skin product) from a SALON, even if it means you have to pay more.</li>
            <li> This product re hydrates and moisturises the hair better than other products I have used.  </li>
            <li> Love the other Moroccan products also.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different hair products over the years to combat the frizziness that inevitably befalls those of us w/ curly hair, but this is the first one I can say really makes a significant difference AND is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, apply before blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, below shoulder length hair that I blow dry straight.</li>
            <li> Mine is fine, but thick, and can easily be damaged.  </li>
            <li> This styling cream is very light and does not weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> this type of brand normally has a certain smell and helps hair, but this was bought online and is a knockoff, smells to chemically.</li>
            <li> I also use moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner, I think all three work really well together and highly recommend them all.</li>
            <li> When I got in mail it was not in a box but a Fedex envelope with tape on the top holding the squirt handle down</li>
            <li> I have very fine, fly-away hair, and even though it&#x27;s long the MN winters leave my hair full of static and difficult to manage.  </li>
            <li> in fact, I&#x27;m smelling my hair right now and can barely tell.</li>
            <li> in fact, I&#x27;m smelling my hair right now and can barely tell.</li>
            <li> The product I received barely had a fragrance and just didn&#x27;t look right.  </li>
            <li> You get more product for less price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My curls are more defines and less frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and slightly shinier when I use this hydrating cream.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, since I found such success with this product, I am going to try the intense hydrating mask and the restorative hair mask.     </li>
            <li> The particular types of silicone are known to cause cancer when looked up on line.</li>
            <li> all time classic.</li>
            <li> This worked like magic especially now that it is short, goes to my neck.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, makes my hair so soft, and helps me maintain my smooth style after I flat iron.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy, but the waves have been pure frizz with all of the damage &amp; gray.</li>
            <li> My hair is in-between curly and wavy but is very dry that it needs something to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> Soft!!  </li>
            <li> Some people have said the smell is a little &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li> Some people have said the smell is a little &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;, but I personally love it.</li>
            <li> Gives you a little healthy shine.</li>
            <li> The price was cheaper than other sites and it was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product - it never lets me down!  </li>
            <li> All I need to do is massage a pea sized amount into my hair while wet, style as usual, and it looks great.  </li>
            <li> This product makes your hair very shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> As someone w/ hair that is very curly &amp; frizzy on humid days, which are far too frequent in Raleigh, NC, this has been a real life-saver for me.  </li>
            <li> I normally purchase the Moroccan oil for my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> it takes few more days to go to the bauty parlor....</li>
            <li> It might cost a few more $</li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair that gets tangled easily</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair so soft without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job on my dry, course, frizzy, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The product does not weigh my hair down, and it makes my hair smell very nice (got quite a few complements about nice-smelling hair from people I hug).   </li>
            <li> I was in need of a new bottle of the oil</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to styling cream.</li>
            <li> It was in brand new condition, wrapped in plastic so the pump wouldn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> I ordered it through Amazon from a new company called Beyond Blush</li>
            <li> and I started noticing that I had some new growth I had at the crown of my head</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to contact seller to send me a new pump, but no way to do that.  </li>
            <li> IF anybody reads these from Amazon, I hope they would send me a new pump</li>
            <li> I recieved this product expecting to get a brand new bottle like from the salon but was dissapointed when that was not the case.</li>
            <li> She put a few spay of this on my hair and like magic my hair looked alive.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight but effective, I have thick curly and unruly hair and this tames it in soft wavy curls and no frizz.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t grease up or weigh down my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the hair very soft, shiny and lots of body.</li>
            <li> I ordered Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream and they sent me very old product and the label</li>
            <li> When I compared the list of ingredients I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> I use after my conditioner in the shower and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sitting here now with SOFT hair!  </li>
            <li> will leave your hair shine and soft!</li>
            <li> Her normal frizz ball hair was tamed and soft.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little strong but fades after blow-drying your hair.</li>
            <li> It adds moisture and light control without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and it helps keep my hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first day, whether I use it on wet hair before blow drying or on dry to smooth frizziness, my hair feels like it has a gunky residue on it.  </li>
            <li> Price was right on target for what I pay at hair dressers, however, had to pay a little more this time around due to shipping.</li>
            <li> Though I liked this product a lot, I&#x27;m not sure how essential the Moroccan Oil shampoo and their corresponding repair conditioner are.</li>
            <li> Both the cream and the oil offer less frizzies and flyaways and overall better grooming, styling, and manageability for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It actually works, unlike many unsuccessful products I have used previously.  </li>
            <li> , I almost feel like this was a half used bottle and something was added to make it seem like it was new and full.</li>
            <li> the price is great.don&#x27;t be afraid to spend a little more to get a good quality product.</li>
            <li> it would have made me a happy customer instead of an unhappy upset one.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, and was looking for a product that will eliminate frizz and add moisture to my hair, but at the same time leave my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I use it with a clear gel for hold.  </li>
            <li> Their products have a lovely, distinct smell, and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;spearmint bubble gum&amp;#34; (sorry).</li>
            <li> I still have some of my old stuff.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> Leaves hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair soft and managable.  </li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> My friend who has naturally curly hair uses this product (i found it through her) and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I have the thickest and longest hair and it is naturally curly.</li>
            <li> and it makes it extremely soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> my hair because it&#x27;s too much of a nuisance and my hair is very fragile</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair SO soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this three years ago and am writing this review now to say it is the real thing because I recently purchased this one http://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Hydrating-Styling-Cream-16-9-Ounce/dp/B001AMMSMK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1438454258&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;moroccanoil+styling+cream that turned out to be counterfeit.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy hair that is much curlier in some sections than others.</li>
            <li> I am also in doubt as to the authenticity, because the pump looks different than it does on the real bottles in the salons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would check the ingredient if you use mostly natural products since this does have chemical.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps for days, not greasy just natural</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Considerable savings over retail shops</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so manageable and has grown soooo much since using on regular basis</li>
            <li> The styling cream makes your hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered directly from MoroccanOil.com.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and this product defines my curls.</li>
            <li> I think this is an old bottle.</li>
            <li> SOFT AND MANAGEABLE THROUGH MY HAIR.  </li>
            <li> it make my hair soft fix..</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and shine.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, helps to shape your hair to how you want it, appears thicker with much body.  </li>
            <li> The bottle looked warn and old, also one of the bar codes looked to be purposefully scratched off.</li>
            <li> I end up using more of this product for the same result and my hair is messy at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> haha), to about the middle of my back and recently cut off almost 10&amp;#34;, to come up right around my collarbone.</li>
            <li> i have a dry to normal hair and it takes few more days to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> I just massage 2-3 squirts of Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream into wet hair right after showering (concentrating on the ends).</li>
            <li> This product makes my thick hair easy to manage and feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I was a user of Moroccan Oil for the last several years ever since it was first used in my hair by my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair and blow dry my hair most days straight</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this product over the regular oil I usually get, but I&#x27;m not in love.  </li>
            <li> Made my dry hair look positively luxurious.</li>
            <li> highly recommend both this brand and specific product!</li>
            <li> This product is costly, but worth it, plus ill make my money back , with return clients, because they are so pleased with there hair.</li>
            <li> and it feels like my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li> At first, the substance in the new bottle appeared similar to the old product (I still had some left over), but after a few pumps of the cream, it became watery and I noticed that it was much lighter in color than the old one (from the salon).</li>
            <li> only need a little bit and it keeps hair smooth and sleek even on humid days.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;oh great, another expensive product that&#x27;s not really gonna work great.\\</li>
            <li> I am very upset that I paid $32 dollars for a 10 ounce bottle of Moroccan styling cream, and the bottle simply will not open.  </li>
            <li> that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Evidently, either Moroccanoil has changed the ingredients for this product, or only bootleg versions are currently available.  </li>
            <li> It curls well with tools such as an iron or rollers, isn&#x27;t limp, just wonderfully soft and full.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week (only when I blow dry) and the 10.2-ounce bottle has lasted me more than six months.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and a little</li>
            <li> helps to keep my curly hair smooth but hard to detangle.</li>
            <li> Using just a little on wet hair each time you shampoo leaves hair soft, smooth, shiny and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for frequent flat-iron and blow-dryer users like me.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, coarse, naturally curly, frizzy, colored hair.  </li>
            <li> It does NOTHING for my hair and barely has any Argon Oil at all.</li>
            <li> I gave her one last year and was surprised that she wanted it again this year.  </li>
            <li> I tried this at my daughter in law and found that it left my permed hair soft and</li>
            <li> it looks and feels the same, but the smell is completely off.</li>
            <li> Helps my natural hair especially humid days.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this MoroccanOIl  product at a local salon, but decided to go with this this seller on Amazon since it was cheaper than buying it locally.</li>
            <li> Like most people I would just grab the straightening iron to get the frizz out, but in return making my problem worse.</li>
            <li> My hair was dull and as dry as hay after too many color treatments.</li>
            <li> This works great, less expensive than buying through a salon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply to wet or dry hair, (wet especially), and makes my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply this product  right before I&#x27;m ready to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> i have a dry to normal hair....</li>
            <li> Then I normally air dry it</li>
            <li> I normally have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Contrary to some other comments I read, this is exactly the same product I have purchased in stores.</li>
            <li> No more frizz with the hot humid weather here in Houston Texas !</li>
            <li> you need very little - my hair tends to be very dry, so I use a bit more, but if you have normal hair you would want to use less.  </li>
            <li> This cuts down the frizz and makes my hair much softer and easier to style</li>
            <li> It allows me to wear my hair with a little more body than usual hair styling products.</li>
            <li> The bottle I ordered was more of a thin greasy texture instead of the thick creamy  texture you normally get with a brand new bottle.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> I also put it along my hairline so that my new growth would dry flat.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the quality is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the quality is worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> I was so desperate that I ignored the price tag, and boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> First day after is about the same, but the second day my hear feels heavy.</li>
            <li> 1 pump is enough to coat my hair which I let dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I can also control how tight the curls are by how much I scrunch my hair while still damp.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to all women who have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair prone to breakage and frizzing, and I was tired of always having hair that went frizzy</li>
            <li> Mine is healing from over processed thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Like Moroccan Oil, a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too  much at first.</li>
            <li> It makes styling my often unruly hair easy, without weighing it down, leaving it sticky or leaving it hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the product was not sealed properly, and had been taped closed with what looked like scotch tape, I opened the product to find that it had a really strange (and really disgusting) &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell, and the product was more pinkish looking than the true product.</li>
            <li> I always purchase this through Amazon as the only other places that I&#x27;ve seen the complete line is in salons.</li>
            <li> Together they tame frizzies without too much build-up.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall is that it&#x27;s a little pricey, but its so worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> This really changed my hair - conditioned dry color treated hair and makes much less frizzy.</li>
            <li> A hair stylist told me the only thing that would work for me was a flat iron</li>
            <li> The price is a little high</li>
            <li> You only have to use a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and have very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it may not have been the same product, but the smell is not as strong and it goes away after a while.</li>
            <li> But this store is very overpriced, especially since other stores charge half what this store does.</li>
            <li> Wrapping usually creates too much stress for my hair</li>
            <li> I wanted a change and basically needed to let my hair recover from the years of blow-drying and flat ironing.</li>
            <li> It will not make your hair flat.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts a long time as only one pump is needed each time before you blow-dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat.  </li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft, silky and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>
            <li> have only tried it once so far, but I will continue to use it a little longer and see if my opinion changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only use this if you want to break out like a teenager - love the idea and marketing but - awful for my chemistry - tested it with friends to same result - all of us excited to try but every single one of us had hairline and/or bangs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially helpful to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> and it was dry and coarse afterward</li>
            <li> It smells terrific and helps with blow dry styling.  </li>
            <li> It is also b/ my hair feels coarse and its texture fools hair stylists into thinking that they can be rough with it when in fact it is very fragile.</li>
            <li> Last night after my hair was long dry</li>
            <li> Plus, that bottle will last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> Plus, that bottle will last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> This item is the only one I have ever purchased that truly restores moisture to very dry over processed hair.</li>
            <li> This product lets me blow dry or air dry, and gives me the smoothest, shiniest hair I&#x27;ve ever had outside the salon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry or flat iron</li>
            <li> South Florida!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had long hair for the past 18yrs (since my senior year of high school...</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointing cosmetic/hair product purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair with grays here &amp; there.</li>
            <li> I encountered breakage (minimal) only when I was combing the conditioner through my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought the hydrating styling cream from my hairstylist a long time ago, and it lasted me for about a year.</li>
            <li> I asked her how long the 10.2oz bottle lasts her.</li>
            <li> I asked her how long the 10.2oz bottle lasts her.</li>
            <li> goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> to long).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works with long hair.</li>
            <li> However, since I began swimming daily for exercise I was getting pretty tired of gunky hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that I can style either curly or straight.  </li>
            <li> My hair is SO much healthier and this is one of the few products that conditions but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair is soft, shiny, and much less frizzy!  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t stiff but rather really soft.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair (about 6 pumps since my hair is long), I let it air dry, then scrunch &amp; spray it.</li>
            <li> I also recommend this product to straighten hair or tame wild hair.  </li>
            <li> but it goes a long way and does the trick !</li>
            <li> IS THERE OTHER COLORS THAN WHITE.</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, and I feel like this product left my hair looking messier when I was done than other products (Redken Curvaceous Curls Styling Cream, Oribe Creme</li>
            <li> It used to take a very long time to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Note: my natural hair consists of very tight curls if that helps you with your purchase decision.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps my hair calm and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really dry and breaks a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done this before and ended up with brittle dry hair</li>
            <li> I use this before I dry and style my hair</li>
            <li> I use it before I blow dry--</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my hair and to help style it as I dry it.  </li>
            <li> Moroccan oil Hydrating Styling cream has solved my problem of tangled, dry hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with dry or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair..</li>
            <li> I also use the oil after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product to use in my dry hair until now.  </li>
            <li> and I even use it on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this product after every shampoo before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need to dry it.</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry</li>
            <li> Of course, hair done by the stylist does not always look the same a few days later.  </li>
            <li> I have curly, very curly, thin but coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to waste time returning, but see no other option.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and combing it out after even using a conditioner I spent a lot of time swearing and threatening to chop it all off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with every hair wash, and am actually noticing my hair become less dry.</li>
            <li> It is finally half way down my back and is in constant need of repair.  </li>
            <li> I definitely feel like my hair is smoother and less frizzy when I use this.  </li>
            <li> : the instructions say that you can use the product on wet and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Can use it wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Can be used on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> Item arrived damaged, seller said they would send replacement but after waiting almost 3 weeks and 4 emails later they finally told me they had no more</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds crazy because it&#x27;s just hair roduct, but after struggling for years, wasting hundreds of dollars, to find that one thing that makes you feel so much better about your physical appearance, you get a little giddy and want to tell the world about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER use anything else!</li>

            <li> My daughter has a very dry, itchy scalp and this hair cream works so well on it.</li>
            <li> (she&#x27;s not one of their retailers) for my VERY dry ends.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair, and this cream made it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from salons and when I received this through the mail it seemed as though it was a fake product, smelled different and it was watery and didn&#x27;t do anything but make my fair hard to brush, also when it arrived the pump was broken</li>
            <li> It does not smooth and soften my wavy thick hair very well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product especially because it is not cheap..</li>
            <li> I like to use this product while the hair is still wet, before drying and styling.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> so I need to be careful when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Just a pump and work thru wet hair.  </li>
            <li> My sister-in-law tried in when she spent the night and could not believe the difference.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to put it on too close to the roots.</li>
            <li> Of course, it can be used as a styling tool in wet hair</li>
            <li> I use this product after washing my hair and apply it when it is still wet.</li>
            <li> I put about a teaspoonful of it on my wet hair after shampooing it and just give it the shape i want</li>
            <li> that I don&#x27;t wake up the next day feeling sticky and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, so I can still go a few days on a blow out.  </li>
            <li> This product moisturizes without greasiness and makes styling much easier with no fly away ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a hair product person.</li>
            <li> They refused to return the item when I complained but once I emailed them and explained I was going to report them to Amazon for selling fake goods as well as reporting them to the Moroccan oil company as well  - they gladly refunded my money.</li>
            <li> And I only used a very small amount, so I&#x27;d say this product will last me a very long time!  </li>
            <li> If you live in an area with cold winters, hot humid or dry summers and you have thin, blond hair that is susceptible to damage - this product is definitely for you.   </li>
            <li> It is a lot less dry now too.  </li>
            <li> Just a little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And, a little seems to go a long way</li>
            <li> Use sparingly as little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Frizz was my major complaint and anti-frizz products</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of this styling cream goes a long way, but it will not leave you hair feeling clumpy.</li>
            <li> my hair is controllable all day long without getting greasy and weighed down!  </li>
            <li> No amount of product or flat ironing would keep those little buggers down.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try some of there other products</li>
            <li> I used only a small amount on my medium-length hair, and it looks so greasy you would think it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a week.</li>
            <li> I tried it on one side of my hair and found that the other side without it was lighter and bouncier after styling.</li>
            <li> I have used other products but this beats them all.  </li>
            <li> I thought she would say maybe a few months, as she has really long hair...</li>
            <li> I thought she would say maybe a few months, as she has really long hair...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave sticky or smelly residue like other products.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> As soon as I ran out, I tried to replace it with other products, but none of them compared, even my argan oil hair serums.</li>
            <li> One of the other reviewers said she uses it for both, so I ordered the product.  </li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this for my granddaughter who has extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair became extreme frizzy.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I knew I received something other than what I had ordered.</li>
            <li> When it is dry I may use a little Moroccan oil to freshen it up.</li>
            <li> but I find just a little bit in my hair when it is dry</li>
            <li> (i have blonde hair down to just past my bra strap and that was using an amount about the size of a pea).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap, but a single bottle lasts months.</li>
            <li> Just a small amount (dime sized or less) is all that&#x27;s necessary.  </li>
            <li> I use one pump on my wet hair (medium length, layered just past my shoulders) and blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> I distribute a small amount evenly through my wet hair before I dry it, and it helps my hair to lay nicer and feel softer.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, long hair and this product helps hydrate my hair.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have which is user error...</li>
            <li> Then I put a satin scarf around my hairline like a thick headband and pinned up the back of my hair and headed to the library</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, dry hair; one pump of this tames it until the next washing.  </li>
            <li> She also told me that this product would weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair and this product does not way it down.</li>
            <li> and I find that the cream does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> The styling cream works even in the summer humidity and does not weigh my hair down or make it oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> have cut my time down by 1/2 using this product.</li>
            <li> Creamy, not greasy, and does not weigh the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Rather alone or combined with other MoroccanOil products, is almost a miracle in a bottle!  </li>
            <li> Add a little to finish off the ends and feed your hair to make up for the other things done to damage your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying their other products today!</li>
            <li> I have fine/medium/wavy/color treated hair past my shoulders that I prefer to air dry.</li>
            <li> Doesnt take alot, less than a dime size.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I typically go and get a $10 wash and wrap every week rather than try to wash it myself.</li>
            <li> I could care less claryfing shampoo once a month</li>
            <li> and it helps define the curl and have less frizz.</li>
            <li> She had this serious look on her face, enough to make me slightly scared to say no, so I held out my hand.</li>
            <li> I used about a half bottle of this stying cream, and I don&#x27;t see where it hydrated my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick, frizzy hair and get a professional Keratin treatment at least once a year.  </li>
            <li> The cost is half the retail price</li>
            <li> I have long thick colored hair</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> However, I was still having trouble getting my hair to lie down after a shower.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> You will only need to pump out a small drop, depending on how thick your hair is.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a little over a year instead of gel because it gives my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing mine away - it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning!  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> You just need a little, a pump or two per use for below shoulder length.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off on this product coming out of the container.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s wavy on a good day, impossibly frizzy on a bad day, and very dry.  </li>
            <li> The product did arrive leaking all over the box- not very pleased with the shipping and packaging.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product I received was clearly tampered with.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews and people being unhappy with the product, I still went ahead and decided to give it a try, just maybe it would work differently for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fairly thin, so it tends to frizz, especially in humidity.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I have been growing it out for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I remember I blow dried my hair once</li>
            <li> After washing my hair I put a few &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34; in my hand and pull through my hair.</li>
            <li> The oils felt messy and greasy to me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> I have colored blond hair, that is thin, fragile, etc.</li>
            <li> I start my hair route with this produce everyday.</li>
            <li> it help a lot with the blow dryer not leaving your hair dried.</li>
            <li> This worked well on my hair, but the smell, while not at all heavy, just did not sit well with me and gave me a headache.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and the few months I went without</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moraccanoil Hydrating styling Cream for a few years.</li>
            <li> Usually creams weigh it down, but this did not.</li>
            <li> I became addicted to hair spray because of this, and even then it would keep them tame for only an hour or so.</li>
            <li> made my hair VERY heavy, and weighed it down quite a bit</li>
            <li> This was to be a Christmas present so at the last minute, 1 week before Christmas, I was on a mad dash to find a replacement from another seller or store to have for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Holds curl and style without being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of products and none work as well as this to tame frizz and help curls like this.  </li>
            <li> It helps tame the frizzies</li>
            <li> I get all the benefits of the oil without the mess!  </li>
            <li> The inside of the box was a mess!</li>
            <li> At least you are getting what you paid for and not some watered down version of it that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I am Black and have have had serious trouble getting my relaxed hair to grow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all...</li>
            <li> I have med thick curly hair that I straighten  everyday.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was my mistake or if I was somehow tricked...</li>
            <li> I switched from the oil to this cream, but I am not sure yet</li>
            <li> have used it faithfully for past two years.</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me two or three months.</li>
            <li> In any case, being burned twice is my limit and I will make no more attempts to purchase Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream--from ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Just a small patch is all you need.</li>
            <li> but I wash my hair every other day and have not experienced it.</li>
            <li> It may seem expensive, but one bottle of this stuff lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Hard to find so</li>
            <li> at least I guess that&#x27;s what they were attempting.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, course and curly</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not very happy about that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But no more!</li>
            <li> I have thrown money down the drain for years, buying one expensive product after another.  </li>
            <li> For me, this was an expensive purchase with little to no results.</li>
            <li> not good.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed as I was really looking forward to trying this.</li>
            <li> Its hard to believe i paid $34 for a fake product.</li>
            <li> I tired this per the recommendation of my sister in law who has cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, and I have thin wavy hair, and a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair &amp; I was immediately addicted to the scent.  </li>
            <li> and I have always struggled with finding a product that doesn&#x27;t make any one of those traits worse.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to give hold and body to my thin hair ant</li>
            <li> Since it seemed to be packed well, I think it was actually broken before.</li>
            <li> Package was poorly made.</li>
            <li> I may use a somewhat heavier amount (still less than MoroccanOil) but it will hold my hair for 2-3 days without it looking too bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when it arrived,  the pump mechanism was broken and unusable.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to discover that silicone is used as the leading ingredient in this entire line of products.  </li>
            <li> SO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> She was SO wrong.</li>
            <li> realizing I&#x27;m getting 2 products in one makes it seem not so expensive.</li>
            <li> But since they&#x27;re not leave-in, they&#x27;ve proven to be useless.</li>
            <li> FAKE PRODUCT&lt;br</li>
            <li> how can i go wrong.</li>
            <li> &quot; Oh was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and it was a fake product.</li>
            <li> AND THE QUALITY IS VERY POOR.</li>
            <li> Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> So needless to say I was disappointed and unhappy with this seller.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and Conditioner are way too expensive ! ...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Moroccan product!  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
            <li> Too bad this is still being sold like this.</li>
            <li> but I am disappointed in the quality .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got this.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have hair that curls and frizzes at the slightest humidity, and this cream helps resist that annoying tendency.</li>
            <li> (I hate when products smell terrible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he also hated listening to my language while combing out the snarls.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m also very disappointed and now I&#x27;m stuck with a product that I&#x27;m not going to use.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this product its totally fake!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful -</li>
            <li> (yeah, the evil trifecta!)</li>
            <li> it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> it is Fake !!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Arrived fast&lt;br /&gt;Pkg well&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product</li>
            <li> My bride just got a tiny amount of this from her beauty goddess or whatever they call themselves.  It worked really well, so I scored a jug on Amazon.  Look, this stuff is like $30 - so I&#x27;m calling BS that gunk is worth $50/pound, but as usual, Amazon has a good price, and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere cheaper.  The beauty salon was another $10.</li>
            <li> Just a little of this product goes a long way. I use it with the extra volume shampoo, conditioner, and hairspray  as well as the treatment oil and my hair has never been so healthy and strong. Plus the scent is great aromatherapy!!</li>
            <li> I use this every day! Great smell . It really leaves my hair feeling soft and healthy! Great for color treated hair!</li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from salons and when I received this through the mail it seemed as though it was a fake product, smelled different and it was watery and didn&#x27;t do anything but make my fair hard to brush, also when it arrived the pump was broken so all in all I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product especially because it is not cheap..</li>
            <li> Shipped fine and looks fine. Haven&#x27;t needed to open it as of yet. I still have some of my old stuff. Doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll be of any problem though.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for use in my salon. So far i have been able to use on all of my clients, with great results. I like to use this product while the hair is still wet, before drying and styling. Leaves the hair very soft, shiny and lots of body. Not to mention how it hydrates the hair. Doesnt take alot, less than a dime size. This product is costly, but worth it, plus ill make my money back , with return clients, because they are so pleased with there hair. I cant wait to try some of there other products</li>
            <li> Helps maintain a healthy head of hair.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil has wonderful hair products and this styling cream makes your hair soft and manageable.  But this store is very overpriced, especially since other stores charge half what this store does. Shop around.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  My daughter used it recently when she came to visit and now she is a fan as well.  It adds moisture and light control without weighing down my hair.  I definitely feel like my hair is smoother and less frizzy when I use this.  I have naturally curly hair.  A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> only use this if you want to break out like a teenager - love the idea and marketing but - awful for my chemistry - tested it with friends to same result - all of us excited to try but every single one of us had hairline and/or bangs and/or wherever our hair hit our skin breakouts</li>
            <li> I normally purchase the Moroccan oil for my unruly hair. I decided to try this product because it is cheaper, and is 10oz, as opposed to 3 for the oil. This cream is easier to manage, it has a pump, and it seems to work just as well. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Rather alone or combined with other MoroccanOil products, is almost a miracle in a bottle!  I don&#x27;t wanna live without it anymore!!</li>
            <li> This is the best styling creme I&#x27;ve ever used. I have been using the Moroccan Oil for over a year and love it! I saw the creme and had to try it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I really love Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream because it leaves my hair soft and manageable!  My hair is fairly thin, so it tends to frizz, especially in humidity.  I usually apply this product  right before I&#x27;m ready to blow dry my hair. Like Moroccan Oil, a little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t use too  much at first. You will only need to pump out a small drop, depending on how thick your hair is.    I work it mostly near the ends of my hair, which are the dryer areas, then gloss over the top  of my hair lightly to smooth fly-aways. You can always apply a bit more after you are done blow drying,  if you need extra control.  Works great for me!</li>
            <li> I tired this per the recommendation of my sister in law who has cut my hair.  I was a user of Moroccan Oil for the last several years ever since it was first used in my hair by my hairdresser.  I loved the oil.  But, SiL said the cream was better and used it in my hair the last time she cut it.  I was in need of a new bottle of the oil so I decided to try the cream instead.  I was hooked after the first try!  I love the texture/consistency and that it doesn&#x27;t coat my hands during application the way the oil did. . .It seems to rinse off my hands easily instead of the scrubbing wash I tried to remove the oil.  I get all the benefits of the oil without the mess!  I also enjoy the smell much more than the oil (of which I was not a fan of the smell).  And, a little seems to go a long way and I could tell - I probably always used more of the oil than I needed to because it was difficult to distribute throughout the hair but the cream solves this.  MorroccanOil Cream is amazing!  Both the cream and the oil offer less frizzies and flyaways and overall better grooming, styling, and manageability for my hair.  Also, it is very light so it doesn&#x27;t grease up or weigh down my fine hair.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Really keeps my ends looking great.  Love the smell and feel of the product.  I will definitely order again in the future&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> My stylist uses this on my hair &amp; I love how it makes my hair feel.  I couldn&#x27;t beat this price!!!  Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST stuff I have ever used on my hair. You only have to use a tiny bit, so it lasts a long time. My hair is SO much healthier and this is one of the few products that conditions but doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This is my new go-to styling cream. I have naturally straight hair, and was looking for a product that will eliminate frizz and add moisture to my hair, but at the same time leave my hair soft and silky. I noticed the change immediately. My hair feels wonderful. The product also smells great! I would definitely recommend it for frequent flat-iron and blow-dryer users like me.</li>
            <li> I ordered Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream and they sent me very old product and the label said *NOT FOR SALE*.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Use sparingly as little bit goes a long way. However, this product is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; on the frizzy hair days.</li>
            <li> First product review I&#x27;ve ever written, but had to comment on this product. It&#x27;s awful - I used only a small amount on my medium-length hair, and it looks so greasy you would think it hasn&#x27;t been washed in a week. I won&#x27;t be using it again!! Very disappointed as I was really looking forward to trying this.</li>
            <li> This cream is light and very hydrating without being greasy. My hair was dull and as dry as hay after too many color treatments. It was frizzy and unmanageable. This cream gave it back its shine and makes it feel smooth, natural and healthy. I love the light smell too!</li>
            <li> I would give it more stars if I could. This stuff is fantastic! I have long, color treated hair with grays here &amp; there. My hair is naturally wavy, but the waves have been pure frizz with all of the damage &amp; gray. Like most people I would just grab the straightening iron to get the frizz out, but in return making my problem worse. I put this on my hair (about 6 pumps since my hair is long), I let it air dry, then scrunch &amp; spray it. You would not believe how amazing this stuff is. It brought out not just wave, but a bit of curl in my hair. I love my hair again &amp; I&#x27;m putting the straightening iron away. Thanks for such a great product. I can&#x27;t live without this now:-)</li>
            <li> This works great, less expensive than buying through a salon</li>
            <li> This was first recommended by a stylist and I loved it, but not the salon price, so I was so happy to find it online at a significant savings.</li>
            <li> I first used this product at a friend&#x27;s house in a pinch and loved it so much I purchased it myself.  It&#x27;s amazing.  I have thick, wavy hair that I can style either curly or straight.  This product works with either style.  It leaves hair soft, silky and doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  Just a small amount (dime sized or less) is all that&#x27;s necessary.  I highly recommend for any hair type!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, coarse, naturally curly, frizzy, colored hair.  I tried Wen Hair Care Products and while I liked the result of the cleaning conditioner, I had a problem with a low level burn in my eyes every day and had to give up the product after using it for a month.  One thing I was able to keep using was the styling cream, but the price to reorder was ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the reviews for the Wen Cleaning Conditioner I heard about this product as a good alternative for the price.  You get more product for less price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I tried it.  Don&#x27;t be put off by Oil in the name, it&#x27;s definitely a cream.  1 pump is enough to coat my hair which I let dry naturally.  I can get different looks just by when I apply the product.  If I wait 10 minutes out of the shower I can get a somewhat fuller look than applying it as soon as the towel is removed.  I can also control how tight the curls are by how much I scrunch my hair while still damp.  In all of these cases I&#x27;ve got curl definition, shinier hair and I&#x27;m frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will get a greasy look if you apply too much product to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that impressed me with the Wen Cleansing Conditioner which this product doesn&#x27;t do, is allow me to get away with washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> Awesome for curly hair! You will not be disappointed! IT leaves your hair feeling great and not greasy whatsoever! I just started using it and will be purchasing the shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> only need a little bit and it keeps hair smooth and sleek even on humid days.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair greasy, and I have thin wavy hair, and a lot of it.  Usually creams weigh it down, but this did not.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Smell is so unique. Leaves my course hair silky and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I had heard much about these products and decided to test. My hair is much stronger and brighter ... recommend the use of the full range ...</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and this product really helps style and hydrate my hair. Easy to use, apply before blow dry. I noticed a difference the first time I used it. I have been using it with the Moroccanoil.</li>
            <li> This is my hair holy grail, it is such a great product and at a great price. It leaves my hair manageable and tames the frizz, it just makes it look a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE&amp;#60; LOVE this product.  Great for dry ends, and super nice scent.</li>
            <li> I am Black and have have had serious trouble getting my relaxed hair to grow. This is partly b/ it&#x27;s really dry and breaks a lot. It is also b/ my hair feels coarse and its texture fools hair stylists into thinking that they can be rough with it when in fact it is very fragile. Nevertheless, I typically go and get a $10 wash and wrap every week rather than try to wash it myself. Whenever I did wash it myself, it would feel brittle and I&#x27;d get a lot of breakage in the ensuing days. If your hair care regimen sounds anything like mine, pick up this product.     I washed my hair yesterday with the MoroccanOil Hydrating Shampoo and followed with the Moisture Repair conditioner. I&#x27;ve done this before and ended up with brittle dry hair but yesterday I added the Moroccan OIl Hydrating Styling Cream to the regimen and it made a wonderful difference. I used more than the bottle instructed-- a full pump and a half and spread it throughout my hair taking care to get the ends. I also put it along my hairline so that my new growth would dry flat. Then I put a satin scarf around my hairline like a thick headband and pinned up the back of my hair and headed to the library (It&#x27;s final examination time around here). It air-dried strong and sleek and felt wonderful. It wasn&#x27;t stiff but rather really soft. I encountered breakage (minimal) only when I was combing the conditioner through my hair. On top of that, my boyfriend loved the smell of it and noticed immediately. I paid $15 more than the list price from amazon and still feel like it was an amazing buy. I am confident that my hair will grow now and I will not fear washing my hair anymore.    Note: my natural hair consists of very tight curls if that helps you with your purchase decision. As mentioned above, I strongly recommend this product. Though I liked this product a lot, I&#x27;m not sure how essential the Moroccan Oil shampoo and their corresponding repair conditioner are. Nevertheless, since I found such success with this product, I am going to try the intense hydrating mask and the restorative hair mask.     Note 2: the instructions say that you can use the product on wet and dry hair. Last night after my hair was long dry I used it on the ends before I wrapped it. Wrapping usually creates too much stress for my hair but I had no breakage last night while wrapping. It was the first time that I could ever wrap my hair after washing my hair myself    If you&#x27;re hair issues sound similar to mine, I cannot recommend this product enough.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair, and this cream made it feel so soft.  I finally feel like I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; hair!  And it smells wonderful!  Just bear in mind you need very little - my hair tends to be very dry, so I use a bit more, but if you have normal hair you would want to use less.  If you have oily hair, it is probably not for you.  Please believe me, I have tried so many many MANY products, and none of them worked.  I have thrown money down the drain for years, buying one expensive product after another.  But no more! This cream is the only thing I need now!  I&#x27;m sitting here now with SOFT hair!  Soft!!  Miraculous!! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Moroccan hair oil and the product came on time( right before Christmas)  and as described.  It was in brand new condition, wrapped in plastic so the pump wouldn&#x27;t move. Did not have to contact the seller.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair and I&#x27;ve been reading about Moroccanoil for a while ...(argan Oil products)......I ordered this hydratating styling cream and its worked wonders on my hair its shiny soft smells delicious and looks healthier than ever ....(that has silicone I could care less claryfing shampoo once a month n done! ........  The shampoo and Conditioner are way too expensive ! ...I would suggest buying ONE&#x27; N ONLY shampoo and Cndtr in Sallys same thing mOROCCANOIL sulfate free and all... awesome products!  YES I WOULD RECOMEND IT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND LET YOUR HAIR SHINE!      ohhh and almost fprgot wow FASTEST SHIPPING I&#x27;VE HAD! 5*********************</li>
            <li> I had used this cream twice since i bought it.... and i can say that it works really good on my hair.... i have a dry to normal hair.... it takes few more days to go to the bauty parlor....</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair cream when I want to get some really good moisture into it.  I had used this cream several times  since i bought it and i can say that it works really good on my hair i have a dry to normal hair and it takes few more days to go to the salon.</li>
            <li> love the feel of my hair, the smell after I have used this. My hair is actually silky,.something that no other product has been able to achieve.  I cant wait to try the entire moroccanOil line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply to wet or dry hair, (wet especially), and makes my hair feel soft.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> great product, good price, fast service. this is a great hair care product for daily use. Holds curl and style without being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> This was A christmas present for my daughter-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;She was so excited and thrilled. She has such beautiful hair and this is what she likes to use.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product out based on all the great things I have heard about this product.  I was definitely impressed with how it moisturized my hair, and the smell is amazing.  This is by far one of my favorite hair products to use to detangle and keep my hair hydrated.</li>
            <li> Product does what it offers to do &amp; smells great</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product for big frizzy hair.  I use this product all the time and I love it.  I ordered it through Amazon from a new company called Beyond Blush and I received the product before the scheduled date of arrival.  It was packaged well and the product was in excellant condition when it arrived.  I was very happy with the product and the company.  I recommend this product and ordering from this company.  I also recommend this product to straighten hair or tame wild hair.  It makes your hair soft and managable.  The product is much more expensive through the salon.</li>
            <li> This works GREAT. After you put it in your hair ( or some one elses) it actually moisturizes your hands as well.</li>
            <li> Great for the hair.  Love the way it makes your hair feel.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with any Moroccan product!  It&#x27;s especially helpful to my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Love this Morocca Oil hydrating cream!  It makes my hair feel smooth and silky when I use it and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily at all.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair this product is for you. I don&#x27;t. I tried it on one side of my hair and found that the other side without it was lighter and bouncier after styling. My friend who has naturally curly hair uses this product (i found it through her) and she loves it. It conditions and softens her hair. I give it 3 stars but if I were my friend I&#x27;m sure she&#x27;d give it a 4 or even a 5 possibly...</li>
            <li> I have tried the shampoo, conditioner, and mask which are all wonderful....but this \\&quot;Hydrating Styling Cream\\&quot; isn&#x27;t hydrating AT ALL! It does NOTHING for my hair and barely has any Argon Oil at all. NOT WORTH IT. SO EXPENSIVE AND THE QUALITY IS VERY POOR. I would never recommend this to anyone. Waste of money. Try Macadamian Oil, Nexxus, or Mixed Chicks Products for a better quality leave-in cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells good and keeps hair soft when I rub it on a few times a week.</li>
            <li> This really changed my hair - conditioned dry color treated hair and makes much less frizzy. Use on wet hair for best results. Never without it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Never fails.</li>
            <li> I have used other products but this beats them all.  It helps my flat-ironed hair by eliminating the frizzies and keeps the smooth sleek style all day!</li>
            <li> I have the thickest and longest hair and it is naturally curly. I prefer to straighten it so I have tried every product under the sun to make my hair healthy and smooth. This stuff blows everything else out of the water, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> pleased with product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on my hair &amp; I was immediately addicted to the scent.  Clean, fresh with a touch of vanilla.  Love the silkyness and shine.  I&#x27;m definately hooked on this product line.</li>
            <li> I was worried about buying this on Amazon, but having tried it out, it&#x27;s the real deal (bought from BeautyWorld, 7/2013). I&#x27;ve used this stuff for a little over a year instead of gel because it gives my hair (thin/fine) a good hold without being sticky or leaving residue.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair feels so moisturized and smooth. Works wonders and I highly recommend you try it out!</li>
            <li> I have fine/medium/wavy/color treated hair past my shoulders that I prefer to air dry. Frizz was my major complaint and anti-frizz products did nothing for me. A hair stylist told me the only thing that would work for me was a flat iron but I didn&#x27;t want to damage my hair. She also told me that this product would weigh my hair down but I just had to have it. She was SO wrong. :) This styling cream added softness, shine, definition, soft hold and most importantly, is the only thing that has ever taken my frizz away. I am finally happy with my hair.</li>
            <li> The spa where I get my hair styled uses the Moroccan Oil products.  I love the way this makes my hair so soft without weighing it down.  I have fine hair but a lot it and I have been growing it out for a few years.  It is finally half way down my back and is in constant need of repair.  I love my long hair and I am willing to buy the products to take care of it.  I use this before I dry and style my hair and it makes it extremely soft and shiny.  However, if you have straight hair and you want to curl it I wouldn&#x27;t use this product prior to trying to curl it...I only gave it 4 stars versus 5 because it is so pricey.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil, but I don&#x27;t get the original one because it&#x27;s strictly oil and can make my hair greasy. I bought the hydrating styling cream from my hairstylist a long time ago, and it lasted me for about a year. The hydrating styling cream is a perfect balance between the amount of moisture it gives your hair and the great feel your hair has once it&#x27;s styled. I ordered it from this seller and it came very quickly and brand new, unopened. Thank you so much and will order again soon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge product junkie and have tried everything from Neutrogena to Ms. Jesse for my 4c hair and I found that this works the best. I don&#x27;t blow dry or flat iron my hair because it&#x27;s too much of a nuisance and my hair is very fragile so I use it as a daily leave in conditioner. I remember I blow dried my hair once and it was dry and coarse afterward so I used a dollop of this and there was a HUGE difference. It made my blow dried hair soft, manageable and shiny and it smelled great too which is an added bonus. Now I use it after my hair dries or sometimes while it&#x27;s still damp and it makes my hair SO soft.</li>
            <li> A friend bought me my first bottle from a beauty supply store, the type of store that you need a  beautican license to even get in the door. I didn&#x27;t want to bother her again so I looked for the same product on line. The front of the bottles are identical. I purchased my second bottle. When I compared the list of ingredients I was very surprised. The bottle from amazon had about 6 extra ingredients listed. I have to say the product seems to work the same, but I would prefer a product that was purer and that didn&#x27;t have a laundry list of chemicals.</li>
            <li> this stuff it great. &amp;#34;Will have you smelling like an Egyptian cab drive in no time&amp;#34; quoted from the greatest show ever, KP</li>
            <li> This cream is wonderful for frizz-prone hair! I use it before I blow dry--It&#x27;s not greasy, makes my hair so soft, and helps me maintain my smooth style after I flat iron. It also smells amazing! I use it a few times a week (only when I blow dry) and the 10.2-ounce bottle has lasted me more than six months. Love it!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Fast shipping. My wife and daughter love this stuff.</li>
            <li> MoroccanOil Hydrating Styling Cream is my favorite hair styling product and I could not find it in local stores.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this product after my stylist had used some on my hair.  I have dry, curly, frizzy hair and this stuff tames it nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and it helps keep my hair smooth.  Not crazy about the smell (it reminds me of Comet Cleanser) but maybe that&#x27;s just me.  Anyway love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve referred this product to my friends and dad that have curly hair. People say my hair smells amazing with it and it helps define the curl and have less frizz. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have thin/wavy hair, pretty oily and it frizzes (yeah, the evil trifecta!) and I have always struggled with finding a product that doesn&#x27;t make any one of those traits worse. I have used everything from regular store brands (Organix, Frizz-Ease, etc.) to the pricey salon stuff (Bumble &amp; Bumble and It&#x27;s a 10), all serum or light oil mist based. Every time I blow-dryed my hair, it would come out nice and straight and smooth, but within a couple of hours...not so much. It&#x27;s almost as if my hair was getting frizzier by using the before mentioned products and I started noticing that I had some new growth I had at the crown of my head would stand up on end after blow-drying. No amount of product or flat ironing would keep those little buggers down. I became addicted to hair spray because of this, and even then it would keep them tame for only an hour or so. And it doesn&#x27;t help that I live in the most humid environment, South Florida!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had long hair for the past 18yrs (since my senior year of high school...you&#x27;re doing the math right now to see how old I am, right? haha), to about the middle of my back and recently cut off almost 10&amp;#34;, to come up right around my collarbone. I wanted a change and basically needed to let my hair recover from the years of blow-drying and flat ironing. Oh, and I recently started coloring my hair again (dang gray hairs!). I was complaining to a coworker (who has gorgeous waist-length hair) about my hair one day and she proceeds to pull out from her purse the bottle of the hydrating creme and tells me to hold out my hand. I said, &amp;#34;no thanks, that&#x27;s a creme - if serums/oils make my hair gross, then a creme would definitely not be any better.&amp;#34; She then looks me in the eye and says, &amp;#34;trust me&amp;#34;. She had this serious look on her face, enough to make me slightly scared to say no, so I held out my hand. She squirts out some of the creme in my hand, about the size of a chick pea, and tells me to rub my hands together and demonstrates how to put it in my hair. My hair instantly became softer, smoother and best of all it did not make it greasy! IT WAS A REVELATION!!! Within seconds, I went onto Amazon and found it. I asked her how long the 10.2oz bottle lasts her. I thought she would say maybe a few months, as she has really long hair...she said ALMOST A YEAR!!! The excitement that came over me was euphoric! I know, it sounds crazy because it&#x27;s just hair roduct, but after struggling for years, wasting hundreds of dollars, to find that one thing that makes you feel so much better about your physical appearance, you get a little giddy and want to tell the world about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER use anything else! Yes, it&#x27;s a little pricey, but the quality is worth every single penny. Plus, that bottle will last you a very long time! Some people have said the smell is a little &amp;#34;old-ladyish&amp;#34;, but I personally love it. It&#x27;s not overwhelming at all...in fact, I&#x27;m smelling my hair right now and can barely tell. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MorrocanOil Hydrating Styling Creme...I love you!!!!!demonstrates how to put it in my hair.

            <li> this is literally my second bestfriend to my hair! it treats my dead ends really well,  plus, it smells really really good.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve ever bought after a trim because it helps with static tremendously!! I recommend this product to all women who have fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I really love Moroccan oil and all of the products that I have used in the line. I always purchase this through Amazon as the only other places that I&#x27;ve seen the complete line is in salons. It does a great job of moisturizing without being too heavy and the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed to discover that silicone is used as the leading ingredient in this entire line of products.  The particular types of silicone are known to cause cancer when looked up on line.</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my hair and to help style it as I dry it.  I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and what I received from Future City Plus Beauty is not the same product.  Sure the bottle was the same but he contents have been tampered with.    Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream is normally an orange color, what I received was a light peach/cream colored product - it looked as though they blended the actual product with some cheap lotion.    Whatever the concoction they&#x27;ve sent is, the product absolutely does not work like the real thing.  I&#x27;m throwing mine away - it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning!  Don&#x27;t buy from this seller!</li>
            <li> While I really love their deep/intense conditioner I did not like this product.  It left a feeling to my hair that I did not like.  I have very curly hair almost like African American and this was too heavy for my hair.  Their deep conditioner is however one of the best professional products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, I mistakenly ordered the Hydrating cream I wanted to order the Curl, however I was not disappointed it leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Been using this since 2010 and love the way it leaves my natural hair as well as weaves... yes i always use this on my weaves..its great...</li>
            <li> But very pricey. I would recommend it to many woman friends - it&#x27;s a must-have. The product is great for women who have wavy hair and it helps with the growing process.</li>
            <li> my hair does too! This product makes my thick hair easy to manage and feel so soft! It&#x27;s as close as I&#x27;ve come to looking like I do when I leave the salon!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have been better. Made my dry hair look positively luxurious. The price was much lower than if I had bought it anywhere in Connecticut.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this smoother and it is very effective.  Using just a little on wet hair each time you shampoo leaves hair soft, smooth, shiny and manageable.  It is a little pricey but the bottle will last for months. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I thought MoroccanOil had more of a clear look???  What I recieved looks like lotion and i&#x27;m not seeing the results either</li>
            <li> Love the product and the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very nice, makes my hair shiny and silky! would totally recommend! :) I have long and some what frizzy hair and it makes it look amazing!</li>
            <li> I love the MoroccanOil Hydrating Styling Cream. The smell is divine &amp; it leaves my hair fully nourished; shiny &amp; healthy. The only down fall is that it&#x27;s a little pricey, but its so worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> So far this is the best product I&#x27;ve found , I love it !  I&#x27;ve tried many different products but this is the one for my coarse hair. After washing my hair I put a few &amp;#34;squirts&amp;#34; in my hand and pull through my hair. After drying with blow dryer I have much more control and my hair looks healthy. It might cost a few more $ but it goes a long way and does the trick !</li>
            <li> purchase all of the time</li>
            <li> I bought this three years ago and am writing this review now to say it is the real thing because I recently purchased this one http://www.amazon.com/Moroccanoil-Hydrating-Styling-Cream-16-9-Ounce/dp/B001AMMSMK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1438454258&amp;sr&#x3D;1-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;moroccanoil+styling+cream that turned out to be counterfeit. This one here, though, is legitimate, and I&#x27;m in love with it. I have fine, wavy, below shoulder length hair that I blow dry straight. One pump of this fabulous product and my hair is left soft, smooth, conditioned, and full of body, with a glorious scent. I have hair that curls and frizzes at the slightest humidity, and this cream helps resist that annoying tendency. Use sparingly -- more than a pump or two will give you a greasy result. Work from the ends up - you don&#x27;t need to saturate your roots. A truly wonderful hair product!</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick hair and blow dry my hair most days straight and this product works great. It moisturizes while not being greasy and has a nice weightless bounce to it.</li>
            <li> Purchase this every four months from our hairdresser.  I wanted to order thru Amazon as a gift for my daughter this Christmas.  Shipped quickly.  Would purchase again.  Price was right on target for what I pay at hair dressers, however, had to pay a little more this time around due to shipping.</li>
            <li> Add a little to finish off the ends and feed your hair to make up for the other things done to damage your hair</li>
            <li> If you have not tried this product it is a must. I don&#x27;t use conditioner any more short hair and highlighted and also colored 1 pump and it is shiny and mangeable</li>
            <li> grease I dont like it!</li>
            <li> I mix it with the oil and apply it to my damp hair.  It gets rid of the fizz in my curly hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best hydration cream on the market for people with thin hair, it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I normally purchase this MoroccanOIl  product at a local salon, but decided to go with this this seller on Amazon since it was cheaper than buying it locally. Unfortunately, the product I received was clearly tampered with. Firstly, the product was not sealed properly, and had been taped closed with what looked like scotch tape, I opened the product to find that it had a really strange (and really disgusting) &amp;#34;plastic&amp;#34; smell, and the product was more pinkish looking than the true product. The telltale sign was when the product did not work in my hair at all in the way that it always has. In the process of figuring out how to have this situation made right!</li>
            <li> Smells really good&lt;br /&gt;Helps with some of the frizziness, but not all of it.</li>
            <li> Tried a lot of products and none work as well as this to tame frizz and help curls like this.  I use it with a clear gel for hold.  Works perfectly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter requested this for the second Christmas.  I gave her one last year and was surprised that she wanted it again this year.  It tells me it must be a wonderful product! The only con I could see is that with the dispenser top, it makes it difficult to transport it from place to place.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is excellent to control the curls of my daughter&#x27;s hair and left it soft and with a great smell.&lt;br /&gt;I fully  recommend it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. It is NOT the real Moroccan oil. They have blended it with something. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it.</li>
            <li> all time classic. There are many imitations, none as good as the real thing. It is worth it, get it.</li>
            <li> I have thinner hair and this product does not way it down. makes hair very manage when blow drying. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product, no frizz, great shine, does not make my scalp itch.  Do not like the price so I took off a star.  The product did arrive leaking all over the box- not very pleased with the shipping and packaging.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife who swears that there is nothing better than MoroccanOil products.</li>
            <li> This is a staple in my daily routine.  Definitely worth the money and a little goes a long way.  Great for fine hair too.</li>
            <li> not good. I&#x27;ve bought this product in a hair salon before and this is not the same stuff. it smells different and has a different consistency. I sent it back</li>
            <li> The cream was runny, not the nice tthick product I have purchased before.  I have been using this cream for several years and maybe they changed their formula but I am disappointed in the quality .</li>
            <li> NEED TO FIND OUT WHAT COLOR IS INSIDE THE BOTTLE CREAM MOROCCANOIL HYDRATING STYLING CREAM. IS THERE OTHER COLORS THAN WHITE.</li>
            <li> MoroccanOil makes really great products.  This styling cream is very light and does not weigh down my hair. I have gray hair and it&#x27;s perfect for keeping it from looking coarse.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. I have very fine hair and I find that the cream does not weigh it down. The oils felt messy and greasy to me. The cream is luxurious and light. Worth every penny. I recently purchased &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; light weight leave in spray which has great reviews, but I love this product WAY more.  First purchased at Saks, but the retail option is just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of all Moroccan Oil products. I have curly/frizzy hair, and this product really helps keep it at bay. It is not oily or greasy either.</li>
            <li> Good product, I like the smell.. It protect my hair from the damage of the iron machine... So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Best curl definition and frizz control. Can use it wet or dry hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave sticky or smelly residue like other products.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan products to keep my hair smooth and not frizzy. I was hoping this would add an additional styling component and it has. I use one pump on my wet hair (medium length, layered just past my shoulders) and blow dry it.  Lots of coworkers have asked what I use and I recommend this all the time.  I wish it were cheaper but realizing I&#x27;m getting 2 products in one makes it seem not so expensive.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair , defrizzes and moisturizes. Can be used on wet or dry hair. Amazon is the best!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this at my daughter in law and found that it left my permed hair soft and the split ends disappeared.  So I bought it and it works quite well.</li>
            <li> Prior to using MoroccanOil Hydrating Styling Cream, my hair used to frustrate me.  I have fine hair prone to breakage and frizzing, and I was tired of always having hair that went frizzy part way through the day.  Not anymore.  The MoroccanOil has finally tamed it so that my hair looks beautifully styled all day long.  It is a lot less dry now too.  All I need to do is massage a pea sized amount into my hair while wet, style as usual, and it looks great.  I definitely recommend this product.  It actually works, unlike many unsuccessful products I have used previously.  It may seem expensive, but one bottle of this stuff lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> Gives you a little healthy shine. Does not weigh down your hair. You only need a small amount. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like this product for four stars, it moisturizer my curls just enough and gives a wonderful smell to it, I&#x27;m giving it four stars because I love it but when I use too much of it at first it&#x27;s wonderful and my hair looks healthy but then the next day it feels like I have to wash it again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK - I found out it has some chemicals in it that I don&#x27;t love (essentially liquid plastics) so I&#x27;ve switched over to Argan oil products instead.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews and people being unhappy with the product, I still went ahead and decided to give it a try, just maybe it would work differently for my hair.  Well, I&#x27;m also very disappointed and now I&#x27;m stuck with a product that I&#x27;m not going to use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, don&#x27;t buy it.  It doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy hair that is much curlier in some sections than others. I have been using the Morrocan Oil for almost a year now and that has helped with the texture of my hair. But the addition of the Morrocan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream is AWESOME! Makes my hair smooth, and shiny but also adds consistency to the curl. The styling cream works even in the summer humidity and does not weigh my hair down or make it oily or greasy. Yes, it is pricy, but worth every penny for gorgeous hair! Plus the Morrocan Oil scent is amazing!</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan Oil! I can&#x27;t believe I just found this product. It works great and has an Awesome smell! I love the whole line of products!</li>
            <li> This smelled wonderful but didn&#x27;t meet my expectations for styling purposes. I would still recommend it might work better for a friend.</li>
            <li> Another great product used for my transition of going natural &amp; it has been very helpful.  My hair is manageable thanks to the products I purchased.</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s a multi-purpose product in one.  Treatment and heat protectant.  A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t buy this product its totally fake!!! I use this product all the time, don&#x27;t let this seller fool you, first of all it didn&#x27;t came in a box the real product comes in an original box and this one  just came with tape on top. it smells terrible.</li>
            <li> My stylist has been using the styling cream on my hair for awhile now and I love it! I have med thick curly hair that I straighten  everyday. My hair looks and feels healthy and has great shine!</li>
            <li> Smells and looks more like baby lotion than Moroccan Oil.  The bottle is written in both Hebrew and English.  Don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
            <li> I am very upset that I paid $32 dollars for a 10 ounce bottle of Moroccan styling cream, and the bottle simply will not open.  Everyone in the family has tried to open it, and it does not pop up so that you can pump from it.  I have used this for many years, and always bought it from a Salon, and never seen this happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now, I am doubting as to whether this is the real thing.  I am also in doubt as to the authenticity, because the pump looks different than it does on the real bottles in the salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to contact seller to send me a new pump, but no way to do that.  IF anybody reads these from Amazon, I hope they would send me a new pump so I can use this product. I did not want to waste time returning, but see no other option.  Very upsetting.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used. My hair is naturally very curly. I blow it out twice a week. It looks smooth and silky. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I got this. It works ok, not the same product that I buy in the salon. It looks the same, but it does not have the same smell. Actually there is no smell. I will go back to buying it from the salon.</li>
            <li> I used to use Bumble and Bumble styling balm untill I could ne longer find it. This has made me forget all about my last favorite-this is my new favorite! My hair always feels healthy. I have fine, wavy hair- but lots of it. This works great for me.</li>
            <li> I loved it make my hair so smooth and is easy to stye my hair after using that oil. thank you</li>
            <li> Moroccan oil Hydrating Styling cream has solved my problem of tangled, dry hair and I&#x27;m now recommending it to all my friends. I have colored blond hair, that is thin, fragile, etc. I just massage 2-3 squirts of Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream into wet hair right after showering (concentrating on the ends). Then I normally air dry it (if I&#x27;m blow drying, I use 4 squirts). RESULT: soft hair that is smooth to the touch and very \\&quot;hair-playing\\&quot; friendly. The product does not weigh my hair down, and it makes my hair smell very nice (got quite a few complements about nice-smelling hair from people I hug).   If you live in an area with cold winters, hot humid or dry summers and you have thin, blond hair that is susceptible to damage - this product is definitely for you.   Before, i tried a bunch of moisturizing damage-repair shampoos and conditioners. But since they&#x27;re not leave-in, they&#x27;ve proven to be useless. With Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling cream I can wash my hair with ANY shampoo and conditioner and still get perfect hair (efficiently cuts down my monthly spending).  LOVE THE PRODUCT!  already recommended it to friends and now I&#x27;m leaving this review &#x3D;) ENJOY!</li>
            <li> Worth every penny for soft frizz free hair all the time. Pump clogs often so watch out for that before each use.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product and recommend it to everyone. Thanks for the efficiency and honesty. Buy more time with you</li>
            <li> It has really help my hair.  It looks nice and I receive many compliments on it.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> FAKE PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;QR CODE BROKE AND ERASE</li>
            <li> This product adds structure to out of control hair. Mine is healing from over processed thin, fine hair.  Only product I&#x27;ve found to be effective on my type hair.</li>
            <li> My niece is a hairdresser and mention that my hair look lifeless.  She put a few spay of this on my hair and like magic my hair looked alive.  I would recommend this to everyone.  Super Great Value!</li>
            <li> The product I was shipped was not the real Moroccan Oil product. They refused to return the item when I complained but once I emailed them and explained I was going to report them to Amazon for selling fake goods as well as reporting them to the Moroccan oil company as well  - they gladly refunded my money. Funny how that works.</li>
            <li> it looks and feels the same, but the smell is completely off. this type of brand normally has a certain smell and helps hair, but this was bought online and is a knockoff, smells to chemically. thats what i get for trying to find it cheaper. this product is definitly worth the 10 more i would have payed if i bought at a professional in person salon, which is the only way you should buy it or any Moroccan oil products to avoid knock offs.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it. Makes my hair soft and easy to manage. Will continue buying it</li>
            <li> I used to dread washing my hair but with this product all has changed.  I have long hair and combing it out after even using a conditioner I spent a lot of time swearing and threatening to chop it all off.  My husband not only did not want me to cut it off but he also hated listening to my language while combing out the snarls.  With just a couple of squirts of this magic stuff my attitude has completely changed.  A girl friend bought my first bottle and I have thanked her time and time again.  I truly am a believer and I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It works well with my hair.  I start my hair route with this produce everyday.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in Las Vegas in a shop downstairs of the Bellagio because I had forgotten to pack any hair products. I was so desperate that I ignored the price tag, and boy am I glad I did!  I have curly, frizzy hair and this turns them into Beautiful ringlets. As soon as I ran out, I tried to replace it with other products, but none of them compared, even my argan oil hair serums. I rushed to Amazon and was thrilled to find it!  I go through it quickly, but I absolutely swear by it, it&#x27;s truly a priceless must-have for me!!</li>
            <li> Great product.....one of the best on the market!</li>
            <li> Good product and I love how you can keep it in your hair and no need to rinse. It does a great job especially in the drying winter months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how or why this product is worth $32.00.  I have a bottle of $10 Argan Oil that works better.  I guess I will have to go along with those who said it may not be the real thing.  I thought I would try it because of all the great reviews, but quite honestly not worth anywhere near the $$$.</li>
            <li> Not only does it leave your hair with this tremendous shine, manageability but also smells so good!!!  Love the way it manages those fly away pieces of hair!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cream is excellent and worth every penny but the supplier I used sent the wrong product.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps my hair calm and doesn&#x27;t smell bad either.</li>
            <li> This product work good together with Keratin oil both together will leave your hair shine and soft! using alone is not as good as together in my opinion..I tried both way however, its a very good for hydrating your hair it help a lot with the blow dryer not leaving your hair dried. I will  recommend this product!</li>
            <li> good stuff and good seller</li>
            <li> If you need to repair your hair and protect the ends from styling, this is the product for you! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my slightly curly hair. It encourages curl without any stiffness</li>
            <li> Quick shipment!! Great product. Excellent experience. Thank you !!!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the hold I was looking for. My hair is wavy, and I feel like this product left my hair looking messier when I was done than other products (Redken Curvaceous Curls Styling Cream, Oribe Creme For Style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only tried it once so far, but I will continue to use it a little longer and see if my opinion changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: No, my opinion has not changed. I end up using more of this product for the same result and my hair is messy at the end of the day. Redken Curvaceous Curls is still my preferred choice. I may use a somewhat heavier amount (still less than MoroccanOil) but it will hold my hair for 2-3 days without it looking too bad.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what it said it was. The stuff inside was obviously tampered with.</li>
            <li> This smelled so good and I liked it so much that I included one in a couple of my best friends holiday gifts.  Every time I put this on my husband asks me what smells so good - need I say more! I use it however in combo with my hair gel - I switch between this and Bouncy Creme but this smells wonderful! Nice product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Smells so good like spearmint bubble gum.  My daughter has a very dry, itchy scalp and this hair cream works so well on it. Leaves her hair shiny too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works like a charm. I have fine thin hair that gets tangled easily so I need to be careful when my hair is wet. The comb slides right through without tangles. It also smells wonderful too.</li>
            <li> This styling cream from moroccanoil is great! Lightweight but effective, I have thick curly and unruly hair and this tames it in soft wavy curls and no frizz. I also use moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner, I think all three work really well together and highly recommend them all. Purchased from amazon.com (not another seller on amazon), so it&#x27;s the actual product and not some cheap stuff in the moroccanoil bottle. Also, great price!</li>
            <li> I was sure I had selected the Oil and obviously not... Not sure if it was my mistake or if I was somehow tricked... SO I can&#x27;t really say but I feel scammed.</li>
            <li> Use this product every time I wash my hair instead of conditioner.  Just a pump and work thru wet hair.  GREAT!</li>
            <li> I used about a half bottle of this stying cream, and I don&#x27;t see where it hydrated my hair at all. It styles ok the first day of use, but the second day hair gets funky, like gooey.  It was very over priced for what it is supposed to do. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is the most disappointing cosmetic/hair product purchase I have ever made. It not only doesn&#x27;t diminish frizz; it INCREASES it. Caveat emptor: let the buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have think fine hair and it is terrific. I have used for about a year now and I fine it does give my hair the body I need to do my hair. It will not make your hair flat.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have curly hair and this does wonders for either leaving it curly, or straightening it.  I am able to comb through my hair with ease.  Totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, course and curly and I bought this based on the rave reviews. I&#x27;m sure it works great with fine wavy hair and it does smell great, but for the price and claim, I was expecting so much more than something that smells nice and makes my hair a little softer.    As a styling product... Well, it just isn&#x27;t for me. I use it more as a leave in conditioner, when I blow dry and straighten my hair. I tried it as a styling product after I shampood and within an hour, my hair was a fuzzball and no control whatsoever. For me, this was an expensive purchase with little to no results.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell. It allows me to wear my hair with a little more body than usual hair styling products.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s stylist used a type of this on her hair when she had her hair cut and she asked for some for Christmas. I did some searching on-line and found this product on Amazon. The price was cheaper than other sites and it was shipped very quickly. She loves the product and how it makes her hair feel.</li>
            <li> The product is good, but it was delivered with the plunger depressed and about 20% leaked out. The inside of the box was a mess!</li>
            <li> I loooove the smell of this product.  But it&#x27;s not truly for all hair types.  I&#x27;ve got coarse hair that&#x27;s wavy on a good day, impossibly frizzy on a bad day, and very dry.  This product&#x27;s third ingredient (after water, and something I can&#x27;t pronounce) is alcohol.  And for me, that&#x27;s not going to lead to a good hair day.  So I can&#x27;t use this product without adding an oil when my hair dries, which basically means it&#x27;s not adding any benefit other than that amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would consider another of their products, maybe something targeting my specific high-maintenance hair type.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair stylist used it (along with the shampoo, conditioner, and oil) and I loved the scent and feel of my hair.  Of course, hair done by the stylist does not always look the same a few days later.  I wanted a conditioning product that I could leave in, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this product was more for styling or for conditioning.  One of the other reviewers said she uses it for both, so I ordered the product.  I am very, very impressed!  Not only does it feel conditioned, it also feels thicker and fuller with a very smooth volume.  It curls well with tools such as an iron or rollers, isn&#x27;t limp, just wonderfully soft and full.  And I only used a very small amount, so I&#x27;d say this product will last me a very long time!  BTW, I used it both on dry hair and on damp hair - it works either way, but slightly better with damp hair.  And it smells good!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to give hold and body to my thin hair ant this is it.  I will buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good creme.  It keeps hair in place.  I would check the ingredient if you use mostly natural products since this does have chemical.  This is a top seller because it works pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly, dry hair; one pump of this tames it until the next washing.  I have used this for years and hope it is around for many more years.</li>
            <li> I have been using this great product for a long time and it seemed like a good idea to order it online to save money.  Unfortunately when it arrived,  the pump mechanism was broken and unusable. Luckily I had another that I was able to use and didn&#x27;t have to return.  Since it seemed to be packed well, I think it was actually broken before.</li>
            <li> This product allows me to do with my hair any stile and it keeps for days, not greasy just natural looking I love these products</li>
            <li> I like the oil better</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.</li>
            <li> I noticed that it&#x27;s the Moroccan OIL that really does the trick with my hair.  Using this cream doesn&#x27;t really seem to make much more of a difference.  Also, you can get Argon Oil for much cheaper at Target, which I would recommend - it works just as well as this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my wife and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling.  Works well with Argan Oil. Together they tame frizzies without too much build-up.  Expensive, but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a hair product that will get me off of hair gel and moose. My hair is in-between curly and wavy but is very dry that it needs something to smooth it out. This worked like magic especially now that it is short, goes to my neck. I don&#x27;t need to use a lot, maybe two pumps after I wash my hair. When it is dry I may use a little Moroccan oil to freshen it up. My hair feels and looks more healthy, less hassle so I cant be happier. There were some reviews that almost deterred me from buying it because they said that it has build up but I wash my hair every other day and have not experienced it. Im glad I tried it anyway. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love moroccanoil products!! Whoever invented this stuff is pure genius!! My hair went from drab to fab! Must buy &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i know, i know! but it&#x27;s moroccanoil- how can i go wrong. nothing is perfect (except the hydrating mask)its gonna hold, it smells great- but it flakes like the rest of &#x27;em. DONT COMB AFTER IT DRIES</li>
            <li> I use to use TIGI Bed Head however this is cheaper and more for your money then the 2pack of TIGI, plus I think it works better in my hair. I have long thick colored hair and you would never know after using this! It is soft, manageable, and doesn&#x27;t look damaged at all since I do use a blow dryer and flat iron on top of everything else!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and soft and healthy looking. It also smells great. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great will be placing another order this week.  What&#x27;s with the survey on every repeated purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Check your records I order quartely the same product.  Nothing has changed!!!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived damaged, seller said they would send replacement but after waiting almost 3 weeks and 4 emails later they finally told me they had no more and they couldn&#x27;t get any from their supplier either so they couldn&#x27;t send a replacement. My money was refunded by Amazon.  This was to be a Christmas present so at the last minute, 1 week before Christmas, I was on a mad dash to find a replacement from another seller or store to have for Christmas. If the original seller told me thy didn&#x27;t have a replacement right away  it would have made me a happy customer instead of an unhappy upset one. So needless to say I was disappointed and unhappy with this seller.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair after having radiation and it was excellent in restoring my hair.you only need to use a small amount each time you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Instantly makes your hair moisturized. I especially love the smell of this product too. I have been using Morccan Oil for several years. It&#x27;s a daily necessity.</li>
            <li> Its hard to believe i paid $34 for a fake product. As soon as i opened the package i knew it was fale. Nothing else to say...&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
            <li> It was the same bottle but different product. It smelled different, different color and consistency. Scam. Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> helps to keep my curly hair smooth but hard to detangle. I would recommend it to anyone with dry or frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My mother purchased this after having it used on her at the hair salon.  This product makes your hair very shiny and soft.  This bottle lasts a long time as only one pump is needed each time before you blow-dry your hair.  The smell is a little strong but fades after blow-drying your hair.</li>
            <li> I am a hair stylist and I use this product all day on clients, and every time I style my own hair!!!  If you have curl in your hair, it will hold the curl!!!  If you are blow drying your hair, it will hold the style!!!  I would give this 12*&#x27;s if I could!!!  By the way, my clients love it.  Keeps style in hair, until you WASH it out!!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t have survived platinum blonde without this.  This item is the only one I have ever purchased that truly restores moisture to very dry over processed hair. I used with Kerastase Bain Force Architect as well as Bumble and Bumble Hairdressers Oil.  I am a high volume platinum blonde, so this works wonders for people with greater than 7 levels of lift.</li>
            <li> I switched from the oil to this cream, but I am not sure yet if I like it better than the oil, it might not be as light as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> My hairstylist recommended this product (she&#x27;s not one of their retailers) for my VERY dry ends. I&#x27;ve been using it every day and it works great. I can definitely see improvement.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great for my hair and smells so good.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me &amp; I LOVE it!  It makes your hair super soft and keeps your hair looking healthy!  It smells &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and I love it!  (I hate when products smell terrible!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix with the MorcoccanOil Light treatment. LOVE the combo!</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it...a great hair product for sure.</li>
            <li> My favorite leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this when they first stared carrying it in the salon and I thought, \\&quot;oh great, another expensive product that&#x27;s not really gonna work great.\\&quot; Oh was I wrong. My hair was soft and frizz free for days. I quickly came to Amazon and found it much cheaper than at the salon and ordered it. I found when I used it, I could easily recreate the same style from the salon.   My sister-in-law tried in when she spent the night and could not believe the difference. Her normal frizz ball hair was tamed and soft. A week later she called me and asked me to order a bottle for her.  You have to be careful not to put it on too close to the roots. Use it from the ears down is best and this way your hair won&#x27;t turn out greasy.  You just need a little, a pump or two per use for below shoulder length.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on my dry, course, frizzy, thick hair.  After using it, my hair is soft, shiny, and much less frizzy!  I love it!</li>
            <li> It is kind of heavy (I have thinner hair), but works its magic. Hair is smooth and silky immediately after washing and applying the cream. First day after is about the same, but the second day my hear feels heavy.</li>
            <li> Different than what I used in the past...Returned</li>
            <li> Dont buy this product it is Fake !!!!!</li>
            <li> Let me just say i bought this product 2 years ago  And i was looking all over the place for it am the type of girl that likes to try different products and let me just say dis is the best product i have ever tried it make ur hair smooth with shine and it smells amazing&lt;br /&gt;And just so you guys know this is my first time writing a review but i had to do it for dis product it deserve it&lt;br /&gt;I looovveee ittt</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair. It used to take a very long time to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;I have cut my time down by 1/2 using this product. Very happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I bought a bottle of this for my granddaughter who has extremely curly hair.  This really wakes it up and controls the curl.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> great product. have used it faithfully for past two years. keeps my hair from frizzing.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of MoroccanOil from a salon months ago and it worked well for my hair type. When I was running low on the product, I decided to save some money by purchasing it through Amazon. At first, the substance in the new bottle appeared similar to the old product (I still had some left over), but after a few pumps of the cream, it became watery and I noticed that it was much lighter in color than the old one (from the salon). I had heard that there were problems buying legitimate hair and skin care products via Amazon and that many were fake. I would recommend buying this product (and any other quality hair/skin product) from a SALON, even if it means you have to pay more. At least you are getting what you paid for and not some watered down version of it that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Packaged well, seems fresh and creamy as it should be and not watery.  It arrived in a timely fashion, thanks</li>
            <li> This product re hydrates and moisturises the hair better than other products I have used.  Leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Great to use on any type of hair! I&#x27;m natural and I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> I love this product since the first time I tried. Very happy that I received my order very fast.</li>
            <li> Considerable savings over retail shops</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and it was a fake product. Not Moroccan Oil. BUYER BEWARE what you get inside and the outside label is not the Moroccan Oil product at all. It doesn&#x27;t even smell like the real Moroccan oil. Too bad this is still being sold like this. Don&#x27;t buy from here. Do yourself a favor and just buy the real product at the salon or from the Moroccan oil website. Who knows what&#x27;s in it….</li>
            <li> Nice, light fragrance.  Creamy, not greasy, and does not weigh the hair down.  Nice product!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!  Item was exactly as described!</li>
            <li> This was counterfeit product.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair this product is brilliant. I live in a very humid climate and have very thick curly hair. This cuts down the frizz and makes my hair much softer and easier to style</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair..this product will help. I always buy several at a time, can t run out. Excellent products worth buying</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my daughter. She loves it and it has made a difference in her damaged hair. Thank you</li>
            <li> It does the job it was made to do</li>
            <li> I love this product, buy it all the time. The title &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; is deceiving, it is not an oil but a cream.  It is not oily or sticky. A quarter size amount or one pump will cover my hair ( Med. to long). I let my hair dry naturally and I have no frizz. I get a lot of complements on the smell. It smells GREAT!. One bottle usually lasts me two or three months.</li>
            <li> Much better than paying salon prices for something you can only purchase in the salon. Works well for whether I want curly or straight hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I have wavy thick hair and this product makes my hair smooth and forms my waves perfectly! LOVE LOVE LOVE!</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a little shine and it smells great!  Its a fun way to start the day! It gives me a good hair day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the real deal.  Doesn&#x27;t smell, feel, or look like the stuff you can get in the salon.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Package was poorly made. A great deal of this product spilled outside of the container, making a large portion unusable.  I recommend this product just don&#x27;t get it from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use after my conditioner in the shower and leaves my hair very soft. Well worth the money. I also use the oil after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser and boy, was she right!  I have curly, thick, frizzy hair and get a professional Keratin treatment at least once a year.  I have never found a product to use in my dry hair until now.  Of course, it can be used as a styling tool in wet hair but I find just a little bit in my hair when it is dry really keeps it smooth and I can re-apply daily until my next shampoo too.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Best deep conditioner for my curly hair I&#x27;ve yet to try.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Makes my hair so manageable and has grown soooo much since using on regular basis</li>
            <li> It was okay. Did not make a difference in my hair. I am a African American woman.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter put this in my hair after i washed it.  My hair always came out with a beautiful shine. It also has a nice scent to it.  I am always getting compliments about how my hair smell so good.  Thank you Liz</li>
            <li> great for any type of hair...everyone should buy this product. a little goes a long way. the price is great.don&#x27;t be afraid to spend a little more to get a good quality product.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase. I have thick, dry, long hair and this product helps hydrate my hair.  I use this product along with Moroccan Oil Intense Curl Cream.  They work very well together.</li>
            <li> I use this product after washing my hair and apply it when it is still wet. It seems to really help protect the hair from styling heat damage and it really smooths my hair. It seems to help hold the hair in place once styled-with no stiffness. Watch how much you use to avoid an overly greasy look. I once used 2 pumps instead of one and it was just too much. Heavenly smell like all Moroccan Oil products is an added bonus!</li>
            <li> Received Moroccan Oil&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;INTENSE CURL CREAM&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;RATHER  THAN  ADVERTISED /LISTED  ITEM.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any hair!! Your hair will feel fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regenerates Damaged Hair Cells With Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil contains a high percentage of vitamin E, which is a powerful antioxidant that protects hair from free-radicals and against environmental damage.&lt;br /&gt;Blow dryers, curling and crimping irons, straighteners, perms, hair colors and sprays may be very harmful for our hair, and damage its structure. Argan oil may prevent this damage and protect our hair against aggressive factors, maintaining it healthy and strong.&lt;br /&gt;Argan oil is an excellent rescue for hair that’s fizzy, brittle and prone to breakage, because it penetrates deep inside the hair fiber, softens the cuticle scales and helps them lay down flat, leaving the hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The ingredients for this product are NOT as advertised on amazon.com.  The list on the package that I ordered is longer and one of the  ingredients is rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol.  I do not fully blame amazon, as I recently attempted to purchase this product from a different vendor not affiliated with amazon.com, with the same results.  Evidently, either Moroccanoil has changed the ingredients for this product, or only bootleg versions are currently available.  In any case, being burned twice is my limit and I will make no more attempts to purchase Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream--from ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice to feel and styling much easier.  My hair looks good from one washing to the next washing.</li>
            <li> This is a great, lightweight product that leaves hair soft, shiny and frizz-free.  Was recommended to me by a friend with very curly hair but worked on my wavy hair too!</li>
            <li> Fantastic. The cost is half the retail price and it&#x27;s exactly the same product.</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream is one of the only products I will use in my hair. It makes styling my often unruly hair easy, without weighing it down, leaving it sticky or leaving it hard and shiny. It softens and moisturizes the hair. All in all, it makes it super easy to achieve the messy, rolled-out-of-bed look that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying it here is easy, and the price is on-point with buying it in a store or salon.</li>
            <li> One of the oil instead cream! Too smelly!! Will buy it in salon next time. Thanks for asking me! Teresa</li>
            <li> Its lightweight, smells amazing and keeps my hair looking great (not oily) all day long. Totally recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> This product seems to contain more water than anything else.  I even tried to add pure Moroccan oil to it and it still didn&#x27;t help.  My hair became extreme frizzy. I had to use heat to smooth it out.  This product is counterproductive.</li>
            <li> This worked well on my hair, but the smell, while not at all heavy, just did not sit well with me and gave me a headache.  I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> The styling cream makes your hair so soft. It&#x27;s like hand cream for your hair without feeling or looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I have found that this is the best product for women who have curly hair. Very hydrating and keeps the hair from becoming frizzy.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself, but my husband uses also.  He said it is the best styling cream he has used for his hair.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist always uses this on my hair so I bought it myself. Will not go a day without it. Helps my natural hair especially humid days. And smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> excellent product and sender.</li>
            <li> I received this product today.  I requested a refund today.  This is not an authentic MoroccanOil product.  Their products have a lovely, distinct smell, and it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;spearmint bubble gum&amp;#34; (sorry). The product I received barely had a fragrance and just didn&#x27;t look right.  I went ahead and ordered directly from MoroccanOil.com.  I still love Amazon, and will continue to purchase products from here.  I just won&#x27;t buy any MoroccanOil from their third-party sellers.  I hope whatever I just put in my hair doesn&#x27;t give me cooties.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shine and silky! I love it. Would recommend this product to everybody. Just a small patch is all you need.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for thick hair. My curls are more defines and less frizz. My hair is soft and shiny and this product defines my curls.</li>
            <li> Love this hydrating and styling cream.  It is moisturizing.  I use it as a leave in conditioner daily.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This product does not even work.... i have blonde hair and its brittle but hydration cream does nothing for my hair but smell good. it doesn&#x27;t eliminate frizz nor does it soften the hair</li>
            <li> I love this styling product.  It smells terrific and helps with blow dry styling.  It&#x27;s not greasy and doesn&#x27;t make your hair flat.  Just the opposite.  The price is a little high but you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  Love the other Moroccan products also.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little off on this product coming out of the container. But once in hair, smells great.  It helps tame the frizzies and I even use it on dry hair.  Product delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Item does not feel or smell like the one I am used too... does not work properly...I think this is an old bottle. Disappointed to say the least. Won&#x27;t buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great on my hair, it make it smooth, and shine. Also I don&#x27;t have to color my hair often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE FAST SHIPPING OF THIS ARTICLE.  SOFT AND MANAGEABLE THROUGH MY HAIR.  NICE LOOKING HAIR STYLE WITH IT.</li>
            <li> When I got in mail it was not in a box but a Fedex envelope with tape on the top holding the squirt handle down so it wouldn&#x27;t get everywhere or at least I guess that&#x27;s what they were attempting. However, there was still hair product everywhere with a busted top!! Really....can&#x27;t be efficient &amp; send in a box?? Not very happy about that.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that product works alright with my hair</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I live in the desert and this is the only hair product the gets out static. I use this product after every shampoo before I blow dry my hair. Works great!,,</li>
            <li> This product works miracles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen this brand grow and expand, I&#x27;ve always used the MoroccanOil shampoo and conditioner, I now use this Hydrating styling cream to style my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see a big difference. Your hair looks healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend both this brand and specific product!</li>
            <li> Staple product. I love this light weight styling cream esp for curly hair. It seems to hydrate and making de tangling easy and smells yum.</li>
            <li> I dont really use the product it gave a really shiny look but it did not come out of the hair very easily..</li>
            <li> Works great, and smells good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, I really like it because it make my hair looks like smooth and fresh. I don&#x27;t even need to dry it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and the few months I went without it was totally noticeable in my hair&#x27;s dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Its an amazing product with great smell.</li>
            <li> Love this cream.  It makes my hair shiny without adding grease.</li>
            <li> Love Morroccoan oil. All their products are the best!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!  I love the smell, and how it manages my hair.  I will try any product once, but the good ones get a second purchase.  I am on my third purchase of this product.  It is that good.  My hair is color treated, and seems to absorb all the humidity we have here in the south.  This styling cream tames the frizz, and leaves my hair shiny and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> it make my hair soft fix..</li>
            <li> I first heard of the product from my hairdresser and I immediately ordered it. I was hesitant at first to use it because I have very fine hair and most products make me look greasy. I have not had that problem with the hydrating styling cream. I have medium length hair and just use 1 pump every morning before blow drying my hair. I feel like it has really protected my hair from the heat of the blow dryer, straightener, and curling iron. I can definitely tell the difference in my hair with and without the cream. I feel like my hair is more rebellious without the cream and with it helps to tame it a bit better. I always recommend the MoroccanOil products to everyone I meet.</li>
            <li> I love this styling cream to crunch my hair and give my curls body.  It&#x27;s light and not greasy and doesn&#x27;t clump in your hair.</li>
            <li> This is a product I use on a regular basis, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Contrary to some other comments I read, this is exactly the same product I have purchased in stores.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Even give it as gifts.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using the moroccan oil hair line, it really hydrates my hair. This is a wonderful hair lotion to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product - it never lets me down!  And the smell is to die for!  Smooths away fly-aways and keeps my hair looking silky all day - can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hairdresser put it on my hair and it smelled beautifully for a long time! Unfortunately, it may not have been the same product, but the smell is not as strong and it goes away after a while. It makes my hair feel soft and shine.</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick hair. I distribute a small amount evenly through my wet hair before I dry it, and it helps my hair to lay nicer and feel softer.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  I put about a teaspoonful of it on my wet hair after shampooing it and just give it the shape i want and it dries as i want it.  My hair is rather short.  I don&#x27;t know how it works with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly, very curly, thin but coarse hair.  My stylist recommended this product over the regular oil I usually get, but I&#x27;m not in love.  It smells amazing, just like the rest of Moroccan Oil&#x27;s products, but it feels sticky.  The first day, whether I use it on wet hair before blow drying or on dry to smooth frizziness, my hair feels like it has a gunky residue on it.  It seems to wear well in that I don&#x27;t wake up the next day feeling sticky and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, so I can still go a few days on a blow out.  But overall, I&#x27;m not in love.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to the regular oil after this.  The oil seems to have lasting effects on improving the overall condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moraccanoil Hydrating styling Cream for a few years. But my Salon stopped carrying it so I was so happy to find it on line.Leaves my hair very healthy and smelling great.</li>
            <li> I have always used it and will continue to use it.  I recommend it to everyone.  It tames the frizzes</li>
            <li> Moroccan Oil Hydrating Styling Cream works for my fine curly hair to keep it from frizzing.  Does need to be reapplied after sleep.</li>
            <li> Great stuff ;  will never use anything else if I dont have to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, the product sent is definitely the same and I love its conditioning quality.  Truly makes a difference in the health of your hair.  Mine is fine, but thick, and can easily be damaged.  This product moisturizes without greasiness and makes styling much easier with no fly away ends.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and has totally reformed my frizz. My hair is wavy and smooth again. I&#x27;m buying their other products today!</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my hair to roller set my hair but first I mix it with the Moroccan oil hair treatment to protect, moisturize and speed up drying time for my hair. After my hair is dry and I take out the rollers my hair is transformed it was bouncy healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have very thick/coarse hair.  This product leaves my hair soft, smelling very nice and very manageable.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Recommended for everyone. Love the product! No more frizz with the hot humid weather here in Houston Texas ! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this over a year and I love it.  Hard to find so if you see it, buy it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with every hair wash, and am actually noticing my hair become less dry. It is great at helping with split ends, and smells wonderful as well. Definitely recommend it for all hair types, especially longer/dryer hair.</li>
            <li> A co-worker was wearing this product in her hair and it smelled heavenly.  It&#x27;s great that it makes your hair look healthy but I wanted my hair to smell like that.  The only complaint that I have which is user error...I must have put too much on because it made my hair look oily.  I normally have dry hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.  I don&#x27;t have to use the oil when I use this.  The fragrance is a plus as well.</li>
            <li> Item had scratched out sku on front of bottle and had lotion inside not Morroccan oil hair cream... Pissed.</li>
            <li> I love the moroccan oil, so i thought i would give this a try.  wasn&#x27;t too thrilled...made my hair VERY heavy, and weighed it down quite a bit (i have blonde hair down to just past my bra strap and that was using an amount about the size of a pea).  my hairdresser suggested that i COMBINE it with the oil (one squirt cream three squirts oil...mix together and apply)...that was a nice combination, but not enough to where i would buy it again. smells good though, but i will stick with just the oil.</li>
            <li> Not all it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  It does not smooth and soften my wavy thick hair very well. It smells good though!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product.  I use it after every shampoo.  Makes hair soft and shiny and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by hair stylist of my wife.  Works very well, easy to use, good price as well.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine who lives in Florida recommended this to me.  As someone w/ hair that is very curly &amp; frizzy on humid days, which are far too frequent in Raleigh, NC, this has been a real life-saver for me.  I have tried a lot of different hair products over the years to combat the frizziness that inevitably befalls those of us w/ curly hair, but this is the first one I can say really makes a significant difference AND is worth the price.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and slightly shinier when I use this hydrating cream. It is perfect with the Moroccan Oil, but works well without it. A little of this styling cream goes a long way, but it will not leave you hair feeling clumpy. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a hair product person. However, since I began swimming daily for exercise I was getting pretty tired of gunky hair. Ultra Swim (anti-chlorine) shampoo helps. However, I was still having trouble getting my hair to lie down after a shower. A dab of this stuff and it feels like my hair is back to normal. It&#x27;s not cheap, but a single bottle lasts months. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (June &#x27;13): So my barber looked at my hair asked me why I had stopped swimming. I haven&#x27;t, in fact I still swim every day. For fixing swimmer&#x27;s hair, this stuff seems like it is doing the trick.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick and wavy hair. This product lets me blow dry or air dry, and gives me the smoothest, shiniest hair I&#x27;ve ever had outside the salon. In fact, it was recommended by my stylist and I love him for it. The best part, however, is the scent. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get tired of the delicious smell of this styling cream.</li>
            <li> I just love this product, since I use it my hair is very well protected for the continued use of blowers and heated hair rollers.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle, helps to shape your hair to how you want it, appears thicker with much body.  Also has a wonderful fragance. Try it.</li>
            <li> actually a gift bought for my daughter but she was delighted to receive it for christmas! she said it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love! Amazing product:) my hair is softer and less frizzy. I use it every day very light and smells great</li>
            <li> We use this on my daughter&#x27;s very curly hair and keeps them soft and frizz free. Also the smell is great and lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have very fine, fly-away hair, and even though it&#x27;s long the MN winters leave my hair full of static and difficult to manage.  Four to five pumps of this stuff and my hair is controllable all day long without getting greasy and weighed down!  It has now become a staple in my hair care product line up!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice but I do notice a nice shine. I was hoping it made my ends a bit more manageable but they seem the same. It is a strong smell but I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It hydrates as well as smoothes out  all of the tangles in your hair.  It makes blow drying a breeze.</li>
            <li> This is okay but it is not as hydrating as I would have thought. I would probably try the morrocan oil next time instead.</li>
            <li> The styling cream keeps moisture in hair but is light and not oily.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product expecting to get a brand new bottle like from the salon but was dissapointed when that was not the case. The bottle looked warn and old, also one of the bar codes looked to be purposefully scratched off. When I opened the bottle I knew I received something other than what I had ordered. I compared the consistancy and the smell and there was no comparrison to the bottle I already have. The bottle I ordered was more of a thin greasy texture instead of the thick creamy  texture you normally get with a brand new bottle. The smell was not horrible but it just didnt smell right, I almost feel like this was a half used bottle and something was added to make it seem like it was new and full.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it smells great.</li>
