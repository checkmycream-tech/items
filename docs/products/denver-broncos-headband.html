            <li> My wife said it was a bit tight but, admittedly, her head is not small.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time fan of this team</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too tight - and I have a big head - so it doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> Sadly, won&#x27;t wear it another time! :(</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with the seller or their products!</li>

            <li> The bronco on the headband we received is near the end of the headband.  I think it is just luck of the draw.  My wife said it was a bit tight but, admittedly, her head is not small.</li>
            <li> Very well made and has a suede-like inner lining, which was an added plus. I purchased this at the beginning of December and have had a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> 4 granddaughters love them!</li>
            <li> Love love love this! It&#x27;s cute and comfortable</li>
            <li> This is the best head band I have ever had! Very soft, and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head if left on for too long. Is very flexible, and doesn&#x27;t squeeze my head. The seller got back to me right away with the answers to the questions I had, and the shipping was fast, on time. I would definitely recommend the product to anyone! You will not be disappointed with the seller or their products! Very Awesome!</li>
            <li> Although the headband itself was super cute, it was terribly uncomfortable and put pressure on my temples. I had to take it off multiple times during the one day I wore it. Even tried placing cardboard as a buffer, the only thing I could find at work, but it didn&#x27;t relieve the pressure. Sadly, won&#x27;t wear it another time! :(</li>
            <li> I bought a few of these for some of the younger girls in my family for Christmas and they really liked them.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! Highly recommend!!</li>
