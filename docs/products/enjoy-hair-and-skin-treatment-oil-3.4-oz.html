            <li>Sometimes I get too much in my hand when I pour.  </li>
            <li>AND I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>This product really helps with all that</li>
            <li>I could not go out in public with out Enjoy Treatment oil.  </li>
            <li>I really like this - moisturizes without &#x27;grease&#x27;,</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>i really like this hair oil.</li>
            <li>More oily than expected.</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s really why Warehouse Deals reduced the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>and I have not been using it much because I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>I use the entire ENJOY line and have been for about 6 years.  </li>
            <li>If you want silicone you can buy that cheap at your local drug store.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this at the salon, and it is much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much healthier already.</li>
            <li>Fo you lovelies with long hair, color treated hair, or general dry and frizzy this is hands down the best paraben free product for your over styled hair.  </li>
            <li>Never heavy, just right to add to luster and conditioning.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, long, highlighted and very wavy.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products that are more expense</li>
            <li>If you want a good natural oil for dry curly or coarse hair you should try all nutrient oil.</li>
            <li>My hair is able to finally grow out a little because of the light coating and protection that this product provides.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT leave that film in your hair and feels light and smooth,,,,,will be using this for a long time</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair and not many fly aways</li>
            <li>With this product, it is a new whole new world!</li>
            <li>It has helped smooth my hair and helps it dry faster.</li>
            <li>Love the texture and slight scent.</li>
            <li>so nothing goes to waste if you pour too much into your palms. :)</li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of conditioner with the same results.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>People are always so surprised to find out that my hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight.  </li>
            <li>I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;RUNNY and not thick like it should be.</li>
            <li>It makes my damaged bleached hair look normal.</li>
            <li>Warehouse Deals indicated the TWO items I purchased were &amp;#34;Used - Like New, Package Damaged&amp;#34; and the price was 1/3 of Beauty Supply Store Price.</li>
            <li>Live and learn, I won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
            <li>I love using this hair old to calm down the frizz and add some shine to the dry parts of my hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair is not left oily and leaves the hair smooth even when you pull back in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>When I put this hair oil on my hair right after flat ironing......</li>
            <li>products,,this oil especially is the key,,,,i recently tried the Enjoy mask and WOW works</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so soft and frizz-free for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>Update: After I ran out of this product, I got some MoroccanOil (the original), which was much more expensive</li>
            <li>The bottle lasts a long time, too, so it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others but this 1 is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy so can add it right to damp hair before you blow dry.</li>
            <li>I tried it immediately and was pleasantly surprised that it did not leave my hair feeling oily and my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>When I sport my natural hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft, and does not get frizzy using this oil.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and with the summer heat and humidity, it&#x27;s unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Drying time is minimized and my hair is soft and soooo shinny.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair soft and silky, not greasy.</li>
            <li>Soft and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Its very oily and doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs into the hair just sits on the outside making your hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Your skin just drinks it up and it makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was packed in cellophane, the first one wasn&#x27;t; an odd thing to look back on and have to wonder if someone opened the first bottle or if in fact the cellophane machine was inoperable that day.  </li>
            <li>:  Definitely got better results from using on dry hair prior to flat ironing!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li>I take a small amount and work it through the ends first and work a little more up my hair</li>
            <li>After my hair has dried, I simply run a dime size into my troubled areas and my curls look great!  </li>
            <li>(my hair is very fine and thin).</li>
            <li>You only need a little and it will instantly smooth and soften your hair.  </li>
            <li>I also discovered that when using on your hair it will blow dry much faster too.  </li>
            <li>I just apply a nickel&#x27;s amount into my palm and work the product into my damp hair before I blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li>one grand parent from each group (White, Black, Chinese and Native American)</li>
            <li>I have medium thick hair that are neither fine nor coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>generally buy inexpensive makeup and hair products because of the cost savings</li>
            <li>It is not greasy but certainly made a big difference in trying to style my dry hair.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and like to have my hair long</li>
            <li>Immediately after I&#x27;ve applied it, this stuff makes my hair very curly and much more difficult to blow dry straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a little though, or you&#x27;ll look very greasy!</li>
            <li>Just a nickel size dab of this in my hair after a shower and my hair dries soft and shiny whether or not I blow it dry.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s easy to style, too.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil treatment; it&#x27;s not heavy and provides good moisture for your hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice addition to my daily routine, keeps my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and oily and it looks fantastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, and to be able to use on your body and face is a great factor.  </li>
            <li> I have fine frizzie hair.  </li>
            <li> Its incredibly light and has a soft pleasant scent.</li>

            <li> I love this dry oil.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve purchased this particular product.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, I have straight fine hair which I could not imagine putting oil on</li>
            <li> I just think for me this may be more effective when applied to dry hair prior to flat ironing rather than on damp</li>
            <li> With as much processing that I do to my hair</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothin.</li>
            <li> I really notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get too much in my hand when I pour.  </li>
            <li> AND I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> This product really helps with all that</li>
            <li> I could not go out in public with out Enjoy Treatment oil.  </li>

            <li> i really like this hair oil.</li>

            <li> I guess that&#x27;s really why Warehouse Deals reduced the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> and I have not been using it much because I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> I use the entire ENJOY line and have been for about 6 years.  </li>
            <li> If you want silicone you can buy that cheap at your local drug store.</li>

            <li> Never heavy, just right to add to luster and conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, long, highlighted and very wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products that are more expense</li>
            <li> If you want a good natural oil for dry curly or coarse hair you should try all nutrient oil.</li>
            <li> My hair is able to finally grow out a little because of the light coating and protection that this product provides.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT leave that film in your hair and feels light and smooth,,,,,will be using this for a long time</li>

            <li> so nothing goes to waste if you pour too much into your palms. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of conditioner with the same results.  </li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> People are always so surprised to find out that my hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight.  </li>
            <li> I really like it so far.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;RUNNY and not thick like it should be.</li>
            <li> It makes my damaged bleached hair look normal.</li>
            <li> Warehouse Deals indicated the TWO items I purchased were &amp;#34;Used - Like New, Package Damaged&amp;#34; and the price was 1/3 of Beauty Supply Store Price.</li>
            <li> Live and learn, I won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
            <li> I love using this hair old to calm down the frizz and add some shine to the dry parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair is not left oily and leaves the hair smooth even when you pull back in a pony tail.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> When I put this hair oil on my hair right after flat ironing......</li>
            <li> products,,this oil especially is the key,,,,i recently tried the Enjoy mask and WOW works</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and frizz-free for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> Update: After I ran out of this product, I got some MoroccanOil (the original), which was much more expensive</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time, too, so it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others but this 1 is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy so can add it right to damp hair before you blow dry.</li>
            <li> I tried it immediately and was pleasantly surprised that it did not leave my hair feeling oily and my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> When I sport my natural hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft, and does not get frizzy using this oil.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and with the summer heat and humidity, it&#x27;s unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Drying time is minimized and my hair is soft and soooo shinny.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and silky, not greasy.</li>
            <li> Soft and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Its very oily and doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs into the hair just sits on the outside making your hair feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Your skin just drinks it up and it makes your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was packed in cellophane, the first one wasn&#x27;t; an odd thing to look back on and have to wonder if someone opened the first bottle or if in fact the cellophane machine was inoperable that day.  </li>
            <li> :  Definitely got better results from using on dry hair prior to flat ironing!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> I take a small amount and work it through the ends first and work a little more up my hair</li>
            <li> After my hair has dried, I simply run a dime size into my troubled areas and my curls look great!  </li>
            <li> (my hair is very fine and thin).</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it will instantly smooth and soften your hair.  </li>
            <li> I also discovered that when using on your hair it will blow dry much faster too.  </li>
            <li> I just apply a nickel&#x27;s amount into my palm and work the product into my damp hair before I blow dry it straight.</li>
            <li> one grand parent from each group (White, Black, Chinese and Native American)</li>
            <li> I have medium thick hair that are neither fine nor coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> generally buy inexpensive makeup and hair products because of the cost savings</li>
            <li> It is not greasy but certainly made a big difference in trying to style my dry hair.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and like to have my hair long</li>
            <li> Immediately after I&#x27;ve applied it, this stuff makes my hair very curly and much more difficult to blow dry straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little though, or you&#x27;ll look very greasy!</li>
            <li> Just a nickel size dab of this in my hair after a shower and my hair dries soft and shiny whether or not I blow it dry.</li>
            <li> No matter how much you use, it will never leave your hair looking greasy but only a small amount is needed for the job so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> This will last a long time.</li>
            <li> After drying it, I flat iron it to a shiny, silky finish.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and I use a flat iron on it quite a bit</li>
            <li> Some people use it before the flat iron</li>
            <li> This product keeps my hair from being frizzy, prevents flyaways, and helps when I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> Just a dime or quarter-size amount spread through my hair and a flat iron -- voila!  </li>
            <li> I use it daily on dry hair to keep it shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair daily and also on my knees and elbows where my skin gets dry.  </li>
            <li> It is pricey, but one bottle last a very long time, even with very long hair like mine.</li>
            <li> If you flat iron or blow dry your hair</li>
            <li> My only dislike is the opening of the bottle.. you have to be careful when pouring the liquid out.</li>
            <li> Just the tiniest amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have long hair and this is supposed to help with the drying time.  </li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> The only criticism is it&#x27;s hard to regulate the amount you pour out of the bottle, but I still gave it five stars because I rubbed it into my hands and arms, so it&#x27;s not wasted.</li>
            <li> This oil has done wonders for my dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> works well for my kinda hair which is basically dry and tends to knot and tangle.  </li>
            <li> My wavy hair is frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> My hair gets dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I also use it between washing when my ends feel dry.</li>
            <li> I can use this when I blow out my hair, or let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and course.</li>
            <li> so it tends to dry out.</li>
            <li> As soon as I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my dry hair come to life with shine and moisture</li>
            <li> I can wait until after it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended product especially if you use hair straightener everyday like I do.</li>
            <li> I am usually against using any type of product to avoid making my hair greasy or stiff/sticky from hairspray as I always want a natural look.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit on the ends so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> You only need a little in your hand, so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> is my only complaint; the oil comes out a little too fast due to the design of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> It also reduces the time it takes to blow dry your hair which is always a bonus!</li>
            <li> Only one was enclosed in a plastic bag and it was an oily mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;YES, I was surprised that BOTH had half  the contents missing.</li>
            <li> I never go above the ears because my hair will start the look a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because it still left a little oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair when it is wet.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair to protect from blow drying and straightening</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients used within this product worked as expected.  </li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday and it lasts several months even with 4 girls using it.</li>
            <li> I like this because I can put it in my hair while it&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> Used it only a few times, now it just sits on the counter.</li>
            <li> BTW, my hair has really NEVER been manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s length is mid back, layered, but thick.</li>
            <li> I would send it back but not worth dealing with the mess.</li>
            <li> It came quickly &amp; it is quite a bit less expensive than purchasing @ a beauty supply or salon.</li>
            <li> So I expected some product loss, the other one wasn&#x27;t in a plastic bag and it had no signs of leakage.</li>
            <li> With this oil a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very long thick wavy hair and only wash it twice a week</li>
            <li> Have medium/short hair, wash hair every other day and the bottle lasts me 8 months.</li>
            <li> Before I used other company and I thought no one could beat the price</li>
            <li> Other than that one reason</li>
            <li> but I noticed I could get it while ordering other items from amazon.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I put some in my hair when it&#x27;s damp and blow dry with a round bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I have thin waist length high lighted hair and put less than a dime size amount in my hair and that&#x27;s what workss</li>
            <li> and I use it on dry hair to freshen up curls and tame frizz.</li>
            <li> you simply can&#x27;t go wrong here at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> It smells divine and helps me manage my coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> it is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a softness and calms down the frizz.  </li>
            <li> and when I am finished to bring the volume down and give my hair shine and shape.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look a bit oily and doesn&#x27;t appear to weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel silky, but not weighed down and oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No buildup at the hairline like I get with other product!</li>
            <li> I have very thick and full-bodied hair that gets out of control easily, especially after washing.  </li>
            <li> Made a mess and half bottle was gone</li>
            <li> It is a thick and mild-scented oil that absorbs quickly and smooths difficult to tame hair and cuts drying/straightening time dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount on the ends of my hair when wet- before styling.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It does cut down on the drying time, but it makes my hair stiff</li>
            <li> You have to work with the amount to decide how much or little</li>
            <li> The seals on each of the bottles were already broken open and half the contents were gone from each bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It can be a little heavy if you use without blow drying.  </li>
            <li> You will not be let down by this product!</li>
            <li> Upon opening the box, the cap was not securely tighten and had leaked out.  </li>
            <li> Takes care of frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a few weeks now</li>

            <li> After washing your hair, you put a little bit in your hands, rub them together and run it through your hair, then style as usual.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this oil, now I have only ordered it online once, it had leaked. : (</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. My hair is fine and oily and it looks fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks healthy and it added volume</li>
            <li> I have been using Enjoy shampoos and conditioners for quite a while and also use a product similar to Enjoy Hair &amp; Skin Treatment.  I tried it immediately and was pleasantly surprised that it did not leave my hair feeling oily and my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> With as much processing that I do to my hair this is the only thing that saves it. My hair is able to finally grow out a little because of the light coating and protection that this product provides. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Jeezy Creezy Batman this stuff is wonderful! I have never found ANY thing for my hair and I was crazy for...until now. I am a wash and wear hair person and I absolutely hate the feeling of product in my hair. I have very long thick wavy hair and only wash it twice a week so styling products end up feeling and looking gross. This product is perfect. Its incredibly light and has a soft pleasant scent. [...] I have a pour and wipe technique that keeps me from loosing any product. With this oil a little goes a long way. Just pour it in your hands, rub your hands together and start at the ends. I never go above the ears because my hair will start the look a little greasy. Any extra on my hands I just rub into my skin. Voila my hair looks good, frizz free and healthy. This will last a long time. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and the level is still in the neck of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! It&#x27;s so nice going on, reduces drying time, and doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling greasy. Love this oil for hair and cuticles!</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling and nice against the hair and skin. When I sport my natural hair I&#x27;ll truly see just how good this product is :)</li>
            <li> After desperately seeking a hair product that would control my frizz,I have finally found a product that will do just that.  After my hair has dried, I simply run a dime size into my troubled areas and my curls look great!  I would strongly recommend this to anyone with curly hair; although it isn&#x27;t cheap,I promise you that it will be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil treatment; it&#x27;s not heavy and provides good moisture for your hair.  I received the product quickly and will purchase from this seller again.  Thank you for carrying a great product!</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from my wonderful hair dresser.  He is great and this product is great.  It goes a long way, and to be able to use on your body and face is a great factor.  I also discovered that when using on your hair it will blow dry much faster too.  The argon oil in it is great.  Remember it is the Enjoy Hair and Skin Treatment Oil to get.  There are several and this one is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair when it is wet. After drying it, I flat iron it to a shiny, silky finish.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a light, citrusy smell.  I have very thick and full-bodied hair that gets out of control easily, especially after washing.  I just rub a bit of this between my hands and then rub it through my hair.  Follow with a comb and it does nicely to tame flyaways without making my hair either greasy or crunchy.  It is pricey, but one bottle last a very long time, even with very long hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my wife and she LOVES it. It is a very light oil that can be rubbed on skin or hair. I scored extra brownie points with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me for detangling and straightening my hair.  I love it.  It detangles, adds shines, and reduces frizz.  I like it better than enjoy straightener.  Great Price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought as Christmas stocking stuffer.  Person LOVED it!  Said  it works GREAT on her hair and has been using it for quite a while.  A bottle lasts her approx. 3 months.</li>
            <li> This oil has done wonders for my dry brittle hair. I use it on wet hair to protect from blow drying and straightening and I use it on dry hair to freshen up curls and tame frizz. Not a greasy oil. Works great to moisturize skin and hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it on my hair every day after a shower. And in a bind I&#x27;ve used it for my skin  as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!!! I have thick curly hair,,,,and have been getting the Brazillian Blowout for the last 2 years,,,,Enjoy products work waaaaaay better than BB products,,this oil especially is the key,,,,i recently tried the Enjoy mask and WOW works great,,,it DOES NOT leave that film in your hair and feels light and smooth,,,,,will be using this for a long time</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and I know I&#x27;ll be using it all the time! I just apply a nickel&#x27;s amount into my palm and work the product into my damp hair before I blow dry it straight. It leaves my hair so soft and frizz-free for the rest of the day! I love running my fingers through my hair now. My only dislike is the opening of the bottle.. you have to be careful when pouring the liquid out. Other than that small problem, I definetly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients used within this product worked as expected.  I have used this product for many years and find it therapeutic  for hair as well as  skin.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and I was amazed.  You only need a little and it will instantly smooth and soften your hair.  Any left on your hands, you just rub into your hands.  You will not be let down by this product!</li>
            <li> ENjoy is the best and I absolutely love this treatment. It&#x27;s so so so helpful especially in the winter! I use this over any lotion that&#x27;s out there!</li>
            <li> works well for my kinda hair which is basically dry and tends to knot and tangle.  My hair is also wavy to curly and many products will make it tangle....this one does not and it dries up so it&#x27;s not oiley.  great moisturizor</li>
            <li> I have thick, Sicilian (i.e. nappy) hair, and this does the trick. I use it before applying a flat-iron, or I use it before I go to bed. Just a little though, or you&#x27;ll look very greasy! Other good news: it&#x27;s lovely on your elbows or arms or wherever else you want to rub the extra... so nothing goes to waste if you pour too much into your palms. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my hair shiny!</li>
            <li> I love enjoy products and this oil is fabulous!! It smells very good and the scent is light and smells clean in your hair and on skin! I have thin waist length high lighted hair and put less than a dime size amount in my hair and that&#x27;s what workss the best leaving hair soft, managable and with no build up or greasy feel! Also great for dry skin and leaves dry area soft and smooth! A must have on my shelf and a bottle lasts me months! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is really great. It smells wonderful and last quite a while! Ive had this bottle for over 6 months and there is about a fourth of it left! ( i use it every day) it adds shine to your hair and smooths it out nicely :3</li>
            <li> This hair oil works great! You don&#x27;t need much! My wavy hair is frizzy and dry. It make my hair smooth and soft.  No buildup at the hairline like I get with other product! I highly recommend and will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> The item leaked in the box, think it busted while on its way overseas. Tried contacting these guys and after a month later STILL has not heard back. Disappointing and will just continue buying from my hair stylist. Thanks for nothin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, the shaping lotion by enjoy is the best product that I have found to tame my curls. This is a nice addition to my daily routine, keeps my hair in good condition.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I discovered it in a beauty supply store a few years ago and was really pleased with how shiny and healthy it leaves my hair.  After washing your hair, you put a little bit in your hands, rub them together and run it through your hair, then style as usual.  I really notice a difference when I don&#x27;t use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my only complaint; the oil comes out a little too fast due to the design of the bottle.  Sometimes I get too much in my hand when I pour.  I would like this better if the pour could be controlled better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/26/13 Update: After I ran out of this product, I got some MoroccanOil (the original), which was much more expensive AND I really didn&#x27;t like the smell.  Worked the same as the cheaper version, though.[[ASIN:B001AO0WCG Moroccan Oil Hair Treatment 3.4 Oz Bottle with Blue Box]]</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Been using for some time. I have silver gray hair; makes my hair soft and looking good. Price is good.</li>
            <li> This oil is useful for so many different types of hair.  No matter how much you use, it will never leave your hair looking greasy but only a small amount is needed for the job so it lasts a long time.  Good for keeping moisture out!  Even days later and trying to wash my hair I have to wash it twice just to get the shower water to penetrate through this wonderful product.  Also very good for skin moisturizing and scalp treatments.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This works great and smells good...</li>
            <li> This oil really works - made my wifes hair shiny and smooth  She got compliments from others  Now she swears by it  Just wish it was cheaper, hence 4 stars!  Recommended</li>
            <li> This product is light-weight yet controls my naturally curly hair beautifully, even when it is raining.  No need to use chemical straighteners any more.  Just a dime or quarter-size amount spread through my hair and a flat iron -- voila!  People are always so surprised to find out that my hair isn&#x27;t naturally straight.  Love, love, love this product.  For me, it is the best there is on the market.</li>
            <li> When used with the Enjoy brand shampoos, I noticed how soft my hair feels and how healthy it looks.  I also noticed that this product is also for skin so I tried it on my face and loved that as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  Works magic on unruly hair!</li>
            <li> I love this item.  I am ordering it for the 2nd time.  I love the way it makes my hair feel.  Great price because the hair and beauty salons sell it for much more.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> She got some a handful of months ago and now having run out, I ordered her more.&lt;br /&gt;It was packed in cellophane, the first one wasn&#x27;t; an odd thing to look back on and have to wonder if someone opened the first bottle or if in fact the cellophane machine was inoperable that day.  It would be too hard to find out but thats why we have immune systems.</li>
            <li> The BEST!!  Have been using for 2 years and love this product for a healthy shine and a detangler. Have medium/short hair, wash hair every other day and the bottle lasts me 8 months.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product</li>
            <li> The best product for any hair type I recommend to anyone that wants good hair you simply can&#x27;t go wrong here at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a year. Nothing else makes my hair so shiny and smooth. You only need a little bit on the ends so the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the Quick Delivery. I will be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like there is product in my hair at all!  It keeps it moisturized and my hair doesn&#x27;t get static-y at all when I use this product.  HIGHLY recommend.  I have VERY thick and wavy hair that does NOT respond well to humidity.  This product seems to help with an impossible job.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair perfect, but it&#x27;s much more manageable with this product in it.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer for your hair and skin in one bottle.  Controls frizz, detangler.  A little goes a very long way.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is an excellent hair treatment, it is very costly in retail stores, was happy to find it on line.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and like to have my hair long but Arizona weather is having none of it. My hair gets dry and frizzy. This product really helps with all that and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. I already buy there conditioner and that is the best so I was very happy to see another product by them being excellent too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many many years. It came quickly &amp; it is quite a bit less expensive than purchasing @ a beauty supply or salon. You only need a little in your hand, so the bottle lasts a long time. This is by far my favorite oil. I&#x27;ve tried others but this 1 is light and doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down. Plus, it smells good.</li>
            <li> Its great for my curly hair and half the price as at the salon!! Smells great too!!Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!  Really great conditioner and it makes hair shine.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on me. I bought it as a light leave in after washing my hair. I also use it between washing when my ends feel dry. It has a light scent and feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product and the best was the price! Before I used other company and I thought no one could beat the price but Amazon.com did it! yeah! I am extremely happy because I used not only for my hair also for my skin andIt works so good!</li>
            <li> Enjoy Treatment Oil is a great product.  I love that it helps my hair to dry more quickly saving time in my morning rush to blow it dry.  Also, it does a pretty good job of taming fly-aways for most of the day.  I equally enjoy the fact that putting it on my hair each morning helps to soften my hands as it is both Hair and Skin Oil.  Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so soft, and does not get frizzy using this oil. It&#x27;s easy to style, too. Great results!</li>
            <li> Beware of purchases from this company - their shipping method is below standard.  I purchased two boxes.  One box was saturated with the oil.  Upon opening the box, the cap was not securely tighten and had leaked out.  So instead of having two boxes of oil, I have only 1.5!  What a shame.</li>
            <li> I use this product with every shampoo.  A drop or two all it takes for my short hair.  It is not greasy but certainly made a big difference in trying to style my dry hair. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I could not go out in public with out Enjoy Treatment oil.  It works as well (maybe better!) than the much more expensive Moroccan oil I was buying before.  My hair is curly to wavy, has a lot of body, and tends to get very very frizzy in the humidity.  This treatment oil tames my hair so it can look smooth and silky whether I&#x27;m wearing it curly or straight.</li>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Amazing. The best hair oil on the market. Smells amazing. I have very long, thick wavy hair. I can use this when I blow out my hair, or let it air dry. Takes care of frizz, and doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or heavy. Holy Grail product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for a few weeks now and I love it. I have long straight hair and not many fly aways but it sometimes looks dull. I use about a dime size after washing my hair and rub it all over mostly on the ends. It makes my hair very smooth and shiny and doesnt look greasy or oily at all! There is no residue left in my hair and it still feels light.&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> Can be used on skin or hair.  I really like this - moisturizes without &#x27;grease&#x27;, controls humidity effect on hair.  Just a real nice product</li>
            <li> My hair stylist uses this product in her salon, so I was pleased to find it online. It smells divine and helps me manage my coarse, thick hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know which I love the most, they way this adds a perfect touch of softness to my hair, or the amazing smell. I have a lot of allergies, so I&#x27;m sensitive to many hair and skin products. But not THIS one.</li>
            <li> I have fine frizzie hair.  This is the only product that tames the friz.</li>
            <li> This was a restock purchase. My daughter and I love, love, love this product. My hairstylist introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> i really like this hair oil. it is lightweight and does not weigh my hair down (my hair is very fine and thin). has helped me to keep my hear look healthy after i got a perm</li>
            <li> Add this to the ends of your hair for moisture and smoothed out, healthy looking hair! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> smells amazing and makes my dry ends (b/w hair cuts) look healthy and silky. will purchase again and again. love it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Like liquid gold for your hair. Also great on the elbows and heals. Not sticky, and leaves hair silky smooth. Just the tiniest amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. My hair is dry and course. I use it daily on dry hair to keep it shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Terrific product. Have used several years and still love it. Never heavy, just right to add to luster and conditioning.</li>
            <li> Marvelous conditioning, doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky, and your hair dries faster.  I recommend it for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> More oily than expected. Its very thick. I am using it weekly and not daily.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on the recommendation of my hair stylist.  I love it!  Use it every day after I shampoo and condition. A tiny bit goes a long way.  It&#x27;s great for blow dryer days.  It can be a little heavy if you use without blow drying.  Made my hair much softer and got rid of the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34; of my fine, extra-dry hair.</li>
            <li> Warehouse Deals indicated the TWO items I purchased were &amp;#34;Used - Like New, Package Damaged&amp;#34; and the price was 1/3 of Beauty Supply Store Price. The postal shipping box had NO damage.  Only one was enclosed in a plastic bag and it was an oily mess. So I expected some product loss, the other one wasn&#x27;t in a plastic bag and it had no signs of leakage. The seals on each of the bottles were already broken open and half the contents were gone from each bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YES, I was surprised that BOTH had half  the contents missing. I guess that&#x27;s really why Warehouse Deals reduced the price. I am disappointed that the condition of the items was not fully disclosed so that I, could make an informed purchase decision. Live and learn, I won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t help with my flyaways like I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;But...it is great for reducing drying time!! I put this in my towel dried hair and then I do my make-up. It&#x27;s usually already air dried quite a bit by the time I&#x27;m done and it dries in a snap with my blow dryer. Great to reduce the time it takes to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 years. It has helped smooth my hair and helps it dry faster. I&#x27;ve also got my mom and sister hooked on this hair serum. I also like the intensive repair serum.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price. Arrived earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> Superior hair treatment!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair is medium length and I use a flat iron on it quite a bit so it tends to dry out. Just a nickel size dab of this in my hair after a shower and my hair dries soft and shiny whether or not I blow it dry. My hairdresser always comments on how nice my hair feels and I get compliments from friends all the time. The scent is mild and not perfume-y at all. Strongly recommend!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite hair product. I am usually against using any type of product to avoid making my hair greasy or stiff/sticky from hairspray as I always want a natural look. My hairdresser introduced me to this product and I have been hooked ever since! I have naturally curly, frizzy hair and with the summer heat and humidity, it&#x27;s unmanageable. With this product, it is a new whole new world! It adds shine, makes my hair soft and smooth and controls the frizz. It&#x27;s a great product and does not make your hair greasy at all! It also reduces the time it takes to blow dry your hair which is always a bonus! I would highly recommend this product! It&#x27;s reasonably priced and works wonders - totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Great price. Love this product.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount on the ends of my hair when wet- before styling. Makes my hair SUPER soft and manageable.  Smells good- not overpowering or strong.  It gives my hair a softness and calms down the frizz.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my body- seems like it would be a bit too heavy for me. I do color my hair and it is fairly thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> I only use it for my hair and have never used it on my skin. I have medium thick hair that are neither fine nor coarse.&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;More light weight than Pura D&#x27;or argan oil (argan oil is good for skin, but too oily for hair)&lt;br /&gt;Smells better than Morrocanoil (less perfume smell), and less expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;Would&#x27;ve liked a pump bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost every hair serum known to man. What&#x27;s best is it works great with all hair types! Enjoy hair oil treatment smooths out hair cuticles without leaving hair greasy or oily. My hair&#x27;s length is mid back, layered, but thick. I only use a quarter size.  A little goes a long way.  I call it liquid gold for my hair! I can finally ENJOY Fighting Florida&#x27;s Frizz!  It&#x27;s a &#x27;must have&#x27; for anyone who wants manageable, smooth, soft, healthy, hair.&lt;br /&gt;With my Amazon Prime account I received the package in two days.  It arrived in perfect condition.  Thank you for carrying this great product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful hair product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Not heavy or greasy, but helps the ends of hair look healthy.</li>
            <li> Great for dry climates. I use daily and add to the hair mask for better moisturizing</li>
            <li> I love the softness and shine it gives to my hair.  I discovered leave-in conditioner about the time this arrived.  Together, they work great and the frizz is gone -- love my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have long hair and this is supposed to help with the drying time.  It does cut down on the drying time, but it makes my hair stiff and I have not been using it much because I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, long, highlighted and very wavy.  As soon as I towel dry my hair I use this oil.  Immediately after I&#x27;ve applied it, this stuff makes my hair very curly and much more difficult to blow dry straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that many oil based styling products tend to make hair curlier when applied to damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, it does have a nice fragrance and makes the hair very shiny!  I just think for me this may be more effective when applied to dry hair prior to flat ironing rather than on damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 11-14:  Definitely got better results from using on dry hair prior to flat ironing!  Adds softness, shine and mends splits ends.  Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Fo you lovelies with long hair, color treated hair, or general dry and frizzy this is hands down the best paraben free product for your over styled hair.  It does not leave you greasy.  I use the entire ENJOY line and have been for about 6 years.  I cannot tell you how may bottles of this I have purchased from Amazon, but whenever I start running low I always re-order.  I have tried other products that are more expense and this is the best thing out their for the price.  Your hair is not left oily and leaves the hair smooth even when you pull back in a pony tail.  No pony tail lines in the hair!</li>
            <li> When I put this hair oil on my hair right after flat ironing......I always get compliments on my hair through out the day. I take a small amount and work it through the ends first and work a little more up my hair but I always stop when I get close to the scalp/ head area. It makes my dry hair come to life with shine and moisture plus it keeps the frizz away. Some people use it before the flat iron but I use it only after because I think it would be to gunky that way.</li>
            <li> Hair dries fast and is smooth.  Love the feel.</li>
            <li> Was unable to get it from my salon.  My hairdresser used to use this on my hair and the salon stop providing it for the hairdressers.  I love this oil and how it makes my hair feels.</li>
            <li> Hair is silky, smooth and not oily or greasy at all! Best recommendation available! $10 cheaper than at the salon for an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Gives hair a shine and helps in drying a tad quicker.</li>
            <li> I selected this product at the recommendation of my hairstylist.  Amazon was $10.00 cheaper than the retail price at the salon.  I really like it so far.  I needed a product that contained the frizzies.  It doesn&#x27;t get rid of the frizzies all together but I&#x27;m okay with that.  Drying time is minimized and my hair is soft and soooo shinny.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner oil is as it says.... great for hair and skin.  It is oily right when you put it in your hand to put in your hair, however, it is not an oily consistency at all.  It absorbs into a soft, non oily product and feels great on your skin.  After putting it in my hair, I will rub it on my arms and into my hands and no need to wash them after, its silky smooth with no oily feeling at all</li>
            <li> I love using this hair old to calm down the frizz and add some shine to the dry parts of my hair.</li>
            <li> This does not make my hair any softer or shinier. It DOES speed up the blow drying process.  Other than that one reason, I have to say this product is just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this moooonths ago and im just now almost done with it. Will be buying another one!</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product in my area but I noticed I could get it while ordering other items from amazon. It was a big mistake! This product is usually VERY thick and the two bottles I received are WATERED DOWN. THE OIL IS VERY&lt;br /&gt;RUNNY and not thick like it should be. And it does not do the job.  A trip to the store would have saved me a lot of aggravation and money.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended product especially if you use hair straightener everyday like I do. I have use this product for a year now and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!  Put it on my hair after I wash before I blow-dry.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff. Way better price than my salon. Makes your hair soft and silky, not greasy. Smells great. Citrusy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, not greasy, great on hair and skin</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than several silicone products. If you want a good natural oil for dry curly or coarse hair you should try all nutrient oil. Not to mention the lid broke when I opened it. I would send it back but not worth dealing with the mess. If you want silicone you can buy that cheap at your local drug store.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair to keep it in check. It lasts FOREVER and truly helps keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my hair! I use it almost everyday and it lasts several months even with 4 girls using it. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, couldn&#x27;t be happier. Reduces drying time, increases shine and softness, lightweight, non-greasy, and absorbs immediately.  Looking forward to the humidity control this summer.</li>
            <li> When product arrived the bottle cap was open and the oil got everywhere. Made a mess and half bottle was gone</li>
            <li> My stylist turned me onto this great product. I have fine hair and it does not weigh it down. Only have to use a dime size and my hair looks fabulous after a blow-dry!</li>
            <li> Works as good as Moroccan oil. Soft and shiny hair. Not greasy. Do not apply to roots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s winter again, and I refuse to use conditioner because it leaves my hair heavy and greasy.  I have tried many different types of conditioner with the same results.  I like this because I can put it in my hair while it&#x27;s wet and it dries faster, or I can wait until after it&#x27;s dry and it adds shine and moisture to my hair.  Either way it improves the overall look and feel.  A bottle lasts a long time, too!</li>
            <li> Makes for shiny, softer, healthier hair styling. My hair stylist uses it all the time when I visit.  It can also be used on your skin for softer feeling.</li>
            <li> LOVE this oil....smells great and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy!  My hairdresser swears by it as well and this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product. If you flat iron or blow dry your hair its a must have. Love the texture and slight scent.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so healthy!!  ENJOY hair and skin treatment isn&#x27;t oily like some&lt;br /&gt;oil conditioners I have tried.  This is my second bottle and I still love what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I live in FL where the sun can do great damage!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair and skin oil treatment out there it work from the first time. I love it and I have a difficult hair because I multiracial (&#x3D;one grand parent from each group (White, Black, Chinese and Native American)</li>
            <li> I love this dry oil. It feel wonderful on your skin and hair. It&#x27;s not greasy so can add it right to damp hair before you blow dry. My hair looks soft and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this at the salon, and it is much cheaper on Amazon.  I have medium length hair, which is coarse.  I use a dab about the size of a nickel.  My hair is then tangle free and dries more quickly.  there is NO oily residue.  great product.</li>
            <li> This product is much more expensive when you attempt to purchase it from a salon, since I found it on Amazon, I do not purchase it any where else.  I love this product and enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Great product -- you just need a little bit!  Works well with the Enjoy Straightening product!  This is the first time that I&#x27;ve purchased this particular product.  It works good.</li>
            <li> A stylist used this oil on my hair in the salon and I loved it so much I took a picture of the bottle so I could go home and buy it immediately.  It is a thick and mild-scented oil that absorbs quickly and smooths difficult to tame hair and cuts drying/straightening time dramatically.  I was worried that it would make my hair look greasy but it doesn&#x27;t at all - just shiny, smooth and awesome.  The bottle lasts a long time, too, so it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this fantastic product.  I have a Keratin treatment on my hair and I use the oil before I blow it out and when I am finished to bring the volume down and give my hair shine and shape.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of the other popular oils on the market but this is the only one that works for me.  You have to work with the amount to decide how much or little that you want.&lt;br /&gt;I find when I use it for the finish, I don&#x27;t use very much otherwise you get greasy hair.  Not so good.  But I would be lost without it.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  Useful for hair and skin with a very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat curly hair that is not the cute kind and has a mind of its own!  This product keeps my hair from being frizzy, prevents flyaways, and helps when I flat iron my hair - I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally buy inexpensive makeup and hair products because of the cost savings but this is one item I spurge on because it works so well.  I always buy it from Amazon because the salons charge around $36 for it.</li>
            <li> In love the enjoy hair products but this,  not so much. Its very oily and doesn&#x27;t feel like it absorbs into the hair just sits on the outside making your hair feel greasy. Used it only a few times, now it just sits on the counter. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Gave a high rating because the other products are great! Love the shampoos! They make my hair feel amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Best oil for my coarse hair</li>
            <li> I used this just once on my dry skin and really liked it.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 starts because it still left a little oily feeling.  I have never found a lotion that didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This is liquid Gold!!!  I use it on my hair daily and also on my knees and elbows where my skin gets dry.  This is not a &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; oil.  It is nice and thick and great for taming frizz.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, it&#x27;s the real deal! This product is great for hair and skin! Good to use for extensions instead of heavier oil products</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Perfect for my childrens&#x27; bi-racial hair and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than buying it at the salon. Protects my hair from the hot irons. Leaves it soft and smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> I have never used a skin oil that does not leave your skin feeling oily. This product is amazing. Your skin just drinks it up and it makes your skin really soft. It is not over scented like many products are. I would recommend this product to every one it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I must admit I was hesitant to try this for two reasons. Firstly, it is expensive. Secondly, I have straight fine hair which I could not imagine putting oil on and it wouldn&#x27;t look oily and stringy. However, I was bothered by the increasingly \\&quot;straw\\&quot; look of my ends. Ugh! Due to the highly enthusiastic reviews, I decided to take a chance. Am I glad I did. This stufff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my damp ends, then blow dried. My hair looks much healthier already. It&#x27;s so soft and manageable. BTW, my hair has really NEVER been manageable. Doesn&#x27;t look a bit oily and doesn&#x27;t appear to weigh my hair down at all.The only criticism is it&#x27;s hard to regulate the amount you pour out of the bottle, but I still gave it five stars because I rubbed it into my hands and arms, so it&#x27;s not wasted. Now, I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Enjoy products I always get complements on my hair how full and Healthy it looks. Will never stop using this product WORTH the Price.</li>
            <li> The perfect hair care product! I live in NH and this is a must for protecting my hair from the cold and wind. It makes my hair feel silky, but not weighed down and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot live without my enjoy products! Worth the investment</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, kind of like candy but not too sweet of a smell. I put some in my hair when it&#x27;s damp and blow dry with a round bristle brush. It makes my damaged bleached hair look normal. I use it constantly and it has never made my hair feel oily or greasy.</li>
