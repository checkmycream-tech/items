            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love this line of products!</li>
            <li>I read in Redbook Magazine that this was the top makeup remover in 2011.</li>
            <li>but I would doubt it was the top makeup remover in 2011.</li>
            <li>I have used many cleansers  and I love this one.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and the cost is great.  </li>
            <li>I love this product&#x27;s oil-free, smooth consistency.</li>
            <li>It works nicely as a face wash and it much cheaper than buying it through an Avon rep. Nuff said!</li>
            <li>I have normal/oily skin which is extremely fair and very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>The best I found before this was the Burt&#x27;s Bees soap bark/chamomile deep cleansing cream, which works very well, but</li>
            <li>It gets my face super clean (as clean as the Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>I have used this for a long time, it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>I like this gentle cleanser, works as well as many higher priced product, and because it comes in a tube, it travels well.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34; skin and this one gets her skin clean without causing breakouts or over drying.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it does a better job than my last</li>
            <li>I rated this product a 5 star because of the way my face feels smooth and soft after washing.</li>

            <li>My face feels very clean after using it, then I add a few&lt;br /&gt; other anti aging Avon  products</li>
            <li>While I think it gets a lot more off my face than my previous remover, it still doesn&#x27;t get all my eye makeup off and there are traces of foundation on a cottonball when I use another cleanser (for acne).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Avon Anew Ultimate Age Repair Cleanser as well as the Avon Anew 7s Ultimate Gold  and love the way the cleansers make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>I wear pretty sheer makeup</li>
            <li>This was my first Avon facial cleanser purchase.</li>
            <li>Just a small amount is all you need, goes on smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin.</li>

            <li> I love this product!  After chemo it was the only line I found that helped bring my skin back...</li>
            <li> I read in Redbook Magazine that this was the top makeup remover in 2011. While I think it gets a lot more off my face than my previous remover, it still doesn&#x27;t get all my eye makeup off and there are traces of foundation on a cottonball when I use another cleanser (for acne). I gave it 3 stars because it does a better job than my last but I would doubt it was the top makeup remover in 2011. I wear pretty sheer makeup so I dont&#x27; want anyone to think I&#x27;m trying to take a clown face off with this! ha</li>
            <li> I have used many cleansers  and I love this one.  It is very moisturizing and the cost is great.  It compares to a lot of the very expensive cleansers.</li>
            <li> It works nicely as a face wash and it much cheaper than buying it through an Avon rep. Nuff said!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING AVON FOR A LONG TIME AND THIS CLEANSER IS ALL I BUY&lt;br /&gt;AND IT GOES ON SO SILKY AND MAKES YOUR FACE FEEL WONDERFUL</li>
            <li> I like this gentle cleanser, works as well as many higher priced product, and because it comes in a tube, it travels well.</li>
            <li> Love this line of products!</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 5 star because of the way my face feels smooth and soft after washing. The price is way lower than if I were to order from Avon website. It arrive in less time than it was suppose to. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time, it is a good product.  My face feels very clean after using it, then I add a few&lt;br /&gt; other anti aging Avon  products</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product.  Went back to using the Ultimate line.</li>
            <li> I had an Avon lady, then we movedl</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Avon Anew Ultimate Age Repair Cleanser as well as the Avon Anew 7s Ultimate Gold  and love the way the cleansers make my skin feel. The Platinum cleanser dried my skin so badly that I had to use extra moisturizer. I ordered 3 tubes because it was cheaper than the other Avon Anew cleansers. I  have 1 opened and 2 unopened tubes that I will not use. I wouldn&#x27;t use the cleanser if someone gave it to me!</li>
            <li> Cleanser works well. Does not dry your skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34; skin and this one gets her skin clean without causing breakouts or over drying. Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Used the cleanser for the first time today and was very surprised how well it cleaned.  Just a small amount is all you need, goes on smooth and creamy.  Have been using Avon 2 in 1 facial wash, and will now be using the platinum cleanser.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my mom for christmas as a gift and she was so happy. It made me happy that the price was good so I could afford to get this for her.</li>
            <li> This was my first Avon facial cleanser purchase. I have normal/oily skin which is extremely fair and very sensitive.  I had been using a variety of other brands (some inexpensive, some pricey) before this. The best I found before this was the Burt&#x27;s Bees soap bark/chamomile deep cleansing cream, which works very well, but which leaves some oil behind on the face.  I love this product&#x27;s oil-free, smooth consistency. I hardly have to use any product at all.  It gets my face super clean (as clean as the Burt&#x27;s Bees I was using), but does not irritate it, and does not leave behind any oily residue.  I am a fan!  I will definitely be re-buying this when my tube runs out (which will be a LONG time from now).</li>
            <li> This comes out hard and is very slipperty.  Will go back to the other cleanser even though it is more expensive</li>
