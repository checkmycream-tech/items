            <li>Bravo China!&lt;br /&gt;For $12 shipped to USA, you provide a good product.</li>
            <li>I guess if you&#x27;re good at sharpening knives/blades</li>
            <li>For the price it is good.</li>
            <li>but all they do is hide the edge and look good.</li>
            <li>I still think this is a good razor to start with if you are unsure if you want to proceed into striaght razor shaving and do not want to spend a fortune.</li>
            <li>i was very pleased with this item</li>
            <li>Great gift for a son or first time shaver but not for the experienced.</li>
            <li>The concern is that the blade itself has a defect which is potentially hazardous.</li>
            <li>and I prefer a nice counter weight to the blade.  </li>
            <li>Nice looking.  </li>
            <li>Buy this, make your own scales or buy them, boom, great straight razor.</li>
            <li>The handle is very light</li>
            <li>It took a while to hone but has a nice weight and actually shaves quite nice once you put a good bevel on it!</li>
            <li>The blade is fine, the scales are nice, oiled when received;however</li>
            <li>but I found the overall aesthetics to be perfectly in line with its pricetag and did not hinder use whatsoever.</li>
            <li>, I can buy literally 10 of these or more for the price of one masterpiece razor and with these, if I dropone or harm one I don&#x27;t care -</li>
            <li>stars, for sure, this isn&#x27;t a purchase I regret at all.</li>
            <li>and i am glad i did.</li>
            <li>While the price is great this is not shave ready.</li>
            <li>The scales are, for the lack of a better word, trash.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I still feel like this shaves better than those ones still.</li>
            <li>the factory this blades edge is OK.</li>
            <li>It cuts peach fuzz here and there, but i think it does a LOT better if you redo the edge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find them to be better.</li>
            <li>Have yet to get an edge on it that I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li>This razor has helped me learn how to properly strop now that I have found an excellent cut throat razor that does shave my face with ease.</li>
            <li>This razor will shave the hair from arms and legs easily with a good stropping but in my case, it never gave me a good facial shave.</li>
            <li>Good lower-priced straight razor.  </li>
            <li>decided to give this razor a shot because I had read that the steel quality is high and that its a good value and boy were they telling the truth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it should shave very well and very easily.</li>
            <li>Background:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to straight razor shaving for beard trimming because it&#x27;s just easier and more forgiving than a shavette</li>
            <li>so I was able to hone it up without much work</li>
            <li>I was able to get it shave ready.</li>
            <li>This razor came ready to shave and had a great shave right before work had all my co workers asking how I got such a smooth shave</li>
            <li>my experience with the \\&quot;Gold Dollar\\&quot; straight razor was marvelous compaired to the extremely costly straight razors out there!</li>
            <li>end result is a 20.00 razor that shaves identically well to the most high end razors that</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine with me because I wanted a stainless steel blade.</li>
            <li>As far as the blade goes, I was able to get it to a decent shave very quickly and with a bit of work</li>
            <li>am sold on this brand and I will be buying another one, the steel quality is there to take and hold an edge, the production Q/C is high enough that the razor is good as a functional tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The grounding on it is kinda funky but other than that it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Add a few more bucks to the budget and get something better.</li>
            <li>Its less work to hone your own edge than it is to re hone the factory edge.</li>
            <li>When given a proper stropping, works fine</li>
            <li>A CHEAP  KNOCK OFF  OF THE  ACTUAL RAZOR  </li>
            <li>and I told them I use a Gold Dollar straight razor</li>
            <li>The blade really doesn&#x27;t seem to want to hold an edge.</li>
            <li>Made for a very tug &amp; pull shave.</li>
            <li>razor does not come &#x27;shave ready&#x27; unless otherwise stated (and even then distrusted)</li>
            <li>Holds an edge really well.</li>
            <li>This appears to be the real deal on the blade.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend decided on this one and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I am a novice straight razor user.</li>
            <li>But for now, i can test it and see if I even want to shave with a straight razor as opposed to disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how much I strop this razor, it does not shave my face well.</li>
            <li>cut throat straight razor that I now use.</li>
            <li>(You can Google what a Shavette is if you dont know) and own several European razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Super super sharp.</li>
            <li>If you are someone looking for a &#x27;pretty&#x27; razor this may be pretty enough to impress them, but it&#x27;s not a work of art</li>
            <li>The steel is decent and will take an edge.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fairly heavy and the scales seem very cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li>I think the difference between the high end ones and this one is the length of time it will maintain an edge.</li>
            <li>In the pictures above, you see a nice display type case, but what I got was a little pouch.</li>
            <li>it sure did for the past 3</li>
            <li>second thing I noticed was that its master grind (the most important grind on a razor) was dead center</li>
            <li>Next time, I shall get a straight razor made in either England or Germany.  </li>
            <li>To you belongs the future, just don&#x27;t screw your people too much in the process.</li>
            <li>took about a month to recieve cause it was shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>so i had it honned &amp; stropped professionally in a barber shop before using.</li>
            <li>Definitely was not shave ready.  </li>
            <li>When this came it was not sharp enough to shave with... which defeats the whole purpose of having it.</li>
            <li>The blade is high quality and very sharp.....very sharp.  </li>
            <li>The razor will give you a nice shave with a little sharpening, and the scales won&#x27;t fall off from a little handling.</li>
            <li>but was not sharp.</li>
            <li>NO straight razor comes &#x27;shave ready&#x27;</li>
            <li>No straight razor comes shave ready.</li>
            <li>, it was not very sharp, had to be rehoned in order to be used.</li>
            <li>Being it is stainless steel it takes a long, long time to sharpen by hand.</li>
            <li>It is not sharp enough out of the box to shave.  </li>
            <li>razor arrived and the first thing I noticed was that it was properly aligned with its scales - it closed dead center, making this a perfectly useful tool.&lt;br</li>

            <li> My husband did not like it that much it was not as sharp as he expected</li>
            <li> This blade is razor sharp after it is properly stropped without question.</li>
            <li> Actually was a small crack that upon touch and visual inspection was correctly identified.</li>
            <li> and it would only get about half and couldn&#x27;t cut some hairs at all</li>
            <li> This razor does not really shave- unless you are a cowboy with the shaving and stubble standards of a cowboy.</li>
            <li> I spent about $18 on this one, i spent anywhere from $3 to $10 on the ebay ones each.</li>
            <li> bought this as part of a project knowing the finish was poor and that I was basically buying a straight razor &amp;#34;blank&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> and I am most disappointed.  </li>
            <li> arrived not as sharp as it should be . . .</li>
            <li> Handle quality is my only issue, I still gave 5 stars because it is a small issue.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty but sharp and can be sharpened to shaving quality.</li>
            <li> The other 3 took A LOT of work with sharpening stones to even cut peach fuzz, let alone whiskers.</li>
            <li> The other ones had a V shape to the edge.</li>
            <li> While it is sharp, it does not come shaving sharp.  </li>
            <li> My score is the average of 5 stars as a kit, and 1 star as a functioning razor.</li>
            <li> Pulled it out of the package and dropped it less than 6 inches to the counter and the blade shattered.</li>
            <li> Only can cut thin hairs, but does nothing when it comes to cutting the coarse facial hair, which I actually need it for.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and takes a keen edge (with a little effort).</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> However, the grind is off in a few places and it came with an uneven bevel.</li>
            <li> I stropped it a few time to see if it can catch any hairs at all</li>
            <li> The faux graphite scales, while completely functional, look cheesy in person.</li>
            <li> They are uneven, flimsy, positioned out of wack etc.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get sharp.</li>
            <li> They were thick blades, and as sharp as a butter knife from the factory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get over it because I bought this inexpensive razor only to practice sharpening it before I sharpen my expensive Dovo razor with which I plan to shave.  </li>
            <li> The edge is very uneven.</li>
            <li> This blade, on half width through, goes to as thin as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> It was dull, and after sitting on the bathroom sink it began to corrode or rust.</li>
            <li> The blade is flimsy and dull and hardly works.</li>
            <li> Also the handle is terrible plastic that would be super slipped while shaving.</li>
            <li> POORLY  </li>
            <li> but it didnt come ready to use, the handle is absolutely horrible; being plastic and making the device unbalanced.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I could not shave with this razor out of the box.</li>
            <li> Anyone who just &#x27;buys&#x27; a razor and puts it to their face is doing something dangerous and foolish and should be well advised to do their homework - it may save you some skin, literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i have no idea what the crazy price ones are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade itself isnt too bad</li>
            <li> This product is without question, the VERY WORST item I have ever purchased through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Does a horrible job of shaving.</li>
            <li> Worst shave ever.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great price but was not sharp.</li>
            <li> This product is without question, the VERY WORST item I have ever purchased through Amazon.  I paid almost $ 20.00 for it and I am most disappointed.  The item is poorly made, CHEAP.  I notice that it says MADE IN CHINA on the wrapping.  Next time, I shall get a straight razor made in either England or Germany.  What a waste of time and money.  I would like to get my money back on this item.  Help me, Jeff Bezos !</li>
            <li> Bravo China!&lt;br /&gt;For $12 shipped to USA, you provide a good product. To you belongs the future, just don&#x27;t screw your people too much in the process.</li>
            <li> When this came it was not sharp enough to shave with... which defeats the whole purpose of having it.</li>
            <li> The blade is fine, the scales are nice, oiled when received;however, it was not very sharp, had to be rehoned in order to be used. Great gift for a son or first time shaver but not for the experienced.</li>
            <li> took about a month to recieve cause it was shipped directly from China. i was very pleased with this item so i had it honned &amp; stropped professionally in a barber shop before using. my experience with the \\&quot;Gold Dollar\\&quot; straight razor was marvelous compaired to the extremely costly straight razors out there!</li>
            <li> A CHEAP  KNOCK OFF  OF THE  ACTUAL RAZOR  POORLY  MADE  I WOULDNT  SHAVE A DOGS  ASS  WITH  THIS  THING  ....  HORIBLE  WOULD  GIVE  NEGITIVE  STARS  BUT  IT  WONT  LET  ME</li>
            <li> It was dull, and after sitting on the bathroom sink it began to corrode or rust.</li>
            <li> This razor came ready to shave and had a great shave right before work had all my co workers asking how I got such a smooth shave and I told them I use a Gold Dollar straight razor</li>
            <li> The blade really doesn&#x27;t seem to want to hold an edge. Made for a very tug &amp; pull shave. Also, there&#x27;s no decal on the blade itself (like in the picture). I guess if you&#x27;re good at sharpening knives/blades and you have the equipment, by all means purchase this blade.</li>
            <li> For the price it is good. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and takes a keen edge (with a little effort). However, the grind is off in a few places and it came with an uneven bevel. It&#x27;s also fairly heavy and the scales seem very cheaply constructed. Save up and buy a dovo.</li>
            <li> My husband did not like it that much it was not as sharp as he expected actually he used it only once</li>
            <li> Background:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to straight razor shaving for beard trimming because it&#x27;s just easier and more forgiving than a shavette (You can Google what a Shavette is if you dont know) and own several European razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give this razor a shot because I had read that the steel quality is high and that its a good value and boy were they telling the truth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the novices:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not come &#x27;shave ready&#x27; unless otherwise stated (and even then distrusted) NO straight razor comes &#x27;shave ready&#x27; they all require proper honing, stropping and subsequent maintenance - this is an industry NORM that ALL should understand and know! Anyone who just &#x27;buys&#x27; a razor and puts it to their face is doing something dangerous and foolish and should be well advised to do their homework - it may save you some skin, literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a functional razor, this is not a pristine work of art, it is built for utility but I found the overall aesthetics to be perfectly in line with its pricetag and did not hinder use whatsoever. If you are someone looking for a &#x27;pretty&#x27; razor this may be pretty enough to impress them, but it&#x27;s not a work of art and you pay for that artwork - bigtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor arrived and the first thing I noticed was that it was properly aligned with its scales - it closed dead center, making this a perfectly useful tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second thing I noticed was that its master grind (the most important grind on a razor) was dead center so I was able to hone it up without much work (It did require some work on the heel/foot of the blade to get right)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result is a 20.00 razor that shaves identically well to the most high end razors that I own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it hold an edge? it sure did for the past 3 shaves I&#x27;ve had with it, and for 20.00 I don&#x27;t care, I can buy literally 10 of these or more for the price of one masterpiece razor and with these, if I dropone or harm one I don&#x27;t care - because I can afford another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on this brand and I will be buying another one, the steel quality is there to take and hold an edge, the production Q/C is high enough that the razor is good as a functional tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars, for sure, this isn&#x27;t a purchase I regret at all.</li>
            <li> very good razor. i read the reviews and decide to to get and i am glad i did. i stropped it and got a very good shave.</li>
            <li> arrived not as sharp as it should be . . .</li>
            <li> This blade was not carbon steel but that&#x27;s fine with me because I wanted a stainless steel blade. The grounding on it is kinda funky but other than that it&#x27;s pretty good. I was able to get it shave ready.</li>
            <li> Wish to inform your company that this product while appeared proper for the price offered had a critical flaw.The concern is that the blade itself has a defect which is potentially hazardous.Razor blade had what appeared to be blemish on the blade&#x27;s leading tip.Actually was a small crack that upon touch and visual inspection was correctly identified.Item should never been sold in that condition.</li>
            <li> While the price is great this is not shave ready. Mine came without a case and without the logo. I stropped it a few time to see if it can catch any hairs at all and it would only get about half and couldn&#x27;t cut some hairs at all</li>
            <li> The blade itself isnt too bad but it didnt come ready to use, the handle is absolutely horrible; being plastic and making the device unbalanced.</li>
            <li> Well done, never shaved until know and still getting the hang of it.</li>
            <li> This razor does not really shave- unless you are a cowboy with the shaving and stubble standards of a cowboy.</li>
            <li> Handle quality is my only issue, I still gave 5 stars because it is a small issue.  The handle is very light and I prefer a nice counter weight to the blade.  The blade is high quality and very sharp.....very sharp.  All in all my face has never gotten a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no shaving snob, but this razor has issues. No straight razor comes shave ready. The blade was machine honed and was not stropped. The edge is very uneven. Do yourself a favor, buy the &amp;#34;blunt&amp;#34; version. Its less work to hone your own edge than it is to re hone the factory edge. I&#x27;m stubborn though I&#x27;ll roll with it. Not that I care but the scales are garbage but all they do is hide the edge and look good.</li>
            <li> It took a while to hone but has a nice weight and actually shaves quite nice once you put a good bevel on it!</li>
            <li> This razor is made in China which is a big turn off for me.  I do not intentionally buy anything from the chi-coms, as enemies of the U.S..  The product description on Amazon may have revealed that fact, but I did not see it.  I&#x27;ll get over it because I bought this inexpensive razor only to practice sharpening it before I sharpen my expensive Dovo razor with which I plan to shave.  I would not buy this razor again as a daily shaver.  It may work for a camping trip where one would not worry about it being lost or damaged.  The faux graphite scales, while completely functional, look cheesy in person.</li>
            <li> Great Razor. Just like the ones I had 40 years ago. Holds an edge really well.</li>
            <li> This appears to be the real deal on the blade. Not pretty but sharp and can be sharpened to shaving quality. The scales are, for the lack of a better word, trash. They are uneven, flimsy, positioned out of wack etc. Buy this, make your own scales or buy them, boom, great straight razor.</li>
            <li> It keeps my ho&#x27;s in line.</li>
            <li> Very good. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Chinese made piece of junk. Pulled it out of the package and dropped it less than 6 inches to the counter and the blade shattered. Its a plastic counter and it was maybe a 4 inch drop. Also the handle is terrible plastic that would be super slipped while shaving. Don&#x27;t waste your money. Buy American or Spanish.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend decided on this one and he absolutely loves it.  Super super sharp. Nice looking.  Great purchase.</li>
            <li> When given a proper stropping, works fine</li>
            <li> I am a novice straight razor user. So i have no idea what the crazy price ones are like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 4 of them between amazon and ebay. This being the most expensive one. This one is my favorite. The other 3 took A LOT of work with sharpening stones to even cut peach fuzz, let alone whiskers. I still feel like this shaves better than those ones still. They were thick blades, and as sharp as a butter knife from the factory. This one came sharper, but i re-did the edge from the ground up. This blade, on half width through, goes to as thin as a razor blade. The other ones had a V shape to the edge. I spent about $18 on this one, i spent anywhere from $3 to $10 on the ebay ones each. Those suck. I wish i just bought a second one of these instead with that money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the factory this blades edge is OK. It cuts peach fuzz here and there, but i think it does a LOT better if you redo the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i get into using this every day, i might invest in a more expensive one. More to see what those expensive ones have that this does not. But for now, i can test it and see if I even want to shave with a straight razor as opposed to disposables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;5 months after....I have since gotten 50+ dollar razors. I find them to be better. I dont use this one anymore, but i still keep it around just in case. I still think this is a good razor to start with if you are unsure if you want to proceed into striaght razor shaving and do not want to spend a fortune. I think the difference between the high end ones and this one is the length of time it will maintain an edge. And the ones from ebay (china steel) are dulled a bit and given to my kids to pretend to shave with me. Dont even bother with those.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this unless you intend to either hone it yourself or send it out to be honed.  The steel is decent and will take an edge.  The scales are cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as part of a project knowing the finish was poor and that I was basically buying a straight razor &amp;#34;blank&amp;#34;.  My score is the average of 5 stars as a kit, and 1 star as a functioning razor.</li>
            <li> The packaging you see in the pictures above and the packaging on the actual blade you receive may not be the same. In the pictures above, you see a nice display type case, but what I got was a little pouch. As far as the blade goes, I was able to get it to a decent shave very quickly and with a bit of work I think it should shave very well and very easily. Not the best you could buy, but that&#x27;s what you sign up for for around $20. The razor will give you a nice shave with a little sharpening, and the scales won&#x27;t fall off from a little handling. If anything ever happens to mine, I&#x27;ll probably buy another one.</li>
            <li> Does a horrible job of shaving. Only can cut thin hairs, but does nothing when it comes to cutting the coarse facial hair, which I actually need it for.</li>
            <li> Definitely was not shave ready.  Have yet to get an edge on it that I am satisfied with.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money.  The blade is flimsy and dull and hardly works. Worst shave ever.</li>
            <li> This blade is razor sharp after it is properly stropped without question. It can shave the hair from arms and legs with ease. No matter how much I strop this razor, it does not shave my face well. This razor has helped me learn how to properly strop now that I have found an excellent cut throat razor that does shave my face with ease. I see now that there is a big difference in the blade weight and hone between this gold dollar brand and the Barber cut throat straight razor that I now use. I see now that this is the reason that this gold dollar did not sharpen my face well.I think that I have shaved almost all the hair from my arms and legs in testing it after stroppings...lol.. This razor will shave the hair from arms and legs easily with a good stropping but in my case, it never gave me a good facial shave.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I could not shave with this razor out of the box. Being it is stainless steel it takes a long, long time to sharpen by hand. Add a few more bucks to the budget and get something better.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my boyfriend, he loves it, but the blade does need to be sharpened extensively before use.</li>
            <li> Handle was bent upon arrival.  Hard to get sharp.</li>
            <li> Good lower-priced straight razor.  Word of advice - sharpen it with a strap before you use it.  It is not sharp enough out of the box to shave.  Otherwise, great deal</li>
            <li> Plastic handle is flimsy.  While it is sharp, it does not come shaving sharp.  Putting an actual edge on it has been a task</li>
