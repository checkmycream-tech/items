    <ol>
            <li>Great oil!</li>
            <li>Although I didn&#x27;t get the product shown the oil is still great.</li>
            <li>The oil is great for your hair as my family member told me.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but don&#x27;t use it anymore because it gives me dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have received good benefits from it.</li>
            <li>Read good reviews about this oil.</li>
            <li>Amazing, I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now</li>
            <li>I love this \\&quot;Brahmi Amla HAIR Oil product, it is wonderful for my scalp and hair, so much, that I keep repeating my orders</li>
            <li>It helps to keep my hair soft and moisturized with great shine!</li>
            <li>and I honestly like that product a lot better.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, that seems to be thinning, most oil products make my hair greasy looking, this is awesome since you wash it out, make my hair shiny, soft and seems to have more volume....</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair shine after applying.</li>
            <li>so it seems appropriate.</li>
            <li>Make sure the packers/shippers understand to look for the \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; on the Product Label.</li>
            <li>It may work for some, but I feel that there are more moisturizing products out there.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and has great shine without being greasy.</li>
            <li>The sandalwood smell is strong but it&#x27;s Indian</li>
            <li>This is also great as nose drops, Brahmi is an Ayurvedic herb that is a specific from stimulating brain growth</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just wonderful, especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li>I lost about 1/3 of the oil right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>Next time I want to make sure I get the right product.</li>
            <li>I use it very lightly after drying my hair, it not only works as anti frizz agent but also as hair shiner.</li>
            <li>and I am definitely noticing my hair getting fuller  &amp; softer and my curls more defined.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after using this product.  </li>
            <li>By far this is my favorite and regularly used oil.</li>
            <li>(My hair is average to good; fine; a little below collar bone length, and on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the thinnest of hair, I&#x27;m probably a 5 or 6.)  </li>
            <li>I was concerned at first about hair shedding, as I read some reviews where people experienced some major shedding after using Alma oil, however I have not experienced any abnormal shedding with this Vadik brand.</li>
            <li>It is very light but a little oily so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li>particularly it&#x27;s thickness.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>For whatever reason, every time I tilted the bottle, it continued to seep oil out around the cap, even though it was completely tightened.  </li>
            <li>I have been experimenting with different kinds of all natural oils.</li>
            <li>The bottle containing the oil was wrapped in plastic - that is because it apparently leaked the entire shipping time.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is also great as nose drops, Brahmi is an Ayurvedic herb that is a specific from stimulating brain growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using  Brahmi-Alma oil during my DC treatments and in my daily water spritz mix. It helped eliminate some dryness I&#x27;d been experiencing after finding out my hair hates insoluble silicones (esp. dimethicone). This oil brought my hair back to life, particularly it&#x27;s thickness. I was concerned at first about hair shedding, as I read some reviews where people experienced some major shedding after using Alma oil, however I have not experienced any abnormal shedding with this Vadik brand. Great oil!</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair shine after applying. It is very light but a little oily so you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t get the product shown the oil is still great. My hair feels so soft and has great shine without being greasy. Next time I want to make sure I get the right product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely shinier since I started sleeping with this oil on once a week.  I&#x27;ve only being using it for about a month so I can&#x27;t speak to any hair growth (My hair is average to good; fine; a little below collar bone length, and on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being the thinnest of hair, I&#x27;m probably a 5 or 6.)  I know my hair&#x27;s condition has improved since I started using this.  The sandalwood smell is strong but it&#x27;s Indian so it seems appropriate.</li>
            <li> Adds a shine to the hair</li>
            <li> I bought it for my niece, she loves it and says it does improve her hair!</li>
            <li> The bottle containing the oil was wrapped in plastic - that is because it apparently leaked the entire shipping time.  I lost about 1/3 of the oil right off the bat.  For whatever reason, every time I tilted the bottle, it continued to seep oil out around the cap, even though it was completely tightened.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, that seems to be thinning, most oil products make my hair greasy looking, this is awesome since you wash it out, make my hair shiny, soft and seems to have more volume....will buy again</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t anything for me. A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but don&#x27;t use it anymore because it gives me dandruff.</li>
            <li> I use this deep conditioner my hair between shampoos with another Ayurvedic oil and I am definitely noticing my hair getting fuller  &amp; softer and my curls more defined. I have natural Afro hair that is a little past my shoulders and this product is really worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this \\&quot;Brahmi Amla HAIR Oil product, it is wonderful for my scalp and hair, so much, that I keep repeating my orders, HOWEVER, I&#x27;m not getting this product with the white label and red letters.  INSTEAD:  I&#x27;m receiving the product called \\&quot;Brahmi Amla Oil\\&quot;.  There is a difference.  Make sure the packers/shippers understand to look for the \\&quot;HAIR\\&quot; on the Product Label.</li>
            <li> The image is not what pictured On my bottle that I received. The oil is great for your hair as my family member told me.</li>
            <li> I add this oil to my hair pomade. I also add it to my monthly henna/brahmi/amla powder gloss treatment.  It helps to keep my hair soft and moisturized with great shine! It is definitely a staple in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different kinds of all natural oils. By far this is my favorite and regularly used oil. I use it very lightly after drying my hair, it not only works as anti frizz agent but also as hair shiner. I also use it on a weekly basis as a leave in conditioning oil before shampooing. I have received good benefits from it. Hope you do as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing, I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years now and it&#x27;s just wonderful, especially for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Just started this using this oil. Read good reviews about this oil.</li>
            <li> some people where saying that this product would change the color of your gray hair I didn&#x27;t see a change at all.</li>
            <li> Returned. Didn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference after using this product.  The biggest thing I did notice was that it made my hair hard.  It may work for some, but I feel that there are more moisturizing products out there.  It also did not control or color my gray hairs.  I&#x27;ve used Vatika oil in the past and I honestly like that product a lot better.  This was not worth what I paid for it.</li>
