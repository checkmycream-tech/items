            <li>Too amazing for words.  </li>
            <li>She said this product made her eyelashes look fuller and that she really liked 3D fiber lashes</li>

            <li>what makes me happy is you clean  </li>
            <li>it also comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>Honestly, Younique is better.  </li>
            <li>This product has an amazing result at the end, but it has to many chemicals thats damaging my lashes</li>
            <li>nothing as yet which is a huge plus!</li>
            <li>its an ok product for the price</li>
            <li>I prefer my Love Alpha to everything else.</li>
            <li>It was ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product better than paying 30$ for the younique product.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product ....</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love love this mascara.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>Love Alpha and the floral-print ones are Angel Mask.  </li>
            <li>For 2 sets under $15, I am thoroughly pleased.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it and will be buying again &#x27;</li>
            <li>love love love.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;m not going to lie.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it will just look better with time</li>
            <li>I used my favorite mascara with the fiber lashes instead of the gel mascara</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just what worked better for me</li>
            <li>Works OK, fibers get into my eyes.</li>
            <li>Soo pleased, bought the set for my sister and</li>
            <li>and I actually have great lashes!</li>
            <li>So glad I didn&#x27;t get ripped off.</li>
            <li>The mascara is good and not difficult to use.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>This product is very cool.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look very full after applying these two products..</li>
            <li>Super cool !!</li>
            <li>Such a shame because I really loved the look that these mascaras gave me!</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li>This is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Comparing both mascaras, the formula are all the same, but I favored the Angel Mask brush for the transplanting gel much more (also the floral print is prettier in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>It actually gave me lashes I could see lol.</li>
            <li>it worked fantastic</li>
            <li>seriously happy with my purchase and will definitely repurchase again!</li>
            <li>and it looked fabulous.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>I love this part because it really adds length!</li>
            <li>Love, bought several more for family!</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with this product, it really makes my lashes longer!</li>
            <li>I used the gel first, then the fibers and repeated that twice more and done.</li>
            <li>Love this product except the cheetah print tubes didn&#x27;t seem as good quality as the other tubes it comes with.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Be sure to cover the whole lash, to cover all the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It shipped fast and it has stylish bottles.</li>
            <li>Finally, apply one more coat of gel and try to make sure it covers every fiber.</li>
            <li>Received it super quick and both mascara sets were neatly wrapped and packaged together.  </li>
            <li>The Angel Mask brush was bigger and able to distribute the gel to my eyelashes better and followed the shape of my eye.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the love alpha because the fibers seem to attach more readily and look darker, but for natural looking wear the angel mask is perfection.</li>
            <li>But this product has given me that extra beauty of long lashes I have to say I am impressed.</li>
            <li>I use only 1-2 coats and my lashes look amazing .</li>
            <li>also have liked this brand of fiber mascara over all the others I&#x27;ve tried because the tube seems to last longer, and the fibers stick</li>
            <li>Love it makes my lashes look great watched many videos of how to apply not really rock science but can be rather messy.</li>
            <li>the mascara only with warm water</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>, one of the fiber tubes comes out clumpy, but the other one is good..</li>
            <li>The idea is Right Eye: Gel, fiber.</li>
            <li>Right Eye: Gel, Fiber.</li>
            <li>Right Eye:</li>
            <li>It takes a while to apply right but with its value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok to me you notice a slight difference the alpha love or angel mask</li>
            <li>This is amazing, i&#x27;m huge on lashes and love the false</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly buy it again!</li>
            <li>I tried these for the first time.</li>
            <li>First time ever trying any 3D lash.</li>
            <li>I applied my eyeshadow first</li>
            <li>but this really helps!</li>
            <li>First you apply the gel.</li>
            <li>Maybe next time around will be a bit better.</li>
            <li>The Love Alpha brush had dipped curve in the middle and didn&#x27;t coat the gel on my lashes evenly.</li>
            <li>this REALLY works!  </li>
            <li>I love the result, the only thing is....</li>
            <li>Enjoy sexy natural lashes at last!!</li>
            <li>there is quite a bit of fibre fall out, but nothing major, wears well through out the day and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>this is not a one two three quick brush on mascara and the end results are worth the time you take (maybe five minutes to completely do both eyes).</li>
            <li>but on my first try at 5:30 am getting ready for work</li>
            <li>really works.</li>
            <li>and it make my eyes really watery</li>
            <li>Really works, I have sparce eyelashes</li>
            <li>I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>Works very well just don&#x27;t like how it leavesbthe fibers under your eye</li>
            <li>plumped them up as much as these tubes did.  </li>
            <li>All you really need to do is gently sweep the fibers on to the ends of your lashes and then re-coat with the transplanting gel and swoop up</li>
            <li>As good if not BETTER THAN Younique!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is totally comparable to the unique mascara.</li>
            <li>I swipe on a few good coats of the gel, then quickly grab the fiber brush and swoop directly up from the middle of my lashes all the way to the tips.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price and for a double set.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive ones are better because I haven&#x27;t tried them</li>
            <li>but overall you definitely get more than you pay for out of it.</li>
            <li>These magic tubes turned my straight, Asian lashes into long, voluminous, fluttery lashes.  </li>
            <li>I normally have no.eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Was not hard to use or understand.</li>
            <li>that long they are super fuzzy to</li>
            <li>SUPER long lashes!!!</li>
            <li>the only thing i didnt like was that the fibers fall from the lashes really fast</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work like I assume doesn&#x27;t even look natural just like I got lint in my eye</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>No one can really see the difference between this and my regular mascara.</li>
            <li>Second time I order it, makes my lashes so long and so full.  </li>
            <li>My lashes looked so thick and natural, much better than applying lash stripes.</li>
            <li>Over all great value for money (2 sets yaay :) - I live in South Africa and we are always last to jump on the beauty wagon craze (which is very annoying hence my international shopping)</li>
            <li>They quickly shipped me the missing set.</li>
            <li>way better than false eyelashes and easier to apply</li>
            <li>Made my eye lashes look long yet natural</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re blonde and barely seen.</li>
            <li>but again do not buy really brings lashes down</li>
            <li>It was a little tricky to get and even amount across my lashes at first, but after about the 3rd time using this product I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>I had none of those issues half asleep and getting my kids ready for the bus at the same time</li>

            <li> Maybe next time around will be a bit better.</li>
            <li> The Love Alpha brush had dipped curve in the middle and didn&#x27;t coat the gel on my lashes evenly.</li>
            <li> this REALLY works!  </li>
            <li> I love the result, the only thing is....</li>
            <li> Enjoy sexy natural lashes at last!!</li>
            <li> there is quite a bit of fibre fall out, but nothing major, wears well through out the day and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> this is not a one two three quick brush on mascara and the end results are worth the time you take (maybe five minutes to completely do both eyes).</li>
            <li> but on my first try at 5:30 am getting ready for work</li>
            <li> really works.</li>
            <li> and it make my eyes really watery</li>
            <li> Really works, I have sparce eyelashes</li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> Works very well just don&#x27;t like how it leavesbthe fibers under your eye</li>
            <li> plumped them up as much as these tubes did.  </li>
            <li> All you really need to do is gently sweep the fibers on to the ends of your lashes and then re-coat with the transplanting gel and swoop up</li>
            <li> As good if not BETTER THAN Younique!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is totally comparable to the unique mascara.</li>
            <li> I swipe on a few good coats of the gel, then quickly grab the fiber brush and swoop directly up from the middle of my lashes all the way to the tips.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price and for a double set.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive ones are better because I haven&#x27;t tried them</li>
            <li> but overall you definitely get more than you pay for out of it.</li>
            <li> These magic tubes turned my straight, Asian lashes into long, voluminous, fluttery lashes.  </li>
            <li> I normally have no.eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Was not hard to use or understand.</li>
            <li> that long they are super fuzzy to</li>
            <li> SUPER long lashes!!!</li>
            <li> the only thing i didnt like was that the fibers fall from the lashes really fast</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work like I assume doesn&#x27;t even look natural just like I got lint in my eye</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> No one can really see the difference between this and my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Second time I order it, makes my lashes so long and so full.  </li>
            <li> My lashes looked so thick and natural, much better than applying lash stripes.</li>
            <li> Over all great value for money (2 sets yaay :) - I live in South Africa and we are always last to jump on the beauty wagon craze (which is very annoying hence my international shopping)</li>
            <li> They quickly shipped me the missing set.</li>
            <li> way better than false eyelashes and easier to apply</li>
            <li> Made my eye lashes look long yet natural</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re blonde and barely seen.</li>
            <li> but again do not buy really brings lashes down</li>
            <li> It was a little tricky to get and even amount across my lashes at first, but after about the 3rd time using this product I got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I had none of those issues half asleep and getting my kids ready for the bus at the same time</li>
            <li> I apply the first layer of feathers just to the base on the top of the lashes to make my lashes look thicker.</li>
            <li> After about 2 months, I stopped using this because my eyes were getting so red, dry, and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I &#x27;ve gotta go light and easy,or it looks freaky fake....</li>
            <li> I usually spend about five minutes applying normal mascara to get the length and volume I want.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is the only mascara I will use.</li>
            <li> Makes my long lashes look &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Even if you just use the gel, and not the fibers- your lashes are still long!</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes and this just boosts up the length!</li>
            <li> and I let the lashes dry before I blinked.</li>
            <li> bought 2 and both seemed to really dry up within 2 weeks of use to the point i had clumpy eyelashes ...</li>
            <li> The only down fall is that it does take a while to ship</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly finding the black fiber on my face under my eyes.</li>
            <li> long as I take my time and am very careful when applying i do not have a problem.</li>
            <li> I read that some people got irritated eyes after using 3D lashes, so I was careful not to get any in my eye during application or during the day.</li>
            <li> Be careful and don&#x27;t get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To remove all I have to do is get them wet, and they slip off like tubes.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected in terms of quality and one of the mascara wands did not have a brush at the end.</li>
            <li> I stopped using this (sadly) and went back to my old mascara and my red eyes were gone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the market and false eyelashes as well but never have achieved this natural, long look as I have with this product.</li>
            <li> Do step 1 and 2 on just one eye, then do step one and two on the other eye, so you get the fibers to attach while the gel is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t cover all the fibers I&#x27;ve found that they fall off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Again, do step 3 and 4 to one eye, then the other.</li>
            <li> I have used other mascaras and nothing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and bought this just as a test for the Fiber 3D lash craze</li>
            <li> Ok this is crazy!</li>
            <li> No I do not sell it, but I have both and this formula makes your lashes long but not full!</li>
            <li> i used to have thick short lashes</li>
            <li> you are a contact wearer be very careful as the little fibers can fall in your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fiber s fell off and clumped a little</li>
            <li> This gel is a little runnier than others, but seems to go on smoother than others too.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look thicker but messy</li>
            <li> It took a few applications to get my lashes to look longer</li>
            <li> I contacted the company about the missing set.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Thin and short!</li>
            <li> The package I received inside of the yellow envelope package was broken and missing both sets of the transplanting gel.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a little hard to apply</li>
            <li> Horrible in so many ways.  </li>
            <li> (not sure that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called</li>
            <li> Until they come up with something that&#x27;s less irritating to my eyes...........................      </li>
            <li> Makes my eyelash thick looking n pop out</li>
            <li> I inherited the absolute worst eyelashes from my dear mom.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fairly irritating.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t point fingers, but I think I&#x27;m allergic to the black fibers or at least they irritated my eyes and contacts like crazy!</li>
            <li> even with five coats...it starts to look fake and spidery.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even thought I was wearing fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> I prefer the base that comes with the lashes.</li>
            <li> Never start at base of lashes when applying fiber and you avoid any irritation to the eye.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed Won&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fiber s fell off and clumped a little I like just using the gel then mascara</li>
            <li> OMG! My lashes are beautiful!  Product  really works. Best part about it, is  that they are my lashes.</li>
            <li> works really good on me</li>
            <li> Great product for the price you pay. It did what it was suppose to, made my lashes look longer and fuller. My boyfriend even thought I was wearing fake eyelashes!</li>
            <li> its an ok product for the price, one of the fiber tubes comes out clumpy, but the other one is good.. the only thing i didnt like was that the fibers fall from the lashes really fast and it make my eyes really watery</li>
            <li> This is easy to use. The fibers did not irritate my eyes. Made my eye lashes look long yet natural</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I gave a set to a friend who uses the name brand stuff for $30 and she is switching to this one!</li>
            <li> As good if not BETTER THAN Younique!  I prefer my Love Alpha to everything else.</li>
            <li> For this review, my girlfriend had to fill me in on this product. She said this product made her eyelashes look fuller and that she really liked 3D fiber lashes</li>
            <li> I tried these for the first time. First time ever trying any 3D lash. I applied to coats and I loved them. My lashes looked so thick and natural, much better than applying lash stripes. I read that some people got irritated eyes after using 3D lashes, so I was careful not to get any in my eye during application or during the day. I applied my eyeshadow first and I let the lashes dry before I blinked. I also applied the lashes the third time using a gel mascara instead of the applicator that came with it. I prefer the base that comes with the lashes. But them, they work great. Take your time. Be careful and don&#x27;t get it in your eye. I had no problem.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome</li>
            <li> It was ok I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look thicker but messy, it&#x27;s a little hard to apply</li>
            <li> Was not hard to use or understand. Really works, I have sparce eyelashes but this really helps! Great online tutorials out there too if you need a visual instruction.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!! I may never go back to regular mascara again!&lt;br /&gt;I also have liked this brand of fiber mascara over all the others I&#x27;ve tried because the tube seems to last longer, and the fibers stick better.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I apply this amazing mascara:&lt;br /&gt;1. First you apply the gel. This gel is a little runnier than others, but seems to go on smoother than others too.&lt;br /&gt;2. Then apply the fibers. The fibers look like tiny feathers that stick to the gel. I apply the first layer of feathers just to the base on the top of the lashes to make my lashes look thicker. If I go under the lashes, I seem to get the fibers in my eyes. Do step 1 and 2 on just one eye, then do step one and two on the other eye, so you get the fibers to attach while the gel is still wet.&lt;br /&gt;3. Next do another coat of gel. Be sure to cover the whole lash, to cover all the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;4. Then apply the fibers again, this time to the ends or tips of the lashes to lengthen your lashes. I love this part because it really adds length! So fun!!&lt;br /&gt;5. Finally, apply one more coat of gel and try to make sure it covers every fiber. If I don&#x27;t cover all the fibers I&#x27;ve found that they fall off during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Again, do step 3 and 4 to one eye, then the other. The idea is Right Eye: Gel, fiber. Left eye: Gel, fiber. Right Eye: Gel, Fiber. Right Eye: Gel, Left Eye: Gel. Doing it this way seems to maximize the drying time of the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To remove all I have to do is get them wet, and they slip off like tubes. Easy!&lt;br /&gt;This brand also sends two sets of mascara, and one set seems to last me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> Love these and great price too :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product better than paying 30$ for the younique product. It shipped fast and it has stylish bottles. Works ok. It takes a while to apply right but with its value.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Love love love this product .... I normally have no.eyelashes. they&#x27;re blonde and barely seen. But this product has given me that extra beauty of long lashes I have to say I am impressed. Especially for the price and I will be buying tons more !!! And it got to me in 3 days</li>
            <li> Fibers ended on my face.</li>
            <li> Holy Lashes! Love, bought several more for family!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected in terms of quality and one of the mascara wands did not have a brush at the end. They also did not send a return slip or instructions for a return/refund process.</li>
            <li> Love it makes my lashes look great watched many videos of how to apply not really rock science but can be rather messy. It did cause me allergies &amp; had to get drops for my eyes to take care of it. It also says &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; this is not as soon as you wipe water on your face the mascara starts to come off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok to me you notice a slight difference the alpha love or angel mask lashes aren&#x27;t that long they are super fuzzy to I suggest younique&#x27;s fiber lashes</li>
            <li> It works and if you take your time applying the gel and fibers it will last all day. this is not a one two three quick brush on mascara and the end results are worth the time you take (maybe five minutes to completely do both eyes). I love it. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara!  I need to purchase more before everyone else finds out how great it is.</li>
            <li> Honestly, Younique is better.  No I do not sell it, but I have both and this formula makes your lashes long but not full! For the money it&#x27;s not bad!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed Won&#x27;t purchase again doesn&#x27;t work like I assume doesn&#x27;t even look natural just like I got lint in my eye</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with this product, it really makes my lashes longer! I&#x27;m so glad I tried this item!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it!!! It actually gave me lashes I could see lol.</li>
            <li> Love love this mascara. The fibers can be a problem sometime so I use my blow dryer on low setting and it makes a different. Other than that this is the only mascara I will use.</li>
            <li> bought 2 and both seemed to really dry up within 2 weeks of use to the point i had clumpy eyelashes ... no matter what i did, it just always looked like i needed to stop drinking hours before... and i dont drink lol for the time it was usable it worked fantastic</li>
            <li> I chose to buy this mascara instead of the more expensive brand. You get what you pay for. I&#x27;ve watched lots of tutorials on how to apply. This doesn&#x27;t do enough length for my lashes...even with five coats...it starts to look fake and spidery.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Doesn&#x27;t make lashes any longer than my regular mascara. It also flakes off. I&#x27;m constantly finding the black fiber on my face under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Its actually very good for the price</li>
            <li> My girls will love this!</li>
            <li> Does not work do not but again do not buy really brings lashes down</li>
            <li> When putting the fibers on my lashes they fell into my eyes and I could feel it all day. Maybe next time around will be a bit better. It took a few applications to get my lashes to look longer</li>
            <li> I have not tried the younique mascara. With that said I do not feel I need to. This product is very cool. Makes my long lashes look &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34;! I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are a contact wearer be very careful as the little fibers can fall in your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I take my time and am very careful when applying i do not have a problem. I love it :)</li>
            <li> Love the products, they take my lashes from blend to Glam!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!!!!! Second time I order it, makes my lashes so long and so full.  So natural♡</li>
            <li> Works very well just don&#x27;t like how it leavesbthe fibers under your eye it also comes off very easily. Not bad for the price and for a double set.</li>
            <li> ---UPDATE 2/24/15 --- After about 2 months, I stopped using this because my eyes were getting so red, dry, and itchy.  I can&#x27;t point fingers, but I think I&#x27;m allergic to the black fibers or at least they irritated my eyes and contacts like crazy! It was almost like a burning, itching sensation that wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I stopped using this (sadly) and went back to my old mascara and my red eyes were gone and I haven&#x27;t had any issues since.  Such a shame because I really loved the look that these mascaras gave me! Until they come up with something that&#x27;s less irritating to my eyes...........................      Received it super quick and both mascara sets were neatly wrapped and packaged together.  I did my research and familiarized myself with the product and application process, so I didn&#x27;t pay any mind to the instructions.  Looking at both sets, they do have different names.  The cheetah-print tubes are  Love Alpha and the floral-print ones are Angel Mask.  Both mascaras have the same formula, except the transplating gel brushes were different.    As for the hype? Believe it!  These magic tubes turned my straight, Asian lashes into long, voluminous, fluttery lashes.  Comparing both mascaras, the formula are all the same, but I favored the Angel Mask brush for the transplanting gel much more (also the floral print is prettier in my opinion).  The Angel Mask brush was bigger and able to distribute the gel to my eyelashes better and followed the shape of my eye.  The Love Alpha brush had dipped curve in the middle and didn&#x27;t coat the gel on my lashes evenly. With practice, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll perfect it, but for now - I&#x27;m in looove with the Angel Mask tubes.    For 2 sets under $15, I am thoroughly pleased.  I have used other mascaras and nothing plumped them up as much as these tubes did.  The key is application process.  I swipe on a few good coats of the gel, then quickly grab the fiber brush and swoop directly up from the middle of my lashes all the way to the tips.  Fibers will definitely get into your eyes and around your face if you wiggle it or start at the baseline.  All you really need to do is gently sweep the fibers on to the ends of your lashes and then re-coat with the transplanting gel and swoop up so you comb all the fibers.  Immediately, my lashes looked longer and fuller.    I&#x27;ll certainly buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!! SUPER long lashes!!! You cannot beat the price- and for TWO sets!!! Try this mascara and you will never use another again! Even if you just use the gel, and not the fibers- your lashes are still long!</li>
            <li> Makes my eyelash thick looking n pop out</li>
            <li> love it! way better than false eyelashes and easier to apply</li>
            <li> I really do love this stuff. I am a name brand makeup snob. This stuff is totally comparable to the unique mascara. The only down fall is that it does take a while to ship</li>
            <li> Super cool !! My eyelashes look very full after applying these two products.. I love it and will be buying again &#x27;</li>
            <li> i have to admit it, it does make my lashes ticker and longer! what makes me happy is you clean  the mascara only with warm water</li>
            <li> I already have long lashes and this just boosts up the length! I was going to spend 40$ on the Younique Moostruck fiber mascara but thank god I found this alternative instead. Defiantly going to buy more when i run out!</li>
            <li> This is amazing, i&#x27;m huge on lashes and love the false but all mine look - this created it to perfection! there is quite a bit of fibre fall out, but nothing major, wears well through out the day and easy to apply. I wear contact lenses so was a bit worried that I would have fibres in my eyes, but nothing as yet which is a huge plus! Over all great value for money (2 sets yaay :) - I live in South Africa and we are always last to jump on the beauty wagon craze (which is very annoying hence my international shopping) seriously happy with my purchase and will definitely repurchase again!</li>
            <li> love love love. I usually spend about five minutes applying normal mascara to get the length and volume I want. withthis I use only 1-2 coats and my lashes look amazing . It was a little tricky to get and even amount across my lashes at first, but after about the 3rd time using this product I got the hang of it. I will defiantly buy this again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company about the missing set. They quickly shipped me the missing set. Thanks!!! It does make your lashes appear thicker and longer. I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Wow...OMG,....this REALLY works!  Too amazing for words.  I &#x27;ve gotta go light and easy,or it looks freaky fake....BUT..., if you want that Faux Lash Look, (and some gals DO)...then do these as suggested and BLAM!!  I wish they came in Brown,I am quite fair...</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;m not going to lie. I love the result, the only thing is....Its damaging my eyelashes. i used to have thick short lashes but now my lashes are falling. This product has an amazing result at the end, but it has to many chemicals thats damaging my lashes</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first and bought this just as a test for the Fiber 3D lash craze and I was not disappointed at all! I am in need of practice with it and I&#x27;m sure it will just look better with time but on my first try at 5:30 am getting ready for work I was amazed by the results!! I only did two coats because I was in a rush and it looked fabulous. I&#x27;ve tried every mascara on the market and false eyelashes as well but never have achieved this natural, long look as I have with this product. I read reviews about issues with fibers in your eyes or falling on your face. I had none of those issues half asleep and getting my kids ready for the bus at the same time lol!! I used the gel first, then the fibers and repeated that twice more and done. I was so impressed I took the time to take pictures, and that&#x27;s a first for me lol!! I&#x27;d say this is a great buy, I don&#x27;t know if the more expensive ones are better because I haven&#x27;t tried them but this set brings 4 tubes 2 gels and 2 fiber and it&#x27;s well worth the price. I will be stocking up just in case the disappear from the market! Enjoy sexy natural lashes at last!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Never start at base of lashes when applying fiber and you avoid any irritation to the eye.</li>
            <li> Love this product except the cheetah print tubes didn&#x27;t seem as good quality as the other tubes it comes with. I used my favorite mascara with the fiber lashes instead of the gel mascara it comes with. That&#x27;s just what worked better for me but overall you definitely get more than you pay for out of it.</li>
            <li> Works OK, fibers get into my eyes. No one can really see the difference between this and my regular mascara.</li>
            <li> Horrible in so many ways.  I will never purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Soo pleased, bought the set for my sister and I. I prefer the love alpha because the fibers seem to attach more readily and look darker, but for natural looking wear the angel mask is perfection. Great deal. Definitely a rival for the Younique brand.</li>
            <li> Omg!!!! Love this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work... don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The package I received inside of the yellow envelope package was broken and missing both sets of the transplanting gel. The only thing I received were fibers which do not work with my regular mascara. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ok this is crazy! I inherited the absolute worst eyelashes from my dear mom. Thin and short! I can&#x27;t believe how well this product works. And believe me I&#x27;m 56 and have tried everything. I put on a layer of Rimmel fab lashes (not sure that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s called but it&#x27;s Rimmel). Then layer of the gel. Then immediately put layer of the fibers. Unbelievably I only need one layer and I actually have great lashes! Tada!! I almost bought that Youngique or whatever it&#x27;s called Ponzi scheme product. So glad I didn&#x27;t get ripped off. This stuff rocks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The mascara is good and not difficult to use. But it was supposed to be 2 sets, as in 4 tubes total. But I only got 1set. That&#x27;s fairly irritating.</li>
