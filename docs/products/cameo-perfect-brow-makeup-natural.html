            <li>If you are getting this for the stencils I say don&#x27;t buy and try going to a salon and asking about a good shape for your brow.</li>

            <li>It does a great job at making my brows look fuller and more defined.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for some time and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good except the fact that the powders dont have an abundant amount of pigmentation.</li>

            <li>its a nice product.</li>
            <li>I found it easier just to draw my own lines, but I didn&#x27;t try to get used to them either.  </li>

            <li>You need to SPEND REAL MONEY FOR GREAT STENCILS!</li>
            <li>The powder and brushes are nice.</li>
            <li>This is a handy kit for defining your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It is a nice eye brow perfecter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother with the tweezers because I have my own.  </li>
            <li>The colors are nice too.  </li>
            <li>Product is nice</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I liked the tweezers though, they did what they were supposed to do</li>
            <li>Nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li>I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and good quality.</li>
            <li>I love the perfect brow , it really helps get the shape you want and over all i give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to use everything .</li>
            <li>I use a clear brow gel before or after whatever I feel like that day and it is the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size and not heavy at all, so you can hold it in your hand while you color your eyebrows if you need to.</li>
            <li>It gives my eyebrows a wonderful, natural look.</li>
            <li>Also, I would have liked a better tool kit, so I had to buy a better brush.</li>
            <li>This helps me easily touch up and make sure both sides are even!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had very light eyebrows since birth and decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, once you master the technique of brushing on the brow powder while holding the template in place, without getting in your own way.  </li>
            <li>Its also nice that it comes with tweasers so if you are in a snitch you can easily take care of it.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it - it is nice, I haven&#x27;t used stencils yet, but it is easy to get the shade you need by mixing those they provide.</li>
            <li>My Sister came over and tried it and fell in love with it to</li>
            <li>i am so amazed at the difference in my eyebrows and so many compliments.</li>
            <li>i love my brown kit...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more brownish that i tought</li>
            <li>Add a touch of water to your application brush and you won&#x27;t even smudge throughout the day...or night. :)</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>The shapers I don&#x27;t use much but the over all kit is great.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>So much better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay wish it was darker .</li>
            <li>But these look great and more real trust</li>
            <li>me the powder looks better than pencil.</li>
            <li>This product has stencils and brow powder which seems to stay on better than eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but it works.</li>
            <li>Got this yesterday &amp; i try using it, it was OK</li>
            <li>sometimes (like if using eyeshadow), but there should be more options for shades of browns.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Eyebrow pencils are better.</li>
            <li>it works phenomenally.</li>
            <li>I was able to create more eyebrows with this kit.  </li>
            <li>The cameo brow maker natural is perfect for light brown blonds.  </li>
            <li>The effect is better than pencil lines.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Cameo Perfect Brow for brunettes, but after several uses, it can&#x27;t hold a candle to Anastasia or Smashbox.  </li>
            <li>She was pleased with the product and plans to reorder when she is completed with this compact.  </li>
            <li>But these look great and more real trust</li>
            <li>me the powder looks better than pencil.</li>
            <li>is not to big and the colors are great!</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>The tweezers aren&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>The colors are perfect, absolutely no red undertones which is always a problem for darker powders!</li>
            <li>so I bought this mostly for the stencils.  </li>
            <li>I love the tools it comes with and the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li>Could have been better, had it came with instructions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like reddish color.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>There should be more than one size.  </li>
            <li>Would buy again in a heart beat :)</li>
            <li>I love the three shades to choose from.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than using the peel off brow stencils.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use the templates, but I love the brush and color choices in the kit.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I had a guide.</li>
            <li>Also, the color is more for lighter colored brows.</li>
            <li>and they did okay blendind but could be</li>
            <li>So I got this in hopes that I would be able to start learning to fill in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the eye brush</li>
            <li>I was generally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this idea but the powders were all cracked when arrived</li>
            <li>The Perfect Brow Cameo has three stencils and they are all the same.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and boy am i glad.</li>
            <li>I prefer and mostly use just eyebrow pencils now.</li>
            <li>I love how there are three colors</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>It would be better if t had a mirror as well.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have to use more.</li>
            <li>The tweezers work really well, better than my own, and everything else is good.</li>
            <li>I can see this kit would be good for all hair colours...and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li>The brush wand is pretty good, and the slant brush and tweezers are okay too.</li>
            <li>The twisters are pretty good and the eyebrow makeup is ok.</li>
            <li>This kit is less then $7 bucks, comes with three AMAZING, VERSATILE SHADES, A GREAT COMB, BRUSH APPLICATOR, tweezers and stencils!!!</li>
            <li>For normal use, this product is great.</li>
            <li>Pretty good product.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty good, the tongs is not goos at all...</li>
            <li>love it its easy to use,perfect colors.</li>
            <li>perfect every single time.</li>
            <li>It looks great and natural.</li>
            <li>Better for those with brown to light colored hair.</li>
            <li>The eyebrow stencil really helped me shape my eyebrows and make them look good.</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast and got it very fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Shipped very fast and got it very fast!!!!</li>
            <li>Everyone likes full eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Color application is easy.  </li>
            <li>For everyday no-one-cares-what-you-look-like effort, this will work, but if you&#x27;re looking for perfect brow color matching, reach for this if you&#x27;re a medium skin tone (for the top color) or if you&#x27;re a lighter brunette for the second/third colors.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite easy to remove, as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>easy to build up</li>
            <li>It arrive very quickly</li>
            <li>The directions are easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I’m pretty happy with my eyebrow shape, but thought it would be great if there was a stencil that helped me shape my eyebrows a little better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for high school student thou</li>
            <li>She uses it every day, she really likes the brush, it got the right angle, the colors of the shadows are also great</li>
            <li>If you shape your brows nicely, after using the palette, they look very natural!!!</li>
            <li>but I use this makeup for photography models and it does happen to work just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li>This is my first time having an eyebrow makeup kit, and I must say it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This little kit is really awesome.</li>
            <li>just a little darker guess I should have picked a darker color Perfect brow model.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the results the very first time I used it, and I was happy to step out into the world with two complete and relatively symmetrical eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality, colors don&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li>is the jell to fit the brow its just powder</li>
            <li>however the colors were light, and my skin tone is medium beige</li>
            <li>Works great on my blonde roommate, though!</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair</li>
            <li>I think my skin tone is too light to make this</li>
            <li>After wearing this one important evening, every photograph made me look like Groucho Marx (even though I didn&#x27;t THINK I looked like him when I waked out the door).  </li>
            <li>I really do like the mix of colors though, and I already had my own tweezers and brush, so</li>
            <li>as ive mentioned its really simple to use and its a great way to create or define the eyebrow you are trying to get.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t dare tweeze them to fit into this stencil.  </li>
            <li>the shapes didnt fit me</li>
            <li>I use the top shadow to fill in my eyebrows and blend with the eyebrow brush and my eyebrows look fuller, more shapely and even better, NATURAL.</li>
            <li>The shadow comes on really light and looks really cheap.</li>
            <li>Also the tweezer looks really cheap and doesn&#x27;t even pluck out hair.</li>
            <li>love it brow was to big for me and the make up is good</li>
            <li>Good colors, natural.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a decent set of tweezers, so when I go on vacation I could leave my nice ones at home.  </li>
            <li>well it was a pretty ok</li>
            <li>im happy with mine and did not take long to get in the mail</li>
            <li>when i bought this i was so excited, but I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products to make my blond eyebrows visible and pretty shape.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention the price was so worth it!</li>
            <li>The eyebrow powder is excellent, however the stencils are too small</li>
            <li>so im familiar with the shape</li>
            <li>An eyebtow pencil is more proficient, and the color is always consistent.</li>
            <li>One thing did&#x27;nt care for were,the stencils which would make the shape more even but overall its a nice kit.</li>
            <li>and she was right!</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s fine - the price is right for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the eyebrow colors, but the shaper were way to big for my face.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and satisfied with my purchase , I would recommend and or buy again.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Nice natural colors</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that the template worked at all  and the powder wasn&#x27;t effective at giving a natural look.  </li>
            <li>All in all not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Came before expected, great colors, blends easily, only thing that could have made it better would be more than one size stencil...</li>
            <li>i love that I can make my own eye brow shades and the little tools that come with it makes it easy to travel with on the go.</li>
            <li>This is my new make up!:-)</li>
            <li>This is my new make up!:-)</li>
            <li>The colors are bold and hold on the skin well.</li>
            <li>The colors are ok but to actually pick up product you need a better brush</li>
            <li>The tweezers are very cheap and don&#x27;t want to hardly grab a hair, so you&#x27;re better off using your own.  </li>
            <li>Lines are very easy to go on and look natural.</li>
            <li>mix the three colors for a more natural color and it goes beautifully with my medium dark hair.  </li>
            <li>I just got these the other day and for the first time I have beautiful eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The dark brown is a pretty good match for me!</li>
            <li>Tweezers are not useless but definitely cheap.</li>
            <li>Okay,  so I ordered this on new years, and it got to my house on the 5th.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and LOVE the powdered eyebrows and the stencils.</li>
            <li>But this is something I will definitely be getting more of when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Very helpfulll.!!</li>
            <li>Stencils make for super easy application and the makeup looks very natural!</li>
            <li>Really helped me to shape eyebrows-colors are fine and they stay on.</li>
            <li>and you have a good day and be careful</li>
            <li>They are useless to me but the powder blends nice and is great for filling in etc.</li>
            <li>it is fun and starts the idea of having MOVIESTAR brows...</li>
            <li>its better to follow your natural brow.</li>
            <li>I rarely use the spooly</li>
            <li>Looks more natural.</li>
            <li>Skip this product and splurge on something that is worth it - because as we all know, eyebrows are the nipples to your face.</li>
            <li>worth it for the money</li>
            <li>kind of make my skin turn red.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>but i was surprised how well the eyebrow powder worked :)</li>
            <li>She told me that this product was more natural looking than the pencils</li>
            <li>I like the shade and choose the lightest one because it looks more natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stencils: I was hoping this would be useful.</li>
            <li>Brushes and color palette are nice, although I will only use one color.</li>
            <li>I did not find the stencils useful -</li>
            <li>The powders are very high pigmented and the brush is the right size for precise brow..</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>At first I thought the brush to apply it was too soft, but after a few applications I decided it was perfect.</li>
            <li>The stencils help with getting just the right shape.</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>None of it looked right.  </li>
            <li>and if you do it right it doesn&#x27;t look like your eye brows are drawn on which</li>
            <li>I am pretty happy with this eyebrow kit, but there are a few downfalls I’ll bring up in a minute.</li>
            <li>I have dark eyebrows and the colors are perfect and last all day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at this eyebrow thing, so it probably works fine in the right hands.</li>
            <li>The darker color is so perfect, its very natural color which is hard to find and the colors lasts all day.</li>
            <li>This looks great, it is a gift, so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really had very many - some people think I have over plucked ...</li>
            <li>The stencils are nice but extremely long not like anyones eyebrows</li>
            <li>Basically a good product with a slight learning curve.</li>
            <li>I had previously used an eyebrow filler that I loved, but it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>the stensil part of it don&#x27;t fit like the ad displayed; the powder barely sticks you have to apply so many applications of powder and the brush is way too soft.</li>
            <li>I like this very much to use</li>
            <li>I like this and didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li>I received my producet very fast</li>
            <li>I would recommend, instead, having them done professionally and then perhaps using the powder to enhance them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the product seems fine.</li>
            <li>Simple, quick, and easy.</li>
            <li>This item came in the mail in a timely manner and is exactly what it says to be.</li>
            <li>The colors were exactly as shown and the pigment stays all day.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I stopped using the powder after I found a shade that worked better for me, but I still use this one occasionally.  </li>
            <li>Arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I go back &amp; forth between the two top shades &amp;</li>
            <li>I looked rather funny.</li>
            <li>Love the color as smaller than I thought and the tweezers suck!</li>
            <li>it last all day I have to scrub off at night to remove most of the times.</li>
            <li>I got this for the stencils when I was first learning about how to shape my brows</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy again:-)</li>
            <li>I love the different powders and the two brushes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased a different stencil set that had more to offer</li>
            <li>Trying to actually use these to pluck more than a couple hairs would drive me crazy!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried wearing so many different ways and 4 out of 7 times</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what to do with the  </li>
            <li>The brow powder is good because it gives you thicker looking brows without looking too harsh.</li>
            <li>if you have very long bushy thick eyebrows , this thing can rly improve ur eyebrows and give them a beautiful shape :)</li>
            <li>Altogether, the pigmentation is great; it is very long lasting, but it does rub off if you start sweating and wipe your face.  </li>
            <li>It was super easy to use; however, i felt as though the powder went on a little too light.</li>
            <li>it is the top darker color because its an ashy color the bottom colors are red tone beware of using it because unless you have red hair this will not look good the red tone may not be noticeable in the mirror</li>
            <li>Other than that it goes on nicely and it makes your eye brows look &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; fuller.</li>
            <li>Stencil is cheap and too much arch for natural look</li>
            <li>is nice definitely gives them the &#x27;natural&#x27; look.</li>
            <li>Wish there was one that went on a bit less warm.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant when I was first considering buying this product because of some of the reviews and the fact that i have never been much of an eyebrow girl.</li>
            <li>The colors of the brow powder is good but, somehow, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The stencil is way too large for my face.</li>
            <li>I have near black eyebrows, and using the pallet they look completely natural, great for filling the sparse areas in.</li>
            <li>A nice little buy, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>But this handy little tool has become one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are tucked into their own little holes.</li>
            <li>But this handy little tool has become one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brushes are tucked into their own little holes.</li>
            <li>, it’s so hard to get them to look good.</li>
            <li>This product was bought for my sister and she really enjoys it.</li>
            <li>then it looks and the templates dont really work well at all.</li>
            <li>Took my stencils to someone house to get ready for a wedding and someone had sticky fingers</li>
            <li>Takes practice to use the stencils, but they really do help you shape your brows....</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t care much for the eyebrow arch</li>
            <li>we all know there comes a time when we pluck to much</li>
            <li>There are 3 templates included so you can customize your eyebrows, but I did not find them very use.</li>
            <li>My friend really did like it.  </li>
            <li>They make this look easier then it really is.</li>
            <li>Very functional.  </li>
            <li>so it really does not show when I use it.</li>
            <li>The way I shape my brows are very close to the stencils</li>
            <li>and it came of really fast.</li>
            <li>While the eyebrow pencil is easier and faster to &#x27;draw&#x27; on, this shadow looks so much nicer.  </li>
            <li>The stencils don&#x27;t work very well since you can&#x27;t tell the distance between eye&#x27;s and nose, but I learned to measure the shape of my eyebrow with out it and just use the brush and walla</li>
            <li>The brown above it worked alright, but it was too light for me.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>The make up is ok expected the kit to work</li>
            <li>Really, all I use is the one color, grooming brush and application brush.</li>
            <li>Really, all I use is the one color, grooming brush and application brush.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work 😊☺</li>
            <li>It really makes them look real.</li>
            <li>I am dirty blonde and my eyebrows are medium brown and the color shadows available are great!</li>
            <li>The colors didn&#x27;t really match my eyebrow</li>
            <li>It has worked very well for me and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>The tools were helpful and much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>The brush is perfect, thin enough to get the job done, but if you brush upwards you can thicken the line.</li>
            <li>Although, this is nice, I was expecting the eyebrow stencils to be different although they are three of the same stencil.</li>
            <li>It builds up nicely with a few coats.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The flat angled brush would of been fine, except the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; would come out of it every time I used it, and eventually I&#x27;m not going to have a brush because of that.  </li>
            <li>Color was suppose to be natural and it&#x27;s way too Orange not what it says!!!</li>
            <li>I also was excited to get the brow stencil - but very dissappointed with the stencil as it is too big</li>
            <li>This was not what I thought it was, and there are other eyebrow products out there that are much better than this one.  </li>
            <li>I have black hair and very light skin</li>
            <li>it dosen&#x60;t stick for long wear, the brush is tinny and the stencils are really cheap.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re not that dark :)</li>
            <li>I am a dark skinned African-American woman and I was able to use the darkest powder without having to blend it with anything else to match my skin color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda new at the whole doing your eyebrows</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong this eyebrow palette:) you will love it too.</li>
            <li>The brow guides were particularly helpful.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like this product.  </li>
            <li>If you have dark hair with a little bit of a red tint, this product would probably be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural as compared to my drawn in pencil that had a reddish tint to it that really didn&#x27;t match my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would highly  recommend E.L.F gel eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to make mire purchases from herei live live live live love live live live live</li>
            <li>Other than those complaints the product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>If your hair is more on the lighter side, I would recommend playing with the shades a little bit.</li>
            <li>I love this little kit.</li>
            <li>I found the stencil useless for me but everything else that came with it was great.</li>
            <li>Totally did not think this product was worth what i paid for it...</li>
            <li>The only color thats worth</li>
            <li>The brushes were the only items found useful.</li>
            <li>I mix the two of the colors provided to get a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;There are actually more gadgets in the little kit than I need, but have learned to work with just the little brush and the two darkest colors provided.</li>
            <li>the plasic thing only goes on your right eye brow and fits my check bones not my brows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use a tinted gel on my brows to make the left and right brow uniform in color and to help the hair grow.  </li>
            <li>I am new to shaping and arching my eyebrows but have done my research.</li>
            <li>As she is getting old, she can&#x27;t do her eyebrows with a steady hand.</li>
            <li>... if you have a decent amount of natural brows.</li>
            <li>BUT IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR AMAZINGLY UNIVERSAL SHADES OF EYEBROW POWDER THAT ARE NATURALLY COLORED, EASY TO APPLY AND LAST...</li>
            <li>The next is reddish brown and the third is a light brown.</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair, and the darkest shade looks very natural and not reddish at all.</li>
            <li>Not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li>You can go as light or as dark as wanted.  </li>
            <li>More suited for people that draw them on, or have extremely small eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I got three of the exact same stencil.</li>
            <li>the colors aren&#x27;t that dark, I am light skinned and the colors do not show up on my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It picks up just the right amount of color and it’s thin enough to get the details nicely.</li>
            <li>And the stencil is for a very dramatically shaped eyebrow that is long with a very aggressive arch.</li>
            <li>I love this because its not too dark there are 3 different shades</li>
            <li>It chain perfectly I&#x27;m open with the plastic on the front silver utensils would not be falling out and is very brand new</li>
            <li>So I purchased this in hopes of getting both a good brow powder and stencils to help shape my brows, I am terrible of it, anyways i am dissapointed with everything in the package, the stencils are waaaay to big and super thin, ( think early 90&#x27;s ) the powder not that great and the tweezers are pretty much garbage.</li>
            <li>The bottom shade is too ashy and does nothing to dull the top shade&#x27;s intensity.  </li>
            <li>natural hair can run a little red, so I thought I could pull off the undertones of the second shade, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too reddish and that was natural looking to fill in my sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li>natural color is so ligth</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li>It gives you a natural look</li>
            <li>but when it arrive their was 3 stencils were all the same, very misleading.</li>
            <li>Blendable and natural looking.</li>
            <li>I had asked her how she was spared her eyebrows (as they looked so natural).</li>
            <li>Lastly, this is very petty</li>
            <li>Lastly, this is very petty</li>
            <li>I used to use a black eye liner to draw in my brows.... looked OK but not very natural.</li>
            <li>I used to use a black eye liner to draw in my brows.... looked OK but not very natural.</li>
            <li>You can see it from far away that its brown &amp; not black.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are a bit awkward with some places more full than others.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hear with spots of dark or medium blonde</li>
            <li>The tips are very simple and clear, but if you&#x27;ve been styling your eyebrows for years like I have, you really won&#x27;t find them helpful since all the directions are obvious!</li>
            <li>I love the soft colors when applying this product - the stencils are complicated to use for me, but I really like the quality of the colors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dark color eyebrown as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>I liked the pigmentation the two lighter colors, but it lasts less than a few hours before it disappears on my skin, (don&#x27;t ask how, because I don&#x27;t even understand how it happens - I am not one to touch my face throughout the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes and the tweezers that come with the product are probably worth less than 1.00 together.</li>
            <li>of this moment, the product sits in my drawer, and will probably only be used as a back up or as a bring-along to a trip (because if it got lost, I really wouldn&#x27;t miss it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are hard to mix to be consistent, and the brow shapes to fill in are not too realistic--the shapes are too long and full.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but is hard to blend.  </li>
            <li>The second shade is too pink, the top shade too dark.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a dark brunette with light skin, just fork over the money for the more expensive brow colors.</li>
            <li>When I do sometimes I like to fill them in with power to make them look a little more sharp.</li>
            <li>Tweezers useless, but eyebrow powders work very well especially if you wet the powder on your eyebrow a bit it holds good.</li>
            <li>Instructions aren&#x27;t clear enough for a beginner</li>
            <li>i should have spent so much money on something i didnt have use for.where</li>
            <li>I use a longer eyeliner brush which is the same shape as the small brush that this comes with, I just feel like my long brush provides me with more control.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m back to my old fashioned brown mascara for coloring my brows.</li>
            <li>The top one is a dark brown for me, this is the only one I use since I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>I find its really hard to find an perfect ash dark brown for my almost black dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>Out of the whole set, I continue to use the brush with other eyebrow powders I have.  </li>
            <li>I have very sparse brows due to years</li>
            <li>The product comes with 3 stencils that are (inexplicably) identical, which might be OK if your brow happens to be the exact shape of the stencil, but is definitely a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for the rest of us.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I don’t really think it matters if you have a cheap brush or expensive one</li>
            <li>I don’t really think it matters if you have a cheap brush or expensive one</li>
            <li>it is a good product, but the colors are hard to show up on dark skin or hair you need something darker brown or black.</li>
            <li>i thought i had gotton the intense one but got the natural :/</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used stencils before but these are too few and too large.</li>

            <li> But the stencils and colors are great.</li>
            <li> in my opinion the powder wasn&#x27;t all that great</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance on this product after all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li> It also stays on all day looking great without smudging.  </li>
            <li> so I was at a loss as to what color I should get, however this works quite great.</li>

            <li> Good shading tools, though.</li>
            <li> If you are getting this for the stencils I say don&#x27;t buy and try going to a salon and asking about a good shape for your brow.</li>
            <li> Good for filling in sparse brows.</li>
            <li> But I do know that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and it looks good on me.</li>

            <li> It does a great job at making my brows look fuller and more defined.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and am very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good except the fact that the powders dont have an abundant amount of pigmentation.</li>

            <li> its a nice product.</li>
            <li> I found it easier just to draw my own lines, but I didn&#x27;t try to get used to them either.  </li>
            <li> Its great for the price, I bought it with low expectations and it came out to be great!</li>
            <li> You need to SPEND REAL MONEY FOR GREAT STENCILS!</li>
            <li> The powder and brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> This is a handy kit for defining your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It is a nice eye brow perfecter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother with the tweezers because I have my own.  </li>
            <li> The colors are nice too.  </li>
            <li> Product is nice</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I liked the tweezers though, they did what they were supposed to do</li>
            <li> Nice and easy to use!</li>
            <li> I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and good quality.</li>
            <li> I love the perfect brow , it really helps get the shape you want and over all i give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to use everything .</li>
            <li> I use a clear brow gel before or after whatever I feel like that day and it is the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size and not heavy at all, so you can hold it in your hand while you color your eyebrows if you need to.</li>
            <li> It gives my eyebrows a wonderful, natural look.</li>
            <li> Also, I would have liked a better tool kit, so I had to buy a better brush.</li>
            <li> This helps me easily touch up and make sure both sides are even!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very light eyebrows since birth and decided to try this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, once you master the technique of brushing on the brow powder while holding the template in place, without getting in your own way.  </li>
            <li> Its also nice that it comes with tweasers so if you are in a snitch you can easily take care of it.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it - it is nice, I haven&#x27;t used stencils yet, but it is easy to get the shade you need by mixing those they provide.</li>
            <li> My Sister came over and tried it and fell in love with it to</li>
            <li> i am so amazed at the difference in my eyebrows and so many compliments.</li>
            <li> i love my brown kit...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more brownish that i tought</li>
            <li> Add a touch of water to your application brush and you won&#x27;t even smudge throughout the day...or night. :)</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> The shapers I don&#x27;t use much but the over all kit is great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> So much better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay wish it was darker .</li>
            <li> But these look great and more real trust</li>
            <li> me the powder looks better than pencil.</li>
            <li> This product has stencils and brow powder which seems to stay on better than eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but it works.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday &amp; i try using it, it was OK</li>
            <li> sometimes (like if using eyeshadow), but there should be more options for shades of browns.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Eyebrow pencils are better.</li>
            <li> it works phenomenally.</li>
            <li> I was able to create more eyebrows with this kit.  </li>
            <li> The cameo brow maker natural is perfect for light brown blonds.  </li>
            <li> The effect is better than pencil lines.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Cameo Perfect Brow for brunettes, but after several uses, it can&#x27;t hold a candle to Anastasia or Smashbox.  </li>
            <li> She was pleased with the product and plans to reorder when she is completed with this compact.  </li>
            <li> But these look great and more real trust</li>
            <li> me the powder looks better than pencil.</li>
            <li> is not to big and the colors are great!</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers aren&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> The colors are perfect, absolutely no red undertones which is always a problem for darker powders!</li>
            <li> so I bought this mostly for the stencils.  </li>
            <li> I love the tools it comes with and the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Could have been better, had it came with instructions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like reddish color.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> There should be more than one size.  </li>
            <li> Would buy again in a heart beat :)</li>
            <li> I love the three shades to choose from.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than using the peel off brow stencils.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the templates, but I love the brush and color choices in the kit.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I had a guide.</li>
            <li> Also, the color is more for lighter colored brows.</li>
            <li> and they did okay blendind but could be</li>
            <li> So I got this in hopes that I would be able to start learning to fill in my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Love the eye brush</li>
            <li> I was generally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Love this idea but the powders were all cracked when arrived</li>
            <li> The Perfect Brow Cameo has three stencils and they are all the same.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and boy am i glad.</li>
            <li> I prefer and mostly use just eyebrow pencils now.</li>
            <li> I love how there are three colors</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> It would be better if t had a mirror as well.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have to use more.</li>
            <li> The tweezers work really well, better than my own, and everything else is good.</li>
            <li> I can see this kit would be good for all hair colours...and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> The brush wand is pretty good, and the slant brush and tweezers are okay too.</li>
            <li> The twisters are pretty good and the eyebrow makeup is ok.</li>
            <li> This kit is less then $7 bucks, comes with three AMAZING, VERSATILE SHADES, A GREAT COMB, BRUSH APPLICATOR, tweezers and stencils!!!</li>
            <li> For normal use, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty good, the tongs is not goos at all...</li>
            <li> love it its easy to use,perfect colors.</li>
            <li> perfect every single time.</li>
            <li> It looks great and natural.</li>
            <li> Better for those with brown to light colored hair.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencil really helped me shape my eyebrows and make them look good.</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast and got it very fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Shipped very fast and got it very fast!!!!</li>
            <li> Everyone likes full eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Color application is easy.  </li>
            <li> For everyday no-one-cares-what-you-look-like effort, this will work, but if you&#x27;re looking for perfect brow color matching, reach for this if you&#x27;re a medium skin tone (for the top color) or if you&#x27;re a lighter brunette for the second/third colors.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite easy to remove, as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> easy to build up</li>
            <li> It arrive very quickly</li>
            <li> The directions are easy to understand.</li>
            <li> I’m pretty happy with my eyebrow shape, but thought it would be great if there was a stencil that helped me shape my eyebrows a little better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for high school student thou</li>
            <li> She uses it every day, she really likes the brush, it got the right angle, the colors of the shadows are also great</li>
            <li> If you shape your brows nicely, after using the palette, they look very natural!!!</li>
            <li> but I use this makeup for photography models and it does happen to work just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li> This is my first time having an eyebrow makeup kit, and I must say it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This little kit is really awesome.</li>
            <li> just a little darker guess I should have picked a darker color Perfect brow model.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results the very first time I used it, and I was happy to step out into the world with two complete and relatively symmetrical eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, colors don&#x27;t blend well.</li>
            <li> is the jell to fit the brow its just powder</li>
            <li> however the colors were light, and my skin tone is medium beige</li>
            <li> Works great on my blonde roommate, though!</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair</li>
            <li> I think my skin tone is too light to make this</li>
            <li> After wearing this one important evening, every photograph made me look like Groucho Marx (even though I didn&#x27;t THINK I looked like him when I waked out the door).  </li>
            <li> I really do like the mix of colors though, and I already had my own tweezers and brush, so</li>
            <li> as ive mentioned its really simple to use and its a great way to create or define the eyebrow you are trying to get.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t dare tweeze them to fit into this stencil.  </li>
            <li> the shapes didnt fit me</li>
            <li> I use the top shadow to fill in my eyebrows and blend with the eyebrow brush and my eyebrows look fuller, more shapely and even better, NATURAL.</li>
            <li> The shadow comes on really light and looks really cheap.</li>
            <li> Also the tweezer looks really cheap and doesn&#x27;t even pluck out hair.</li>
            <li> love it brow was to big for me and the make up is good</li>
            <li> Good colors, natural.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a decent set of tweezers, so when I go on vacation I could leave my nice ones at home.  </li>
            <li> well it was a pretty ok</li>
            <li> im happy with mine and did not take long to get in the mail</li>
            <li> when i bought this i was so excited, but I was dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products to make my blond eyebrows visible and pretty shape.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the price was so worth it!</li>
            <li> The eyebrow powder is excellent, however the stencils are too small</li>
            <li> so im familiar with the shape</li>
            <li> An eyebtow pencil is more proficient, and the color is always consistent.</li>
            <li> One thing did&#x27;nt care for were,the stencils which would make the shape more even but overall its a nice kit.</li>
            <li> and she was right!</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s fine - the price is right for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved the eyebrow colors, but the shaper were way to big for my face.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and satisfied with my purchase , I would recommend and or buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.</li>
            <li> Nice natural colors</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the template worked at all  and the powder wasn&#x27;t effective at giving a natural look.  </li>
            <li> All in all not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Came before expected, great colors, blends easily, only thing that could have made it better would be more than one size stencil...</li>
            <li> i love that I can make my own eye brow shades and the little tools that come with it makes it easy to travel with on the go.</li>
            <li> This is my new make up!:-)</li>
            <li> This is my new make up!:-)</li>
            <li> The colors are bold and hold on the skin well.</li>
            <li> The colors are ok but to actually pick up product you need a better brush</li>
            <li> The tweezers are very cheap and don&#x27;t want to hardly grab a hair, so you&#x27;re better off using your own.  </li>
            <li> Lines are very easy to go on and look natural.</li>
            <li> mix the three colors for a more natural color and it goes beautifully with my medium dark hair.  </li>
            <li> I just got these the other day and for the first time I have beautiful eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The dark brown is a pretty good match for me!</li>
            <li> Tweezers are not useless but definitely cheap.</li>
            <li> Okay,  so I ordered this on new years, and it got to my house on the 5th.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and LOVE the powdered eyebrows and the stencils.</li>
            <li> But this is something I will definitely be getting more of when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Very helpfulll.!!</li>
            <li> Stencils make for super easy application and the makeup looks very natural!</li>
            <li> Really helped me to shape eyebrows-colors are fine and they stay on.</li>
            <li> and you have a good day and be careful</li>
            <li> They are useless to me but the powder blends nice and is great for filling in etc.</li>
            <li> it is fun and starts the idea of having MOVIESTAR brows...</li>
            <li> its better to follow your natural brow.</li>
            <li> I rarely use the spooly</li>
            <li> Looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Skip this product and splurge on something that is worth it - because as we all know, eyebrows are the nipples to your face.</li>
            <li> worth it for the money</li>
            <li> kind of make my skin turn red.</li>
            <li> worth</li>
            <li> but i was surprised how well the eyebrow powder worked :)</li>
            <li> She told me that this product was more natural looking than the pencils</li>
            <li> I like the shade and choose the lightest one because it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stencils: I was hoping this would be useful.</li>
            <li> Brushes and color palette are nice, although I will only use one color.</li>
            <li> I did not find the stencils useful -</li>
            <li> The powders are very high pigmented and the brush is the right size for precise brow..</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought the brush to apply it was too soft, but after a few applications I decided it was perfect.</li>
            <li> The stencils help with getting just the right shape.</li>
            <li> The price is right.</li>
            <li> None of it looked right.  </li>
            <li> and if you do it right it doesn&#x27;t look like your eye brows are drawn on which</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this eyebrow kit, but there are a few downfalls I’ll bring up in a minute.</li>
            <li> I have dark eyebrows and the colors are perfect and last all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at this eyebrow thing, so it probably works fine in the right hands.</li>
            <li> The darker color is so perfect, its very natural color which is hard to find and the colors lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This looks great, it is a gift, so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had very many - some people think I have over plucked ...</li>
            <li> The stencils are nice but extremely long not like anyones eyebrows</li>
            <li> Basically a good product with a slight learning curve.</li>
            <li> I had previously used an eyebrow filler that I loved, but it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> the stensil part of it don&#x27;t fit like the ad displayed; the powder barely sticks you have to apply so many applications of powder and the brush is way too soft.</li>
            <li> I like this very much to use</li>
            <li> I like this and didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li> I received my producet very fast</li>
            <li> I would recommend, instead, having them done professionally and then perhaps using the powder to enhance them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the product seems fine.</li>
            <li> Simple, quick, and easy.</li>
            <li> This item came in the mail in a timely manner and is exactly what it says to be.</li>
            <li> The colors were exactly as shown and the pigment stays all day.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using the powder after I found a shade that worked better for me, but I still use this one occasionally.  </li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I go back &amp; forth between the two top shades &amp;</li>
            <li> I looked rather funny.</li>
            <li> Love the color as smaller than I thought and the tweezers suck!</li>
            <li> it last all day I have to scrub off at night to remove most of the times.</li>
            <li> I got this for the stencils when I was first learning about how to shape my brows</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy again:-)</li>
            <li> I love the different powders and the two brushes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a different stencil set that had more to offer</li>
            <li> Trying to actually use these to pluck more than a couple hairs would drive me crazy!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried wearing so many different ways and 4 out of 7 times</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what to do with the  </li>
            <li> The brow powder is good because it gives you thicker looking brows without looking too harsh.</li>
            <li> if you have very long bushy thick eyebrows , this thing can rly improve ur eyebrows and give them a beautiful shape :)</li>
            <li> Altogether, the pigmentation is great; it is very long lasting, but it does rub off if you start sweating and wipe your face.  </li>
            <li> It was super easy to use; however, i felt as though the powder went on a little too light.</li>
            <li> it is the top darker color because its an ashy color the bottom colors are red tone beware of using it because unless you have red hair this will not look good the red tone may not be noticeable in the mirror</li>
            <li> Other than that it goes on nicely and it makes your eye brows look &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; fuller.</li>
            <li> Stencil is cheap and too much arch for natural look</li>
            <li> is nice definitely gives them the &#x27;natural&#x27; look.</li>
            <li> Wish there was one that went on a bit less warm.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant when I was first considering buying this product because of some of the reviews and the fact that i have never been much of an eyebrow girl.</li>
            <li> The colors of the brow powder is good but, somehow, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The stencil is way too large for my face.</li>
            <li> I have near black eyebrows, and using the pallet they look completely natural, great for filling the sparse areas in.</li>
            <li> A nice little buy, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> But this handy little tool has become one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are tucked into their own little holes.</li>
            <li> But this handy little tool has become one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brushes are tucked into their own little holes.</li>
            <li> , it’s so hard to get them to look good.</li>
            <li> This product was bought for my sister and she really enjoys it.</li>
            <li> then it looks and the templates dont really work well at all.</li>
            <li> Took my stencils to someone house to get ready for a wedding and someone had sticky fingers</li>
            <li> Takes practice to use the stencils, but they really do help you shape your brows....</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for the eyebrow arch</li>
            <li> we all know there comes a time when we pluck to much</li>
            <li> There are 3 templates included so you can customize your eyebrows, but I did not find them very use.</li>
            <li> My friend really did like it.  </li>
            <li> They make this look easier then it really is.</li>
            <li> Very functional.  </li>
            <li> so it really does not show when I use it.</li>
            <li> The way I shape my brows are very close to the stencils</li>
            <li> and it came of really fast.</li>
            <li> While the eyebrow pencil is easier and faster to &#x27;draw&#x27; on, this shadow looks so much nicer.  </li>
            <li> The stencils don&#x27;t work very well since you can&#x27;t tell the distance between eye&#x27;s and nose, but I learned to measure the shape of my eyebrow with out it and just use the brush and walla</li>
            <li> The brown above it worked alright, but it was too light for me.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> The make up is ok expected the kit to work</li>
            <li> Really, all I use is the one color, grooming brush and application brush.</li>
            <li> Really, all I use is the one color, grooming brush and application brush.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work 😊☺</li>
            <li> It really makes them look real.</li>
            <li> I am dirty blonde and my eyebrows are medium brown and the color shadows available are great!</li>
            <li> The colors didn&#x27;t really match my eyebrow</li>
            <li> It has worked very well for me and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> The tools were helpful and much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect, thin enough to get the job done, but if you brush upwards you can thicken the line.</li>
            <li> Although, this is nice, I was expecting the eyebrow stencils to be different although they are three of the same stencil.</li>
            <li> It builds up nicely with a few coats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The flat angled brush would of been fine, except the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; would come out of it every time I used it, and eventually I&#x27;m not going to have a brush because of that.  </li>
            <li> Color was suppose to be natural and it&#x27;s way too Orange not what it says!!!</li>
            <li> I also was excited to get the brow stencil - but very dissappointed with the stencil as it is too big</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought it was, and there are other eyebrow products out there that are much better than this one.  </li>
            <li> I have black hair and very light skin</li>
            <li> it dosen&#x60;t stick for long wear, the brush is tinny and the stencils are really cheap.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re not that dark :)</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned African-American woman and I was able to use the darkest powder without having to blend it with anything else to match my skin color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda new at the whole doing your eyebrows</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong this eyebrow palette:) you will love it too.</li>
            <li> The brow guides were particularly helpful.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like this product.  </li>
            <li> If you have dark hair with a little bit of a red tint, this product would probably be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> It looks very natural as compared to my drawn in pencil that had a reddish tint to it that really didn&#x27;t match my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would highly  recommend E.L.F gel eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to make mire purchases from herei live live live live love live live live live</li>
            <li> Other than those complaints the product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> If your hair is more on the lighter side, I would recommend playing with the shades a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit.</li>
            <li> I found the stencil useless for me but everything else that came with it was great.</li>
            <li> Totally did not think this product was worth what i paid for it...</li>
            <li> The only color thats worth</li>
            <li> The brushes were the only items found useful.</li>
            <li> I mix the two of the colors provided to get a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;There are actually more gadgets in the little kit than I need, but have learned to work with just the little brush and the two darkest colors provided.</li>
            <li> the plasic thing only goes on your right eye brow and fits my check bones not my brows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use a tinted gel on my brows to make the left and right brow uniform in color and to help the hair grow.  </li>
            <li> I am new to shaping and arching my eyebrows but have done my research.</li>
            <li> As she is getting old, she can&#x27;t do her eyebrows with a steady hand.</li>
            <li> ... if you have a decent amount of natural brows.</li>
            <li> BUT IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR AMAZINGLY UNIVERSAL SHADES OF EYEBROW POWDER THAT ARE NATURALLY COLORED, EASY TO APPLY AND LAST...</li>
            <li> The next is reddish brown and the third is a light brown.</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair, and the darkest shade looks very natural and not reddish at all.</li>
            <li> Not too dark or too light.</li>
            <li> You can go as light or as dark as wanted.  </li>
            <li> More suited for people that draw them on, or have extremely small eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I got three of the exact same stencil.</li>
            <li> the colors aren&#x27;t that dark, I am light skinned and the colors do not show up on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It picks up just the right amount of color and it’s thin enough to get the details nicely.</li>
            <li> And the stencil is for a very dramatically shaped eyebrow that is long with a very aggressive arch.</li>
            <li> I love this because its not too dark there are 3 different shades</li>
            <li> It chain perfectly I&#x27;m open with the plastic on the front silver utensils would not be falling out and is very brand new</li>
            <li> So I purchased this in hopes of getting both a good brow powder and stencils to help shape my brows, I am terrible of it, anyways i am dissapointed with everything in the package, the stencils are waaaay to big and super thin, ( think early 90&#x27;s ) the powder not that great and the tweezers are pretty much garbage.</li>
            <li> The bottom shade is too ashy and does nothing to dull the top shade&#x27;s intensity.  </li>
            <li> natural hair can run a little red, so I thought I could pull off the undertones of the second shade, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too reddish and that was natural looking to fill in my sparse eyebrows.</li>
            <li> natural color is so ligth</li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasts all day and looks natural.</li>
            <li> It gives you a natural look</li>
            <li> but when it arrive their was 3 stencils were all the same, very misleading.</li>
            <li> Blendable and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I had asked her how she was spared her eyebrows (as they looked so natural).</li>
            <li> Lastly, this is very petty</li>
            <li> Lastly, this is very petty</li>
            <li> I used to use a black eye liner to draw in my brows.... looked OK but not very natural.</li>
            <li> I used to use a black eye liner to draw in my brows.... looked OK but not very natural.</li>
            <li> You can see it from far away that its brown &amp; not black.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are a bit awkward with some places more full than others.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hear with spots of dark or medium blonde</li>
            <li> The tips are very simple and clear, but if you&#x27;ve been styling your eyebrows for years like I have, you really won&#x27;t find them helpful since all the directions are obvious!</li>
            <li> I love the soft colors when applying this product - the stencils are complicated to use for me, but I really like the quality of the colors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dark color eyebrown as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li> I liked the pigmentation the two lighter colors, but it lasts less than a few hours before it disappears on my skin, (don&#x27;t ask how, because I don&#x27;t even understand how it happens - I am not one to touch my face throughout the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes and the tweezers that come with the product are probably worth less than 1.00 together.</li>
            <li> of this moment, the product sits in my drawer, and will probably only be used as a back up or as a bring-along to a trip (because if it got lost, I really wouldn&#x27;t miss it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors are hard to mix to be consistent, and the brow shapes to fill in are not too realistic--the shapes are too long and full.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but is hard to blend.  </li>
            <li> The second shade is too pink, the top shade too dark.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a dark brunette with light skin, just fork over the money for the more expensive brow colors.</li>
            <li> When I do sometimes I like to fill them in with power to make them look a little more sharp.</li>
            <li> Tweezers useless, but eyebrow powders work very well especially if you wet the powder on your eyebrow a bit it holds good.</li>
            <li> Instructions aren&#x27;t clear enough for a beginner</li>
            <li> i should have spent so much money on something i didnt have use for.where</li>
            <li> I use a longer eyeliner brush which is the same shape as the small brush that this comes with, I just feel like my long brush provides me with more control.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m back to my old fashioned brown mascara for coloring my brows.</li>
            <li> The top one is a dark brown for me, this is the only one I use since I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I find its really hard to find an perfect ash dark brown for my almost black dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Out of the whole set, I continue to use the brush with other eyebrow powders I have.  </li>
            <li> I have very sparse brows due to years</li>
            <li> The product comes with 3 stencils that are (inexplicably) identical, which might be OK if your brow happens to be the exact shape of the stencil, but is definitely a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for the rest of us.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I don’t really think it matters if you have a cheap brush or expensive one</li>
            <li> I don’t really think it matters if you have a cheap brush or expensive one</li>
            <li> it is a good product, but the colors are hard to show up on dark skin or hair you need something darker brown or black.</li>
            <li> i thought i had gotton the intense one but got the natural :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used stencils before but these are too few and too large.</li>
            <li> hard to hold the left and right eye deally on the brow...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this whole eyebrow shaping thing, so I&#x27;m just confused as to how you&#x27;re supposed to set the plastic thing and puck around it?</li>
            <li> The powder does last a long time though</li>
            <li> I expected that it would be much darker as I am very dark skinned</li>
            <li> I have decent eyebrows, but I like to just add a little bit of color to help fill in where I had a failed eyebrow piercing and just to give them a little more definition.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are completely useless and cheap.</li>
            <li> As far as the stencils go, I tried them a few times.  </li>
            <li> They are a tad too long</li>
            <li> Thid lasts for a really long time.</li>
            <li> far as the stencils...don&#x27;t waste your time.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks to get the routine down to making them look even and natural (much harder to do with sparse eyebrows)</li>
            <li> The second two have a little too much red in them for me.&lt;br /&gt;Application brush:</li>
            <li> Made eyes brows look dry.</li>
            <li> but, the stencils are more for people with really thin eyebrows because my thick ones did&#x27;nt shape well with the arches.</li>
            <li> I only used one shade of the powder, the darkest shade, since I have dark hair.  </li>
            <li> The colors are a bit dusty, but in all honesty they are of a much higher quality than I was expecting for the price point.  </li>
            <li> However, the darkest shade does have a slight red tint which didn&#x27;t match my skin &amp; hair colors.  </li>
            <li> I am Asian and have black hair.  </li>
            <li> just buy a black powder one next time.</li>
            <li> This one was a little big on my face.</li>
            <li> They come with little applicators that I actually adore.</li>
            <li> The actual colors are a little lighter than picture.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about this product, I love it</li>
            <li> Weird and messy and cheap</li>
            <li> Not much color.</li>
            <li> Stencils do not really work.</li>
            <li> I never really understood how to work these stencils.</li>
            <li> But other than that its okay... Not sure if ill buy again since I dont use the other colors.</li>
            <li> was not exactly what I expected, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> One brow is grey while the other is black.  </li>
            <li> It takes some practice, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Even the packaging is poorly designed, so that removing one tool causes everything to fall out at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Utter and complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that the tweezers are way too small and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to the $30 product I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I use a q-tip to help tone down the edges where I&#x27;ve put the powder on too wide.</li>
            <li> The only con: the tweezers that come with the kit are not very good</li>
            <li> and i hope you like phenoxyethanol and other super bad for you long named chemicals</li>
            <li> But other than that it is extremely helpful withb the tips!</li>
            <li> If yours are very sparse, it will not stay on the bald spots and may even be difficult to apply satisfactorily there.</li>
            <li> I have dark brows with gray here and there.</li>
            <li> To me this was not worth my money.</li>
            <li> I am considered to have average features and am not a petite person.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it, which make the whole set sort of useless for me.  </li>
            <li> Daughter really wanted this, must have been useless as I&#x27;ve never seen her with eyebrows shaped like this.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is the stencils that came with it.</li>
            <li> I say look for something else because this is not worth no $7</li>
            <li> Which I thought would do so once applied to my dark brown eyebrows</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for dark color eyebrows, if you are not blond just dont buy it.</li>
            <li> looks like its dark, bu its not</li>
            <li> the eye brow stencil&#x27;s on other hand are very hard to use without them slipping an next thing</li>
            <li> I would choose this product hands down over the pencils and eyeshadows I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> you no your eye brow is down by</li>
            <li> down side: the stencils that are suppose to shape your eyebrows are too long...it didnt bother me because i get my eyebrows waxed in the salon</li>
            <li> The lightest shade has a slight reddish tint to it and the darkest brown is fairly dark on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have really dark brows, almost black</li>
            <li> I had to mix another product into it so that the dark brown on this palette turned into black.</li>
            <li> The brown palettes work well for people with brown or black brows and blend in</li>
            <li> I have black hair and the color</li>
            <li> I have almost black hair</li>
            <li> I have less brow because of my thyroid so to make them fluffier and fuller is what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The darkest brown has a red undertone to it, and made me look ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The tweezers are a little short and difficult to use, the brush has the same issue.</li>
            <li> Not smooth, too dark; even an almost a caked on feeling</li>
            <li> The slanted brush included in this kit is too small to work with, but other than that...</li>
            <li> However, my feedback goes a little deeper than that.</li>
            <li> The color Cameo delivers is a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; from those two products.  </li>
            <li> There is little fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this little kit every day.</li>
            <li> The brow color is a very dark neutral kinda palette,  and it should work on any skin color ^^  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying something nicer and throwing it away within a few months.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> but this kit was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t waste yours.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> After getting this kit I realize how I’ve been missing out.</li>
            <li> After getting this kit I realize how I’ve been missing out.</li>
            <li> Buying this product was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I find it a little bit difficult to hold down the stencil with the brow bone area being curved while applying the powder.  </li>
            <li> Its annpying that people are giving this product such poor stars due to the stencils!!!</li>
            <li> Stencils are all the same shape just range from thin to thick.</li>
            <li> and it was very thin, thinner than the other two, and it made it a little difficult to hold down because it didn&#x27;t want to lay down flat.  </li>
            <li> but overall it is what I paid for like the powders everything else was useless.</li>
            <li> Too small.</li>
            <li> The stencils were definitely the wrong shape and size for my face, and I wouldn&#x27;t ever  recommend using them anyways.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s looks like small factory product.</li>
            <li> but I find them to be pointless since I have learned to draw them in.</li>
            <li> which this not cute trust me</li>
            <li> stencils were a bit small</li>
            <li> I was under the impression they were three different ones, although I may have mis read something or read the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> Brush was missing slow shipping</li>
            <li> I can’t reach my finger in to grab them because the space is too small.</li>
            <li> I can’t reach my finger in to grab them because the space is too small.</li>
            <li> I only gave three stars because the stencils are difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Pencils made my eyebrows look double fake.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like this color as yet.</li>
            <li> but they are all the same size so it was useless..</li>
            <li> Not ideal for anyone with dark brown or black brows - the palette makes you look a bit clownish.  </li>
            <li> The brush, itself, is very small and thin and, if you have arthritis or trouble holding onto something that little, you may have some difficulty maneuvering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stencils are a bit hard to keep in one spot while adding the shadow.</li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t hold hardly any color.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I’m also a little annoyed that I didn’t get the colors in the picture.</li>
            <li> I’m also a little annoyed that I didn’t get the colors in the picture.</li>
            <li> The stencils, while neatly covered in protective plastic, provide no use whatsoever (at least not for my eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a cocoa brown complextion and this &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; sucks.</li>
            <li> I like the tools it comes with, but the eyebrow colors are reddish which is a negative.</li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe except to compare it with the other products I&#x27;ve owned before.  </li>
            <li> The texture of this is not good and it falls apart,</li>
            <li> The stencils however are just the worst due to the fact that they&#x27;re all the same stencil.  </li>
            <li> the colors are very dull or too dark.....waste of money all in all in my opinion</li>
            <li> The stencils weren&#x27;t quite what I wanted they were too thin</li>
            <li> Did not work for me... not happy</li>
            <li> I tried using the pencil &amp; it was worse.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it, and it&#x27;s poor quality.</li>
            <li> These are either for kids or people with pencil thin eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Thin brows outliners , it&#x27;s 2015.</li>
            <li> However, when I opened it I noticed that the mascara wand was broken and the tweezers suck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried drawing eyebrows with a pencil and also using false brows</li>
            <li> i want my eyebrows to be, but for girls or guys looking for the stencils to determine the shape they will be a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> i hate the overr dramatic eyebrow look because on an everyday basis i do not like over done eyemakeup</li>
            <li> Your brows will not look drawn on or fake.</li>
            <li> but they always looked obviously fake.</li>
            <li> and so it was much to difficult to put on correctly gave it to a friend.</li>
            <li> it cant go wrong with the colors and the stencil helps.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I am unable to use it .</li>
            <li> I know this sounds weird, but I’ve never had one of these brushes.</li>
            <li> actual case itself is very annoying.</li>

            <li> actual case itself is very annoying.</li>
            <li> I always hated penciled eyebrows but needed them to put features on my bland complexion.</li>
            <li> Maybe I’m just bad at it, but they always look too fake.</li>
            <li> A disappointment.</li>
            <li> I truly hate giving a bad review</li>
            <li> I was sort of disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with the product</li>
            <li> Hated, and too bad does not spread well.</li>
            <li> The tweezer and brow stencils are worthless they have no use</li>
            <li> The stencils were worthless for me, but may work for you.</li>
            <li> The tweezers in this set were worthless and the colors did not blend as well as I would like</li>
            <li> i hate his stuff</li>
            <li> I HATE using pencils</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a horrible application brush since the set was so inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> These were awful.</li>
            <li> This is horrible!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are horrible tweezers.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product. Easy to use and good quality.</li>
            <li> It chain perfectly I&#x27;m open with the plastic on the front silver utensils would not be falling out and is very brand new and it looks good I can&#x27;t wait to give this away as a gift I bought one for myself but I&#x27;m not going to speak on that one cuz it had been opened but thank you all and you have a good day and be careful</li>
            <li> I have near black eyebrows, and using the pallet they look completely natural, great for filling the sparse areas in.</li>
            <li> love it its easy to use,perfect colors.</li>
            <li> I brought this so I don&#x27;t have to buy the one from sephora but now I wish I would&#x27;ve brought the one from sephora it&#x27;s good for high school student thou</li>
            <li> Great product and seller!!</li>
            <li> Cheap quality, colors don&#x27;t blend well. The brush wand is pretty good, and the slant brush and tweezers are okay too. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have fair hair and this product is great, it gives me the perfect frame for my brow...easy 5 star product</li>
            <li> I do not use the tweezers or stencils included in this kit. I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t too reddish and that was natural looking to fill in my sparse eyebrows. I have medium brown hair, and the darkest shade looks very natural and not reddish at all. I&#x27;ve received compliments after I started using this product.  The color lasts all day. I would choose this product hands down over the pencils and eyeshadows I&#x27;ve used. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!! The color match with different skin tones! The stencils are crap but great for just the makeup part.</li>
            <li> The product brought exectly what I was looking for!!! Will definitely order again. If you shape your brows nicely, after using the palette, they look very natural!!! Good product for good price!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for an inexpensive eye brow kit and I read the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try well it was a pretty ok but, the stencils are more for people with really thin eyebrows because my thick ones did&#x27;nt shape well with the arches.The kit it self is great for on-the go if you need to touch up your make up throughout the day and the tweezers and brushes are great for shaping.The brown palettes work well for people with brown or black brows and blend in well.One thing did&#x27;nt care for were,the stencils which would make the shape more even but overall its a nice kit.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just my brows but they aren&#x27;t shaped like any of the provided stencils. They are useless to me but the powder blends nice and is great for filling in etc. Your brows will not look drawn on or fake. Good price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Why do all eyebrow liners &amp; shadow have red undertones? I don&#x27;t have red eyebrows, they are ashy brown and all three of these colors were brown with red undertones. The brush and tweezers are great tho.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for myself and love it! My Sister came over and tried it and fell in love with it to so I ordered her one to 😊</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need the eyebrow pencil anymore. This eyebrow powder defines my eyebrows perfectly. The product is excalty as the picture, the only thing is that the stencils are bit big for my eyebrows. I would suggest making different sizes next time.&lt;br /&gt;Everything is great. The colors are perfect too.</li>
            <li> hard to hold the left and right eye deally on the brow... it is fun and starts the idea of having MOVIESTAR brows... so I enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> I have always used an eyebrow pencil after trying this i will never use a pencil again..i am so amazed at the difference in my eyebrows and so many compliments. Thank you for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This item came in the mail in a timely manner and is exactly what it says to be. The only reason I have no rated a 5 star is because I have not used it as I bought it for a gift and the colors seem a tad lite to me.</li>
            <li> i love my brown kit... i just wish that the colours were darker like the picture, it&#x27;s more brownish that i tought</li>
            <li> These last All Day! Add a touch of water to your application brush and you won&#x27;t even smudge throughout the day...or night. :)&lt;br /&gt;Each color has warmth to it. Wish there was one that went on a bit less warm.</li>
            <li> i should have spent so much money on something i didnt have use for.where is the jell to fit the brow its just powder</li>
            <li> The colors were exactly as shown and the pigment stays all day. It&#x27;s also enough powder that it should last a while. I have nothing bad to say about this product, I love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and my daughter simple loves this.</li>
            <li> works great and easy to use</li>
            <li> I love this and I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Tweezers useless, but eyebrow powders work very well especially if you wet the powder on your eyebrow a bit it holds good. The stencils weren&#x27;t quite what I wanted they were too thin I have thicker eyebrows that I wanted to shape out but overall it is what I paid for like the powders everything else was useless.</li>
            <li> Good deal forth money. The slanted brush included in this kit is too small to work with, but other than that...its a nice product.</li>
            <li> This product was bought for my sister and she really enjoys it. She uses it every day, she really likes the brush, it got the right angle, the colors of the shadows are also great</li>
            <li> the price is perfect the set is very nice. however the colors were light, and my skin tone is medium beige so I needed something darker</li>
            <li> This product is terrific,I apply to my brows just to darking them in and it last all day, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off even when I rub them. The shapers I don&#x27;t use much but the over all kit is great.</li>
            <li> I love this product. The stencils help with getting just the right shape. The colors are bold and hold on the skin well. The only thing I would change are the tweezers and handle lengths.</li>
            <li> This product is a joke.  Not meant for women of any color. Made eyes brows look dry. Not much color. I would highly  recommend E.L.F gel eyebrow kit. So much better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good except the fact that the powders dont have an abundant amount of pigmentation. The tweezers work really well, better than my own, and everything else is good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay wish it was darker . i thought i had gotton the intense one but got the natural :/</li>
            <li> Good and the colors are nice</li>
            <li> Overall, I am pleased with this product.  I only used one shade of the powder, the darkest shade, since I have dark hair.  However, the darkest shade does have a slight red tint which didn&#x27;t match my skin &amp; hair colors.  As far as the stencils go, I tried them a few times.  I found it easier just to draw my own lines, but I didn&#x27;t try to get used to them either.  However, I absolutely LOVED the brush!  I was expecting it to be a horrible application brush since the set was so inexpensive.  Out of the whole set, I continue to use the brush with other eyebrow powders I have.  I stopped using the powder after I found a shade that worked better for me, but I still use this one occasionally.  If you have dark hair with a little bit of a red tint, this product would probably be perfect for you.  If not, you still may like the way it looks.  Altogether, the pigmentation is great; it is very long lasting, but it does rub off if you start sweating and wipe your face.  For normal use, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Totally did not think this product was worth what i paid for it... Did not work for me... not happy</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use. Great quality, easy to use, looks great! Shipped very fast and got it very fast!!!! I used to use a black eye liner to draw in my brows.... looked OK but not very natural. But these look great and more real trust me the powder looks better than pencil. Its a must try. This is my new make up!:-)</li>
            <li> Its actually a lot smaller then it looks and the templates dont really work well at all. But other than that it is extremely helpful withb the tips!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff! I go back &amp; forth between the two top shades &amp; it blends perfectly with my eyebrows. I do not use the stencils. its better to follow your natural brow. I rarely use the spooly and I do not use the brush. I use a longer eyeliner brush which is the same shape as the small brush that this comes with, I just feel like my long brush provides me with more control. I do not tweeze my eyebrows. I use an eyebrow razor that I buy from target / walmart , they are $3 and come in packs of 3. hope this review helped xx</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have very sparse brows due to years (decades actually) of over-plucking and also medications for RA. I&#x27;ve tried drawing eyebrows with a pencil and also using false brows but they always looked obviously fake. This product has stencils and brow powder which seems to stay on better than eyeshadow. Looks more natural.</li>
            <li> Not ideal for anyone with dark brown or black brows - the palette makes you look a bit clownish.  Works great on my blonde roommate, though!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but it works. My sister likes it. The stencils are identical shapes, not different shapes as i was expecting.</li>
            <li> Might as well just use an eye shadow pallet&lt;br /&gt;And the plasic thing only goes on your right eye brow and fits my check bones not my brows.&lt;br /&gt;So it might work best for a rocky horror picture show kinda thing and i hope you like phenoxyethanol and other super bad for you long named chemicals</li>
            <li> Stencils are a bit hard to keep in one spot while adding the shadow. I tried using the pencil &amp; it was worse.</li>
            <li> Basically a good product with a slight learning curve. I mix the two of the colors provided to get a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;There are actually more gadgets in the little kit than I need, but have learned to work with just the little brush and the two darkest colors provided.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a present to my mom. As she is getting old, she can&#x27;t do her eyebrows with a steady hand. This helps her a lot.</li>
            <li> Got this yesterday &amp; i try using it, it was OK i like how my brow look like now more.&lt;br /&gt;Just doesn&#x27;t like those lil tools stuff on it. But you get what you pay for. Still recommend this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good that there&#x27;s no mica which can make your brows look sparkly sometimes (like if using eyeshadow), but there should be more options for shades of browns. Otherwise--great kit.</li>
            <li> Weird and messy and cheap</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I saw in Internet people saying good comments about this product and really it&#x27;s so good! It covered all my eyebrow perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am a very happy customer with my purchase of this Cameo Perfect Brow Make-Up kit! I have struggled for months trying to find the perfect shape and perfect WAY to shape my eyebrows - this kit is it! I will definitely be a continued consumer of this product!</li>
            <li> I found the stencil useless for me but everything else that came with it was great. i love that I can make my own eye brow shades and the little tools that come with it makes it easy to travel with on the go.</li>
            <li> natural color is so ligth</li>
            <li> the stencil would only work on a suprised witch&#x27;s eye brow... no one&#x27;s eyebrow looks like that... and the tweezers don&#x27;t even work well</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Made for asians. Too small.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to practive shading in my eyebrows. It was super easy to use; however, i felt as though the powder went on a little too light.</li>
            <li> Took my stencils to someone house to get ready for a wedding and someone had sticky fingers this is my second order</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Comes with everything you need for great looking brows.  Takes practice to use the stencils, but they really do help you shape your brows....especially for a beginner.  The only con: the tweezers that come with the kit are not very good and I don&#x27;t use them. I have black hair and the color is a good match. Not too dark or too light. Looks natural.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite. Must be reapplied. Eyebrow pencils are better. Stencils do not really work.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! I&#x27;m kinda new at the whole doing your eyebrows w/makeup. And this is an excellent choice. Only thing I don&#x27;t use is the stencils for the brows. I looked rather funny. But this is something I will definitely be getting more of when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> It works fine, but is hard to blend.  I ended up buying something nicer and throwing it away within a few months.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to darken up my eye brows an it works phenomenally. the eye brow stencil&#x27;s on other hand are very hard to use without them slipping an next thing you no your eye brow is down by you&#x27;re nose haha.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair so I had to play with the shades. If your hair is more on the lighter side, I would recommend playing with the shades a little bit. Other than that it goes on nicely and it makes your eye brows look &amp;#34;naturally&amp;#34; fuller. I personally do not like those &amp;#34;sharpie&amp;#34; eye brows so this was absolutely a great buy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s lasts all day and looks natural. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Color was suppose to be natural and it&#x27;s way too Orange not what it says!!! Stencil is cheap and too much arch for natural look</li>
            <li> love it brow was to big for me and the make up is good im happy with mine and did not take long to get in the mail</li>
            <li> For the price, you literally get what you paid for. However, my feedback goes a little deeper than that. I liked the pigmentation the two lighter colors, but it lasts less than a few hours before it disappears on my skin, (don&#x27;t ask how, because I don&#x27;t even understand how it happens - I am not one to touch my face throughout the day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes and the tweezers that come with the product are probably worth less than 1.00 together. The stencils, while neatly covered in protective plastic, provide no use whatsoever (at least not for my eyebrows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of this moment, the product sits in my drawer, and will probably only be used as a back up or as a bring-along to a trip (because if it got lost, I really wouldn&#x27;t miss it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR: Skip this product and splurge on something that is worth it - because as we all know, eyebrows are the nipples to your face.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care much for the eyebrow arch but the rest worked wonderfully.  I was able to create more eyebrows with this kit.  Ladies we all know there comes a time when we pluck to much and this helped.</li>
            <li> This looks great, it is a gift, so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality if make-up. I would order again.</li>
            <li> The cameo brow maker natural is perfect for light brown blonds.  You can go as light or as dark as wanted.  The effect is better than pencil lines.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Cameo Perfect Brow for brunettes, but after several uses, it can&#x27;t hold a candle to Anastasia or Smashbox.  The color Cameo delivers is a little &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; from those two products.  I think my skin tone is too light to make this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color application is easy.  The product and the product accessories are of sufficient quality to get the job done.  The colors are a bit dusty, but in all honesty they are of a much higher quality than I was expecting for the price point.  There is little fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My natural hair can run a little red, so I thought I could pull off the undertones of the second shade, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t work.  The second shade is too pink, the top shade too dark.  The bottom shade is too ashy and does nothing to dull the top shade&#x27;s intensity.  After wearing this one important evening, every photograph made me look like Groucho Marx (even though I didn&#x27;t THINK I looked like him when I waked out the door).  It&#x27;s difficult to describe except to compare it with the other products I&#x27;ve owned before.  If I had never seen those before, I&#x27;d never think anything was off about this one.  It&#x27;s just that this product isn&#x27;t in the same zip code.  And that&#x27;s fine - the price is right for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually bummed about this because I wanted this to work. For everyday no-one-cares-what-you-look-like effort, this will work, but if you&#x27;re looking for perfect brow color matching, reach for this if you&#x27;re a medium skin tone (for the top color) or if you&#x27;re a lighter brunette for the second/third colors.  If you&#x27;re a dark brunette with light skin, just fork over the money for the more expensive brow colors.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product......the colors are very dull or too dark.....waste of money all in all in my opinion</li>
            <li> if you have very long bushy thick eyebrows , this thing can rly improve ur eyebrows and give them a beautiful shape :)</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought it was, and there are other eyebrow products out there that are much better than this one.  There are 3 templates included so you can customize your eyebrows, but I did not find them very use.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother.  She was pleased with the product and plans to reorder when she is completed with this compact.  Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I just got mines today and I tried it on and I Loved it!! It gives you a natural look</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how easy it was to use. Great quality, easy to use, looks great! Shipped very fast and got it very fast!!!! I used to use a black eye liner to draw in my brows.... looked OK but not very natural. But these look great and more real trust me the powder looks better than pencil. Its a must try. This is my new make up!:-)</li>
            <li> perfect brows everytime.. i use this in combination with brow gel and pencil.. perfect every single time. worth it for the money</li>
            <li> I have severe arithis and so it was much to difficult to put on correctly gave it to a friend. My friend really did like it.  i just didn&#x27;t have the time nor inclination to fuss with it.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing this product I was using for my brows the regular powder makeup and I was happier. The texture of this is not good and it falls apart, it dosen&#x60;t stick for long wear, the brush is tinny and the stencils are really cheap.Very unhappy with the product</li>
            <li> Its great for the price, I bought it with low expectations and it came out to be great! I use it every day and I still have some left I would buy again.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My eyebrows are a bit awkward with some places more full than others. This helps me easily touch up and make sure both sides are even!</li>
            <li> I think this was a great deal for this kit! I use it everyday. The stencils were definitely the wrong shape and size for my face, and I wouldn&#x27;t ever  recommend using them anyways. The tweezers are a little short and difficult to use, the brush has the same issue. I really do like the mix of colors though, and I already had my own tweezers and brush, so this set is just a good deal and convenient. You can&#x27;t expect Ulta quality makeup when you order this for basically 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> the box is perfect for the purse! is not to big and the colors are great! also it has all the stuff for perfect brow</li>
            <li> Hated, and too bad does not spread well.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like it... it&#x27;s looks like small factory product. ....low quality. ...i don&#x27;t like it, and it&#x27;s poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had very light eyebrows since birth and decided to try this product.  I am quite pleased with it.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I find it a little bit difficult to hold down the stencil with the brow bone area being curved while applying the powder.  The powder does last a long time though and they give you 3 color choices which enables you to find the perfect match.</li>
            <li> ... if you have a decent amount of natural brows. If yours are very sparse, it will not stay on the bald spots and may even be difficult to apply satisfactorily there.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> The eyebrow kit. kind of make my skin turn red. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to the product.</li>
            <li> Met all of my expectations, and introduced me to the idea of having an alternative to use in wake of thinning eyebrows.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Pretty good product. The tweezers aren&#x27;t my favorite. I don&#x27;t use them, nor the stencils. I do use the brow brush and the shaping brush. Both work well. I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used stencils before but these are too few and too large. The colors of the brow powder is good but, somehow, it doesn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve used. I truly hate giving a bad review but this kit was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> Love the color as smaller than I thought and the tweezers suck!</li>
            <li> I have dark brows with gray here and there. I didn&#x27;t expect this product to work. But it does. It takes some practice, as a little goes a long way. I use a q-tip to help tone down the edges where I&#x27;ve put the powder on too wide. But I&#x27;m a believer.</li>
            <li> worth it cant go wrong with the colors and the stencil helps.</li>
            <li> This product has no &amp;#34;pros&amp;#34; that I can find. &amp;#34;Cons&amp;#34; include:&lt;br /&gt;1. The color does not apply evenly.&lt;br /&gt;2. The brush doesn&#x27;t hold hardly any color.&lt;br /&gt;3. The product comes with 3 stencils that are (inexplicably) identical, which might be OK if your brow happens to be the exact shape of the stencil, but is definitely a &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for the rest of us.&lt;br /&gt;4. Even the packaging is poorly designed, so that removing one tool causes everything to fall out at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Utter and complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> These were awful. They make this look easier then it really is. To me this was not worth my money. So don&#x27;t waste yours. No I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this</li>
            <li> Loved the colors and the brow tools that were included in this kit.</li>
            <li> Very helpfulll.!! excelent product.</li>
            <li> Love this.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> Came before expected, great colors, blends easily, only thing that could have made it better would be more than one size stencil... This one was a little big on my face.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. The colors are perfect, absolutely no red undertones which is always a problem for darker powders! For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong. Its annpying that people are giving this product such poor stars due to the stencils!!! This kit is less then $7 bucks, comes with three AMAZING, VERSATILE SHADES, A GREAT COMB, BRUSH APPLICATOR, tweezers and stencils!!! If you&#x27;re expecting to find amazing tools or stencils to recreate eyebrows in THIS KIT then your expectations are out of sack. You need to SPEND REAL MONEY FOR GREAT STENCILS! BUT IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING FOR AMAZINGLY UNIVERSAL SHADES OF EYEBROW POWDER THAT ARE NATURALLY COLORED, EASY TO APPLY AND LAST... THIS IS IT!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time on my brows. I use a clear brow gel before or after whatever I feel like that day and it is the best! it last all day I have to scrub off at night to remove most of the times. The tweezer and brow stencils are worthless they have no use so if thats what you are looking for I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this little kit. You get 3 colors to mix/choose from in the kit and can build up the intensity. It&#x27;s quite easy to remove, as well. They come with little applicators that I actually adore. Definitely recommend this if you&#x27;re a beginner and want to experiment.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. I might give it away. I guess I&#x27;ll stick with pencils.</li>
            <li> Good colors, natural. Easy to use. The stencils were worthless for me, but may work for you.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!! I love it and very fast delivery!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this very much to use and I still use it to this day although I did purchase another eyebrow brush with a longer handle on it.</li>
            <li> Very functional.  I have no eyebrows because of chemotherapy so I bought this mostly for the stencils.  They are a tad too long but I and you can adjust that.  I love the tools it comes with and the assortment of colors.</li>
            <li> Not smooth, too dark; even an almost a caked on feeling</li>
            <li> The colors are a great match for my redish brown hair. brushes are the perfect angle... I never really understood how to work these stencils. Everyone&#x27;s face is a different shape! I just don&#x27;t get it. But the makeup itself is great.</li>
            <li> I really loved the stencil but i was surprised how well the eyebrow powder worked :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to build up and it looks great :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so as ive mentioned its really simple to use and its a great way to create or define the eyebrow you are trying to get. I like to use the stencil to color in the eyebrows and pluck away any hairs that arent colored byt the powder.</li>
            <li> The stencil is way too large for my face. I am considered to have average features and am not a petite person. I wish I had chosen a kit with multiple stencils. The powder and brushes are nice.</li>
            <li> The actual colors are a little lighter than picture. I have almost black hair and it worked perfect with my eyebrows. Would recommend this to someone who has darker hair.</li>
            <li> I expected that it would be much darker as I am very dark skinned so it really does not show when I use it.</li>
            <li> For the price, this set can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s easy to use, once you master the technique of brushing on the brow powder while holding the template in place, without getting in your own way.  I was happy with the results the very first time I used it, and I was happy to step out into the world with two complete and relatively symmetrical eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t use the tweezers or angle brush at all. But the stencils and colors are great. I use it everyday. Could have been better, had it came with instructions. Overall, wouldn&#x27;t mind buying again.</li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows but I get them waxed atleast twice a month. When I do sometimes I like to fill them in with power to make them look a little more sharp. I thought this item was the answer to my prayers but it wasn&#x27;t. The powder cannot be seen on my skin. Im a cocoa brown complextion and this &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; sucks.</li>
            <li> The reason I say it&#x27;s &amp;#34;Okay&amp;#34; is because it doesnt come with the wax. It&#x27;s just eyebrow shadow which isn&#x27;t enough to keep eyebrow hairs in place. Good shading tools, though.</li>
            <li> Love it! Nice and easy to use! Comes with 3 stencils that can match anyone&#x27;s eyes. The brow color is a very dark neutral kinda palette,  and it should work on any skin color ^^  I would buy from this seller again!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, colors are perfect and easy to use. You can&#x27;t go wrong this eyebrow palette:) you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I find its really hard to find an perfect ash dark brown for my almost black dark brown hair. The darker color is so perfect, its very natural color which is hard to find and the colors lasts all day. I got this for the stencils when I was first learning about how to shape my brows I thought six bucks and its comes with color great! but when it arrive their was 3 stencils were all the same, very misleading. The way I shape my brows are very close to the stencils but I find them to be pointless since I have learned to draw them in. If you are getting this for the stencils I say don&#x27;t buy and try going to a salon and asking about a good shape for your brow. The only color thats worth it is the top darker color because its an ashy color the bottom colors are red tone beware of using it because unless you have red hair this will not look good the red tone may not be noticeable in the mirror but if you take a photo it will end will like you have red eyebrows which this not cute trust me I have college id photos that prove it.</li>
            <li> Thid lasts for a really long time. It stays on well and I use it every day. Blendable and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I love the soft colors when applying this product - the stencils are complicated to use for me, but I really like the quality of the colors.</li>
            <li> I like the things it brings but what I don&#x27;t like is that all the eyebrow palettes are the same I thought the shapes would be different.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dark color eyebrown as shown in the picture. It&#x27;s more like reddish color. Plus, the tweezer doesn&#x27;t even pluck out hair. Ughhh!!!</li>
            <li> This product is AWESOME, exactly what I wanted. It was represented perfectly and a great price. I will definitely buy again:-)</li>
            <li> I have used this little kit every day. I have black hair and very light skin and I use the darkest of the colours to fill in my overly plucked brows, and it fills them in perfectly without looking like I used a crayon I found in prison (we all know that look). I can see this kit would be good for all hair colours...and it is super easy to use. The price is right. I&#x27;ll purchase it again.</li>
            <li> stencils were a bit small</li>
            <li> Love it I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product! I have dark eyebrows and the colors are perfect and last all day! The tips are very simple and clear, but if you&#x27;ve been styling your eyebrows for years like I have, you really won&#x27;t find them helpful since all the directions are obvious! It&#x27;s the perfect size and not heavy at all, so you can hold it in your hand while you color your eyebrows if you need to. Perfect eyebrow powder for almost all colors... since you can play with the shades and they&#x27;re not that dark :) The only problem I have with it is that the tweezers are way too small and \\&quot;cheap\\&quot; so I&#x27;ll just rather use the ones that I already had. I still give the product five stars though because it&#x27;s a great price for all that you get!</li>
            <li> The brow stencil is ridiculously big for my face.  I can&#x27;t use it, which make the whole set sort of useless for me.  There should be more than one size.  If you have a smaller face don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> when i bought this i was so excited, but I was dissapointed. It took forever to arrive! in my opinion the powder wasn&#x27;t all that great and it came of really fast. I ended up giving it to my mom! The stencils are nice but extremely long not like anyones eyebrows i know. This didnt work for me but it might for someone else...</li>
            <li> The brush is perfect, thin enough to get the job done, but if you brush upwards you can thicken the line. Various shades so it can accommodate when you color your hair. Only reason it did not get 5 stars is because I have to use the &#x27;wax&#x27; from another kit in combo with the brow powder from this kit. Would buy again in a heart beat :)</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t compare to the $30 product I used in the past.  Also, the packaging is so bulky that it&#x27;s not practical to travel with so I&#x27;m back to my old fashioned brown mascara for coloring my brows.</li>
            <li> Daughter really wanted this, must have been useless as I&#x27;ve never seen her with eyebrows shaped like this.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this compact! Going to have to order another one because i&#x27;m about to run out!!&lt;br /&gt;Perfection!</li>
            <li> I love the three shades to choose from.  I never had to worry about my brows before cancer.  Ever since my eyelashes and brows fell out my brows came back sparse.  One brow is grey while the other is black.  I had to learn to wear makeup with creativity.  I experimented with brow pencils, glue-on brows, brushes, dyes, etc. None of it looked right.  I use a tinted gel on my brows to make the left and right brow uniform in color and to help the hair grow.  I use this product to fill in.  It looks great and natural.</li>
            <li> Okay,  so I ordered this on new years, and it got to my house on the 5th. Anyways I just tried it. Annd I love it ! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is all 3 powders are lighter than my eyebrows. Buuut , it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using an eyebrow pencil for years for my sparse eyebrows.  I decided to take a chance on this product after all the great reviews.  While the eyebrow pencil is easier and faster to &#x27;draw&#x27; on, this shadow looks so much nicer.  It took a couple of weeks to get the routine down to making them look even and natural (much harder to do with sparse eyebrows) but now I wouldn&#x27;t go back to the pencil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix the three colors for a more natural color and it goes beautifully with my medium dark hair.  It looks very natural as compared to my drawn in pencil that had a reddish tint to it that really didn&#x27;t match my hair.  It also stays on all day looking great without smudging.  The brush, itself, is very small and thin and, if you have arthritis or trouble holding onto something that little, you may have some difficulty maneuvering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the stencils...don&#x27;t waste your time.  I tried them and they were so big for me plus they didn&#x27;t line up with my eyebrows.  But it&#x27;s no big deal...I am very satisfied with the eyebrow shadow and its great results!</li>
            <li> I say dah cause I did not realize I was getting a brow stencil with this kit.  It is much better than using the peel off brow stencils.  I am very very happy!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had expected. I was somewhat disappointed the product in general was good but the stensil part of it don&#x27;t fit like the ad displayed; the powder barely sticks you have to apply so many applications of powder and the brush is way too soft.</li>
            <li> These are either for kids or people with pencil thin eyebrows.  They are TINY and I would not recommend.  I basically have to throw them out. Not for women with traditional eyebrows.  More suited for people that draw them on, or have extremely small eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s came on time. I loved the eyebrow colors, but the shaper were way to big for my face. Way to big.</li>
            <li> This is a handy kit for defining your eyebrows. I didn&#x27;t use the templates, but I love the brush and color choices in the kit.</li>
            <li> I just got these the other day and for the first time I have beautiful eyebrows. I would highly recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this whole eyebrow shaping thing, so I&#x27;m just confused as to how you&#x27;re supposed to set the plastic thing and puck around it?</li>
            <li> This is horrible!!!!!!! I bought mine and never have used it after I tried it:/ Do not recommend at all</li>
            <li> Thin brows outliners , it&#x27;s 2015. Everyone likes full eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at this eyebrow thing, so it probably works fine in the right hands. If you have smaller, rounder eyebrows like I do, the kit isn&#x27;t going to work for you. The templates will not help you at all. I would recommend, instead, having them done professionally and then perhaps using the powder to enhance them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise the product seems fine. There are three templates and three shades of brown. The lightest shade has a slight reddish tint to it and the darkest brown is fairly dark on your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyebrow filler I ever use! Love it</li>
            <li> The templates do work, you just have to pivot them at your arch in order to follow the shape of your individual brow.  The power does set if you go over your eyebrows with just the slightest bit of foundation.  I am a dark skinned African-American woman and I was able to use the darkest powder without having to blend it with anything else to match my skin color.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t the greatest I could have bought but deffinetly for the price. I have light brown hear with spots of dark or medium blonde so I was at a loss as to what color I should get, however this works quite great. Good for filling in sparse brows. The only negative is the stencils that came with it. They are all the same one. I was under the impression they were three different ones, although I may have mis read something or read the wrong thing. Will probably buy this again when needed, and would recommend no doubt.</li>
            <li> Instructions aren&#x27;t clear enough for a beginner</li>
            <li> ITS NOT THAT I EXPECT IT</li>
            <li> A cancer patient told me about this product just prior to me losing my hair to chemo. I had asked her how she was spared her eyebrows (as they looked so natural). She told me that it was brow makeup. She told me that this product was more natural looking than the pencils and she was right! Even though my hair has grown back, I still use the product to fill in the brows because it still has some thinness to it.</li>
            <li> This little kit is really awesome. I&#x27;ve never been one to hardcore &amp;#34;do my brows&amp;#34;, so when I decided to start.. I wanted to make sure I had a guide. This palette is pretty awesome. The powders are very high pigmented and the brush is the right size for precise brow.. coloring? I don&#x27;t know. But I do know that it doesn&#x27;t smudge and it looks good on me.</li>
            <li> I like that It came with a shaper for the brows. The color was great too. A nice little buy, I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The tweezers in this set were worthless and the colors did not blend as well as I would like but I use this makeup for photography models and it does happen to work just fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to actually try this out.</li>
            <li> The brow templates are not something I would use.  I have less brow because of my thyroid so to make them fluffier and fuller is what I needed.  I like the colors but I mixed them a bit and also used a pencil with it.</li>
            <li> Nice kit for the price! Very affordable and satisfied with my purchase , I would recommend and or buy again.</li>
            <li> My wife loves using this. Simple, quick, and easy. I also noticed an improvement when she used it compared to when she does it without.</li>
            <li> You get what you payed for. It is a nice eye brow perfecter. Although, this is nice, I was expecting the eyebrow stencils to be different although they are three of the same stencil. Also, the color is more for lighter colored brows. I have really dark brows, almost black and they did okay blendind but could be just a little darker guess I should have picked a darker color Perfect brow model. Other than those complaints the product is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Brush was missing slow shipping</li>
            <li> I like the colors and quality of the brown powders and brush.  I also was excited to get the brow stencil - but very dissappointed with the stencil as it is too big and I am unable to use it . so that is why I gave this 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The set was great came with everything I could need to make my eyebrows look amazing and it was very easy to use everything .</li>
            <li> I am always in search for the perfect eyebrow kit! While I like that this kit comes with 3 colors, I wish it had a gel color. Also, I would have liked a better tool kit, so I had to buy a better brush.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are completely useless and cheap. The eyebrow stencil really helped me shape my eyebrows and make them look good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products to make my blond eyebrows visible and pretty shape.  The stencils don&#x27;t work very well since you can&#x27;t tell the distance between eye&#x27;s and nose, but I learned to measure the shape of my eyebrow with out it and just use the brush and walla it&#x27;s all done.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Warning only use this stuff if you have paitience only f you have paitience i draw my eyebrows i dont shade them in i hate his stuff cuz i dont have any paitience</li>
            <li> So I got this in hopes that I would be able to start learning to fill in my eyebrows.  Well, the stencil I wanted to use, had these air bubbles in it and it was very thin, thinner than the other two, and it made it a little difficult to hold down because it didn&#x27;t want to lay down flat.  The flat angled brush would of been fine, except the &amp;#34;hairs&amp;#34; would come out of it every time I used it, and eventually I&#x27;m not going to have a brush because of that.  The darkest brown has a red undertone to it, and made me look ridiculous.  The brown above it worked alright, but it was too light for me.  The tweezers are very cheap and don&#x27;t want to hardly grab a hair, so you&#x27;re better off using your own.  I say look for something else because this is not worth no $7</li>
            <li> What a good product.  recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It does a great job at making my brows look fuller and more defined. However, it works best when you eyebrows are done. Not to mention the price was so worth it!</li>
            <li> It is much better than I expected. The combination of color is good for Asian.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is they should add a mirror to this!</li>
            <li> The eyebrow powder is excellent, however the stencils are too small</li>
            <li> I love the different powders and the two brushes.  I don&#x27;t bother with the tweezers because I have my own.  The stencils however are just the worst due to the fact that they&#x27;re all the same stencil.  My eye brows are shaped differently and I wouldn&#x27;t dare tweeze them to fit into this stencil.  I purchased a different stencil set that had more to offer and I use it instead of the Cameo stencils.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my eyebrows whats so ever. The tracers are all the same and the powder is just eye shadow. I recommend not to buy this at all. Waste of money</li>
            <li> Not really lasting but it was pretty good, the tongs is not goos at all... the shapes didnt fit me</li>
            <li> I like this product because of the stencil.  I do not know how to shape my eyebrows and the stencils makes it easier for me to have perfectly shaped eyebrows.  The colors are nice too.  I am Asian and have black hair.  I like the shade and choose the lightest one because it looks more natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it but i will just use it for my hair roots and for eyeshadow for smoky eyes</li>
            <li> Great by It arrive very quickly I love it I&#x27;m definitely going to make mire purchases from herei live live live live love live live live live</li>
            <li> The make up is ok expected the kit to work but i have to use a eye pencil with the stencil. Love the eye brush</li>
            <li> I was generally pleased with this product.  The brow guides were particularly helpful.</li>
            <li> I am pretty happy with this eyebrow kit, but there are a few downfalls I’ll bring up in a minute. I went in search of a good eyebrow filler in stores and on Amazon. I have decent eyebrows, but I like to just add a little bit of color to help fill in where I had a failed eyebrow piercing and just to give them a little more definition. I had previously used an eyebrow filler that I loved, but it was discontinued. Since then I’ve been at a loss. I HATE using pencils, it’s so hard to get them to look good. Maybe I’m just bad at it, but they always look too fake. I was very pleased to find this on Amazon! I’ll briefly mention what I like and don’t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Colors: I received a different color palette than what showed in the picture. The top one is a dark brown for me, this is the only one I use since I have dark brown hair. The next is reddish brown and the third is a light brown. The dark brown is a pretty good match for me! The second two have a little too much red in them for me.&lt;br /&gt;Application brush: At first I thought the brush to apply it was too soft, but after a few applications I decided it was perfect. It picks up just the right amount of color and it’s thin enough to get the details nicely. It gives my eyebrows a wonderful, natural look. It builds up nicely with a few coats.&lt;br /&gt;Stencils: I was hoping this would be useful. I’m pretty happy with my eyebrow shape, but thought it would be great if there was a stencil that helped me shape my eyebrows a little better. I got three of the exact same stencil. I was sort of disappointed. And the stencil is for a very dramatically shaped eyebrow that is long with a very aggressive arch. It’s not something I used at all.&lt;br /&gt;Tweezers: These are horrible tweezers. I have to try to pull a hair about 5 times before it actually gets it. I was hoping for a decent set of tweezers, so when I go on vacation I could leave my nice ones at home.  Trying to actually use these to pluck more than a couple hairs would drive me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Grooming brush: I know this sounds weird, but I’ve never had one of these brushes. After getting this kit I realize how I’ve been missing out. I don’t really think it matters if you have a cheap brush or expensive one, I don’t see how they could function differently. But this handy little tool has become one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual case itself is very annoying. The brushes are tucked into their own little holes. I can’t reach my finger in to grab them because the space is too small. So I have to turn it over and shake the brush out. When I do that everything falls out. I ended up throwing the stencils away because of that.  Really, all I use is the one color, grooming brush and application brush. I wish the kit were smaller, it takes up quite a bit of space in my makeup organizer. I’m also a little annoyed that I didn’t get the colors in the picture. I would’ve used 2 of those colors, but I can only use the one in my kit. Even the picture on the front of mine is different. Lastly, this is very petty I know.a couple hairs would drive me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;Grooming brush: I know this sounds weird, but I’ve never had one of these brushes.

            <li> Wonderful set for the</li>
            <li> Really helped me to shape eyebrows-colors are fine and they stay on. I recommend to anyone that has a problem shaping brows.</li>
            <li> I like this and didn&#x27;t cost very much.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for some time and am very pleased with it.  They give you some helpful tips and some stencils.  Lines are very easy to go on and look natural.</li>
            <li> Love this idea but the powders were all cracked when arrived</li>
            <li> The brow powder is good because it gives you thicker looking brows without looking too harsh. I only gave three stars because the stencils are difficult to use. All in all not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Love this product so much. I use it every morning when I&#x27;m getting ready for work 😊☺</li>
            <li> The Perfect Brow Cameo has three stencils and they are all the same. I was expecting three different ones. The twisters are pretty good and the eyebrow makeup is ok.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am not one of those people who are blessed with eyebrows. I&#x27;ve never really had very many - some people think I have over plucked ... but I didn&#x27;t. I haven&#x27;t plucked a stray eyebrow since I was a teenager and I&#x27;m over 50 now. Pencils made my eyebrows look double fake. I always hated penciled eyebrows but needed them to put features on my bland complexion. I wanted to try something new and LOVE the powdered eyebrows and the stencils. It really makes them look real. I&#x27;ll be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant when I was first considering buying this product because of some of the reviews and the fact that i have never been much of an eyebrow girl. However i figured i should give it a chance and boy am i glad. I am dirty blonde and my eyebrows are medium brown and the color shadows available are great! I use the top shadow to fill in my eyebrows and blend with the eyebrow brush and my eyebrows look fuller, more shapely and even better, NATURAL. i hate the overr dramatic eyebrow look because on an everyday basis i do not like over done eyemakeup however, this kit is great. down side: the stencils that are suppose to shape your eyebrows are too long...it didnt bother me because i get my eyebrows waxed in the salon so im familiar with the shape i want my eyebrows to be, but for girls or guys looking for the stencils to determine the shape they will be a little disappointed. but the pros out do the cons so i suggest GET THIS PRODUCT. i willl buy this again</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I like this color as yet. I have tried wearing so many different ways and 4 out of 7 times I dont like it. I will update soon</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the colors and there was no &amp;#34;brow tamer&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Stencils are all the same shape just range from thin to thick. Tweezers are not useless but definitely cheap. Brushes and color palette are nice, although I will only use one color. I&#x27;ve been using this everday and even though I like it... I won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> The colors didn&#x27;t really match my eyebrow I had to mix another product into it so that the dark brown on this palette turned into black. Which I thought would do so once applied to my dark brown eyebrows but No. You can see it from far away that its brown &amp; not black. But other than that its okay... Not sure if ill buy again since I dont use the other colors. Prob. just buy a black powder one next time.</li>
            <li> Product is nice but I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year. I prefer and mostly use just eyebrow pencils now.</li>
            <li> I love how there are three colors so if I dye my hair darker I can use all three colors but if my hair is lighter I just use the lighter color. It has worked very well for me and lasts all day. Its also nice that it comes with tweasers so if you are in a snitch you can easily take care of it.</li>
            <li> A disappointment. The brushes were the only items found useful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for dark color eyebrows, if you are not blond just dont buy it. looks like its dark, bu its not</li>
            <li> I like the tools it comes with, but the eyebrow colors are reddish which is a negative. Alright for the price.</li>
            <li> Buying this product was a waste of money. The shadow comes on really light and looks really cheap. The stencils doesn&#x27;t match my eyebrows. Also the tweezer looks really cheap and doesn&#x27;t even pluck out hair.</li>
            <li> was not exactly what I expected, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging and it arrived on time. (Actually sooner). However, when I opened it I noticed that the mascara wand was broken and the tweezers suck. The colors are ok but to actually pick up product you need a better brush so I had to use another one I had. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> it is a good product, but the colors are hard to show up on dark skin or hair you need something darker brown or black.</li>
            <li> This brow kit comes with different brown brow colors and some shapes to fill in.  The colors are hard to mix to be consistent, and the brow shapes to fill in are not too realistic--the shapes are too long and full.  An eyebtow pencil is more proficient, and the color is always consistent.</li>
            <li> Love it.. Perfect eyebrow kit... Nice natural colors</li>
            <li> This is my first time having an eyebrow makeup kit, and I must say it is very easy to use. The directions are easy to understand.</li>
            <li> Loved it. I learned how to do my eyebrows with this product. I had been wanting to do my eyebrows for ever and did not know how to.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this in hopes of getting both a good brow powder and stencils to help shape my brows, I am terrible of it, anyways i am dissapointed with everything in the package, the stencils are waaaay to big and super thin, ( think early 90&#x27;s ) the powder not that great and the tweezers are pretty much garbage. Guess it&#x27;s back to square one</li>
            <li> Looooovvveeeeddd it !</li>
            <li> The eyebrow stencils are horrible and the colors are not the best however the powder definatly has staying power. Better for those with brown to light colored hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what to do with the  but the color powders are great! The brush works well to blend the colors. Great deal for the price and convenient sized</li>
            <li> I love the perfect brow , it really helps get the shape you want and over all i give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it - it is nice, I haven&#x27;t used stencils yet, but it is easy to get the shade you need by mixing those they provide. It would be better if t had a mirror as well. But you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Stencils make for super easy application and the makeup looks very natural!</li>
            <li> I received my producet very fast and it was just what I needed. The tools were helpful and much more than I expected. 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I used to use a pencil to fill in my eyebrows which sometimes wouldn&#x27;t turn out so well! I love this because its not too dark there are 3 different shades and if you do it right it doesn&#x27;t look like your eye brows are drawn on which is nice definitely gives them the &#x27;natural&#x27; look. Happy!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like this product.  I didn&#x27;t find that the template worked at all  and the powder wasn&#x27;t effective at giving a natural look.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaping and arching my eyebrows but have done my research. I did not find the stencils useful - they were way too big. I thought they would be 3 different sizes but they are all the same size so it was useless.. the colors aren&#x27;t that dark, I am light skinned and the colors do not show up on my skin at all. Maybe I have to use more. I liked the tweezers though, they did what they were supposed to do</li>
