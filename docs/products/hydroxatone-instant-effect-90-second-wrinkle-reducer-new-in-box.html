            <li>Works good if you can get anything out of the container.</li>
            <li>It would be great if they could fix these flaws, but until then, I am not spending more $ on something that breaks and becomes nonaccessible after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>Great instant effect that lasts a good 4 to 6 hours, perfect for a night out.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have a problem with volume, and the package came sealed nicely.  </li>
            <li>I want ALL the ladies to know that this product really DOES work and work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this until I find a better product.</li>

            <li>I recommend it to all woman who would like a wrinkle free day!</li>
            <li>go over it one more time with another application.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I loved it.</li>
            <li>I blend it in with my foundation to get an overall smooth flawless look.</li>
            <li>not sure why the Magic happens when I use them together, but the combination is the BEST thing I have found for my Eye Bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is nice to have this cream when wrinkles start appearing as you get older in years.</li>
            <li>I received a full size sample in my Klutchclub or Birchbox subscription and loved it so well that I bought the next tube.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t want to waste ANY, it is sooooooo good!</li>
            <li>very  very fast thank you .</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product except for the packaging, it is hard to get all the product out of the tube.</li>
            <li>I love the effects of this product but wish they could eliminate the white chalkiness that sometimes accompany it...........</li>
            <li>Leaves a film on your face.make up looks funny over it.</li>
            <li>It really works but won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li>She relies on this product and uses it all the time with the results she wants.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement using this item.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it really worked.  </li>
            <li>so I use it very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>I was really dissapoiinted.</li>
            <li>I use it with \\&quot;Sudden Change\\&quot; 3 minute Firming Serum (also available at Amazon).  </li>
            <li>and FYI, it doesn&#x27;t work very well by itself either,</li>
            <li>And yes, if you&#x27;re not careful, it can leave a white residue, but I put an additional brightener on top</li>
            <li>When I use it WITH Sudden Change, it becomes more Matte (after drying) and my Mineral Makeup (I use under my eyes, like concealer) sticks to it and totally conceals everything and looks natural (I use the mineral makeup with a brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, maybe I had a little moisturizer on my finger, or too much of one and not enough of the other, but after applying it twice (on those rare occasions), I&#x27;m Good</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCT HAS YET TO LIVE UP TO THE ADVERTISING.  </li>
            <li>live with bags under our eyes once again.</li>
            <li>It was okay, certainly not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I initially purchased it a while ago for $25, now it&#x27;s $45.50????&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, for $25 several of my friends were interested, but not at the higher price.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>It does leave the white powdery residue if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>90 second Wrinkle Reducer NEW IN BOX!]]  </li>
            <li>I thought it would at least somewhat reduce the fine lines</li>
            <li>I am a 58 yr old female and have smoked for years.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf to long</li>
            <li> It has to be applied very carefully or it leaves white powdery marks on your face.  </li>
            <li> After it dries, the Instant Effect seems a little \\&quot;Shiny\\&quot; and my Mineral Makeup doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;Stick\\&quot; to it.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s been returned but the container is empty.</li>
            <li> The only problem was the pump stopped working after just a few uses...</li>
            <li> I just have to be careful when I tap it out on part of my hand...</li>
            <li> THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I used the sealed product once, then the container was completely empty.</li>
            <li> BUT, it does work if you&#x27;re careful.  </li>
            <li> The only problem that I KEEP having is the pump is ALWAYS breaking, not allowing the product to come through the little hole when pumping it, and, it ALL comes out on the sides losing all of the product!  </li>
            <li> reason I gave it a 4 Star Rating is because I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with it by itself, but with Sudden Change, I give it 5 STARS!!  </li>
            <li> , sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other times, but don&#x27;t get discouraged.....</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t typically see this residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> I have used this product in the past and like it with some reservations.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s happened to me at least twice before with that brand.</li>
            <li> Not very happy, maybe will purchase again,</li>
            <li> This product is VERY expensive for this little tube, however; NOT fair to lose all the product with one pump by it coming out of the sides!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this product works.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf to long or it&#x27;s been returned but the container is empty. It&#x27;s happened to me at least twice before with that brand. It really works but won&#x27;t make that mistake again. Works good if you can get anything out of the container.</li>
            <li> I received a full size sample in my Klutchclub or Birchbox subscription and loved it so well that I bought the next tube.  This products works well for me.  It tightens my skin in 90s as advertised.  And yes, if you&#x27;re not careful, it can leave a white residue, but I put an additional brightener on top so I don&#x27;t typically see this residue.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have a problem with volume, and the package came sealed nicely.  I will continue to buy this until I find a better product.</li>
            <li> This cream does work.  It is nice to have this cream when wrinkles start appearing as you get older in years.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It is great to put in your makeup bag...The only problem was the pump stopped working after just a few uses...I just have to be careful when I tap it out on part of my hand...don&#x27;t want to waste ANY, it is sooooooo good!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I loved it. By the third use, the pump broke and as a result, the product started oozing out of the packaging. I had problems with the product \\&quot;loosening\\&quot; in the treated area after applying makeup to cover the white film under my eye (left after application of procuct). It would be great if they could fix these flaws, but until then, I am not spending more $ on something that breaks and becomes nonaccessible after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> hi i will say that was very  very fast thank you . and this item  is very good. it work i love it.buy it you will love it</li>
            <li> I bought this for someone who had received a sample and I told her amazon had the best price. She relies on this product and uses it all the time with the results she wants.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of an improvement using this item. Did not diminish crow&#x27;s feet. Not very happy, maybe will purchase again,</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004O3T0AU Hydroxatone Instant Effect 90 second Wrinkle Reducer NEW IN BOX!]]  I would not buy this product again.  It has to be applied very carefully or it leaves white powdery marks on your face.  I didn&#x27;t think it really worked.  For the price, it&#x27;s definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT HAS YET TO LIVE UP TO THE ADVERTISING.  THERE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE IN MY SKIN. I SHALL GIVE IT MORE TIME AS I HAVE HAD IT ONLY 2 WEEKS.</li>
            <li> Great instant effect that lasts a good 4 to 6 hours, perfect for a night out. I blend it in with my foundation to get an overall smooth flawless look. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is I&#x27;m still looking for that longer lasting product. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used the sealed product once, then the container was completely empty. I plan to seek a refund. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Good stuff!  It&#x27;s a little pricey so I use it very sparingly.  I will order it again when I find it on sale.</li>
            <li> I love the effects of this product but wish they could eliminate the white chalkiness that sometimes accompany it...........it&#x27;s like it needs to be stirred before using..........they need to address this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s embarrassing when you arrive somewhere, go to the ladies&#x27; room and find white, crusty circles.</li>
            <li> The only problem that I KEEP having is the pump is ALWAYS breaking, not allowing the product to come through the little hole when pumping it, and, it ALL comes out on the sides losing all of the product!  This product is VERY expensive for this little tube, however; NOT fair to lose all the product with one pump by it coming out of the sides!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOSE a lot of money with having to buy this quicker than I should have to!</li>
            <li> It was okay, certainly not my favorite.  Probably would not order this product again.. However, I do like to try different products for an aging skin.</li>
            <li> I want ALL the ladies to know that this product really DOES work and work wonderfully. I am a 58 yr old female and have smoked for years. I got a trial thingie in the mail and put it on my lip wrinkles and.....they got pulled out. You can actually feel the tightening in the 90 seconds after you apply. A MUST have for all ladies</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!!! Great dealer to deal with.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This product did nothing to reduce the wrinkles. I thought it would at least somewhat reduce the fine lines but it&#x27;s just another product that we all fall for and then doesn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
            <li> The product does not work for me at all.  I was really dissapoiinted. Leaves a film on your face.make up looks funny over it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this product works. Tightens the skin around the eyes.  This is my second bottle and I recommend it to everyone!.</li>
            <li> I recieved the product with no problems. I am happy with the product except for the packaging, it is hard to get all the product out of the tube.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!  You wouldn&#x27;t even know you had a wrinkle on your face!  I recommend it to all woman who would like a wrinkle free day!</li>
            <li> I use it with \\&quot;Sudden Change\\&quot; 3 minute Firming Serum (also available at Amazon).  After it dries, the Instant Effect seems a little \\&quot;Shiny\\&quot; and my Mineral Makeup doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;Stick\\&quot; to it.  When I use it WITH Sudden Change, it becomes more Matte (after drying) and my Mineral Makeup (I use under my eyes, like concealer) sticks to it and totally conceals everything and looks natural (I use the mineral makeup with a brush).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it a 4 Star Rating is because I&#x27;m not totally satisfied with it by itself, but with Sudden Change, I give it 5 STARS!!  I do not work for the company that makes Sudden Change......and FYI, it doesn&#x27;t work very well by itself either, not sure why the Magic happens when I use them together, but the combination is the BEST thing I have found for my Eye Bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t work as well as other times, but don&#x27;t get discouraged.....go over it one more time with another application.  Not sure why it doesn&#x27;t work sometimes, maybe I had a little moisturizer on my finger, or too much of one and not enough of the other, but after applying it twice (on those rare occasions), I&#x27;m Good To Go AND SO GRATEFUL to have it......will NOT leave the House Without applying it, EVER!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, Amazon is SO Awesome because they have the Best Prices and Delivery always seems fast......FYI, I don&#x27;t work for Amazon either, just a Happy Bagless Lady!</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and like it with some reservations.  It does leave the white powdery residue if you use too much.  You can&#x27;t touch it after it is applied.  You cannot put makeup over it or you rub it off. BUT, it does work if you&#x27;re careful.  I initially purchased it a while ago for $25, now it&#x27;s $45.50????&lt;br /&gt;Sorry, for $25 several of my friends were interested, but not at the higher price.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll live with bags under our eyes once again.</li>
