            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>The padding is nice, but it&#x27;s not as neck-supportive as an inflatable one I used to have.</li>
            <li>I give up and just end up sitting up in the bath, and that is just not as nice and relaxing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The suction cups are very strong, and held the pillow in place throughout my bath.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly fit the bill and for the price was a good value.</li>
            <li>Taking a nice relaxing bath is one of my favorite things to do.</li>

            <li>received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review.</li>
            <li>What I have been on the lookout was a perfect bathtub pillow until recently</li>
            <li>It felt nice and comfortable.</li>
            <li>makes bath time more relaxing.</li>
            <li>This pillow made relaxing in the bath tub so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>pillow is easy to install.</li>
            <li>Also, the vinyl allows the pillow to be easily cleaned.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pillow was easy to attach to my bath tub.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile and useful, it is great to add to your bathroom or spa.</li>
            <li>It had a strong plastic smell when I took it out the packaging but the smell eventually faded.</li>
            <li>Good price and helps me relax in my new tub.  </li>
            <li>A really lovely pillow, used a bath pillow for the very first time</li>
            <li>Filled with water.</li>
            <li>When I get a bath to relax, I like to feel comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You see... sitting in the tub isn&#x27;t all that comfortable for me.</li>
            <li>comfortable</li>
            <li>So comfy and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>Also the material it is made out of is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it is super easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>The plastic smell is still pretty overwhelming.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it.</li>
            <li>There are special instructions to follow to remove the pillow (not included in the packaging but listed on the ordering page).</li>
            <li>Love it very comfty, just what I needed</li>
            <li>A mild soap and wet cloth should be all you need to keep this pillow looking great.</li>
            <li>As a mother of 6 children on top of watching many others over the years and taking care of the house, the one thing I look forward to when the children are down for the night is a nice hot bath while reading a book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This pillow would make a great gift as well, for Mother’s Day or any other</li>
            <li>So far easy to clean and attaches easily.</li>
            <li>This is truly my new favorite bathroom accessory.</li>
            <li>love my Balance Bath Pillow, and I would recommend this pillow to anyone who has a tub or jacuzzi and would like to be able to lay down comfortably in it.  </li>
            <li>It was comfy and I loved that it was large enough to include the shoulder area.  </li>
            <li>Well, I couldn&#x27;t help but message him and tell him how comfortable it was and how I really didn&#x27;t want to get out.</li>
            <li>Balance bath pillow has a really nice shade of white, and looks and feels gerat in my bath.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but supportive.</li>
            <li>With my head and neck resting on the pillow, I was finally able to lay back and enjoy a nice, long, and relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter and I to use so we can enjoy the new soaker tub we have.  </li>
            <li>The nice thick padding makes this one much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still have to take my ponytail out or pile it further on top of my head, but it is well worth</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make bath time more relaxing.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we were looking for.</li>
            <li>The 2 section design allows the pillow to be used anywhere in virtually any size and shape bath tub, hot tub, or jacuzzi.</li>
            <li>The pillow is covered in a durable vinyl fabric, which is soft and comfortable.</li>
            <li>item can also be used in a Jacuzzi or hot tub.</li>
            <li>Tore on the first day of the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is also very well padded, making it soft and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Though I followed the directions, one of the cups did rip out and created a large hole in the bottom of the product.</li>
            <li>The Balance Bath Pillow is large enough to support both my head and my shoulders which makes staying in the bath for a long time much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Most bath pillows are filled with air and are not as durable or long lasting as this one.</li>
            <li>that a pillow like this can make such a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves this bath pillow.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much I like it.</li>
            <li>Warm baths, with some bath salt and essential oil, are just thing for unwinding after a long day.  </li>
            <li>The older tubs never had comfort in mind when they were made.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their time in a bath.</li>
            <li>It is a 2-section pillow that is soft and very well made.</li>
            <li>No problems with water getting through, the pillow is fully water proof and so far has proved to be very durable.</li>
            <li>Tried out a new tub in a shop.  </li>
            <li>Installed for my wife in new walk-in tub.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s most likely because it&#x27;s helping alleviate the pain in my back overall.</li>
            <li>It has 7 very strong suction cups on the back to hold it firmly in place.</li>
            <li>Just wet the suction cups, stick them to the tub, lay back and enjoy.</li>
            <li>Our tub is almost 30 years old.</li>
            <li>and it tore across the whole back portion.</li>
            <li>I love soaking and relaxing in a nice long bath, but I find it very uncomfortable to lay down completely in the tub.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sitting in a funny position anymore as the pillow is also helping me from sliding down into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Well designed and versatile, so far I tried it on 2 different tubs and the pillow stayed firmly in place on both of them.</li>
            <li> the back there are not one but seven suction cups which means you are not going to have to worry about it slipping out from under neath of you.</li>
            <li> I would be very careful in removal to keep the same from happening to you.</li>
            <li> The pillow stayed put without slipping.</li>
            <li> just wish it came in other colors</li>
            <li> bath pillow is much larger then those I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> IF you&#x27;re VERY careful removing it from the tub.  </li>
            <li> It is made of a high-quality foam, which provides support for your head and head while laying down in your bathtub.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last a week.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment was that the suction cup ripped out of the back on the bottom.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> Seven suction cups attach the pillow firmly to your tub.  </li>
            <li> When I am relaxing in the tub, I usually either have my tablet with me or my smartphone.</li>
            <li> I taped it but it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I did like the pillow until it ripped around one of the suction cups when I attempted to remove it from the tiles behind the bathtub.</li>
            <li> Useless</li>
            <li> Disappointing, very thin foam.</li>
            <li> Resting my head is impossible, and trying to lay with my head up strains my neck.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible item.</li>

            <li> Suction cup ripped out after one usage. Filled with water. Useless</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase especially for such a price. Just wet the suction cups, stick them to the tub, lay back and enjoy. Love this pillow!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I was looking for an inexpensive yet durable product for my tub. I have to say I am impressed with how comfortable it was! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to make bath time more relaxing. I know I will look forward to using this again soon!</li>
            <li> The padding is nice, but it&#x27;s not as neck-supportive as an inflatable one I used to have. The plastic smell is still pretty overwhelming.</li>
            <li> When I get a bath to relax, I like to feel comfortable. Not all baths out there in the world are this way. It was recommended by my best friend that I invest in something called a bath pillow. Although I never did, I was finally chosen to review one and I am very happy I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see... sitting in the tub isn&#x27;t all that comfortable for me. Our tub is almost 30 years old. The older tubs never had comfort in mind when they were made. They were just created to get the job done of getting a bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pillow is easy to install. Suction cups hold it in place. Plus, you never have to worry about them coming off because of the pressure you will apply to it while sitting against it. When I am relaxing in the tub, I usually either have my tablet with me or my smartphone. That way if my husband needs me he can get into contact with me. I like to keep the door locked, so I have some peace and quiet and &amp;#34;me time&amp;#34;. Well, I couldn&#x27;t help but message him and tell him how comfortable it was and how I really didn&#x27;t want to get out. I almost felt as if I could fall asleep while sitting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing that a pillow like this can make such a huge difference. For me, it&#x27;s most likely because it&#x27;s helping alleviate the pain in my back overall. I&#x27;m not sitting in a funny position anymore as the pillow is also helping me from sliding down into the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with this pillow. When I first received it, I wasn&#x27;t so sure about it. After applying and trying, I plan to use it until I no longer can. BEST BATH PILLOW EVER!</li>
            <li> Tried out a new tub in a shop.  Got into it.  Very comfortable.  Forgot to consider the wall that would be up at the end.  The pillow was an inexpensive solution.  Good price and helps me relax in my new tub.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I used this once and it tore across the whole back portion. Then I found a rip on the side. This was a horrible item.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well at all with the suction cups.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> ripped after about the 3rd use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great IF you&#x27;re VERY careful removing it from the tub.  Always grab the plastic suction cup(s) when pulling.  NEVER the fabric.  If you do that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Looked used when I got it ... Otherwise just like the picture shows.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we were looking for. Stays in place and very comfortable</li>
            <li> Good  happy with purchase good for people with older tubs  comfortable just wish it came in other colors</li>
            <li> Love this pillow! So comfy and easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  I look forward to a good soak.  So far easy to clean and attaches easily.</li>
            <li> Warm baths, with some bath salt and essential oil, are just thing for unwinding after a long day.  I love soaking and relaxing in a nice long bath, but I find it very uncomfortable to lay down completely in the tub. Resting my head is impossible, and trying to lay with my head up strains my neck. I give up and just end up sitting up in the bath, and that is just not as nice and relaxing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was eager to try the Balance Bath Pillow. It is made of a high-quality foam, which provides support for your head and head while laying down in your bathtub.  Seven suction cups attach the pillow firmly to your tub.  The 2 section design allows the pillow to be used anywhere in virtually any size and shape bath tub, hot tub, or jacuzzi. The pillow is covered in a durable vinyl fabric, which is soft and comfortable. Also, the vinyl allows the pillow to be easily cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pillow was easy to attach to my bath tub.  The suction cups are very strong, and held the pillow in place throughout my bath.  With my head and neck resting on the pillow, I was finally able to lay back and enjoy a nice, long, and relaxing bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Balance Bath Pillow, and I would recommend this pillow to anyone who has a tub or jacuzzi and would like to be able to lay down comfortably in it.  This pillow would make a great gift as well, for Mother’s Day or any other holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for sharing my honest opinion of the product. Opinion is entirely my own.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter and I to use so we can enjoy the new soaker tub we have.  The pillow stayed put without slipping. I would prefer a bit more foam to make it thicker but it certainly fit the bill and for the price was a good value.</li>
            <li> I really loved the pillow. It was comfy and I loved that it was large enough to include the shoulder area.  My only disappointment was that the suction cup ripped out of the back on the bottom. There are special instructions to follow to remove the pillow (not included in the packaging but listed on the ordering page). Though I followed the directions, one of the cups did rip out and created a large hole in the bottom of the product. I taped it but it was a little disappointing. I would be very careful in removal to keep the same from happening to you.</li>
            <li> Taking a nice relaxing bath is one of my favorite things to do. This bath pillow is a great addition to any bathtub. It is a 2-section pillow that is soft and very well made. It has 7 very strong suction cups on the back to hold it firmly in place. No worries about it coming detached from the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cover of this bath pillow is made of vinyl, so it is super easy to keep clean. A mild soap and wet cloth should be all you need to keep this pillow looking great. It is also very well padded, making it soft and comfortable to use. Most bath pillows are filled with air and are not as durable or long lasting as this one. The nice thick padding makes this one much more comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item can also be used in a Jacuzzi or hot tub. Very versatile and useful, it is great to add to your bathroom or spa. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys relaxing in a bath!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest, unbiased product review. All opinions expressed are truly my own.</li>
            <li> Installed for my wife in new walk-in tub. Loves it.</li>
            <li> I did like the pillow until it ripped around one of the suction cups when I attempted to remove it from the tiles behind the bathtub. I was pretty disappointed that it didn&#x27;t last a week.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:129e54a89663834d06c778c258d2825f]]This pillow is really great for head and neck support, which results in a more comfortable and enjoyable bath. Highly recommend it for anyone looking to enhance their time in a bath.</li>
            <li> Love it very comfty, just what I needed</li>
            <li> Tore on the first day of the purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product for an even better price. Well designed and versatile, so far I tried it on 2 different tubs and the pillow stayed firmly in place on both of them. No problems with water getting through, the pillow is fully water proof and so far has proved to be very durable. Hope it stays that way!</li>
            <li> As a mother of 6 children on top of watching many others over the years and taking care of the house, the one thing I look forward to when the children are down for the night is a nice hot bath while reading a book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I like to relax and take bit of time for myself. Over the years I have mixed it up with writing. What I have been on the lookout was a perfect bathtub pillow until recently I hadn&#x27;t found. Well that all changed when the Balance Bath Pillow came in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bath pillow is much larger then those I have had in the past. I don&#x27;t have to blow them up before using them, so there is no need to worry about it popping either. The Balance Bath Pillow is large enough to support both my head and my shoulders which makes staying in the bath for a long time much more comfortable. I still have to take my ponytail out or pile it further on top of my head, but it is well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the back there are not one but seven suction cups which means you are not going to have to worry about it slipping out from under neath of you. This is truly my new favorite bathroom accessory.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves this bath pillow. The pillow is just as described, great quality, packed densely with foam. I’m also impressed how well the suctions cups stick to the tub. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> A really lovely pillow, used a bath pillow for the very first time and I have to say if I can help it, I&#x27;m not taking another bath without this thing! Balance bath pillow has a really nice shade of white, and looks and feels gerat in my bath. I just wish it came with some wine and candles.</li>
            <li> Disappointing, very thin foam.</li>
            <li> I received this bath pillow to try out. I really like it. It felt nice and comfortable. It stayed in place with no problem. Also the material it is made out of is easy to clean. This pillow made relaxing in the bath tub so much more comfortable. It had a strong plastic smell when I took it out the packaging but the smell eventually faded. This bath pillow is great!</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s soft but supportive. I would have given it 5 stars except that it had a blowout  after 5 months. The foam inside now gets waterlogged. I&#x27;m concerned that it will harbor bacteria. Despite the fact that it only lasted a short time, I am ordering another one. That&#x27;s how much I like it. If this one doesn&#x27;t last I will post an update.</li>
            <li> Nice and relaxing makes bath time more relaxing. Just what I was hoping for</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Works great</li>
