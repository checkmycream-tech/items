    <ol>
            <li> I love this curling iron it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> i thorough it would work better</li>
            <li> Bought this with a groupon for $20 less. I love. Put some pretreatment oil that I would use before straightening and started with otherwise dry, clean hair with some product. Started at the bottom and combed out sections to curl. I first had it on med curl high setting but then changed to the tighter curl as I worked up my head. The curls were beautiful. The iron would tell me if there was too much hair and I got it caught 2 times and the iron easily and painlessly released. My hair will not hold curl, typically gone an hour later. I used this appliance with store brand moose and heat protection oil, no hair spray. My hair still has a beautiful wave in it. My hair is long between bra strap and hip. With long layers.</li>
            <li> NOT GOOD IF YOUR HAIR IS REALLY LONG.</li>
            <li> It works well if your hair is long enough. No place on the ad or the box does it discuss hair length. If you have layered hair It won&#x27;t work on shorter layers but very good on long hair.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with service, merchandise and the cost of my curlmatic machine. I recommend Amazon to anybody.</li>
            <li> this is cool, but let me warn you:&lt;br /&gt;1.  you cannot put 1 or 1.5 inches of hair in at a time.  maybe 1/2 inch.  it takes me an hour, but the result is awesome&lt;br /&gt;2.  you can get your hair stuck in the motor - i did and my husband had to come to the rescue.  what would i do at the gym if this happened there?</li>
            <li> Awesome. Easy for very long hair! Natural looking curls and waves.</li>
            <li> This works perfectly!  My new favorite  tool. I can have my hair done in less than 10 minutes and it looks fabulous! I got my hair tangled  in the back a couple of times but I just pulled it out slowly and there was no problem. The machine beeps if your hair gets tangled so you just open it and get your hair out. No big deal, just make sure you don&#x27;t put too much hair in. I absolutely  recommend this item!</li>
            <li> works awesome!!!!  have recommended it several times since receiving it</li>
            <li> Item broke on 2 time of usage</li>
            <li> Not the sellers fault but this product does not do what it claims.  I followed the directions before even plugging it in and it does not do the job.&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware of this product.  I do want to claim that the seller was prompt in delivery and I would buy from them again.  Let&#x27;s see how easy it is to return it! lol  Sad it doesn&#x27;t do what it claims to.</li>
            <li> It works very well and lodks exactly like Infinity Pro by Conair. I wonder what is the difference between both, as everyone prefers the Infinity Pro instead. Also, I would like to know if the Curlmatic is the new version of Infinity Pro.</li>
            <li> Really works! I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> very hard to use, does not hold a curl. i want to return it if i can</li>
            <li> Worked good two times. Looked cute once I figured out how to use it (you have to use less hair than you think!). The third time I went to use it, wouldn&#x27;t work! The turning mechanism wouldn&#x27;t engage! Very annoying!</li>
