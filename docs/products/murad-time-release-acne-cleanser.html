            <li>After about a month of use I started to receive complements from perfect strangers telling me how beautiful my skin is.</li>
            <li>the end I switched over to supermarket-grade Cetaphil, which I&#x27;ve been using for about 4 months now, and have experienced excellent results.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find it for cheaper!</li>
            <li>This face wash is amazing.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s an amazing combo.  </li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up amazingly well</li>
            <li>and then I wash it off with a washcloth and warm water.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 &amp; have started focusing on anti-aging regimens, so this product fits in nicely</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t notice any astounding beautifying changes in my complexion because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this product.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and a great price.  </li>
            <li>seems to be most effective when you use it in rotation with something stronger.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best face cleaners I have used because it addresses both preventing acne and also aging.</li>
            <li>Bar far the best acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used in 20 years.</li>
            <li>The best face wash I&#x27;ve ever tried for my adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I use it with my clairsonic and it leaves my skin feeling clean and bright.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser...does a great job cleaning my face and is minty fresh too...</li>
            <li>cleanser smells good, not chemically, and it leaves your skin tingly clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel great at first</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and comes off real easy.</li>
            <li>at first I thought GREAT more zits..</li>
            <li>tax is more than I would like to pay</li>
            <li>Acne is goneafter years and skin looks so much better since using this.</li>
            <li>Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for a face wash for so many years.</li>
            <li>well I tried most of it all.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure that with extended use, I&#x27;ll see better results.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;d recommend it to others, I wouldn&#x27;t view it as a magical &#x27;cure-all.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin has a healthy shine to it</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash</li>
            <li>Going thru some phases in life, works well will order more soon!&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t love this product.  </li>
            <li>Also, entering my 20&#x27;s I began to worry about using the appropriate anti aging products.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend using it more than once a day though.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and feel of this product.</li>
            <li>I am \\&quot;older\\&quot; and my God zits most of my life..</li>
            <li>I paid alot more for this stuff at the store..</li>
            <li>but since he has been using it, not any more.</li>
            <li>I use a seperate, more lathering wash for makeup removal before using this product.</li>
            <li>Better than in sephora.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most over the counter products and some prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li>This one is okay.</li>
            <li>I love Murad products and have used this skin wash for a year now.</li>
            <li>I really love this Murad time release cleanser.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely my favorite cleanser yet.</li>
            <li>A friend recommended it and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for minor acne.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li>I am in love and my skin is happy and clear</li>
            <li>i liked this product until I got pregnant.</li>
            <li>my face is becoming immune to the product.</li>
            <li>Murad cleanser does a great job of keeping her skin clear.</li>
            <li>and my skin is happy and clear</li>
            <li>very gentle on skin, gets it good and clean and helps prevent break outs</li>
            <li>I bought this after having used the original murad face wash which I love.</li>
            <li>but.. those are covered up easily..</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I love murad products and this is not a bad face wash, just like the original better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, my face felt amazing.</li>
            <li>so I am also worried about fine lines.</li>
            <li>Murad is a strong brand and solid product id wear it proudly...</li>
            <li>This product  is more of a cream rather than a gel and doesn&#x27;t leave the fresh tingle feeling after washing.</li>
            <li>While it gives a nice &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation, I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleansed very well or improved my acne at all.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my daughters face acne free.</li>
            <li>It has a light and airy feel to it.</li>
            <li>Murad has fantastic products</li>
            <li>but it does leave your face feeling fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very creamy and gives my face a nice clean feel.</li>
            <li>It addresses my unique skin care needs.</li>
            <li>Originally I saw it on a youtube channel and decided to pick up the starter kit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this one has to be my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have been using Murad products for several years and love, love, love them.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling tingling and clean.  </li>
            <li>After using this cleanser your face will feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Non drying and leaves the face feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This cleanser helped clear up my hormanal aging skin and now it&#x27;s in tip top shape!  </li>
            <li>It feels very good and even leaves a little bit of a minty sent.</li>
            <li>I love the whole Murad acne and wrinkle reducer line.</li>
            <li>is my dream come true.</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this purchase is still the fact that I got it much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li>Love it, doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils too much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better, this stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li>It has a peppermint type scent and leave your face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>The item came quickly and was just as stated in the description.</li>
            <li>I would suggest this product to anyone who needs a mild product for mild acne.</li>
            <li>Now what other murad must I get :)?!!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied and will probably be returning to purchase this item in the future.</li>
            <li>Looking more closely at my skin, I noticed blackheads where they&#x27;d never been before, and throughout the use of this product, whiteheads that I normally didn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d received a sample of this product and used it for about 2 weeks and was very pleased with the results and the overall impact on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too!!</li>
            <li>I was not crazy about this cleanser.</li>
            <li>but then :) a must try if u want clear skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for acne but as far as face wash goes this is one of the better ones around for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>getting more soon  face is much clearer thanks</li>
            <li>The price is worth it.</li>
            <li>But as the months wore on, I was noticing more and more blemishes breaking out in different places on my face, particularly my chin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and it is definitely a product I cannot do without&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a good acne cleanser</li>
            <li>I alternate it 2-3x/week with Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser for my very problematic skin &amp; it seems to do a nice job.</li>
            <li>In my experience, although this will not suffice on its own for severe acne, it is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irrate or inflame the skin.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that this product would work well or better with the extra benefits</li>
            <li>During the first week or so of use I did not see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li>My skin has more firmness than before I started using these products, it has a healthy appearance and I only have an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>Was the first time I tried it</li>
            <li>I can only see my skin getting and looking better..</li>
            <li>Price on Amazon is much better than facial boutiques.</li>
            <li>At first, it almost seemed to work.</li>
            <li>This is the first treatment system that works for me - it dramatically reduced the breakout frequency and intensity.</li>
            <li>For a guy constantly working out and getting sweaty that is a challenge for sure.</li>
            <li>this is my first time to buy a Murad cleanser</li>
            <li>My son has tried multiple other acne creams &amp; this by far the best....</li>
            <li>Murad&#x27;s Time-Relase Acne Cleanser has a very creamy texture &amp; it leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, and have tried many different acne products.  </li>
            <li>I began using this with the acne and wrinkle reducer (step 2) cream about a month ago and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li>However, I made a new years resolution to take better care of my face - ie: I&#x27;m going to get better about washing my face day and night with proper cleanser, moisturizing regularly, etc.</li>
            <li>The formula is mild and creamy and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used every cleanser there is and most of them lather up and dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li>used this in the past its a good reliable and gentle face wash</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after raving reviews claiming this product helped with everything from wrinkles to acne and promising a brighter skin tone.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very picky.</li>
            <li>Have used for a year and have seen much improvement.</li>
            <li>Purchasing this on Amazon is much cheaper than buying it in stores.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it cleans it very well.</li>
            <li>and I lose interest in using them too fast to justify spending the money.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much - I use about a dime size.  </li>
            <li>it is gentle on skin but still does the job.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>You could include how much time it takes before it releases.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a lot of acne cleansers out there, but this one really seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to acne or have really oily skin, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I have also been using this with the murad gentle acne treatment gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li>that isn&#x27;t too intense.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed at how well this works for my skin.  </li>
            <li>surge intense.  </li>
            <li>She battled a fairly severe case of acne in her late teens and was eventually prescribed Accutane.</li>
            <li>and this is the only one that has been able to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li>i feel it doesnt clean as much as I would personally like</li>
            <li>but I think I will be going back to the original murad face wash.</li>
            <li>i like the other age balancing cream better</li>
            <li>It is a mix between a cleanser and very gentle scrub-a consistency that many products try to obtain but few achieve.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I do not believe this cleanser cleared my acne or prevented new acne any faster/better than my normal cleanser and scrub-and neither are meant to target acne.</li>
            <li>Most acne cleanser out there will strip your face of natural oils too and leave it dry but not this Time Release Acne Cleanser by Murad.</li>
            <li>At the age of 41, I suddenly found myself with a face full of acne, and went looking for a product for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It has slightly less salicylic acid than even most face washes like clearasil, neutrogena, etc., but I think that&#x27;s why it works so well--</li>
            <li>The overall condition of my skin has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I tried many products and this was the only one that actually worked.</li>
            <li>so in 4 days.. noticed a HUGE difference.. and in a week.. clear skin... sure some red spots where the little devils were</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like this better than any other product I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>My skin also seemed to absorb products a little better than with my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li>Really has improved my adult acne without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>And as a side note, its much cheaper to buy through Amazon then on Murad&#x27;s website directly.</li>
            <li>Because I have semi-sensitive skin, I cannot use a scrub more than three or four times a week-but I was able to use this product two times daily without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin looked normal.</li>
            <li>Fast forward a few weeks, and the tingle I get with the scrub at the end of each night never gets old and is always refreshing.</li>
            <li>and I loved the feel of it and the &amp;#34;Time Released Acne Cleanser&amp;#34; is non irritating.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (particularly to cleansers) and still break out.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend using it at night, as it makes me wake with very clear skin.</li>
            <li>I am a fairly new fan of Murad.</li>
            <li>Really works and is gentle enough.</li>
            <li>It is very soft, not exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same product that is sold in Sephora for 36 dollars.</li>
            <li>No down sides, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It took me about six weeks to use the full tube, and because of the expensive and lack-luster results I switched back to my Neutrogena deep clean cream cleanser (oil free).  </li>
            <li>and of course, clear.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the clear Murad.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and have sensitive skin prone to breakout and also have rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 62 with acne and some wrinkles, my skin had lost its suppleness/firmness and and my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li>I finally ditched the Murad cleanser altogether, and within a week, my skin looked much clearer.  </li>
            <li>I met with a mural consultant and she explained how Murad is NEVER tested on animals, uses natural ingredients and the line is created by Dr.Murad himself.</li>
            <li>but wow.. I will stick with this..</li>
            <li>I definitely notice a change in my skin - it seems more vitalized and blemishes are few and far between.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, it is the only one that really worked.</li>
            <li>Now two years later, I don&#x27;t use it as much</li>
            <li>This is the only acne cleanser that actually makes me skin feel soft and smooth the next morning</li>
            <li>even through I naturally have oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh, at all.</li>
            <li>I have adult onset acne</li>
            <li>I have adult acne (age 30)</li>
            <li>It feels calming and moisturizing--skin feels soft all day.</li>
            <li>Although there are number of acne fighting ingredients-white willow bark seems to the main acne fighting ingredient which essentially is only an exfoliator.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fight it per say, but it does a decent job keeping you from further break outs.</li>
            <li>no down time</li>
            <li>and i have fairly normal skin, except for the regular acne breakouts -</li>
            <li>Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout.</li>
            <li>I used my wife&#x27;s Murad and it dried it up really quickly.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely amazed that this cleanser is actually working with my sensitive, dry, breakout/acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I have stuck with this cleanser longer than any other, and use the acne and anti wrinkle reducer afterwards which really helps keep breakouts under control for my 45 yr old skim</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and it is not red or irritated.  </li>
            <li>Recently my skin was fairly clear, but it wasn&#x27;t where I knew it could be.</li>
            <li>My back is completely clear.</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old female.  </li>
            <li>My son and I use this daily, it really helps with prevention of acne but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li>At 26 years old, I am very fed up with my acne, so after trying the regular Murad Acne Kit, I decided to try some of the \\&quot;Adult Acne\\&quot; products offered by Murad, and was not very pleased.</li>
            <li>At first it got a little worse, but after two or so weeks it got much better and has stayed that way for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>#34;Murad is the only face wash which consistently keeps my skin clear, eliminates excessive shine and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the dirt out of my pores, leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>

            <li> This face wash is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s an amazing combo.  </li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up amazingly well</li>
            <li> and then I wash it off with a washcloth and warm water.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 &amp; have started focusing on anti-aging regimens, so this product fits in nicely</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t notice any astounding beautifying changes in my complexion because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and a great price.  </li>
            <li> seems to be most effective when you use it in rotation with something stronger.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best face cleaners I have used because it addresses both preventing acne and also aging.</li>
            <li> Bar far the best acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used in 20 years.</li>
            <li> The best face wash I&#x27;ve ever tried for my adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I use it with my clairsonic and it leaves my skin feeling clean and bright.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser...does a great job cleaning my face and is minty fresh too...</li>
            <li> cleanser smells good, not chemically, and it leaves your skin tingly clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great at first</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and comes off real easy.</li>
            <li> at first I thought GREAT more zits..</li>
            <li> tax is more than I would like to pay</li>
            <li> Acne is goneafter years and skin looks so much better since using this.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This is much better.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a face wash for so many years.</li>
            <li> well I tried most of it all.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser ever.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m sure that with extended use, I&#x27;ll see better results.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;d recommend it to others, I wouldn&#x27;t view it as a magical &#x27;cure-all.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin has a healthy shine to it</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash</li>
            <li> Going thru some phases in life, works well will order more soon!&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also, entering my 20&#x27;s I began to worry about using the appropriate anti aging products.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it more than once a day though.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this product.</li>
            <li> I am \\&quot;older\\&quot; and my God zits most of my life..</li>
            <li> I paid alot more for this stuff at the store..</li>
            <li> but since he has been using it, not any more.</li>
            <li> I use a seperate, more lathering wash for makeup removal before using this product.</li>
            <li> Better than in sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most over the counter products and some prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  </li>
            <li> This one is okay.</li>
            <li> I love Murad products and have used this skin wash for a year now.</li>
            <li> I really love this Murad time release cleanser.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely my favorite cleanser yet.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended it and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Excellent product for minor acne.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!!</li>
            <li> I am in love and my skin is happy and clear</li>
            <li> i liked this product until I got pregnant.</li>
            <li> my face is becoming immune to the product.</li>
            <li> Murad cleanser does a great job of keeping her skin clear.</li>
            <li> and my skin is happy and clear</li>
            <li> very gentle on skin, gets it good and clean and helps prevent break outs</li>
            <li> I bought this after having used the original murad face wash which I love.</li>
            <li> but.. those are covered up easily..</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I love murad products and this is not a bad face wash, just like the original better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, my face felt amazing.</li>
            <li> so I am also worried about fine lines.</li>
            <li> Murad is a strong brand and solid product id wear it proudly...</li>
            <li> This product  is more of a cream rather than a gel and doesn&#x27;t leave the fresh tingle feeling after washing.</li>
            <li> While it gives a nice &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation, I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleansed very well or improved my acne at all.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my daughters face acne free.</li>
            <li> It has a light and airy feel to it.</li>
            <li> Murad has fantastic products</li>
            <li> but it does leave your face feeling fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very creamy and gives my face a nice clean feel.</li>
            <li> It addresses my unique skin care needs.</li>
            <li> Originally I saw it on a youtube channel and decided to pick up the starter kit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this one has to be my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for several years and love, love, love them.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling tingling and clean.  </li>
            <li> After using this cleanser your face will feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Non drying and leaves the face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This cleanser helped clear up my hormanal aging skin and now it&#x27;s in tip top shape!  </li>
            <li> It feels very good and even leaves a little bit of a minty sent.</li>
            <li> I love the whole Murad acne and wrinkle reducer line.</li>
            <li> is my dream come true.</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this purchase is still the fact that I got it much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils too much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better, this stuff really works for me.</li>
            <li> It has a peppermint type scent and leave your face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and was just as stated in the description.</li>
            <li> I would suggest this product to anyone who needs a mild product for mild acne.</li>
            <li> Now what other murad must I get :)?!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied and will probably be returning to purchase this item in the future.</li>
            <li> Looking more closely at my skin, I noticed blackheads where they&#x27;d never been before, and throughout the use of this product, whiteheads that I normally didn&#x27;t get.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d received a sample of this product and used it for about 2 weeks and was very pleased with the results and the overall impact on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Fast Shipping too!!</li>
            <li> I was not crazy about this cleanser.</li>
            <li> but then :) a must try if u want clear skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for acne but as far as face wash goes this is one of the better ones around for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> getting more soon  face is much clearer thanks</li>
            <li> The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> But as the months wore on, I was noticing more and more blemishes breaking out in different places on my face, particularly my chin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and it is definitely a product I cannot do without&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a good acne cleanser</li>
            <li> I alternate it 2-3x/week with Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser for my very problematic skin &amp; it seems to do a nice job.</li>
            <li> In my experience, although this will not suffice on its own for severe acne, it is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irrate or inflame the skin.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that this product would work well or better with the extra benefits</li>
            <li> During the first week or so of use I did not see any difference in my skin</li>
            <li> My skin has more firmness than before I started using these products, it has a healthy appearance and I only have an occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> Was the first time I tried it</li>
            <li> I can only see my skin getting and looking better..</li>
            <li> Price on Amazon is much better than facial boutiques.</li>
            <li> At first, it almost seemed to work.</li>
            <li> This is the first treatment system that works for me - it dramatically reduced the breakout frequency and intensity.</li>
            <li> For a guy constantly working out and getting sweaty that is a challenge for sure.</li>
            <li> this is my first time to buy a Murad cleanser</li>
            <li> My son has tried multiple other acne creams &amp; this by far the best....</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s Time-Relase Acne Cleanser has a very creamy texture &amp; it leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and have tried many different acne products.  </li>
            <li> I began using this with the acne and wrinkle reducer (step 2) cream about a month ago and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> However, I made a new years resolution to take better care of my face - ie: I&#x27;m going to get better about washing my face day and night with proper cleanser, moisturizing regularly, etc.</li>
            <li> The formula is mild and creamy and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used every cleanser there is and most of them lather up and dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> used this in the past its a good reliable and gentle face wash</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after raving reviews claiming this product helped with everything from wrinkles to acne and promising a brighter skin tone.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very picky.</li>
            <li> Have used for a year and have seen much improvement.</li>
            <li> Purchasing this on Amazon is much cheaper than buying it in stores.</li>
            <li> and I feel like it cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> and I lose interest in using them too fast to justify spending the money.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much - I use about a dime size.  </li>
            <li> it is gentle on skin but still does the job.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> You could include how much time it takes before it releases.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of acne cleansers out there, but this one really seems to work for me.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to acne or have really oily skin, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have also been using this with the murad gentle acne treatment gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  </li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t too intense.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed at how well this works for my skin.  </li>
            <li> surge intense.  </li>
            <li> She battled a fairly severe case of acne in her late teens and was eventually prescribed Accutane.</li>
            <li> and this is the only one that has been able to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> i feel it doesnt clean as much as I would personally like</li>
            <li> but I think I will be going back to the original murad face wash.</li>
            <li> i like the other age balancing cream better</li>
            <li> It is a mix between a cleanser and very gentle scrub-a consistency that many products try to obtain but few achieve.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I do not believe this cleanser cleared my acne or prevented new acne any faster/better than my normal cleanser and scrub-and neither are meant to target acne.</li>
            <li> Most acne cleanser out there will strip your face of natural oils too and leave it dry but not this Time Release Acne Cleanser by Murad.</li>
            <li> At the age of 41, I suddenly found myself with a face full of acne, and went looking for a product for aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It has slightly less salicylic acid than even most face washes like clearasil, neutrogena, etc., but I think that&#x27;s why it works so well--</li>
            <li> The overall condition of my skin has improved tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I tried many products and this was the only one that actually worked.</li>
            <li> so in 4 days.. noticed a HUGE difference.. and in a week.. clear skin... sure some red spots where the little devils were</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like this better than any other product I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> My skin also seemed to absorb products a little better than with my normal cleanser.</li>
            <li> Really has improved my adult acne without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> And as a side note, its much cheaper to buy through Amazon then on Murad&#x27;s website directly.</li>
            <li> Because I have semi-sensitive skin, I cannot use a scrub more than three or four times a week-but I was able to use this product two times daily without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin looked normal.</li>
            <li> Fast forward a few weeks, and the tingle I get with the scrub at the end of each night never gets old and is always refreshing.</li>
            <li> and I loved the feel of it and the &amp;#34;Time Released Acne Cleanser&amp;#34; is non irritating.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (particularly to cleansers) and still break out.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend using it at night, as it makes me wake with very clear skin.</li>
            <li> I am a fairly new fan of Murad.</li>
            <li> Really works and is gentle enough.</li>
            <li> It is very soft, not exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same product that is sold in Sephora for 36 dollars.</li>
            <li> No down sides, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It took me about six weeks to use the full tube, and because of the expensive and lack-luster results I switched back to my Neutrogena deep clean cream cleanser (oil free).  </li>
            <li> and of course, clear.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the clear Murad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and have sensitive skin prone to breakout and also have rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 with acne and some wrinkles, my skin had lost its suppleness/firmness and and my skin is sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and adult acne.</li>
            <li> I finally ditched the Murad cleanser altogether, and within a week, my skin looked much clearer.  </li>
            <li> I met with a mural consultant and she explained how Murad is NEVER tested on animals, uses natural ingredients and the line is created by Dr.Murad himself.</li>
            <li> but wow.. I will stick with this..</li>
            <li> I definitely notice a change in my skin - it seems more vitalized and blemishes are few and far between.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, it is the only one that really worked.</li>
            <li> Now two years later, I don&#x27;t use it as much</li>
            <li> This is the only acne cleanser that actually makes me skin feel soft and smooth the next morning</li>
            <li> even through I naturally have oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not harsh, at all.</li>
            <li> I have adult onset acne</li>
            <li> I have adult acne (age 30)</li>
            <li> It feels calming and moisturizing--skin feels soft all day.</li>
            <li> Although there are number of acne fighting ingredients-white willow bark seems to the main acne fighting ingredient which essentially is only an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fight it per say, but it does a decent job keeping you from further break outs.</li>
            <li> no down time</li>
            <li> and i have fairly normal skin, except for the regular acne breakouts -</li>
            <li> Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout.</li>
            <li> I used my wife&#x27;s Murad and it dried it up really quickly.  </li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed that this cleanser is actually working with my sensitive, dry, breakout/acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> I have stuck with this cleanser longer than any other, and use the acne and anti wrinkle reducer afterwards which really helps keep breakouts under control for my 45 yr old skim</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and it is not red or irritated.  </li>
            <li> Recently my skin was fairly clear, but it wasn&#x27;t where I knew it could be.</li>
            <li> My back is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old female.  </li>
            <li> My son and I use this daily, it really helps with prevention of acne but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> At 26 years old, I am very fed up with my acne, so after trying the regular Murad Acne Kit, I decided to try some of the \\&quot;Adult Acne\\&quot; products offered by Murad, and was not very pleased.</li>
            <li> At first it got a little worse, but after two or so weeks it got much better and has stayed that way for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> #34;Murad is the only face wash which consistently keeps my skin clear, eliminates excessive shine and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It cleans the dirt out of my pores, leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and seems to hold acne back.</li>
            <li> It may be too harsh for that especially if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li> I continue to use the simple spot treatment, and I use plain old Cetaphil cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue using until the tube is gone to see if it helps long term</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had acne here and there throughout my teen years, due to my PCOS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician &amp; after hormonal shifts due to age &amp; bc thus is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to someone with less severe acne that would like to exfoliate without irritation-but it is a little  expensive for a cleanser that is not too effective.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt dry out my skin like the store bought cleanser</li>
            <li> (something in them makes my face breakout or dry to the point of pain even with lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it washes my face thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I am getting a bit older and can&#x27;t believe that I still break out - late 30s.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use very little and the bottle is big</li>
            <li> On a couple of occasions, she  tried less expensive products hoping to save money, but came right back to Murad.</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days and did not like the results I got on my face, however I had some acne on my back and this worked wonders.  </li>
            <li> this is one of the few acne cleansers that i can actually SEE a difference on my face when i use it.</li>
            <li> After using it, I had very few \\&quot;dead spots\\&quot; and my skin was red for only about two minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> Had more wash than face but the experience wasn&#x27;t half bad.</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser twice a day along with the Murad anti-aging moisturizer SPF 20 (for blemish prone skin) in the morning and the Murad acne-wrinkle reducer every other night.  </li>
            <li> Way cheaper on Amazon than other stores.</li>
            <li> Will never use anything else other than Murad.</li>
            <li> use this once or twice a day (depending on my level of activity) with my Clarisonic Mia and every since, I&#x27;ve had very minimal breakouts.</li>
            <li> BTW, I massage this cleanser on my dry face for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> While pregnant I broke out like crazy and that didn&#x27;t change after giving birth.</li>
            <li> and I mean the two weeks to heal deep acne.</li>
            <li> has only a very small percentage of salicylic acid in it.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick, so I&#x27;d recommend using a face brush to later and apply.</li>
            <li> I use the Acne Clearing Solution with it and my face has less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I let it sit on my face for maybe a half minute</li>
            <li> This product cleared my skin in less than a week, when used twice a day.</li>
            <li> i noticed less acne almost immediately, and even still, if i go a day or 2 without using it, my face breaks out...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it would react to dry skin, but for me, after a while if I didn&#x27;t apply just a tad of some oil-free lotion every now and then, my skin would become a little dried out.</li>
            <li> 20-something, slightly pigmented, few lines, acne-prone, semi-sensitive, oily</li>
            <li> This cleanser is a little too greasy for my already oily skin.</li>
            <li> After using this product two times each day for eight weeks, I have concluded that this product contains too little of the acne fighting ingredient, as well as contains ingredients that clog pores.  </li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get use to that.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my skin is a little clearer and softer than it was with store bought acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it with any other acne products because I don&#x27;t want to go overboard</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t strip face or leave it dried out.</li>
            <li> I started buying it at Sephora a few years ago and will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> It is not as harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> After trial and error with at least forty or so other products, my mom found this one.</li>
            <li> No strong smell.</li>
            <li> Still not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> but like I said.. desperate.. and WOW..</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after suffering from breakouts this past summer.</li>
            <li> and when just a couple of days past, there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it worked as well as Proactiv,</li>
            <li> First of all, it cleared up a horrible hormonal breakout in record time,and then actually doesn&#x27;t strip my face at all.  </li>
            <li> I have very few outbreaks now.</li>
            <li> Usually, I feel like my skin can be a train wreck and is so hard to balance.  </li>
            <li> I had a breakout last week due to stress at work and bad diet.  </li>
            <li> disappointed in the whole process.</li>
            <li> Anything that will help breakouts will usually dry my skin out worse and thus break me out even worse.  </li>
            <li> but the item is the Time Release Blemish Cleanser which is not effective against acne like the acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> but I am in my late 30s</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less expensive when purchasing on Amazon that buying in a store.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> However, there are still times of higher stress that bring out the worst in my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy the products that spas recommend because they are expensive</li>
            <li> I workout three times a day and don&#x27;t get a chance to wash my face as much as I should - with wipes being a horrible option for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-drying, and really helps get rid of those nasty acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Yes I know lame..</li>
            <li> I am so sick and tired of zits...</li>
            <li> Used to have them like crazy -</li>
            <li> Very sad it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find retail here in Korea.</li>
            <li> It was painful and awful.</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin.</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible acne, it was all over my face.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as worst as it could have been, but it was classified as severe acne.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product description says Time Release Acne Cleanser but the item is the Time Release Blemish Cleanser which is not effective against acne like the acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> My son and I use this daily, it really helps with prevention of acne but doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. Its great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, and have tried many different acne products.  I&#x27;m finally getting results with the Murad line.</li>
            <li> I have stuck with this cleanser longer than any other, and use the acne and anti wrinkle reducer afterwards which really helps keep breakouts under control for my 45 yr old skim</li>
            <li> Still not sure how I feel about this product. I bought this after having used the original murad face wash which I love. I was hoping that this product would work well or better with the extra benefits but I think I will be going back to the original murad face wash. This product  is more of a cream rather than a gel and doesn&#x27;t leave the fresh tingle feeling after washing. Also, doesn&#x27;t seem like it as working as well for my acne but it could be bc my face is becoming immune to the product. Nonetheless, I love murad products and this is not a bad face wash, just like the original better.</li>
            <li> One of my FAVORITE products EVER!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product ...........for now ! i feel it doesnt clean as much as I would personally like but it does leave your face feeling fresh and clean :)</li>
            <li> I was not crazy about this cleanser. At 26 years old, I am very fed up with my acne, so after trying the regular Murad Acne Kit, I decided to try some of the \\&quot;Adult Acne\\&quot; products offered by Murad, and was not very pleased. This cleanser is a little too greasy for my already oily skin. While it gives a nice &#x27;tingling&#x27; sensation, I didn&#x27;t feel like it cleansed very well or improved my acne at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s and have sensitive skin prone to breakout and also have rosacea. I had gone for a fascial during the winter and they used Murad products and I loved the feel of it and the &amp;#34;Time Released Acne Cleanser&amp;#34; is non irritating. Being that it costs  $30 + tax is more than I would like to pay but since I&#x27;ve found it on Amazon I&#x27;m saving over $10, plus I&#x27;m on Prime so I don&#x27;t have to pay for shipping.  I&#x27;m a very happy and satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> i liked this product until I got pregnant. seems to be most effective when you use it in rotation with something stronger. has only a very small percentage of salicylic acid in it. doesn&#x27;t strip face or leave it dried out.</li>
            <li> Acne is goneafter years and skin looks so much better since using this.</li>
            <li> Using for about 2 months. Really has improved my adult acne without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 62 with acne and some wrinkles, my skin had lost its suppleness/firmness and and my skin is sensitive.  During the first week or so of use I did not see any difference in my skin and I was about to move on to another product.  All of a sudden my skin tone &amp; clarity improved and blemishes were reduced.  After a month I started to see a diminishing in wrinkles.  I use this cleanser twice a day along with the Murad anti-aging moisturizer SPF 20 (for blemish prone skin) in the morning and the Murad acne-wrinkle reducer every other night.  My skin has more firmness than before I started using these products, it has a healthy appearance and I only have an occasional breakout.  These are not miracle products and results take time.  My hairdresser who does not know that I have changed my skin routine just told me that I look younger than I look in a photo taken 8 years ago (it&#x27;s on my business card). I am pleased with the results!</li>
            <li> I have managed to mitigate my acne problems over the years with a combination of different products-but I still have issues with redness. However, there are still times of higher stress that bring out the worst in my skin. I purchased this product after raving reviews claiming this product helped with everything from wrinkles to acne and promising a brighter skin tone.  I was most impressed with the consistency of this product. It is a mix between a cleanser and very gentle scrub-a consistency that many products try to obtain but few achieve. After using it, I had very few \\&quot;dead spots\\&quot; and my skin was red for only about two minutes afterwards. My skin also seemed to absorb products a little better than with my normal cleanser. Because I have semi-sensitive skin, I cannot use a scrub more than three or four times a week-but I was able to use this product two times daily without irritating my skin.  Unfortunately I do not believe this cleanser cleared my acne or prevented new acne any faster/better than my normal cleanser and scrub-and neither are meant to target acne. Although there are number of acne fighting ingredients-white willow bark seems to the main acne fighting ingredient which essentially is only an exfoliator. It took me about six weeks to use the full tube, and because of the expensive and lack-luster results I switched back to my Neutrogena deep clean cream cleanser (oil free).  I would recommend this product to someone with less severe acne that would like to exfoliate without irritation-but it is a little  expensive for a cleanser that is not too effective.  skin type: 20-something, slightly pigmented, few lines, acne-prone, semi-sensitive, oily</li>
            <li> The item came quickly and was just as stated in the description. Very satisfied and will probably be returning to purchase this item in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product. It is a little thick, so I&#x27;d recommend using a face brush to later and apply.</li>
            <li> I switched over to a been foaming facial wash.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser.  My breakouts have gone away.</li>
            <li> very gentle on skin, gets it good and clean and helps prevent break outs</li>
            <li> I love the whole Murad acne and wrinkle reducer line. I have sensitive skin and adult acne. I began using this with the acne and wrinkle reducer (step 2) cream about a month ago and have noticed a positive difference.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best face cleaners I have used because it addresses both preventing acne and also aging. I cant go anywhere with out it!</li>
            <li> I am a fairly new fan of Murad. I used to use Total Effects Olay antiaging/blemish cleanser. They discontinued that product. This is much better. It addresses my unique skin care needs. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have horrible skin. A friend recommended it and so far so good! It&#x27;s much less expensive when purchasing on Amazon that buying in a store. It&#x27;s very creamy and gives my face a nice clean feel. I use the Acne Clearing Solution with it and my face has less breakouts.</li>
            <li> YES A MILLION TIMES OVER. I have been on the hunt for a face wash for so many years. My skin is very picky. I tried proactiv I tried neutrogena I tried it all - well I tried most of it all. This stuff is perfect for me. I def need to use a face lotion afterwards but I have the murad oil control mattifier and it paired with this stuff is my dream come true. LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> Bar far the best acne cleanser I&#x27;ve used in 20 years. Nothing seems to do as well as this stuff does.</li>
            <li> I have used this cleanser for years and it is the best for hormonal acne.  I&#x27;m 58.  BTW, I massage this cleanser on my dry face for a few seconds.  I let it sit on my face for maybe a half minute and then I wash it off with a washcloth and warm water.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable results.  I&#x27;m going to continue using until the tube is gone to see if it helps long term</li>
            <li> I got this cleanser for my daughter who&#x27;s skin is oily and acne prone and she has struggled for years to find a cleanser that helped with these issues without overly drying out her skin.  She says that &amp;#34;Murad is the only face wash which consistently keeps my skin clear, eliminates excessive shine and does not dry out my skin.  I highly recommend it and it is definitely a product I cannot do without&amp;#34;!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone looking for a good acne cleanser should try this. Most acne cleanser out there will strip your face of natural oils too and leave it dry but not this Time Release Acne Cleanser by Murad.</li>
            <li> i like the other age balancing cream better</li>
            <li> This set has worked well for me. Have used for a year and have seen much improvement. Way cheaper on Amazon than other stores.</li>
            <li> My son has tried multiple other acne creams &amp; this by far the best.... as soon as he starts to use it he notices a difference immediately!</li>
            <li> Will never use anything else other than Murad. This face wash is the only thing that works for me. Purchasing this on Amazon is much cheaper than buying it in stores. I recommend this for everyone.</li>
            <li> I like this better than any other product I have tried so far.  I have had lifetime acne and now have aging skin.  I like this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Originally I saw it on a youtube channel and decided to pick up the starter kit. The overall condition of my skin has improved tremendously.  I also use it in conjunction with my Clarisonic.  My only gripe is the cost. But, I guess you&#x27;re getting what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my daughters face acne free. She battled a fairly severe case of acne in her late teens and was eventually prescribed Accutane. Murad cleanser does a great job of keeping her skin clear. On a couple of occasions, she  tried less expensive products hoping to save money, but came right back to Murad. It seems to be the best at keeping her acne free post Accutane.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cleanser ever.  It leaves my face feeling clean and not dried out. I use it twice daily.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so good! Completely delighted with all aspects of transaction: delivery, product, and results. Beware: when you start a new skin are regime, you&#x27;re likely to experience a purge of your pores, resulting in a breakout. Trust me, suffer through and be patient for about two weeks: it will be worth it!! As a side note, I use this product with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser. I keep it in the shower and use it every morning. It cleans the dirt out of my pores, leaves my skin soft and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I have oily skin and it works great on me.</li>
            <li> Drug store cleansers work better than this! I will not buy it again. Very sad it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s Time-Relase Acne Cleanser has a very creamy texture &amp; it leaves my skin smooth &amp; soft. I&#x27;m 28 &amp; have started focusing on anti-aging regimens, so this product fits in nicely &amp; I&#x27;m sure that with extended use, I&#x27;ll see better results. I alternate it 2-3x/week with Murad&#x27;s AHA/BHA Exfoliating Cleanser for my very problematic skin &amp; it seems to do a nice job. While I&#x27;d recommend it to others, I wouldn&#x27;t view it as a magical &#x27;cure-all.&#x27; My favorite part about this purchase is still the fact that I got it much cheaper than retail.</li>
            <li> The best face wash I&#x27;ve ever tried for my adult acne prone skin. I have ordered this multiple times over the last couple years and will never switch! It is pricey but one tube lasts me about 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> I had a breakout last week due to stress at work and bad diet.  I used my wife&#x27;s Murad and it dried it up really quickly.  I&#x27;d also recommend always buying this product online.  It&#x27;s impossible to find retail here in Korea.</li>
            <li> I believe that when I use this product it does what it says it will, continue to work after I have washed it off.  It does not dry out my skin and I feel like it cleans it very well.</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old female.  I have very sensitive skin (particularly to cleansers) and still break out.  I love this cleanser.  My skin is clear and it is not red or irritated.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I get facials about once a month and this product was recommended by my esthetician.  I don&#x27;t usually buy the products that spas recommend because they are expensive and I lose interest in using them too fast to justify spending the money.  However, I made a new years resolution to take better care of my face - ie: I&#x27;m going to get better about washing my face day and night with proper cleanser, moisturizing regularly, etc. - so I decided to buy the Murad Time Release Acne Cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  You don&#x27;t need to use much - I use about a dime size.  It leaves my face feeling tingling and clean.  I&#x27;ve only been using it regularly for about 2 weeks but I&#x27;ve already noticed that my skin has a healthy shine to it and I haven&#x27;t gotten any pimples.</li>
            <li> Love it, doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of oils too much. Sometimes leaves a residue though</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash</li>
            <li> Going thru some phases in life, works well will order more soon!&lt;br /&gt;with no down time excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Kingwood, Texas  Realtor</li>
            <li> After using this product two times each day for eight weeks, I have concluded that this product contains too little of the acne fighting ingredient, as well as contains ingredients that clog pores.  At the age of 41, I suddenly found myself with a face full of acne, and went looking for a product for aging skin.  I saw this recommended in a beauty article about oily skin control, and decided to try it based on the good amazon reviews. I also used the step 2 Murad product for acne and aging skin in the p.m., and the step 3 product moisturizer/sunscreen for acne prone skin in the a.m.  After four weeks of seeing no improvements, I stopped the step 2 and 3 products, because sometimes oily skin needs fewer products. At about six weeks, I started using a spot treatment of the salicylic acid (1per cent- a Neutrogena brand) and finally saw results. Looking more closely at my skin, I noticed blackheads where they&#x27;d never been before, and throughout the use of this product, whiteheads that I normally didn&#x27;t get.  I finally ditched the Murad cleanser altogether, and within a week, my skin looked much clearer.  I continue to use the simple spot treatment, and I use plain old Cetaphil cleanser. I also began using the step 3 moisturizer from Murad again, and this seems to combat any dryness without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> This face wash is amazing. I use it religiously, and it has done wonders on my face. It has slightly less salicylic acid than even most face washes like clearasil, neutrogena, etc., but I think that&#x27;s why it works so well--it is gentle on skin but still does the job. I can definitely tell after two days if I haven&#x27;t been using this wash, as my skin breaks out. Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is a great face cleanser.</li>
            <li> Anything from murad is a great product, no complaints</li>
            <li> Murad only made my problem worsens, at this point I will stick with proactive. Murad was not made for me. Not good.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and a great price.  However, I don&#x27;t love this product.  Was the first time I tried it and it does not provide the level of acne clearing power as the regular acne cleanser.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Controls my oils and breakouts. I swear by this thing.</li>
            <li> I am getting a bit older and can&#x27;t believe that I still break out - late 30s.  I use this product in the shower every morning and I do think it keeps the zits at bay.  If I travel without it for a week or so I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 and I&#x27;ve had acne here and there throughout my teen years, due to my PCOS. Recently my skin was fairly clear, but it wasn&#x27;t where I knew it could be. Also, entering my 20&#x27;s I began to worry about using the appropriate anti aging products. I met with a mural consultant and she explained how Murad is NEVER tested on animals, uses natural ingredients and the line is created by Dr.Murad himself. My skin feels great, looks and I would recommend the Time Release Acne Cleanser to anyone in their 20&#x27;s. My boyfriend even uses my cleanser and loves it. If you&#x27;re not in you&#x27;re 20&#x27;s, don&#x27;t fear! Murad makes excellent products for all ages and skin conditions.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad for over a year now. I use it every night to wash my face to get the oil and grime off. In the morning I use purity. The combination of the two work great for my skin. I would suggest this product to anyone who needs a mild product for mild acne. It has a peppermint type scent and leave your face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great at first u break out but then :) a must try if u want clear skin</li>
            <li> This cleanser is great! I have very oily skin and am prone to breakouts. I use this with my clarisonic and there is a noticeable difference after a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about is it doesn&#x27;t foam. It took me a little while to get use to that.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts. After using this cleanser your face will feel clean and refreshed. Helps fight breakouts for sure! I would not recommend using it more than once a day though. It may be too harsh for that especially if you have sensitive skin like me. I think there may be eucalyptus in this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. I started buying it at Sephora a few years ago and will never buy anything else. It&#x27;s so nice to be able to find it for cheaper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician &amp; after hormonal shifts due to age &amp; bc thus is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that works for me!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better, this stuff really works for me. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Murad is a strong brand and solid product id wear it proudly... used this in the past its a good reliable and gentle face wash</li>
            <li> I have used just about every type and brand for my acne and this is the only one that has been able to keep my face clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product so far. I was using the Murad Clarifying cleanser before trying this one. Can&#x27;t say that I see a big difference between the two but I do like the claim that this product works after it&#x27;s washed off. Have been using Murad products for almost 10 yrs. I have fairly oily skin and this brand has been a lifesaver. The clarifying line cleared up my skin and got my shine under control.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feel of this product. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products and this one has to be my favorite! Now what other murad must I get :)?!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have purchased it twice now. I have acne prone skin but I am in my late 30s so I am also worried about fine lines. I use it with my clairsonic and it leaves my skin feeling clean and bright. It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker for acne but as far as face wash goes this is one of the better ones around for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Had more wash than face but the experience wasn&#x27;t half bad. You could include how much time it takes before it releases.</li>
            <li> getting more soon  face is much clearer thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this out of desperation... I am so sick and tired of zits... I am \\&quot;older\\&quot; and my God zits most of my life.. so I tried this after seeing an infomercial.. Yes I know lame.. I paid alot more for this stuff at the store.. but like I said.. desperate.. and WOW.. with in 2 days I noticed a difference.. at first I thought GREAT more zits.. but I realized.. ummm they were already on their way up.. so in 4 days.. noticed a HUGE difference.. and in a week.. clear skin... sure some red spots where the little devils were but.. those are covered up easily.. I do use the time release acne cleaner, the astringent, and the acne gel stuff.. faithfully morning and night.. but wow.. I will stick with this.. I can only see my skin getting and looking better.. shame on me for not trying this sooner!!! Good luck to all...</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used. While pregnant I broke out like crazy and that didn&#x27;t change after giving birth. I tried many products and this was the only one that actually worked. Price on Amazon is much better than facial boutiques.</li>
            <li> I used this product for over a year. At first, it almost seemed to work. But as the months wore on, I was noticing more and more blemishes breaking out in different places on my face, particularly my chin. My skin looked normal. It didn&#x27;t notice any astounding beautifying changes in my complexion because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end I switched over to supermarket-grade Cetaphil, which I&#x27;ve been using for about 4 months now, and have experienced excellent results. I definitely notice a change in my skin - it seems more vitalized and blemishes are few and far between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you go spending $20-30 on products like this, I say hit your local Walmart or Kmart and try out Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> I have started using this cleanser now for about a week and I have noticed that my skin is a little clearer and softer than it was with store bought acne cleanser. It doesnt dry out my skin like the store bought cleanser does either. It is not as harsh on my skin. It goes on smooth and comes off real easy. No strong smell. It has a light and airy feel to it. I would definitely recommend this to people who have acne problems. I use it to keep from having acne problems, especially related to a womans hormone cycle. I have started my husband using it every moring as a preventative so he wouldnt have any issues with acne which on occasion he would pop up with a blemish here or there, but since he has been using it, not any more. I would definitely recommend using this product. And as a side note, its much cheaper to buy through Amazon then on Murad&#x27;s website directly.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot of acne cleansers out there, but this one really seems to work for me. The day I don&#x27;t use it, I start to break out. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I never had a problem with acne when I was younger, but once I hit 40 I started getting hormonal acne.  This is the first treatment system that works for me - it dramatically reduced the breakout frequency and intensity. At first it got a little worse, but after two or so weeks it got much better and has stayed that way for 2 months.  I use this and the Acne &amp; Wrinkle Reducer and Anti-aging Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Fast Shipping too!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after suffering from breakouts this past summer. I do not have acne, so I can only blame the breakouts on stress or hormonal change. This product cleared my skin in less than a week, when used twice a day. After about a month of use I started to receive complements from perfect strangers telling me how beautiful my skin is. The formula is mild and creamy and does not irritate my sensitive skin. I use it along with the Murad spot fix when necessary. Side note: I do not reccomend this product to remove make up. I use a seperate, more lathering wash for makeup removal before using this product.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser...does a great job cleaning my face and is minty fresh too...I recommend to all women and men tooo.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cleanser! For me, it is the only one that really worked. I used to have horrible acne, it was all over my face. It wasn&#x27;t as worst as it could have been, but it was classified as severe acne. After trial and error with at least forty or so other products, my mom found this one. It works! I was about fifteen when I started using it and when just a couple of days past, there was a noticeable difference. Now two years later, I don&#x27;t use it as much but I only have a couple of blemishes on my face. I also use  Murad&#x27;s &amp;#34;Acne Body Wash&amp;#34;. It works wonders for my blemishes that I always got all over my body. Now almost all of them are gone. I have oily skin so I&#x27;m not sure how it would react to dry skin, but for me, after a while if I didn&#x27;t apply just a tad of some oil-free lotion every now and then, my skin would become a little dried out. If you are prone to acne or have really oily skin, I highly recommend this! The price is worth it.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested that I try this time released acne cleanser instead of the regular acne cleanser.  I tried it for a few days and did not like the results I got on my face, however I had some acne on my back and this worked wonders.  My back is completely clear.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne forever.  I&#x27;ve used every cleanser there is and most of them lather up and dry out the skin.  This cleanser does not lather but works great.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 days and already my skin is clearing.  I&#x27;m talking about acne that I&#x27;ve had for weeks that won&#x27;t go away is actually clearing up!  I have also been using this with the murad gentle acne treatment gel and it&#x27;s an amazing combo.  This is the only acne cleanser that actually makes me skin feel soft and smooth the next morning and of course, clear.  Another great thing to remember is that Murad does not test on animals which makes the product perfect!</li>
            <li> Great price. Better than in sephora.</li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and need to use an acne cleanser to help control breakouts.  I have tried several kinds of OTC as well as dept. store brands and often they work for reducing the severity of breakouts but my face tends to become drier than desirable, even through I naturally have oily skin.  I&#x27;d received a sample of this product and used it for about 2 weeks and was very pleased with the results and the overall impact on my skin.  I&#x27;ve since purchased outright and continue to use.  I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I liked this product.  Not sure if it worked as well as Proactiv, but I did like it.  Would buy it again if I wasn&#x27;t using Proactiv.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! It&#x27;s the only thing I can use that won&#x27;t break my face out!!!</li>
            <li> It feels good. But I haven&#x27;t seen changes after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> Had to order some of this at the recommendation of my esty girlfriend. I workout three times a day and don&#x27;t get a chance to wash my face as much as I should - with wipes being a horrible option for me (something in them makes my face breakout or dry to the point of pain even with lotion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, my face felt amazing. Fast forward a few weeks, and the tingle I get with the scrub at the end of each night never gets old and is always refreshing. My skin has cleared up amazingly well and this is all from just one scrub while in the shower before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Greats stuff. Really works and is gentle enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in a constant battle with my complexion.  I&#x27;ve tried most over the counter products and some prescriptions.  I love this cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin.  My skin isn&#x27;t as oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I wanted the clear Murad.  This one is okay.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for minor acne.  Non drying and leaves the face feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love it!  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and it washes my face thoroughly.  I love Murad products and have used this skin wash for a year now.</li>
            <li> I really love this Murad time release cleanser. It&#x27;s not harsh, at all. For sensitive skin, it&#x27;s perfect! The time release is great too because it means your skin doesn&#x27;t get oily after just an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser smells good, not chemically, and it leaves your skin tingly clean. It never stings or dries you out too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this once or twice a day (depending on my level of activity) with my Clarisonic Mia and every since, I&#x27;ve had very minimal breakouts. Used to have them like crazy - and I mean the two weeks to heal deep acne. It was painful and awful. My current system works like a charm! (Murad Time Release Acne Cleanser, Murad Clarifying Toner, and Obagi Therapeutic Lotion for spot treatment)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try! I hope you love it!</li>
            <li> this is one of the few acne cleansers that i can actually SEE a difference on my face when i use it. i noticed less acne almost immediately, and even still, if i go a day or 2 without using it, my face breaks out... but then clears up again as soon as i use it again. highly recommend using it at night, as it makes me wake with very clear skin. everyone has different skin - i&#x27;m 28 and i have fairly normal skin, except for the regular acne breakouts - and this stuff works for mine. it&#x27;s definitely my favorite cleanser yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products for several years and love, love, love them. I have gotten awesome compliments on my skin since using them. I have adult onset acne but this product has done wonders for me. I have very few outbreaks now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and seems to hold acne back. It doesn&#x27;t fight it per say, but it does a decent job keeping you from further break outs. For a guy constantly working out and getting sweaty that is a challenge for sure. I will pick up another bottle of this when done.</li>
            <li> This cleanser helped clear up my hormanal aging skin and now it&#x27;s in tip top shape!  It&#x27;s non-drying, and really helps get rid of those nasty acne breakouts.  What I am noticing is that if I do get an ocassional breakout it does not get as big and goes away faster now that I&#x27;m using this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use the product because it arrived opened with the safety seal not attached. Murad has fantastic products though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just disappointed in the whole process. Won&#x27;t order from them again.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with the matching lotion.  I have adult acne (age 30) that isn&#x27;t too intense.  I haven&#x27;t seen any relief with my acne.  It has a menthol type smell and feel.  It is very soft, not exfoliating.  I think I will use this alone for a bit and see if there is any progress.  You only have to use very little and the bottle is big so it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> works well with my skin</li>
            <li> this is my first time to buy a Murad cleanser and I love it! It feels very good and even leaves a little bit of a minty sent.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely amazed that this cleanser is actually working with my sensitive, dry, breakout/acne prone skin.  Usually, I feel like my skin can be a train wreck and is so hard to balance.  Anything that will help breakouts will usually dry my skin out worse and thus break me out even worse.  A friend told me about this product and I tried it, even though I was hesitant.  I am absolutely amazed at how well this works for my skin.  First of all, it cleared up a horrible hormonal breakout in record time,and then actually doesn&#x27;t strip my face at all.  I don&#x27;t use it with any other acne products because I don&#x27;t want to go overboard and my skin is happy and clear so I&#x27;m gonna leave it alone.  Just for reference, I&#x27;ve been using the oil cleansing method (part castor and part olive oil) to cleanse the makeup off of my face, follow with this cleanser, and then moisturize with clinique moisture surge intense.  I am in love and my skin is happy and clear - I&#x27;m so happy.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product that is sold in Sephora for 36 dollars. In my experience, although this will not suffice on its own for severe acne, it is gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irrate or inflame the skin. It feels calming and moisturizing--skin feels soft all day. No down sides, I highly recommend.</li>
