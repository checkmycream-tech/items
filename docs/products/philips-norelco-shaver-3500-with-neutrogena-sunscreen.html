    <ol>
            <li>Great Razor!</li>
            <li>Best electric Shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>(took about 5-15 minutes to read all of the pertinent info) as it will tell you how to take care of your razor as well as how it can provide the best shave for you.</li>
            <li>Great razor, durable and dependable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it and happy with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream was wierd but the razor is great.</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>another good Norelco product.</li>
            <li>For the price and not expecting it to be what it is not, this is a good bargain.  </li>
            <li>Good product and price ratio.</li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>and He loved it...</li>
            <li>I love it, works great.  </li>
            <li>Nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>Nice shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver provides a great shave quickly and conveniently.</li>
            <li>But, to be honest, I rarely do more than just blow them into a wastebasket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 3500 model is the best Norelco offers today-</li>
            <li>This has been the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
            <li>Gives me a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>He does have a very light beard growth so can&#x27;t say how well it would work on a heavier beard.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>I just could not tell if i got a better shave or not with the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Norelco has more fancy models to tease you with than an alligator has teeth.</li>
            <li>sure to read the instructions</li>
            <li>Nice clean cut</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t matter, it has new heads and works great while plugged</li>
            <li>Works great, most reviews online tell you to buy the $300 model, which I&#x27;m sure is better, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t really care about a super perfect close shave and wants something fast and easy, this does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Very nice replacement for my old Ni-Cad razor.  </li>
            <li>Easy cleaning with water.</li>
            <li>I suppose a foil shaver may give a close shave more quickly, but the ones that I have used were noisy.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>motor is much more powerful, I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 days to test this one;</li>
            <li>a continues orange light indicates the blades need to be changed/replaced.</li>
            <li>They both have said that it is comfortable (no rashes or burns) on their face.</li>
            <li>I like my face smooth.</li>
            <li>I like to show off dat der Jawline and a smooth face makes that possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth shave, every time.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to my husband and he says,&amp;#34;nice smooth shave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like traditional shaving.</li>
            <li>So far so good with shaving.</li>
            <li>Not as good as my 15 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li>: Fast, easy to clean, many days of shaves on one charge, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>The lithium-ion batteries in this one provides a remarkable power reserve; I may have charged it once in the last six months.</li>
            <li>It does the job quickly, cleanly, and with no nicks or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>can clean after each use with running water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Better still, you can use it while it is plugged in (yet you can still rinse it to clean it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly happy, but next time I think I will try one of the higher $ shavers.</li>
            <li>I think this is a fair price for the time I expect this razor to last.</li>
            <li>It is not as good a shave as a regular razor</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>so I could quickly shave in the morning, after over 20 years of using razors (triple blade) exclusively, and I did not want to spend a lot of moeny.  </li>
            <li>A lot better than my older Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Holds a charge long and works good.  </li>
            <li>Very close shave!!</li>
            <li>Shaves better than my old norelco</li>
            <li>Does not hold a charge - avoid this model - very very under powered as well.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing, I read the reviews of many Norelco shavers.</li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco shavers for many years now and it finally came time to replace the one I was using because the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li>This works very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does charge in just 3 minutes and gives a very comfortable shave several in fact.</li>
            <li>My old  Norelco QC5550 was better for shaving my head to a near razor like smoothness</li>
            <li>huge difference, This one is hands down better than the old one there is no tugging or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It did not work very well with longer stubble.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to go again.</li>
            <li>This whole &amp;#34;beardsman&amp;#34; trend aint for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very good.i buy another one for my father.</li>
            <li>He seems to really like it.</li>
            <li>Feels pretty cheap, mostly because of weak motor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned and used this shaver for several months and still get clean, close shaves.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my high functioning autistic son and he has found it very easy to use</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s in the sweet spot of high quality and low</li>
            <li>On my last one the shaving screens finally wore out after many years.</li>
            <li>;, but that&#x27;s a super critical feature.</li>
            <li>Seems like I have to mash this thing against my face to get a decent shave.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I got a much closer shave than my old one by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>According to this instructions (yes, I always read the instructions before using a product -- you should too), this is completely normal, as it takes about two weeks for your skin to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the shaver, whatever that means.</li>
            <li>I have had it for a few months now and am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>This new one&#x27;s motor does sound a little &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34; compared to my old ones, but it cuts much better and the battery lasts an astoundingly long time.</li>
            <li>You can do a quick shave and rinse off the blades right away and let it dry, then by the next shave</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a low charge indicator (red)light as well as a full charge (green) light,</li>
            <li>(ALL other parts were original.)  </li>
            <li>I like these shavers because they are quiet and provide a comfortable dry shave each morning</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m comparing this to my old razor Philips Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver.</li>
            <li>i paid nearly $100 bucks 8 years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t tried the cream yet, my old razor has a Reservoir to install a pouch of cream that would be administered while shaving.</li>
            <li>i am not taking that chance; my old one could though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought it to replace a 20+ year old Norelco after I had replaced and worn out three sets of NiCad batteries.</li>
            <li>So far my husband likes this.  </li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>ready for the next time.</li>
            <li>It takes a fifth of the time to shave compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li>one came in the retail box and included:&lt;br /&gt;the razor - cord - a cover for the blades - a small brush for cleaning - oil free  cream and a care &amp; instructional booklet.</li>
            <li>Much higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>The new style cutter heads cut much closer than the style I had previously.</li>
            <li>this one lasts as long as my last one, I&#x27;ll be very</li>
            <li>Beyond the 4500 you&#x27;re talking about spending over $100 on a razor for gimmicks you don&#x27;t need and that cause problems like making the razor hard to clean.</li>

            <li> I felt like it started cutting better after the first few days.</li>
            <li> It does not give as close a shave as a razor nor does it last as long</li>
            <li> He had to go over the same area for a long time.</li>
            <li> This model has the top of the line cutting heads and screens.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seemed strange that this shaver comes bundled with a tube of Neutrogena sunblock.  </li>
            <li> I gave my 15 year old Norelco to my son and the battery has been dead for 10 years-</li>
            <li> - I like the speed of a dry shave.</li>
            <li> My father has had this shaver for 2 years now and not had a single problem either.  </li>
            <li> but it cuts close enough for work and it cuts down on my prework prep time.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts as long as my other Norelco&#x27;s did</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers complain of nicks, skin irritation, and missed hairs.</li>
            <li> It give a close shave compared to other electric shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> They also do a poor job of making the differences clear (probably with marketing intent).  </li>
            <li> which has been about 4 years average.</li>
            <li> by registering the product you get a 2 year warranty from date of purchase also an additional 6 months from the previous coverage plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter and cuts closer than any of the previous ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of them, but I needn&#x27;t have been.</li>
            <li> About 5 % are always left behind.</li>
            <li> If you get a wet razor like the 4500 the razor is disabled while plugged in, so it will be useless in a couple years when the battery dies or whenever it runs low on power.</li>
            <li> (I only use them for my head), but I got tired of the $30 foils breaking on it and thought I&#x27;d try something else.  </li>
            <li> I returned my one after a few painfull usages</li>

            <li> another good Norelco product.</li>
            <li> I got this so I could quickly shave in the morning, after over 20 years of using razors (triple blade) exclusively, and I did not want to spend a lot of moeny.  It does not give as close a shave as a razor nor does it last as long (you may not have this issue if you have light/fine facial hair), but I did not expect it to and neither should you.  It does not come with a travel pouch or counter stand, so if you want those look elsewhere (in hind sight I should have looked for one with a pouch).  For the price and not expecting it to be what it is not, this is a good bargain.  It does run a lot slower than the Norelcos I bought decades ago, but I guess they figured out the optimal speed did not have to be that fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Fast, easy to clean, many days of shaves on one charge, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none that I can think of</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers complain of nicks, skin irritation, and missed hairs. Yes, I had these problems too... for about two weeks. According to this instructions (yes, I always read the instructions before using a product -- you should too), this is completely normal, as it takes about two weeks for your skin to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34; to the shaver, whatever that means. In any case, after my skin had adjusted, I&#x27;ve had no problems at all using this shaver. It does the job quickly, cleanly, and with no nicks or skin irritation. Seriously, give this shaver a try, and stick with it for a couple weeks. You&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Great razor, durable and dependable. Very close shave!!</li>
            <li> Good product and price ratio.</li>
            <li> Very nice replacement for my old Ni-Cad razor.  Much higher quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Nice, close shave. Good battery life. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great Razor! This arrived i just 2 days. I&#x27;m comparing this to my old razor Philips Norelco 7110 Cordless Rechargeable Shaver. i paid nearly $100 bucks 8 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is much more powerful, I didn&#x27;t shave for 3 days to test this one; huge difference, This one is hands down better than the old one there is no tugging or pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does charge in just 3 minutes and gives a very comfortable shave several in fact. I got a much closer shave than my old one by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the cream yet, my old razor has a Reservoir to install a pouch of cream that would be administered while shaving. I just could not tell if i got a better shave or not with the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one came in the retail box and included:&lt;br /&gt;the razor - cord - a cover for the blades - a small brush for cleaning - oil free  cream and a care &amp; instructional booklet. by registering the product you get a 2 year warranty from date of purchase also an additional 6 months from the previous coverage plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a low charge indicator (red)light as well as a full charge (green) light, a continues orange light indicates the blades need to be changed/replaced. they say around a year or so is the recommendation time to replace, depending on how your shaving habits are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can clean after each use with running water.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find anything in the manual saying that we can not use in the shower. There is no mention of showering while shaving. i am not taking that chance; my old one could though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any questions just ask.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my high functioning autistic son and he has found it very easy to use and it doesn&#x27;t bother his sensory issues. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Norelco has more fancy models to tease you with than an alligator has teeth. They also do a poor job of making the differences clear (probably with marketing intent).  But, unless you plan to wet-shave, I doubt you will want a Norelco fancier than this one either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it to replace a 20+ year old Norelco after I had replaced and worn out three sets of NiCad batteries. (ALL other parts were original.)  The lithium-ion batteries in this one provides a remarkable power reserve; I may have charged it once in the last six months. So, if you&#x27;re going on vacation, charge it before you go and leave the power cord at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ads don&#x27;t say so, but you CAN shave with the Model 3500 while it is charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient that you can rinse the clippings out of the heads under the water tap. But, to be honest, I rarely do more than just blow them into a wastebasket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The HQ8 heads on this shaver give a bit closer shave than the HQ3 heads in my last Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this one lasts as long as my last one, I&#x27;ll be very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seemed strange that this shaver comes bundled with a tube of Neutrogena sunblock.  I&#x27;d rather they had kept that and knocked $5 off the price.</li>
            <li> Will not cut all my hairs. About 5 % are always left behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned and used this shaver for several months and still get clean, close shaves. As such, I can legitimately recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far my husband likes this.  It did not work very well with longer stubble.  He had to go over the same area for a long time. But, when he does regular upkeep it works like a charm.  No problems yet.  Have had for about 2 months.  Used daily.  My father has had this shaver for 2 years now and not had a single problem either.  They both have said that it is comfortable (no rashes or burns) on their face.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco for 40 years.  On my last one the shaving screens finally wore out after many years. This one is lighter and shaves faster.&lt;br /&gt;The Li-ion battery allows me to charge it without worrying about battery &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; problems.&lt;br /&gt;This razor says to replace the screens yearly. I probably will not based on the history of my last one.</li>
            <li> Nice shaver. Been using it once per week since I purchased it.</li>
            <li> 3rd unit purchased for family members.  Shaves better than my old norelco it replaced.  Easy cleaning with water.</li>
            <li> Shaving is not very good, batteries is durable, the feeling is not very ideal.</li>
            <li> This model has the top of the line cutting heads and screens. The lower end models skimp on the screens and cutting heads, or don&#x27;t have lithium batteries. So in terms of the qualities that matter, this razor has it all. I&#x27;m using it and happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better still, you can use it while it is plugged in (yet you can still rinse it to clean it). If you get a wet razor like the 4500 the razor is disabled while plugged in, so it will be useless in a couple years when the battery dies or whenever it runs low on power. Beyond the 4500 you&#x27;re talking about spending over $100 on a razor for gimmicks you don&#x27;t need and that cause problems like making the razor hard to clean. The 3500 model is the best Norelco offers today- it&#x27;s in the sweet spot of high quality and low complexity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review as the Norelco model selection options are crazy complicated and it took me a while to figure things out. Also, their product descriptions fail to mention &amp;#34;use while plugged in&amp;#34;, but that&#x27;s a super critical feature. I gave my 15 year old Norelco to my son and the battery has been dead for 10 years- it doesn&#x27;t matter, it has new heads and works great while plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading, I hope the review was helpful.</li>
            <li> So far so good with shaving.Purchased it for someones birthday. Nice clean cut</li>
            <li> Best electric Shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. You can do a quick shave and rinse off the blades right away and let it dry, then by the next shave you&#x27;re ready to go again. There aren&#x27;t any cons I can think of with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t seem to irritate it. I always moisturize after using the razor though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions (took about 5-15 minutes to read all of the pertinent info) as it will tell you how to take care of your razor as well as how it can provide the best shave for you.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge long and works good.  No complaints.  It give a close shave compared to other electric shavers I have used.</li>
            <li> I like my face smooth. Even a five o&#x27;clock shadow makes me cringe...This whole &amp;#34;beardsman&amp;#34; trend aint for me. I like to show off dat der Jawline and a smooth face makes that possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This did the trick. Smooth shave, every time. Wish I had another set of arms because I would give this 4 thumbs UP</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  My old  Norelco QC5550 was better for shaving my head to a near razor like smoothness (I only use them for my head), but I got tired of the $30 foils breaking on it and thought I&#x27;d try something else.  For the price I I&#x27;m fairly happy, but next time I think I will try one of the higher $ shavers.</li>
            <li> A lot better than my older Norelco.  Use it , Rinse it off, and it&amp;#34;s ready for the next time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good.i buy another one for my father.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas Gift for my fella and He loved it...</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my husband and he says,&amp;#34;nice smooth shave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Not as good as my 15 year old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing, I read the reviews of many Norelco shavers. I was a little worried after reading some of them, but I needn&#x27;t have been. I have been using Norelco shavers for many years now and it finally came time to replace the one I was using because the battery wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. This new one&#x27;s motor does sound a little &amp;#34;tinny&amp;#34; compared to my old ones, but it cuts much better and the battery lasts an astoundingly long time. I use it for about 5 minutes every day and the battery lasts over 3 weeks. The new style cutter heads cut much closer than the style I had previously. I have had it for a few months now and am completely satisfied. I hope it lasts as long as my other Norelco&#x27;s did which has been about 4 years average.</li>
            <li> I like the Philips Norelco shaver. The one this one replaces had and on/off switch that is wearing out. I like these shavers because they are quiet and provide a comfortable dry shave each morning - I like the speed of a dry shave. I suppose a foil shaver may give a close shave more quickly, but the ones that I have used were noisy. I think this is a fair price for the time I expect this razor to last.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t irritate my face like traditional shaving. Gives me a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> Works great, most reviews online tell you to buy the $300 model, which I&#x27;m sure is better, but for someone who doesn&#x27;t really care about a super perfect close shave and wants something fast and easy, this does the job very well. I shave daily and I&#x27;m done in 5 minutes, the pop out trimmer is convenient too. One charge lasts several days. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my grown son. He seems to really like it. He does have a very light beard growth so can&#x27;t say how well it would work on a heavier beard.</li>
            <li> This has been the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned so far. It&#x27;s quieter and cuts closer than any of the previous ones I&#x27;ve had. It takes a fifth of the time to shave compared to my old razor.</li>
            <li> I love it, works great.  The cream was wierd but the razor is great.</li>
            <li> This shaver provides a great shave quickly and conveniently. I&#x27;ve had 2 dozen shaves, and it&#x27;s still running.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a break in period. I felt like it started cutting better after the first few days. It is not as good a shave as a regular razor but it cuts close enough for work and it cuts down on my prework prep time.</li>
            <li> what used to take me 2mins to shave with a disposable razor, now takes me 20 mins with this electric razor.  Seems like I have to mash this thing against my face to get a decent shave.  the amount of time this needs to be on to shave, it builds up heat.  only benefit I see is for business travel so I can avoid risk of razor cuts before a meeting.  I should have stuck with the $0.25 bic disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a charge - avoid this model - very very under powered as well.</li>
            <li> Shaving takes ~15 minutes. Does not shave 100%, оften cuts the skin. Feels pretty cheap, mostly because of weak motor. I returned my one after a few painfull usages</li>
            <li> This works very well! Great value for the price.</li>
