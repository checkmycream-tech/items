            <li> Recently discovered the mint listerine has sucralose in it.  I am not one to judge, but I dont think mouthwash needs to taste like candy.  Old fasioned I suppose.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t personally use this but a family member does</li>

            <li> I bought this in order to soak my feet in vinegar and listerine.  It helps remove calluses.</li>
