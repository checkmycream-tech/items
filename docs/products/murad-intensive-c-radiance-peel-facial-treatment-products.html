    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this mask. Cool tingly while it&#x27;s on and my skin is radiant, smooth and clear of blemishes when using just once or twice a week. Definitely recommend, especially when it&#x27;s so much more affordable on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product, and at present I have not used it enough to truly comment on it.</li>
            <li> I get monthly Murad facials and the vitamin c line is my absolute favorite.  I use this peel weekly, leaves the face smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom with no irritation.  Fabulous products, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My face looks radiant after I use it.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for aging skin.  It has made my skin softer, brighter and more younger looking.  I would recommend it to anyone who is in their 50&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Use this a couple times on week on my sensitive and acne prone skin and I love it.  Murad is high quality and I&#x27;m getting the dose of antioxidants on my face like my dermatologist recommends without a high price.</li>
            <li> I have being using Muard for almost a year I love it. Works great feel so good on your skin you can start seeing the change within the first week of using. I will pay this again.</li>
            <li> I keep using this product and it works well</li>
            <li> I love the whole Murad Essential C line.  I&#x27;ve only been using this product a few months, but each time I do, my face is SOOOO soft.  I use it once a week.</li>
            <li> I really like how my skin looks and feels after I use this. My husband even asked me the other day why I was wearing make - up before bed, and I told him I wasn&#x27;t.  He said that my skin looked so smooth, he thought I had foundation on!</li>
            <li> I take exceptional care of my skin and am always trying new products.  This has to be my new favorite.  IT IS AMAZING.  it tingles when you apply it and works so well, my skin still tingled the next morning.  Vitamin C is fantastic for the skin and if you add this to a great skin cleansing and toning regine you will love the results.  Remember no product will work overnight.  it takes discipline - find products you love and stick with a routine every day and night.  I don&#x27;t use a lot of MURAD products but i may invest in a few after having found something this great.  i have used this product 3 times in a little over a week and my skin looks like it is glowing.  i had one very small brown spot on my skin that is seemingly getting smaller each time i use it - disappearing before my very eyes.  this stuff is GREAT and CHEAP.  it is a MUST HAVE PRODUCT in your bag!!!!!  i love love love it!!</li>
            <li> I did notice softer skin after using this product.</li>
            <li> Such an awesome product! I love the entire Murad line, and the smell of the Intensive-C is perfectly fragrant and refreshing. Goes on light with an all day moisturizer. Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love this peel. Your skin is so smooth and soft. It feels refreshing</li>
            <li> I have gotten better results from drugstore cheapie brands. it smells nice and tightens my skin but thats about it. I would go with the Murad exfoliating mask over this.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I have tried in the Environmental Shield line, and I absolutely love what it does to my face.</li>
            <li> We have been using the peel for over a month twice a week.  Both my husband and myself are seeing visible differences in our skin.  This is a great alternative for those unable to take the time for professional peels.  Just be patient because results take 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Everything dealing with my purchase was quick and easy. I love my product!!!! I would definately do business with again.</li>
            <li> I use it about one a week and have noticed the difference in my skin. Less flakiness and a more even skin tone. Does sting a little on application, but briefly only, then quickly gone. Have left on for more than 10 minutes by accident with no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> A great product that tingles when it&#x27;s on the skin, and leaves it feeling refreshed and brightened!</li>
            <li> So the product I received did not look like the photo but it appears that murad has changed the packaging for it.  I am no stranger to glycolic peels as I regularly do a 40% and I have zero irritation I put this on my skin and it burned but I kept it on and suffered through it. I definitely have some redness and irritation the day after but I think this is because I am a regular user of retin  a and I didn&#x27;t have s long enough pause of that in between doing this peel. I will definitely try to again in a couple weeks and see what happens. I will update my review after that.  Update: So I tried the peel again last night and no tingling or burning sensation at all? WEIRD. I did stop me retin a for a couple days so maybe that is why? My skin is soft but i am not sure if this thing actually did anything the second time around.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever made. Price is right</li>
            <li> great price and service</li>
            <li> Love all Murad products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is authentic Murad or maybe it is already expired. I have used this product several times and have not seen a difference. It more clogs up my pores than the peel element that it promises.</li>
            <li> My daughter got a bad soccor season tan and I was wondering if I can use it on her to brighten up her skin. She is 5 years old.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so smooth, I would use it ever day but was advise to do 2-3x a week.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working yet.  I do feel a tingling when I use it but haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my melasma.  Product was unsealed so I questioned its authenticity.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and works great.  I&#x27;m a licensed esthetician and ran out of this.  Decided to buy from here.  Not disappointed at all.  Happy clients</li>
            <li> Feels great, not too harsh</li>
            <li> Great mask, it smells nice, skin tingles slightly (in a good way). Much less expensive online vs in Spa.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  Love the Murad line.  Better deal than what I can purchase around here.  Did see improvement in fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love this brand, everything i use is good quality and males my skin look and feel its best.  This product is a more affordable product of murad that makes my skin look more consistent and lessen the appearance of spots.  After several uses i get this glow on my face, and i even get compliments on how good my skin looks!</li>
            <li> I love this product its amazing. I will never go without it again. My sun burn of 15 years  totally faded completely.</li>
            <li> I did really like this product, made my skin look better after the first treatment however I was expecting a little stronger than what it actually was....but if you have a good peel at a salon, this is a great product to keep up with it.</li>
