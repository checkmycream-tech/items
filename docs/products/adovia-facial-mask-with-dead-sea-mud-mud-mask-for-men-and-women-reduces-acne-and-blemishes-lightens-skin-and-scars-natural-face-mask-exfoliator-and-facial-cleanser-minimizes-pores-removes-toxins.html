            <li>It has done some great things for my skin the couple of times I have used it.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a really great product.</li>
            <li>This product is a great product to control and get rid of breakouts, this product firms and tightens my skin, I also use it on my neck, shoulders and chest as during the Spring transition</li>
            <li>I still always gravitate towards these products because I believe in the health properties of mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to try this mask out.</li>
            <li>This mask is really a great find, because it helps to relieve your skin of all the toxins and oils that you don’t need clogging your pores.</li>
            <li>The mask felt great on the face.</li>
            <li>And I feel great about the ingredients instead of using something that has chemicals and dyes in it.</li>

            <li>I have seen great results in the oil control of my skin as well with the blackheads and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not even medications from the dermatologist gave us great results as this product does.</li>
            <li>Lol.</li>
            <li>Which brings me to a great point, no irritation.</li>

            <li>Well it is great..</li>
            <li>The product works great.</li>
            <li>But I tend to like nice smelling products which are probably not all the best things for your skin, so I choose to ignore the mud smell of this mask.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel great</li>

            <li>It arrived in good time and was in great condition.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing my own now too!</li>
            <li>This is a really nice mud mask!  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it does what it claims!</li>
            <li>so I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest products.  </li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it does what it claims!</li>
            <li>I do wish I have their toner and moisturizer to follow with to see more wonderful results.</li>
            <li>My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years, and the fact that my acne is dissipating is a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that it does have a not so pleasant smell when it’s rinsing off.</li>
            <li>It has this great cooling effect which my mother and I find very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is also an easy application on and off the face, which is perfect for a mom of a toddler to use!  </li>
            <li>It was easy to apply a think layer; and it felt wonderful on my face because I used an upward motion as I massaged it into my skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great reputable brand too in the skin care industry!</li>
            <li>.......yes, because of the very good results that I got from using this mud mask and in the end that is what matters most to me.</li>
            <li>So i bought this product hoping it would be something amazing based on all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>good idea.</li>
            <li>and you are good to go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries in about 10 to 15 minutes, so its good if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li>it clears out my pores and fees good after using it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had good experience with their bath salts</li>
            <li>This smells good when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved mud masks, but have avoided them in the winter months</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will suggest friends to try because it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li>The packaging is gorgeous and reminds me of being in a spa with its silver/blue label.</li>
            <li>This one work good for my face</li>
            <li>IT was a really good mask.</li>
            <li>I have to say how much I loved the way my skin felt.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth and awesome!</li>
            <li>you use it, it&#x27;s a good idea to shake and knead the tube to distribute the liquid evenly.  </li>
            <li>and I loved that about it.  </li>
            <li>I’ve found that about 15 minutes is a good amount of time before it starts to flake off.  </li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>My face felt really good after it was all over.</li>
            <li>I loved the mask.  </li>
            <li>This is good for 30 sessions of mud mask that can make you save up - that is not going to the spa anymore spending on those sessions of mud mask therapy.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really really smooth to touch and looks very bright and radiant!</li>
            <li>So, I have been looking for a good product to help me with these issues.</li>
            <li>I have tried this brand before and loved it</li>
            <li>While I think this product is good in itself, it did not help with my break out</li>
            <li>and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>, my face felt so good after using it.</li>
            <li>sure makes your face feel great.</li>
            <li>and i am very very pleased with the results of it.</li>
            <li>: Smell is very potent too: my eyes and nostrils burn and get irritated just by the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>and I was able to get great coverage before spots started drying.</li>
            <li>Once applied it feels very refreshing to my face.  </li>
            <li>Since I don’t put that on my list of priorities, I do it on my own when I can find a good one.</li>
            <li>There is good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; The mask spreads nicely and that&#x27;s allowed me to use less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li>Its not often that I am Impressed right from the start with a product.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice mud mask and has some really great things I love about it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>

            <li>It dries quickly</li>
            <li>Adovia Facial Mask is perfect for those days when coming back from work and feeling the pimples growing on my face.</li>
            <li>I sometimes add baking soda to my cleanser to get a mild exfoliating treatment out of it and that is what I would compare the grit size/texture to - baking soda.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft after using and lovely to touch.</li>
            <li>If I got a &amp;#34;blinder&amp;#34;, those pimples that can&#x27;t make-up their mind about coming up all the way or going away, no problem as the mask&#x27;s influence made them decide really quickly.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to wash off and my face feels so soft after using the mask!</li>
            <li>You have to first clean your skin, and I used soothing toner to do that, and then apply the mask on clean</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Mask was easy to apply and remove - not very thick like so masks and washed off easily without a need to scrub</li>
            <li>It comes off with a washcloth and warm water, and you can instantly see a significant difference in your skin upon washing it off.  </li>
            <li>It was just an overall very refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is completely natural compared to many other masks out in the market.</li>
            <li>This is LITERALLY my new favorite thing</li>
            <li>Leave it on for between 20-30 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water and finally splashing some cool water on your face to help close your pores.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really a scent and it rubs on easily.</li>
            <li>it actually makes my face feel great &amp; fresh, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have loved every single thing in the Adovia line from their soap to their shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This seller is soliciting positive reviews by giving away free products at a beauty bloggers site called Tomoson.com&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>but this one has definitely become my favorite!</li>
            <li>When has this product been my whole life!!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my face immediately after the first use!</li>
            <li>My wife loves the stuff after the first use!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent which is a plus and goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>love how it leaves my face feeling super soft after each use</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t get really tight which is great.</li>
            <li>considering most mud masks are really goopy and don&#x27;t spread very evenly, this was actually pretty smooth</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing and my pores on my nose (my problem area) had the same clean, polished effect that I gain from using a good microdermabrasion product or those other hefty &#x27;fierce&#x27; clays that I was just mentioning.</li>
            <li>Of course I totally recommend it for anyone who wants clean, beautiful, soft skin, trust me</li>
            <li>I have used different masks before, but this is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li>Very smelly face mask;leaves a huge ring in the tub if you use it in the bath; I just haven&#x27;t seen any difference with the product that would make me buy it again..</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell of it, which is just a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I did notice my skin looked very radiant and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with this natural dead sea mud mask from Adovia.</li>
            <li>I am happy to recieve the Avodia dead sea mask to review.</li>
            <li>My whole face was smooth, my pores looked smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their quality is amazing and this product is no different.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel great after using the Dead Sea Mud mask.</li>
            <li>The shipment was incredibly fast (I received this for free to review and ordered it through amazon as though I purchased it), packaging kept the product well protected and the box was not damaged at all.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>Love this, makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product especially for those who do their own facials.</li>
            <li>I honestly would not have thought that this supple clay would have had the same effect</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to people who love natural products.</li>
            <li>It gives me that fresh matte finish with the tighter pores and not shine.</li>
            <li>It also makes my skin more clear and radiant.</li>

            <li>This mud mask is refreshing and worked well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very seldom do I find a product that exceeds my expectations to the point of being in love with the product after the first use, but that is exactly the case with this mask.</li>
            <li>I know they would be well worth it.</li>

            <li>I adore face masks and have fun experimenting with them.</li>
            <li>My moisturizer glided on like a dream and absorbed well into the skin after.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin either like many products do.</li>
            <li>I then applied Adovia night &amp; eye cream which was absorbed into my skin making it feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>The top layer begin to dry very quickly, so you have to apply it somewhat quickly.</li>

            <li>I was sent this for review, however I only express my honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li>I am using it to clear and prevent my skin from irritation related to a contact dermatitis on my shoulders and it works great.</li>
            <li>I love this product effect on my mature skin removing impurities, aiding the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adovia Mineral Skin Care, is a company that carries everything from masks, creams to even soap bars derived from more kinder and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>You are worth it, so stick to a schedule</li>

            <li>There is just nothing like that fresh feeling after a mask treatment.</li>
            <li>cant smile or crack all over and flake everywhere</li>
            <li>I did receive a complimentary product in hopes for a review.</li>
            <li>Pores are far tighter and my skin is more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>This was surprisingly gentle and more effective than I honestly expected it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packaging is high quality - this is a gift worthy product, and would make a fantastic addition to a beauty gift</li>
            <li>It is very easy to put on and does not drip or anything, so I am able to go about doing whatever I want without having to worry about making a mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already seen a great improvement in clearer skin and less blackheads!</li>
            <li>I am beyond THRILLED to find such an amazing mask at such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li>My face feels so soft, smooth, and clean after I use this.</li>
            <li>It goes on silkily smooth and leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The mask makes my skin feel clean and definitely clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I used a yogurt mask right after to help with the burn.</li>
            <li>The right face mask makes a world of difference to my skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s got the right ingredients and that it is working</li>
            <li>I love masks and typically spend a good amount on all of my skin care products since I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The tube has A LOT of product in it, so I will be able to enjoy my masks for a long time.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a medium consistency but very easy to see if you are putting enough on.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft and clean!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been all that great at using as little as possible :)</li>
            <li>But seriously if you want something that feels great on your face and makes it feel clean than I tell ya</li>
            <li>Since my better half tends to use these mud masks more than me, these are her observations.  </li>
            <li>I feel like this is the same idea, but it&#x27;s already mixed up for you, you can apply much thinner, and I cannot even express how incredible your face feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Have had it for a week, so not that long, but the texture feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li>It is always such a refreshing feeling to get a facial with some kind of face mask.</li>
            <li>This is one product I can honestly say I would like to keep in my mask rotation for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clear it completely, but yes, it sure does help!  </li>
            <li>I went with this one due to  reviewers posts describing a pleasant smell, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The Adovia purifying dead sea mud mask is luxurious and rich and absorbed nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and washes off easily.</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>Excellent dead sea mud facial mask!</li>
            <li>My skin felt much firmer after rinsing off (use a cool splash of water after &amp; really see your pores tighten up!)</li>
            <li>When I washed it off it came off easily and my skin felt soft, suptle and revitalized.</li>
            <li>it dries quickly and it smells and feels very purifying.</li>
            <li>The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is a great mask!  </li>
            <li>I loved using this product it renewed my skin and made it so soft only thing was the smell while washing it off</li>
            <li>This has to be the best Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend if you love that fresh feeling after a mask.</li>
            <li>I felt a pleasant tightening as it dried.</li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The mask does not carry any heavy scent (barely detected any scent at all, which is perfect for me), and has a nice, thick texture that was relatively easy to apply to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Right after use, your skin not only feels smooth, but glows radiantly!</li>
            <li>while I did receive this product in order to facilitate a review of it, the above thoughts are my own honest opinion of the product and I am looking into other Adovia products to add to my skin care regime!</li>
            <li>it thank you very much</li>
            <li>This mud mask is very gentle compared to another I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My skin was very warm after and flushed/reddened.....and that did last several hours.  </li>
            <li>It dries very fast and is not the easiest to spread.</li>
            <li>I like this very much and would buy again.</li>
            <li>The Adovia brand was very gentle and when I washed it off</li>
            <li>Pretty good for those who have a very active day being in all types of places that may carry dirt and germs harmful to your face.</li>
            <li>mask really hit the spot for me as far as a quick but comfortable mask to wear during a bath or weekly.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li>when I washed off my face I could feel all the impurities on my face gone left my skin feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li>This is a real nice product, very thick, goes on easliy.</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I didn&#x27;t suffer from any redness or itching as I have with certain masks in the past.</li>
            <li>Effective, affordable, large long lasting tube, and chemical free!  </li>
            <li>everyone should have this mud mask especially men who work outside in the elements this mud mask would be amazing and cleanse all the toxins from the day off of your face !</li>
            <li>I bought this mask for my mother and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>(I know I should have done that first)</li>
            <li>However, after my first application, my skin tone was revived.  </li>
            <li>When I went to squeeze the tube for the first time, the crimped end blew apart.</li>
            <li>I have never been an avid user of mud mask</li>
            <li>I first of all splashed water on my face to remove the mask, then used a bath cloth to wipe away any that remained.  </li>
            <li>how smooth and clear it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what is it meant to do.</li>
            <li>It definitely seems to work with minimizing my pores and I love how my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li>but it is very tolerable and definately worth the results.</li>
            <li>My pores are smaller, and my skin tone is definitely more even.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and clear skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have blackheads on my nose, big pores on top of cheek bones.</li>
            <li>After using it for the last two weeks, my skin is a bit more clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to run out definitely buying more.</li>
            <li>After it was washed off my face was extremely soft and smooth and I no longer had redness in my face</li>
            <li>It makes my all skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li>When I first received this product in the mail, I noticed that even though the Amazon outer packaging was undamaged, but the box was damaged.  </li>
            <li>Actually seems to make my skin feel better.</li>
            <li>I use this product at least 3 times per week, and it does a great job removing the dirt &amp; oil.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised at how smooth and creamy</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, again, since using this mask, my nose has STAYED smooth and clear, and YES even my pores seemed to have shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, the first time I used it, I only remembered to go rinse it off because I had set a timer on my phone - if I had not, I likely would not have remembered because it is so comfortable -</li>
            <li>I will reorder this product many times in the future!</li>
            <li>I had no weird tingling, itching, or tightening.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use of this product the results were immediate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MANY different face masks (mud/clay/pumpkin/etc.)</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Nothing but soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>or maybe I just notice them more, but in any case, they looked smaller to me.</li>
            <li>This is the first mask I have ever used that lived up to its promises.  </li>
            <li>first two times I used it, I thought it was breaking me out.  </li>
            <li>After the first week, I would have probably given it a 4.</li>
            <li>First off I wash my face with water</li>
            <li>When the mask first touch my face</li>
            <li>For example when you eat pepper for the first time and it starts to burn your mouth</li>
            <li>well that’s how it felt when I first had the mask on my face.</li>
            <li>Unlike many people who reviewed this product, I actually purchased this.</li>
            <li>First impression</li>
            <li>This is my FIRST time</li>
            <li>They may think you&#x27;re nuts at first</li>
            <li>Really made my skin feel rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW, they did increased the prices recently, but I know there is nothing better for us than Adovia.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today and I like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>that facial mask you recommended, can I use it more than once a week?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The more religious you are about using it and by this</li>
            <li>I had no weird tingling, itching, or tightening.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>love facial masks</li>
            <li>Things such as it having many of the minerals and healing properties.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the mask</li>
            <li>But... I opened the top for the first time and as I squeezed the tube, the back of the tube EXPLODED.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a mud mask.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have tried that comes in a squirt tube.  </li>
            <li>The mask leaves the face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes in a tube and is already mixed</li>
            <li>I love trying all different types.</li>
            <li>Overall, a really good mud mask that really does help clear the skin without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have heard good things about dead sea mud helping.</li>
            <li>I really loved this Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>Only suggestion I can make right now is to be more descriptive with how much you&#x27;re supposed to use.</li>
            <li>After the mask is completely dry, rinse with warm water in gentle circles, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>It dried quickly, and I rinse it with a wash cloth and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear, youthful, and refreshed when I use it!!!!</li>
            <li>it leaves my legs feeling very smooth and cleared my psoriasis to half of what they originally were.</li>
            <li>So i received this today after only waiting 2 days and heard so many positive reviews that i figured I&#x27;d give it a go tonight.</li>
            <li>I use it a couple times a week and noticed a positive difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>My skin felt really soft and smooth and pores did not seem as large.  </li>
            <li>Also, they offer an awesome money back guarantee if you are not satisfied for any reason, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Other times when I have time, I leave the mask on longer - and have my own &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am so excited to find an all natural combination of Pro-Vitamins B5 and E that rejuvenates and refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li>It feels very gentle and pure.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early at this point to say what long term benefits I will gain from using this product, but right off the bat my skin was softer after using it and had a nice &#x27;glow&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>On her legs is where she has it the worst and since using this product along with a great moisturizer we have seen incredible results.</li>
            <li>After the wash my face felt clean but soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and felt clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>after washing it off it felt soft and clean but i still needed to moisturize.</li>
            <li>After using this product to clean and nourish my skin, my sensitive and combination skin feels soothed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have received a sample of Adovia Purifying Mud Mask recently, and I am so glad to be finally ready to post a review about</li>
            <li>If you can achieve the same effect by applying something more gentle on your skin, why not?</li>
            <li>The mask was a little watery at first, but I shook the bottle really good to mix the separated liquid back into the mud mask before applying it the times after, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I’m pretty certain</li>
            <li>I’m pretty certain</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just make sure I have time to clean up from the mess</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use - no long drawn out treatment process.</li>
            <li>Skin feels brighter, super soft, as well as moisturized!  </li>
            <li>The package came right on time, it was intact, and the packaging was just as you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li>I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
            <li>No matter where applied, I got positive results that lasted.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth, not rough.</li>
            <li>;) haha</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this mud, it was very clinical.  </li>
            <li>Many hours later, my face still feels really soft and &#x27;fresh&#x27;</li>
            <li>With a warm face towel I began simply removing the mud and finished with a few splashes to the face to make sure I rinse everything.</li>
            <li>Love this mask, it&#x27;s super creamy but has a slight scrub from the salt.</li>
            <li>I was only able to use the mask that one time, and it was fairly decent.</li>
            <li>have tried many other mud masks, but this one is different for sure.  </li>
            <li>mask went on very smooth and dried rather quickly.</li>
            <li>The directions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, but did not experience any burning, itchyness or eye irritation.</li>
            <li>I have (yikes...even at 31) acne prone skin that tends to be oily with dry patches in the winter and summer mostly.</li>
            <li>apply, let dry and rinse off and love your renewed skin.</li>
            <li>After using this mask, I notice my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure they don&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting it off of my skin was not as easy as simply, &amp;#34;rinising&amp;#34; it off.</li>
            <li>The seal on the top of the tube split causing it to leak out or dry up.</li>
            <li>When I spoke to the customer care, Sharon said Mud mask will make me more dry and that it may not be for me.</li>
            <li>Most people apply masks, allow them to dry for 20 to 30 minutes, and then rinse.</li>
            <li>After more than 20 minutes, I washed it off with lukewarm water and pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell odd and felt nice upon application.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a acne/blemish product that didn&#x27;t completely dry you out or didn&#x27;t cause more blemishes in the end.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>after awhile the numbness went away leaving my skin nice and soft, but it was still a bit strange.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne, however; I do have large pores and this is like a day at the spa.</li>
            <li>It boosts cell renewal, revitalizes your skin and tightens those pesky large pores.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the pure mud as well.  </li>
            <li>My face feels really nice and fresh after using the product, though longer term use will be needed to see if there is any long lasting affects.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that this is my new favorite facial mask and that I adding it into my skin routine</li>
            <li>Love my new facial mask!</li>
            <li>As a dead see products lover I really like this facial mask, it works great and leaves the skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>In less than a half an hour, I can complete a wonderful spa treatment right at home</li>
            <li>No scent really, just fresh, soft skin!</li>

            <li>First thing is they are a bit pricey, but not so much as many other fancy products in the market</li>
            <li>This product seemed very high quality.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry flaky skin and fed up of trying so many products and spending thousands of $$$.</li>
            <li>Nice little tingle while it&#x27;s drying and tightens up.</li>
            <li>Once off, though, my skin felt really smooth and my pores were noticeably smaller - my pores are usually really large -</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin, it smells nice, easy to wash off, helped with my dark spots which I have a lot off.</li>
            <li>I found that this makes a really good spot treatment as well because when the mask dries it becomes really hard and does not come off while</li>
            <li>This huge tube will last you forever</li>
            <li>I put it on before getting in the shower, and do something while it dries (make the bed, change out the laundry, get my clothes ready - anything really - 10 minutes goes by fast) then jump in the shower to rinse off.  </li>
            <li>am a huge fan of mud masks, and have tried a ton of different kinds.  </li>
            <li>Well, I paid for my product and I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I notice it is so much softer, it is addressing some problems with clogged pores, etc.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, I say absolutely go for it.</li>
            <li>It helps restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Great for someone who has acne or very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>My wife enjoys this product immensely, and her son is smooth and radiant after use.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mud mask.</li>
            <li>it makes my face soft and calm after use.</li>
            <li>I was so tired before applying the mask, but when I took it off, I felt like I have had a great rest.</li>
            <li>My skin is much clearer after two uses.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Left my skin feeling smooth and tightened.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate using quality beauty products and this mud mask has proven to be just that to me.</li>
            <li>It is ready to use.</li>
            <li>You get ready to use mud mask.</li>
            <li>Im free to write my personal experience.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC Facial Mask!  </li>
            <li>I was able to evenly apply it and also remove from my fingers with minimal issue.</li>
            <li>A &amp;#34;thin layer&amp;#34; is pretty general and can be interpreted many different ways.</li>
            <li>mud mask has become my go-to because of the benefits, and how much of an improvement I have seen in my skin since I started using this product just once a week.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle mask to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much improvement on my skin either.</li>
            <li>BUT TOO MUCH HASSLE.</li>
            <li>thanks so much, will be putting up the review this week on my blog.</li>
            <li>Haha....</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>It was also gentle on my face, and there was NO drying of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It also claims it leaves skin radiant, younger looking, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got it for the “radiant, younger looking, and smooth” claim</li>
            <li>I put it on and really forgot about</li>
            <li>I have a really oily T-zone and cystic acne</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>I really don know if its working or not</li>
            <li>But my skin felt great afterwards and didn&#x27;t feel abrasive or irritating at all.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which I appreciate.</li>
            <li>When I received this product, I noticed the consistency was very watery and dilluted.</li>
            <li>I used it anyways and did not think much of it.</li>
            <li>This is unacceptable of Adovia to send a product like this to those who actually PAY for it instead of receiving it for free.</li>
            <li>but it really does work well for that.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product really is like mudd.</li>
            <li>Very upscale feel with the packaging.</li>
            <li>It came in a tub which is much messier.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really cant see the effect....</li>
            <li>If the seller can keep the price at a reasonable rate I would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li>It was also very itchy around my jawline.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed a difference in my skin since using this mask.  </li>
            <li>It works really well at minimizing my pores and helps keep my face from breaking out.  </li>
            <li>It is not drying and is actually moisturizing and and has vitamin c to help fight free radicals.</li>
            <li>This facial mask was free.  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Adovia.  </li>
            <li>I received the above product(s) free of charge from Adovia.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>It also claims it leaves skin radiant, younger looking, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got it for the “radiant, younger looking, and smooth” claim</li>
            <li>I put it on and really forgot about it.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t notice anything</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really thought much of buying a mud mask again.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the exfoliating that it does.</li>
            <li>I had smaller pores, my face felt smooth and I never had any issues with skin reactions etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>with all that, I have been very weary to purchase a product.</li>
            <li>It is not gone, but it is much lighter and I have fewer breakouts than before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial mask to add to their facial cleaning routine!</li>
            <li>It went on smooth and there was a brief tingle</li>
            <li>It really looks like mud.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really like the Adovia Mud Mask,</li>
            <li>but for the whole benefit.  </li>
            <li>I really like this mask</li>
            <li>My skin was so smooth, soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d given up on any facial masks, as I have incredibly sensitive skin, and most skin care products just seem to rip my face up--</li>
            <li>I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE them all.</li>
            <li>I love that this mask is all natural and you can actually recognize &amp; pronounce the ingredients!</li>
            <li>Even if they are being completely honest, I still feel there will be a heavy bias.</li>
            <li>but this one left it clarified and touch-ably soft :)</li>
            <li>Kind of messy to use, but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tiny bumps where the oil glands kind of get inflamed, not pimples, but tiny bumps.  </li>
            <li>It comes out of the tube with a thick consistency and has good coverage as it goes on.</li>
            <li>I do not have a tight pulling feeling as I have experienced with other masks and it still allows elasticity in my face when I talk or smile.</li>
            <li>This product has some very powerful amazing ingredients in it, containing dead sea water, dead sea mud, chamomile, aloe, and sunflower which are only some of the amazing ingredients.</li>
            <li>It spread very easily and tingled slightly while drying.</li>
            <li>So just slight movement of your face will loosen up the mask and cause specks to shed very easily.</li>
            <li>I think I always thought in the past that you need that to get clean - but this mask leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy and all the extra &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; is gone!  </li>
            <li>this stuff makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li>The mask is soothing in that it goes on smooth and cool, has a slight grit to the texture but not overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Beeswax, Dead Sea water/mud, papaya extract, Aloe Vera gel, vitamins a and c, camomile,  sunflower seed and jojoba oil, among other incredibly moisturizing ingredients make this a mask that every girl should have in her skin care regime.</li>
            <li>This product gently tightened, then after rinsing left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It washed off fairly easy and left our faces feeling very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it causes my pimples to be removed and start the next day fresh!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth and my pores are barely visible.</li>
            <li>but it does really deep clean them so they are not so aparent.</li>
            <li>It says to use on clean skin, so I washed my face beforehand, but then I got a couple pimples on my forehead the next day.</li>
            <li>or when I feel I need a deep clean on my face to unclog my pores.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the ingredient in their active state and allows more of that &amp;#34;gentle pulling&amp;#34; and purifying of the skin&#x27;s surface to take place.</li>
            <li>I rarely apply mud mask to my face and the latest I can remember will be 6 months ago when I bought a small sachet in Target just to try it out.</li>
            <li>For the most part my skin is normal, without breakouts, and not really oily.</li>
            <li>Once mixed well, though, I found it had a pleasant texture and little to no odor.</li>
            <li>After it dried, the mask washed off very easily with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>After seeing the effects that the Adovia Dead Sea Facial Mask had on myself, my husband, my son and daughter, I would love to own the entire line of products.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see how far it goes; a little provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I prefer more of a thicker, clay type mask because it is easier to apply and you can feel that you have product on your face; where as Adovia is more on the watery side and applying it to your face makes you feel like youve hardly put enough.</li>
            <li>well I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been missing out on such a wonderful product for so long !!!</li>
            <li>I was excited when I received this offer, when it arrived the packaging was great, I was shocked at how big of a free sample I had gotten.</li>
            <li>It was a great mask, it actually did make my face feel firm and was really soft after application.</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is way more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I received this, I was surprised at the packaging of the product.</li>
            <li>My face felt super soft, but not tight or irritated.</li>
            <li>and I really appreciate that since I live in a desert climate.</li>
            <li>I like that because it makes my skin feel really refreshed and &#x27;new&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This product has really helped with the breakouts as well as preventing new ones.</li>
            <li>It brought some below the surface debris closer to the surface and allowed me to easily extract them without roughly squeezing and bruising my face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is silly, but I love the color of this mask. :)</li>
            <li>It left my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth (just a nice thin layer and spreads well!)</li>
            <li>The top closure blew open the last time I used it</li>
            <li>I used this product every few days to keep my face looking fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li>It left my skin moist, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t exactly have consistent face care regime</li>
            <li>This Mud Mask Tightens and Purifies Pores leaving a Clear, Smooth &amp; Younger Looking Complexion</li>
            <li>I did apply a moisturizer afterwards and now my skin is extra smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a creamy medicated face wash, and only costs 10 bucks (and will last more than a month).</li>
            <li>I do hate this purging experience, but it’s nice to know that the product is working and that my pores are getting a good cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get as unbearably tight as other masks I have experienced</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how it does for my skin over the long haul.  </li>
            <li>From the very FIRST use this mask left me in awe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and looks brighter!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend and I will be buying again</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for all the skin tone.</li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth and moisturized,  my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I left my mask on for 15 minutes (it turned into a nice chalky earthy green color when it dried) and rinsed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I find this very moisturizing for a mud mask which is a good thing since the one I normally use tends to dry my skin out no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li>It also works great for Eczema and Psoriasis as well due to Dead Sea salt and mud known properties that help relieve Eczema, Psoriasis and acne symptoms.</li>
            <li>The mask goes on cool and leaves my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated without the mask feeling uncomfortably tight or tingly.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soooooo soft and refreshed after using!!</li>
            <li>It does smell a little funky like most mud masks do.</li>
            <li>If it has been sitting for a little while, make sure to shake the tube before using or it may separate and be watery looking.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this particular mask is that it spreads like butter and does not crack or become uncomfortable when drying.</li>
            <li>This facial mask draws out impurities, toxins and excess oils leaving your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I love all of the natural ingredients in this product, and this is a great mud facial that I can afford at home without the expensive spa facials that can cost over $100 each!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and get evenly unlike other masks I have used.</li>
            <li>I LOVE Adovia products, and this was in no way a let down!</li>
            <li>I am happy to report that I had NOT ONE ill side effect of using this product.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say I was sooo happy about that because I had pore strips on my shopping list.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an intense pore cleanser that is not harsh and drying.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and some problems with adult acne and this product has really made a difference.</li>
            <li>Dead Sea mud has so many uses and has been used in ancient healing practices.</li>
            <li>feeling I normally get from using masks.  </li>
            <li>All of the sudden my face was looking so fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After a few more uses my skin cleared up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally use a mud mask, but I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>Most of us know the benefits of skin products containing Dead Sea Mud.</li>
            <li>Love the way this felt on my face as it dried and</li>
            <li>I have tried many others, only to have them dry out my face.  </li>
            <li>He came off easily and left my skin feeling tighter and the pores on my nose looked smaller.  </li>
            <li>Thick and a little gritty, this goes on nicely and makes my skin feel amazing after I wash it off.</li>
            <li>Be sure to knead the product a little before opening and trying to apply for the first time; then hopefully you won&#x27;t squeeze out tons of watery liquid before actually getting the mud mask out.</li>
            <li>The price may seem a little steep, but for the amount you get it is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting a large and for the lack of word, fat container filled with dead sea mud mask goodness.</li>
            <li>When I washed the mud off my skin felt extremely hydrated and so silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to put a moisturizer on.</li>
            <li>I felt like a new me.</li>
            <li>Just thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li>This is a new must have in my beauty collection.</li>
            <li>mask contains aloe vera, so my skin felt moisturized instead of super dry, like how it feels after using a homemade clay mask.</li>
            <li>I have larger pores, so I try to use a mask at least once a week, twice on a good week.</li>
            <li>I ordered it before but the free one I received seemed to have a different texture, slightly gritty and with a shiny emollient (probably the olive oil).</li>
            <li>This Adovia Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask arrived quickly in a nice box.</li>
            <li>I rinsed it with warm water after the mask had dried and it left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Rinsed off clean - again with a very mild exfoliating feeling and my skin did not feel tight, dry or sensitive in any way.  </li>
            <li>it felt cool and nice on my burn and definitely made it less red instantly after removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use mud masks about 3 times a week and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It did however leave my skin very, very soft.</li>
            <li>I deal with acne prone skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive about my skin</li>
            <li>My skin was very soft and it took a lot of the oil out.</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin prone to acne</li>
            <li>Not with Adovia; my skin was very soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves skin very soft am hoping with time will diminish scars.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I highly recommend a cautionary amount whenever first trying new products if you have sensitive skin, especially if you have plans for that evening.</li>
            <li>I used to struggle with it as a teen, and then it was fine in my 20s and early 30s with the occasional bump here and there.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I found that this mask made my face burn a little bit in my more sensitive areas (i.e. around the nose).</li>
            <li>Has helped clear my acne!</li>
            <li>there is usually something newer &amp; better out there).</li>
            <li>Noticed a big difference in the first use.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel as soft as a baby!</li>
            <li>My skin was so so soft &amp; silky to touch after my 1st treatment!  </li>
            <li>so soft!</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this mask is that it comes in a big squeeze tube bottle, so you have enough to last you a while.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants a relaxing hour or so!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>My skin looked radiant and felt soft for days!  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to mention it because you might not want to try it for the first time before a big date or heading off to a wedding!</li>
            <li>I would suggest after you have applied the mask to use a small fan brush to make sure it is even.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and I am constantly buying it for other people to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle is pretty big</li>
            <li>Love these dead sea products!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on super smoothly, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have always been a huge fan of products from the dead sea, so that&#x27;s the main reason why I got this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken care with my skin and frequently try new products.</li>
            <li>As I have sensitive, oily skin, I am always cautious about trying new products for my face.  </li>
            <li>It also helps skin to look new and young.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my face smooth and less oily.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily and I didnt feel like it dried my skin out.</li>
            <li>I think I just didn&#x27;t manage to clean it off completely and some residue stayed on my skin for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, since it comes in a tube, rather than an open container, it will last longer.</li>
            <li>I tried the mask on my hand first (in case of reaction) - it left my hand soft and supple with no itchiness.</li>
            <li>The labeling is very clear and professional looking.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple times so far and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>The tube makes it very easy to get just the right amount, as you only need a thin layer.</li>
            <li>Do not use a white or light towel to dry your face, unless you know this stuff is all off,  It stained the material.</li>
            <li>My skin is definitely smoother, my acne breakouts have calmed down (not gone completely but way better), and my face is moisturized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine, just a little hurting to sensitive skin</li>
            <li>a fair and sensitive skinned girl, I am always skeptical about trying new products.</li>
            <li>The mud mask spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry.</li>
            <li>where I have been using the ADOVIA Purifying Mud Mask for a month now and there is a clear difference.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it twice a week, for 10 mins to clear out any impurities with your skin.</li>
            <li>The grittiness of the mask is just enough of a gentle exfoliator for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have only tried this once, but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, but it seems to clear that up a bit as well.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with acne since my early adulthood and struggled to find product that was gentle enough on the skin but that reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li>It does such a great job that I almost feel guilty applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I like getting maybe 1 pimple and then having clear skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so soft and refreshed after using.</li>
            <li>The 13 year old has used it as well</li>
            <li>It cleared my skin &amp; made it feel soft.  </li>
            <li>mud mask is 100 natural  detoxifier and purifier that come from sea.</li>
            <li>It really cleans deeply.</li>
            <li>feels soft after use.</li>
            <li>Although I can&#x27;t really say that I noticed any difference in the appearance of my skin on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>The only problem, which isn’t really a problem at all is that it’s a bit itchy and if you accidentally itch your face or where ever you’ve put it on, the ‘dust’ from the mask goes everywhere.</li>
            <li>As far as removing blackheads, this product doesnt Cut it for me.</li>
            <li>This mud mask is all natural.</li>
            <li>Once rinsed off, it reveals healthier, glowing skin that is so soft</li>
            <li>Now, if you have oily, or sensitive skin, I am going to recommend this to you.</li>
            <li>I am a 41-year-old Caucasian female with very oily skin and enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li>ADOVIA Fast forward 3 weeks later</li>
            <li>I WILL CONTINUE TO USE MY OLD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>would absolutely have waited for an exchange but no such option is given here.</li>
            <li>Even though the mud feels heavy in your hands, it feels really light and airy on your face.</li>
            <li>but it makes my face feel soft as a consolation</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After removing the mask my skin feels really soft and moist.</li>
            <li>Skin is soft and hydrated after use.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft and wasn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Here are my thoughts so far on this one.</li>
            <li>Overall I really like this product and will continue to use it on a weekly basis since I like the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>and you skin will feel soft and radiant like a baby.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, hyper pigmented skin and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>No harsh smells or redness....</li>
            <li>This mask leaves your skin feeling soft and revitalised</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m done with my mask my face feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>were completely gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not bothered by that because I didn&#x27;t have rash or irritation afterwards even if I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This mask left my skin feeling really hydrated afterwards which is something I didn&#x27;t expect,</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to using this a couple of more times in the next few weeks and updating my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just love “Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask” despite</li>
            <li>I did see a small difference in reducing my breakouts, but I can buy a mask for less than a fifth of the price that not only gives me much better results as far as reducing acne, but it makes my skin glow, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>When I removed it, my skin felt tight and clean, and completely un-irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>last time I did this mask, my skin felt oily and gross, like it does right before a breakout.</li>
            <li>I mean, my nose was smoother to the touch and, upon close inspection, all but free of blackheads!</li>
            <li>most likely due to the amount of essential oils in it.</li>
            <li>It rinses off easily without excessive scrubbing.</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling soft, clear and vibrant.</li>
            <li>but it is also oily certain times of the month, and then super dry during other times.</li>
            <li>I tried this product on my hands which were super dry and red from this winter.</li>
            <li>It has been great way to defunk my skin after a long cold winter and get ready for summer.</li>
            <li>I like how after you have let it sit on your face for the time as directed that you can add a bit of water and gently use it to further give your face an exfoliation treatment like no other.  </li>
            <li>During the first few uses of this mask you will notice a few more breakouts.</li>
            <li>Those always tighten up, and I can&#x27;t smile, or even say anything, this mask on the other hand is like the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree mask.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve used other Dead Sea mus before on my face and this just didn&#x27;t work quite the same magic.</li>
            <li>I am constantly having to deal with black heads and trying to exfoliate to keep my nose looking smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>Clean up is messy as well.</li>
            <li>I have been having some serious issues with breaking out and noticing that my pores are more visible than I would like them to be.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and have to be careful with the products I use to avoid breaking out in hives.</li>
            <li>This is nice because with my rosacea it usually feels rough.</li>
            <li>I really love that this mud is in a convenient squeeze tube that makes applying it that much easier and less messy.</li>
            <li>nose is the main spot on my face with big pores.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a decent mask for the price.</li>
            <li>highly, highly recommend this facial mask as a part of your weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li>This product comes in high quality packaging and is packed with terrific ingredients for your skin.  </li>
            <li>thought that that type of fierce ultra drying of the clay was required in order to just as fiercely draw out the excess oils, toxins, black heads, acne, white heads, free clogged pores etc, etc., from the skin</li>
            <li>And its just not new but better because of its dead sea mineral properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The very first time I used the product, I made a mess however.</li>
            <li>One is always a bit skeptical when a skincare product claIms to have so very many beneficial properties...and mud?</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with the product&#x27;s consistency and it&#x27;s wet enough to make application a cinch but not so wet that I am chasing it.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy facial masks</li>
            <li>I enjoyed Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask and have incorporated it into my ongoing regular beauty routine.  </li>
            <li>As it dried, it felt really cool and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, dries quickly on your face, only squirts out enough for a thin layer (I usually glob too much mask on my face unevenly with other brands), and works with my adult-acne-prone fair, sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li>my skin felt so smooth and soft and not dry and scaly like usual.</li>
            <li>It dried fast on me, telling me that I have very dry skin this winter - my friend&#x27;s face is more oily and it took longer to dry.  </li>
            <li>I was once again looking for a new product when I found Adovia Facial Mud Mask.</li>
            <li>This 5.1 ounce tube is huge and will last a few months if used twice a week.</li>
            <li>very worried it&#x27;s going to dry up.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin meaning some of my skin is oily and some is extremely dry and the mask has really helped to even out my skin.</li>
            <li>Though my skin is dry all the time, this really worked well</li>
            <li>My skin tends to be dry and after using this mask, it was very oily for a couple days.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and are unsure of what to use to clean your face, pick up this Dead Sea Facial Mask.</li>
            <li>This Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>The mask has a light scent and as it dried, you could definitely feel your skin tightening.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick yet easy to spread.  </li>
            <li>This mask dried on quickly on my face.</li>
            <li>It has a thick consistency but goes on easily.</li>
            <li>My face is more clear and it has decreased the redness exponentially.  </li>
            <li>And like I said, a little goes a long way so there is more than enough for it to be used weekly or as needed for quite a while.</li>
            <li>This mask will deliver results like no other.  </li>
            <li>And I saw a major difference in my face after.</li>
            <li>well worth the mess.  </li>
            <li>Hey, forgot to say, the fine lines are gone in a week, you bet and the thicker ones become hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The major concerns that I ran into with my research were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I left it on for about 10 minutes the first time, because I thought it might dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>comes out of the tube in a chalky greyish blue  dry substance, almost as dried mud, ok</li>
            <li>Perhaps the effect may even be better because my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out and in need of urgent moisturizing as it does after using the other ultra drying clays.</li>
            <li>I have used this mask several times over the past few weeks (more than suggested) and I have had positive results every time, no matter my skin issue.</li>
            <li>The end result was soft, supple skin that felt completely clean without feeling dry or tight.  </li>
            <li>I really struggle with dry skin and this product helps remove all the dead, dry skin and leaves my face very fresh and glowing.  </li>
            <li>My face felt smoother and softer to the touch and just generally CLEANER.</li>
            <li>and my skin is finally starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>It left my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;YOU WILL LOOK MUCH OLDER, and extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am over 30 years old, but I still get occasional acne.</li>
            <li>It contains aloe vera to balance the natural level of moisture, and Vitamin C for overall skin health.</li>
            <li>The product does feel s natural and somewhat gritty.</li>
            <li>mask itself is not at all gritty, which was pleasantly unexpected.</li>
            <li>(I left mine on for just over 5 minutes because of my uber sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I am adamant about taking care of my skin and am trying to stave off the inevitable wrinkles I know will come.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest with this mask to make sure you do a thin layer.</li>
            <li>(as air is the enemy) but making sure none falls on the jar&#x27;s rim or worse, on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right after applying it  I can feel the cooling sensation and little tingling on my skin.</li>
            <li>- I break out in hives at the thought of new products, so I am always very careful and hesitant to try new things.  </li>
            <li>And when it does dry, I can definitely feel my face tightening, which I don&#x27;t feel as significantly with other</li>
            <li>My skin remains in that improved state for about three days, so I got more out of the results by doing the &amp;#34;wet treatment&amp;#34;, and it also makes removal easier and less messy.</li>
            <li>I use a lot of masks, usually once a week because I believe they are the only thing that can get your skin deep clean and clear out things that are hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin very soft and really does take all the dead skin off...</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and the usual issues such as fine lines and have difficulty finding a mask that actually works.</li>
            <li>At first it was the same as any other mask:</li>
            <li>I have parts of my skin that are considered sensitive and other normal to even oily in the t-zone area.</li>
            <li>It deep cleanse my pores and left skin extremely soft!</li>
            <li>I do have eczema and psoriasis and it is helping to clear those patches also, which is a blessing since it is unattractive to have dead skin flaking off or building up in certain areas of your face.</li>
            <li>It has not shrunk the few large pores that I have, but it does leave my face feeling soft and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li>but  when putting it on, all I get is the look of a firemen that handled ashes, there is NO  thick layering possible as seen on pictures, no such deep color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many dead sea mud masks and all of them stung a little when applied.  </li>
            <li>I had read many reviews of a few different brands of Dead Sea Mud masks and they all mentioned how great these masks are and how bad the smell is.</li>
            <li>I like the way this product left my facial skin clear and oil-free.  </li>
            <li>I used this item the same day i received it, OMG it left my face feeling so soft and radiant</li>
            <li>The tube is useful, although the tubs are larger, every time you open up the lid, you are drying out the mask, so with a tube, there is much less air getting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 35+ adult male and have had to deal with a sudden break out.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my face, but it does get rid of excess oil.</li>
            <li>Does not completely dry.</li>
            <li>I am bothered because all the 5 star reviews here say that the product is thick, goes on smoothly, has a slightly gritty texture, and not one mention of it stinging my face.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to try this and after removing the mask, its not dry at all.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been looking to test out a new mud mask, I highly recommend giving Adovia Spa&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask a try.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it leaves it very soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>and actually I have not had a major acne break out since using this mask either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when used on regularly we see a major difference in our skin.  </li>
            <li>This did not take long to dry and was quick and easy to rub off (as long as you rinse your washcloth off a few times, it does act a little bit like mud of course).</li>
            <li>also notice that using this on breakouts really dries them out and brings them to a head much quicker - even quicker than my usual benzoyl peroxide spot treatment!</li>
            <li>Mud Mask is made with Pure Dead Sea Mud that has the highest concentration of minerals which is vital for a facial skin treatment glow.</li>
            <li>I thought that was strange because mud masks are supposed to be thick so they can apply on easily.</li>
            <li>I have found that Dead Sea mud, the mud tends to still be as effective as other mud based masks, but tends to give less of the side effects like over drying.</li>
            <li>There is also a 100% money back guarantee so there really isn&#x27;t anything to loose !!</li>
            <li>The first few minutes that I had it on my face</li>
            <li>The previous Adovia mask I purchased before looked exactly as pictured, same color and consistency, this one I just received is completely different.  </li>
            <li>Just be sure to moisturize after you dunce it off since it usually dries my face out a little.</li>
            <li>First I want to give you a little back story.....</li>
            <li>, I know that sounds silly but some masks are so strong they can make your eyes water, this one doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I recommend giving this product a try, the bottle is very heavy which made me feel that it was worth every every cent.</li>
            <li>I saw negative reviews about how it was runny, but having owned the pure dead sea mud, it needs to be noted, that there is a lot of moisture that separates from the mud, so shake or press on the container gently w/o squeezing it too much to allow the moisture to mix back into the mud.  </li>
            <li>She was surprised with this as it didn’t dry her skin as some mud masks do.  </li>
            <li>Now in our family we only use Adovia moisturizing Soap, Adovia day moisturizing cream, mud mask, hand cream (professional size for year long).</li>
            <li>The mud mask dries fast, it feels weird, but cool as well.</li>
            <li>I first heard of Dead Sea Salts and Mud via one of those daily talk shows</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical when I first removed the top and saw the color, a brown mud color.  </li>
            <li>The next week I used it, the same firming was there, but the redness wasn&#x27;t as noticeable...and the 3rd week, it was barely a pinkness to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I did not experience any of the redness that I normally do with other masks.</li>
            <li>Just a little- enough to get a little more attention to my oily days, and I don&#x27;t need to scrub on the dry days.</li>
            <li>It does stain white towels and unless you use oxiclean/and bleach with hot water it will be hard to remove so try using an old towel or maybe facial wipe?</li>
            <li>It never really looks dry, so you just have to gently touch it with your fingers to see if there is any transfer.</li>
            <li>You only need a thin layer, smooths on easily</li>
            <li>I have never used a mud mask that&#x27;s is not dry, but has the same cleaning efx of a traditional mud mask.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, starts to work on your impurities almost instantly, smells a little like mud (obviously) and has a slight tingle factor as it works its magic!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure Dead Sea minerals and vegan.</li>
            <li>It smells a little funky, but it works and that to me serves the whole purpose.</li>
            <li>my pores and blackheads are really getting small and my acne is gone, but for one or two little bumps that aren&#x27;t very noticeable!</li>
            <li>Since there is no way to contact the seller to report an issue &amp;#34;perhaps a bad batch&amp;#34;, no link to the manufactures website to even ASK if it&#x27;s meant to be like this, I cannot in good faith recommenced this despite promotional pricing.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It has done some great things for my skin the couple of times I have used it.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a really great product.</li>
            <li> This product is a great product to control and get rid of breakouts, this product firms and tightens my skin, I also use it on my neck, shoulders and chest as during the Spring transition</li>
            <li> I still always gravitate towards these products because I believe in the health properties of mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to try this mask out.</li>
            <li> This mask is really a great find, because it helps to relieve your skin of all the toxins and oils that you don’t need clogging your pores.</li>
            <li> The mask felt great on the face.</li>
            <li> And I feel great about the ingredients instead of using something that has chemicals and dyes in it.</li>
            <li> its one of the great products that i would recommend.</li>

            <li> I have seen great results in the oil control of my skin as well with the blackheads and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not even medications from the dermatologist gave us great results as this product does.</li>
            <li> Lol.</li>
            <li> Which brings me to a great point, no irritation.</li>

            <li> Well it is great..</li>
            <li> The product works great.</li>
            <li> But I tend to like nice smelling products which are probably not all the best things for your skin, so I choose to ignore the mud smell of this mask.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> This is a really nice mud mask!  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it does what it claims!</li>
            <li> so I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest products.  </li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it does what it claims!</li>
            <li> I do wish I have their toner and moisturizer to follow with to see more wonderful results.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years, and the fact that my acne is dissipating is a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that it does have a not so pleasant smell when it’s rinsing off.</li>
            <li> It has this great cooling effect which my mother and I find very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is also an easy application on and off the face, which is perfect for a mom of a toddler to use!  </li>
            <li> It was easy to apply a think layer; and it felt wonderful on my face because I used an upward motion as I massaged it into my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great reputable brand too in the skin care industry!</li>
            <li> .......yes, because of the very good results that I got from using this mud mask and in the end that is what matters most to me.</li>
            <li> So i bought this product hoping it would be something amazing based on all the great reviews.</li>
            <li> good idea.</li>
            <li> and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries in about 10 to 15 minutes, so its good if you&#x27;re in a hurry.</li>
            <li> it clears out my pores and fees good after using it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had good experience with their bath salts</li>
            <li> This smells good when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved mud masks, but have avoided them in the winter months</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s actually a good thing.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will suggest friends to try because it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li> The packaging is gorgeous and reminds me of being in a spa with its silver/blue label.</li>
            <li> This one work good for my face</li>
            <li> IT was a really good mask.</li>
            <li> I have to say how much I loved the way my skin felt.</li>
            <li> Skin is smooth and awesome!</li>
            <li> you use it, it&#x27;s a good idea to shake and knead the tube to distribute the liquid evenly.  </li>
            <li> and I loved that about it.  </li>
            <li> I’ve found that about 15 minutes is a good amount of time before it starts to flake off.  </li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> My face felt really good after it was all over.</li>
            <li> I loved the mask.  </li>
            <li> This is good for 30 sessions of mud mask that can make you save up - that is not going to the spa anymore spending on those sessions of mud mask therapy.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really really smooth to touch and looks very bright and radiant!</li>
            <li> So, I have been looking for a good product to help me with these issues.</li>
            <li> I have tried this brand before and loved it</li>
            <li> While I think this product is good in itself, it did not help with my break out</li>
            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> , my face felt so good after using it.</li>
            <li> sure makes your face feel great.</li>
            <li> and i am very very pleased with the results of it.</li>
            <li> : Smell is very potent too: my eyes and nostrils burn and get irritated just by the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> and I was able to get great coverage before spots started drying.</li>
            <li> Once applied it feels very refreshing to my face.  </li>
            <li> Since I don’t put that on my list of priorities, I do it on my own when I can find a good one.</li>
            <li> There is good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; The mask spreads nicely and that&#x27;s allowed me to use less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Its not often that I am Impressed right from the start with a product.</li>

            <li> You have to first clean your skin, and I used soothing toner to do that, and then apply the mask on clean</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Mask was easy to apply and remove - not very thick like so masks and washed off easily without a need to scrub</li>
            <li> It comes off with a washcloth and warm water, and you can instantly see a significant difference in your skin upon washing it off.  </li>
            <li> It was just an overall very refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is completely natural compared to many other masks out in the market.</li>
            <li> This is LITERALLY my new favorite thing</li>
            <li> Leave it on for between 20-30 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water and finally splashing some cool water on your face to help close your pores.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really a scent and it rubs on easily.</li>
            <li> it actually makes my face feel great &amp; fresh, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have loved every single thing in the Adovia line from their soap to their shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This seller is soliciting positive reviews by giving away free products at a beauty bloggers site called Tomoson.com&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> but this one has definitely become my favorite!</li>
            <li> When has this product been my whole life!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my face immediately after the first use!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff after the first use!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent which is a plus and goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li> love how it leaves my face feeling super soft after each use</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t get really tight which is great.</li>
            <li> considering most mud masks are really goopy and don&#x27;t spread very evenly, this was actually pretty smooth</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing and my pores on my nose (my problem area) had the same clean, polished effect that I gain from using a good microdermabrasion product or those other hefty &#x27;fierce&#x27; clays that I was just mentioning.</li>
            <li> Of course I totally recommend it for anyone who wants clean, beautiful, soft skin, trust me</li>
            <li> I have used different masks before, but this is by far the best so far.</li>
            <li> Very smelly face mask;leaves a huge ring in the tub if you use it in the bath; I just haven&#x27;t seen any difference with the product that would make me buy it again..</li>
            <li> I also really like the smell of it, which is just a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I did notice my skin looked very radiant and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this natural dead sea mud mask from Adovia.</li>
            <li> I am happy to recieve the Avodia dead sea mask to review.</li>
            <li> My whole face was smooth, my pores looked smaller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their quality is amazing and this product is no different.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel great after using the Dead Sea Mud mask.</li>
            <li> The shipment was incredibly fast (I received this for free to review and ordered it through amazon as though I purchased it), packaging kept the product well protected and the box was not damaged at all.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product especially for those who do their own facials.</li>
            <li> I honestly would not have thought that this supple clay would have had the same effect</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to people who love natural products.</li>
            <li> It gives me that fresh matte finish with the tighter pores and not shine.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin more clear and radiant.</li>

            <li> of the pictures &amp;#34; including their own promo pics&amp;#34; from some reviewers apply to the actual density , liquidity which brings lack of quantity..</li>
            <li> This mud mask is refreshing and worked well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very seldom do I find a product that exceeds my expectations to the point of being in love with the product after the first use, but that is exactly the case with this mask.</li>
            <li> I know they would be well worth it.</li>

            <li> I adore face masks and have fun experimenting with them.</li>
            <li> My moisturizer glided on like a dream and absorbed well into the skin after.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin either like many products do.</li>
            <li> I then applied Adovia night &amp; eye cream which was absorbed into my skin making it feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> The top layer begin to dry very quickly, so you have to apply it somewhat quickly.</li>

            <li> I was sent this for review, however I only express my honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> I am using it to clear and prevent my skin from irritation related to a contact dermatitis on my shoulders and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this product effect on my mature skin removing impurities, aiding the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adovia Mineral Skin Care, is a company that carries everything from masks, creams to even soap bars derived from more kinder and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> You are worth it, so stick to a schedule</li>

            <li> There is just nothing like that fresh feeling after a mask treatment.</li>
            <li> cant smile or crack all over and flake everywhere</li>
            <li> I did receive a complimentary product in hopes for a review.</li>
            <li> Pores are far tighter and my skin is more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li> This was surprisingly gentle and more effective than I honestly expected it to be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The packaging is high quality - this is a gift worthy product, and would make a fantastic addition to a beauty gift</li>
            <li> It is very easy to put on and does not drip or anything, so I am able to go about doing whatever I want without having to worry about making a mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already seen a great improvement in clearer skin and less blackheads!</li>
            <li> I am beyond THRILLED to find such an amazing mask at such a reasonable price!  </li>
            <li> My face feels so soft, smooth, and clean after I use this.</li>
            <li> It goes on silkily smooth and leaves my face feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> The mask makes my skin feel clean and definitely clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I used a yogurt mask right after to help with the burn.</li>
            <li> The right face mask makes a world of difference to my skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s got the right ingredients and that it is working</li>
            <li> I love masks and typically spend a good amount on all of my skin care products since I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The tube has A LOT of product in it, so I will be able to enjoy my masks for a long time.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a medium consistency but very easy to see if you are putting enough on.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and clean!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been all that great at using as little as possible :)</li>
            <li> But seriously if you want something that feels great on your face and makes it feel clean than I tell ya</li>
            <li> Since my better half tends to use these mud masks more than me, these are her observations.  </li>
            <li> I feel like this is the same idea, but it&#x27;s already mixed up for you, you can apply much thinner, and I cannot even express how incredible your face feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Have had it for a week, so not that long, but the texture feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li> It is always such a refreshing feeling to get a facial with some kind of face mask.</li>
            <li> This is one product I can honestly say I would like to keep in my mask rotation for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clear it completely, but yes, it sure does help!  </li>
            <li> I went with this one due to  reviewers posts describing a pleasant smell, and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The Adovia purifying dead sea mud mask is luxurious and rich and absorbed nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> Excellent dead sea mud facial mask!</li>
            <li> My skin felt much firmer after rinsing off (use a cool splash of water after &amp; really see your pores tighten up!)</li>
            <li> When I washed it off it came off easily and my skin felt soft, suptle and revitalized.</li>
            <li> it dries quickly and it smells and feels very purifying.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is a great mask!  </li>
            <li> I loved using this product it renewed my skin and made it so soft only thing was the smell while washing it off</li>
            <li> This has to be the best Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend if you love that fresh feeling after a mask.</li>
            <li> I felt a pleasant tightening as it dried.</li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The mask does not carry any heavy scent (barely detected any scent at all, which is perfect for me), and has a nice, thick texture that was relatively easy to apply to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Right after use, your skin not only feels smooth, but glows radiantly!</li>
            <li> while I did receive this product in order to facilitate a review of it, the above thoughts are my own honest opinion of the product and I am looking into other Adovia products to add to my skin care regime!</li>
            <li> it thank you very much</li>
            <li> This mud mask is very gentle compared to another I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My skin was very warm after and flushed/reddened.....and that did last several hours.  </li>
            <li> It dries very fast and is not the easiest to spread.</li>
            <li> I like this very much and would buy again.</li>
            <li> The Adovia brand was very gentle and when I washed it off</li>
            <li> Pretty good for those who have a very active day being in all types of places that may carry dirt and germs harmful to your face.</li>
            <li> mask really hit the spot for me as far as a quick but comfortable mask to wear during a bath or weekly.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try something new.</li>
            <li> when I washed off my face I could feel all the impurities on my face gone left my skin feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li> This is a real nice product, very thick, goes on easliy.</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I didn&#x27;t suffer from any redness or itching as I have with certain masks in the past.</li>
            <li> Effective, affordable, large long lasting tube, and chemical free!  </li>
            <li> everyone should have this mud mask especially men who work outside in the elements this mud mask would be amazing and cleanse all the toxins from the day off of your face !</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my mother and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> (I know I should have done that first)</li>
            <li> However, after my first application, my skin tone was revived.  </li>
            <li> When I went to squeeze the tube for the first time, the crimped end blew apart.</li>
            <li> I have never been an avid user of mud mask</li>
            <li> I first of all splashed water on my face to remove the mask, then used a bath cloth to wipe away any that remained.  </li>
            <li> how smooth and clear it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is it meant to do.</li>
            <li> It definitely seems to work with minimizing my pores and I love how my skin feels after I use it.</li>
            <li> but it is very tolerable and definately worth the results.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, and my skin tone is definitely more even.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and clear skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my nose, big pores on top of cheek bones.</li>
            <li> After using it for the last two weeks, my skin is a bit more clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to run out definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> After it was washed off my face was extremely soft and smooth and I no longer had redness in my face</li>
            <li> It makes my all skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> When I first received this product in the mail, I noticed that even though the Amazon outer packaging was undamaged, but the box was damaged.  </li>
            <li> Actually seems to make my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> I use this product at least 3 times per week, and it does a great job removing the dirt &amp; oil.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised at how smooth and creamy</li>
            <li> and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, again, since using this mask, my nose has STAYED smooth and clear, and YES even my pores seemed to have shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, the first time I used it, I only remembered to go rinse it off because I had set a timer on my phone - if I had not, I likely would not have remembered because it is so comfortable -</li>
            <li> I will reorder this product many times in the future!</li>
            <li> I had no weird tingling, itching, or tightening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use of this product the results were immediate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different face masks (mud/clay/pumpkin/etc.)</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Nothing but soft, smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> or maybe I just notice them more, but in any case, they looked smaller to me.</li>
            <li> This is the first mask I have ever used that lived up to its promises.  </li>
            <li> first two times I used it, I thought it was breaking me out.  </li>
            <li> After the first week, I would have probably given it a 4.</li>
            <li> First off I wash my face with water</li>
            <li> When the mask first touch my face</li>
            <li> For example when you eat pepper for the first time and it starts to burn your mouth</li>
            <li> well that’s how it felt when I first had the mask on my face.</li>
            <li> Unlike many people who reviewed this product, I actually purchased this.</li>
            <li> First impression</li>
            <li> This is my FIRST time</li>
            <li> They may think you&#x27;re nuts at first</li>
            <li> Really made my skin feel rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, they did increased the prices recently, but I know there is nothing better for us than Adovia.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and I like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> that facial mask you recommended, can I use it more than once a week?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The more religious you are about using it and by this</li>
            <li> I had no weird tingling, itching, or tightening.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> love facial masks</li>
            <li> Things such as it having many of the minerals and healing properties.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the mask</li>
            <li> But... I opened the top for the first time and as I squeezed the tube, the back of the tube EXPLODED.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a mud mask.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have tried that comes in a squirt tube.  </li>
            <li> The mask leaves the face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love that it comes in a tube and is already mixed</li>
            <li> I love trying all different types.</li>
            <li> Overall, a really good mud mask that really does help clear the skin without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have heard good things about dead sea mud helping.</li>
            <li> I really loved this Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin very soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> Only suggestion I can make right now is to be more descriptive with how much you&#x27;re supposed to use.</li>
            <li> After the mask is completely dry, rinse with warm water in gentle circles, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> It dried quickly, and I rinse it with a wash cloth and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear, youthful, and refreshed when I use it!!!!</li>
            <li> it leaves my legs feeling very smooth and cleared my psoriasis to half of what they originally were.</li>
            <li> So i received this today after only waiting 2 days and heard so many positive reviews that i figured I&#x27;d give it a go tonight.</li>
            <li> I use it a couple times a week and noticed a positive difference in my skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> My skin felt really soft and smooth and pores did not seem as large.  </li>
            <li> Also, they offer an awesome money back guarantee if you are not satisfied for any reason, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other times when I have time, I leave the mask on longer - and have my own &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I am so excited to find an all natural combination of Pro-Vitamins B5 and E that rejuvenates and refreshes my skin.</li>
            <li> It feels very gentle and pure.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early at this point to say what long term benefits I will gain from using this product, but right off the bat my skin was softer after using it and had a nice &#x27;glow&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> On her legs is where she has it the worst and since using this product along with a great moisturizer we have seen incredible results.</li>
            <li> After the wash my face felt clean but soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and felt clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> after washing it off it felt soft and clean but i still needed to moisturize.</li>
            <li> After using this product to clean and nourish my skin, my sensitive and combination skin feels soothed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have received a sample of Adovia Purifying Mud Mask recently, and I am so glad to be finally ready to post a review about</li>
            <li> If you can achieve the same effect by applying something more gentle on your skin, why not?</li>
            <li> The mask was a little watery at first, but I shook the bottle really good to mix the separated liquid back into the mud mask before applying it the times after, and it went on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I’m pretty certain</li>
            <li> I’m pretty certain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just make sure I have time to clean up from the mess</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use - no long drawn out treatment process.</li>
            <li> Skin feels brighter, super soft, as well as moisturized!  </li>
            <li> The package came right on time, it was intact, and the packaging was just as you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for</li>
            <li> I was not required or compelled to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> No matter where applied, I got positive results that lasted.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth, not rough.</li>
            <li> ;) haha</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this mud, it was very clinical.  </li>
            <li> Many hours later, my face still feels really soft and &#x27;fresh&#x27;</li>
            <li> With a warm face towel I began simply removing the mud and finished with a few splashes to the face to make sure I rinse everything.</li>
            <li> Love this mask, it&#x27;s super creamy but has a slight scrub from the salt.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use the mask that one time, and it was fairly decent.</li>
            <li> have tried many other mud masks, but this one is different for sure.  </li>
            <li> mask went on very smooth and dried rather quickly.</li>
            <li> The directions are simple and easy to follow.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, but did not experience any burning, itchyness or eye irritation.</li>
            <li> I have (yikes...even at 31) acne prone skin that tends to be oily with dry patches in the winter and summer mostly.</li>
            <li> apply, let dry and rinse off and love your renewed skin.</li>
            <li> After using this mask, I notice my skin is super soft.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure they don&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting it off of my skin was not as easy as simply, &amp;#34;rinising&amp;#34; it off.</li>
            <li> The seal on the top of the tube split causing it to leak out or dry up.</li>
            <li> When I spoke to the customer care, Sharon said Mud mask will make me more dry and that it may not be for me.</li>
            <li> Most people apply masks, allow them to dry for 20 to 30 minutes, and then rinse.</li>
            <li> After more than 20 minutes, I washed it off with lukewarm water and pat dry with a towel.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell odd and felt nice upon application.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a acne/blemish product that didn&#x27;t completely dry you out or didn&#x27;t cause more blemishes in the end.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> after awhile the numbness went away leaving my skin nice and soft, but it was still a bit strange.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne, however; I do have large pores and this is like a day at the spa.</li>
            <li> It boosts cell renewal, revitalizes your skin and tightens those pesky large pores.</li>
            <li> I have purchased the pure mud as well.  </li>
            <li> My face feels really nice and fresh after using the product, though longer term use will be needed to see if there is any long lasting affects.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that this is my new favorite facial mask and that I adding it into my skin routine</li>
            <li> Love my new facial mask!</li>
            <li> As a dead see products lover I really like this facial mask, it works great and leaves the skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> In less than a half an hour, I can complete a wonderful spa treatment right at home</li>
            <li> No scent really, just fresh, soft skin!</li>
            <li> you are interested in more beauty reviews among other things like makeup looks and fashion, please check out my blog:&lt;br /&gt;[...</li>
            <li> First thing is they are a bit pricey, but not so much as many other fancy products in the market</li>
            <li> This product seemed very high quality.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry flaky skin and fed up of trying so many products and spending thousands of $$$.</li>
            <li> Nice little tingle while it&#x27;s drying and tightens up.</li>
            <li> Once off, though, my skin felt really smooth and my pores were noticeably smaller - my pores are usually really large -</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin, it smells nice, easy to wash off, helped with my dark spots which I have a lot off.</li>
            <li> I found that this makes a really good spot treatment as well because when the mask dries it becomes really hard and does not come off while</li>
            <li> This huge tube will last you forever</li>
            <li> I put it on before getting in the shower, and do something while it dries (make the bed, change out the laundry, get my clothes ready - anything really - 10 minutes goes by fast) then jump in the shower to rinse off.  </li>
            <li> am a huge fan of mud masks, and have tried a ton of different kinds.  </li>
            <li> Well, I paid for my product and I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I notice it is so much softer, it is addressing some problems with clogged pores, etc.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, I say absolutely go for it.</li>
            <li> It helps restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Great for someone who has acne or very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoys this product immensely, and her son is smooth and radiant after use.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mud mask.</li>
            <li> it makes my face soft and calm after use.</li>
            <li> I was so tired before applying the mask, but when I took it off, I felt like I have had a great rest.</li>
            <li> My skin is much clearer after two uses.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling smooth and tightened.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate using quality beauty products and this mud mask has proven to be just that to me.</li>
            <li> It is ready to use.</li>
            <li> You get ready to use mud mask.</li>
            <li> Im free to write my personal experience.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC Facial Mask!  </li>
            <li> I was able to evenly apply it and also remove from my fingers with minimal issue.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;thin layer&amp;#34; is pretty general and can be interpreted many different ways.</li>
            <li> mud mask has become my go-to because of the benefits, and how much of an improvement I have seen in my skin since I started using this product just once a week.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle mask to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much improvement on my skin either.</li>
            <li> BUT TOO MUCH HASSLE.</li>
            <li> thanks so much, will be putting up the review this week on my blog.</li>
            <li> Haha....</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> It was also gentle on my face, and there was NO drying of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It also claims it leaves skin radiant, younger looking, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got it for the “radiant, younger looking, and smooth” claim</li>
            <li> I put it on and really forgot about</li>
            <li> I have a really oily T-zone and cystic acne</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> I really don know if its working or not</li>
            <li> But my skin felt great afterwards and didn&#x27;t feel abrasive or irritating at all.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which I appreciate.</li>
            <li> When I received this product, I noticed the consistency was very watery and dilluted.</li>
            <li> I used it anyways and did not think much of it.</li>
            <li> This is unacceptable of Adovia to send a product like this to those who actually PAY for it instead of receiving it for free.</li>
            <li> but it really does work well for that.  </li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product really is like mudd.</li>
            <li> Very upscale feel with the packaging.</li>
            <li> It came in a tub which is much messier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really cant see the effect....</li>
            <li> If the seller can keep the price at a reasonable rate I would recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li> It was also very itchy around my jawline.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed a difference in my skin since using this mask.  </li>
            <li> It works really well at minimizing my pores and helps keep my face from breaking out.  </li>
            <li> It is not drying and is actually moisturizing and and has vitamin c to help fight free radicals.</li>
            <li> This facial mask was free.  </li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Adovia.  </li>
            <li> I received the above product(s) free of charge from Adovia.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It also claims it leaves skin radiant, younger looking, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got it for the “radiant, younger looking, and smooth” claim</li>
            <li> I put it on and really forgot about it.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t notice anything</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really thought much of buying a mud mask again.</li>
            <li> What I really like is the exfoliating that it does.</li>
            <li> I had smaller pores, my face felt smooth and I never had any issues with skin reactions etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> with all that, I have been very weary to purchase a product.</li>
            <li> It is not gone, but it is much lighter and I have fewer breakouts than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial mask to add to their facial cleaning routine!</li>
            <li> It went on smooth and there was a brief tingle</li>
            <li> It really looks like mud.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I really like the Adovia Mud Mask,</li>
            <li> but for the whole benefit.  </li>
            <li> I really like this mask</li>
            <li> My skin was so smooth, soft and clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d given up on any facial masks, as I have incredibly sensitive skin, and most skin care products just seem to rip my face up--</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE them all.</li>
            <li> I love that this mask is all natural and you can actually recognize &amp; pronounce the ingredients!</li>
            <li> Even if they are being completely honest, I still feel there will be a heavy bias.</li>
            <li> but this one left it clarified and touch-ably soft :)</li>
            <li> Kind of messy to use, but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny bumps where the oil glands kind of get inflamed, not pimples, but tiny bumps.  </li>
            <li> It comes out of the tube with a thick consistency and has good coverage as it goes on.</li>
            <li> I do not have a tight pulling feeling as I have experienced with other masks and it still allows elasticity in my face when I talk or smile.</li>
            <li> This product has some very powerful amazing ingredients in it, containing dead sea water, dead sea mud, chamomile, aloe, and sunflower which are only some of the amazing ingredients.</li>
            <li> It spread very easily and tingled slightly while drying.</li>
            <li> So just slight movement of your face will loosen up the mask and cause specks to shed very easily.</li>
            <li> I think I always thought in the past that you need that to get clean - but this mask leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy and all the extra &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; is gone!  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li> The mask is soothing in that it goes on smooth and cool, has a slight grit to the texture but not overly abrasive.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Beeswax, Dead Sea water/mud, papaya extract, Aloe Vera gel, vitamins a and c, camomile,  sunflower seed and jojoba oil, among other incredibly moisturizing ingredients make this a mask that every girl should have in her skin care regime.</li>
            <li> This product gently tightened, then after rinsing left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It washed off fairly easy and left our faces feeling very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it causes my pimples to be removed and start the next day fresh!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth and my pores are barely visible.</li>
            <li> but it does really deep clean them so they are not so aparent.</li>
            <li> It says to use on clean skin, so I washed my face beforehand, but then I got a couple pimples on my forehead the next day.</li>
            <li> or when I feel I need a deep clean on my face to unclog my pores.  </li>
            <li> It keeps the ingredient in their active state and allows more of that &amp;#34;gentle pulling&amp;#34; and purifying of the skin&#x27;s surface to take place.</li>
            <li> I rarely apply mud mask to my face and the latest I can remember will be 6 months ago when I bought a small sachet in Target just to try it out.</li>
            <li> For the most part my skin is normal, without breakouts, and not really oily.</li>
            <li> Once mixed well, though, I found it had a pleasant texture and little to no odor.</li>
            <li> After it dried, the mask washed off very easily with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> After seeing the effects that the Adovia Dead Sea Facial Mask had on myself, my husband, my son and daughter, I would love to own the entire line of products.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see how far it goes; a little provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li> I prefer more of a thicker, clay type mask because it is easier to apply and you can feel that you have product on your face; where as Adovia is more on the watery side and applying it to your face makes you feel like youve hardly put enough.</li>
            <li> well I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been missing out on such a wonderful product for so long !!!</li>
            <li> I was excited when I received this offer, when it arrived the packaging was great, I was shocked at how big of a free sample I had gotten.</li>
            <li> It was a great mask, it actually did make my face feel firm and was really soft after application.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is way more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I received this, I was surprised at the packaging of the product.</li>
            <li> My face felt super soft, but not tight or irritated.</li>
            <li> and I really appreciate that since I live in a desert climate.</li>
            <li> I like that because it makes my skin feel really refreshed and &#x27;new&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped with the breakouts as well as preventing new ones.</li>
            <li> It brought some below the surface debris closer to the surface and allowed me to easily extract them without roughly squeezing and bruising my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is silly, but I love the color of this mask. :)</li>
            <li> It left my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth (just a nice thin layer and spreads well!)</li>
            <li> The top closure blew open the last time I used it</li>
            <li> I used this product every few days to keep my face looking fresh and blemish free.</li>
            <li> It left my skin moist, soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t exactly have consistent face care regime</li>
            <li> This Mud Mask Tightens and Purifies Pores leaving a Clear, Smooth &amp; Younger Looking Complexion</li>
            <li> I did apply a moisturizer afterwards and now my skin is extra smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a creamy medicated face wash, and only costs 10 bucks (and will last more than a month).</li>
            <li> I do hate this purging experience, but it’s nice to know that the product is working and that my pores are getting a good cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get as unbearably tight as other masks I have experienced</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how it does for my skin over the long haul.  </li>
            <li> From the very FIRST use this mask left me in awe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and looks brighter!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend and I will be buying again</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for all the skin tone.</li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth and moisturized,  my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I left my mask on for 15 minutes (it turned into a nice chalky earthy green color when it dried) and rinsed it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> I find this very moisturizing for a mud mask which is a good thing since the one I normally use tends to dry my skin out no matter how little I use.</li>
            <li> It also works great for Eczema and Psoriasis as well due to Dead Sea salt and mud known properties that help relieve Eczema, Psoriasis and acne symptoms.</li>
            <li> The mask goes on cool and leaves my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated without the mask feeling uncomfortably tight or tingly.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soooooo soft and refreshed after using!!</li>
            <li> It does smell a little funky like most mud masks do.</li>
            <li> If it has been sitting for a little while, make sure to shake the tube before using or it may separate and be watery looking.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this particular mask is that it spreads like butter and does not crack or become uncomfortable when drying.</li>
            <li> This facial mask draws out impurities, toxins and excess oils leaving your skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love all of the natural ingredients in this product, and this is a great mud facial that I can afford at home without the expensive spa facials that can cost over $100 each!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and get evenly unlike other masks I have used.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Adovia products, and this was in no way a let down!</li>
            <li> I am happy to report that I had NOT ONE ill side effect of using this product.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was sooo happy about that because I had pore strips on my shopping list.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an intense pore cleanser that is not harsh and drying.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and some problems with adult acne and this product has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea mud has so many uses and has been used in ancient healing practices.</li>
            <li> feeling I normally get from using masks.  </li>
            <li> All of the sudden my face was looking so fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few more uses my skin cleared up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a mud mask, but I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> Most of us know the benefits of skin products containing Dead Sea Mud.</li>
            <li> Love the way this felt on my face as it dried and</li>
            <li> I have tried many others, only to have them dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> He came off easily and left my skin feeling tighter and the pores on my nose looked smaller.  </li>
            <li> Thick and a little gritty, this goes on nicely and makes my skin feel amazing after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> Be sure to knead the product a little before opening and trying to apply for the first time; then hopefully you won&#x27;t squeeze out tons of watery liquid before actually getting the mud mask out.</li>
            <li> The price may seem a little steep, but for the amount you get it is well worth the price!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a large and for the lack of word, fat container filled with dead sea mud mask goodness.</li>
            <li> When I washed the mud off my skin felt extremely hydrated and so silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to put a moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> I felt like a new me.</li>
            <li> Just thought I would try something new.</li>
            <li> This is a new must have in my beauty collection.</li>
            <li> mask contains aloe vera, so my skin felt moisturized instead of super dry, like how it feels after using a homemade clay mask.</li>
            <li> I have larger pores, so I try to use a mask at least once a week, twice on a good week.</li>
            <li> I ordered it before but the free one I received seemed to have a different texture, slightly gritty and with a shiny emollient (probably the olive oil).</li>
            <li> This Adovia Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask arrived quickly in a nice box.</li>
            <li> I rinsed it with warm water after the mask had dried and it left my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> Rinsed off clean - again with a very mild exfoliating feeling and my skin did not feel tight, dry or sensitive in any way.  </li>
            <li> it felt cool and nice on my burn and definitely made it less red instantly after removal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use mud masks about 3 times a week and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It did however leave my skin very, very soft.</li>
            <li> I deal with acne prone skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive about my skin</li>
            <li> My skin was very soft and it took a lot of the oil out.</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin prone to acne</li>
            <li> Not with Adovia; my skin was very soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft am hoping with time will diminish scars.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I highly recommend a cautionary amount whenever first trying new products if you have sensitive skin, especially if you have plans for that evening.</li>
            <li> I used to struggle with it as a teen, and then it was fine in my 20s and early 30s with the occasional bump here and there.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I found that this mask made my face burn a little bit in my more sensitive areas (i.e. around the nose).</li>
            <li> Has helped clear my acne!</li>
            <li> there is usually something newer &amp; better out there).</li>
            <li> Noticed a big difference in the first use.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel as soft as a baby!</li>
            <li> My skin was so so soft &amp; silky to touch after my 1st treatment!  </li>
            <li> so soft!</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this mask is that it comes in a big squeeze tube bottle, so you have enough to last you a while.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants a relaxing hour or so!</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> My skin looked radiant and felt soft for days!  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to mention it because you might not want to try it for the first time before a big date or heading off to a wedding!</li>
            <li> I would suggest after you have applied the mask to use a small fan brush to make sure it is even.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and I am constantly buying it for other people to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty big</li>
            <li> Love these dead sea products!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on super smoothly, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have always been a huge fan of products from the dead sea, so that&#x27;s the main reason why I got this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken care with my skin and frequently try new products.</li>
            <li> As I have sensitive, oily skin, I am always cautious about trying new products for my face.  </li>
            <li> It also helps skin to look new and young.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my face smooth and less oily.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily and I didnt feel like it dried my skin out.</li>
            <li> I think I just didn&#x27;t manage to clean it off completely and some residue stayed on my skin for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, since it comes in a tube, rather than an open container, it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I tried the mask on my hand first (in case of reaction) - it left my hand soft and supple with no itchiness.</li>
            <li> The labeling is very clear and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple times so far and my skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> The tube makes it very easy to get just the right amount, as you only need a thin layer.</li>
            <li> Do not use a white or light towel to dry your face, unless you know this stuff is all off,  It stained the material.</li>
            <li> My skin is definitely smoother, my acne breakouts have calmed down (not gone completely but way better), and my face is moisturized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, just a little hurting to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> a fair and sensitive skinned girl, I am always skeptical about trying new products.</li>
            <li> The mud mask spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry.</li>
            <li> where I have been using the ADOVIA Purifying Mud Mask for a month now and there is a clear difference.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it twice a week, for 10 mins to clear out any impurities with your skin.</li>
            <li> The grittiness of the mask is just enough of a gentle exfoliator for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have only tried this once, but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, but it seems to clear that up a bit as well.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with acne since my early adulthood and struggled to find product that was gentle enough on the skin but that reduced my breakouts.</li>
            <li> It does such a great job that I almost feel guilty applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I like getting maybe 1 pimple and then having clear skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling so soft and refreshed after using.</li>
            <li> The 13 year old has used it as well</li>
            <li> It cleared my skin &amp; made it feel soft.  </li>
            <li> mud mask is 100 natural  detoxifier and purifier that come from sea.</li>
            <li> It really cleans deeply.</li>
            <li> feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> Although I can&#x27;t really say that I noticed any difference in the appearance of my skin on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> The only problem, which isn’t really a problem at all is that it’s a bit itchy and if you accidentally itch your face or where ever you’ve put it on, the ‘dust’ from the mask goes everywhere.</li>
            <li> As far as removing blackheads, this product doesnt Cut it for me.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is all natural.</li>
            <li> Once rinsed off, it reveals healthier, glowing skin that is so soft</li>
            <li> Now, if you have oily, or sensitive skin, I am going to recommend this to you.</li>
            <li> I am a 41-year-old Caucasian female with very oily skin and enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> ADOVIA Fast forward 3 weeks later</li>
            <li> I WILL CONTINUE TO USE MY OLD PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> would absolutely have waited for an exchange but no such option is given here.</li>
            <li> Even though the mud feels heavy in your hands, it feels really light and airy on your face.</li>
            <li> but it makes my face feel soft as a consolation</li>
            <li> have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After removing the mask my skin feels really soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Skin is soft and hydrated after use.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft and wasn&#x27;t drying.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Here are my thoughts so far on this one.</li>
            <li> Overall I really like this product and will continue to use it on a weekly basis since I like the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> and you skin will feel soft and radiant like a baby.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, hyper pigmented skin and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> No harsh smells or redness....</li>
            <li> This mask leaves your skin feeling soft and revitalised</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m done with my mask my face feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> were completely gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not bothered by that because I didn&#x27;t have rash or irritation afterwards even if I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This mask left my skin feeling really hydrated afterwards which is something I didn&#x27;t expect,</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to using this a couple of more times in the next few weeks and updating my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just love “Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask” despite</li>
            <li> I did see a small difference in reducing my breakouts, but I can buy a mask for less than a fifth of the price that not only gives me much better results as far as reducing acne, but it makes my skin glow, smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> When I removed it, my skin felt tight and clean, and completely un-irritated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> last time I did this mask, my skin felt oily and gross, like it does right before a breakout.</li>
            <li> I mean, my nose was smoother to the touch and, upon close inspection, all but free of blackheads!</li>
            <li> most likely due to the amount of essential oils in it.</li>
            <li> It rinses off easily without excessive scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling soft, clear and vibrant.</li>
            <li> but it is also oily certain times of the month, and then super dry during other times.</li>
            <li> I tried this product on my hands which were super dry and red from this winter.</li>
            <li> It has been great way to defunk my skin after a long cold winter and get ready for summer.</li>
            <li> I like how after you have let it sit on your face for the time as directed that you can add a bit of water and gently use it to further give your face an exfoliation treatment like no other.  </li>
            <li> During the first few uses of this mask you will notice a few more breakouts.</li>
            <li> Those always tighten up, and I can&#x27;t smile, or even say anything, this mask on the other hand is like the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree mask.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve used other Dead Sea mus before on my face and this just didn&#x27;t work quite the same magic.</li>
            <li> I am constantly having to deal with black heads and trying to exfoliate to keep my nose looking smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> Clean up is messy as well.</li>
            <li> I have been having some serious issues with breaking out and noticing that my pores are more visible than I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have to be careful with the products I use to avoid breaking out in hives.</li>
            <li> This is nice because with my rosacea it usually feels rough.</li>
            <li> I really love that this mud is in a convenient squeeze tube that makes applying it that much easier and less messy.</li>
            <li> nose is the main spot on my face with big pores.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a decent mask for the price.</li>
            <li> highly, highly recommend this facial mask as a part of your weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This product comes in high quality packaging and is packed with terrific ingredients for your skin.  </li>
            <li> thought that that type of fierce ultra drying of the clay was required in order to just as fiercely draw out the excess oils, toxins, black heads, acne, white heads, free clogged pores etc, etc., from the skin</li>
            <li> And its just not new but better because of its dead sea mineral properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The very first time I used the product, I made a mess however.</li>
            <li> One is always a bit skeptical when a skincare product claIms to have so very many beneficial properties...and mud?</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with the product&#x27;s consistency and it&#x27;s wet enough to make application a cinch but not so wet that I am chasing it.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy facial masks</li>
            <li> I enjoyed Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask and have incorporated it into my ongoing regular beauty routine.  </li>
            <li> As it dried, it felt really cool and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, dries quickly on your face, only squirts out enough for a thin layer (I usually glob too much mask on my face unevenly with other brands), and works with my adult-acne-prone fair, sensitive, oily skin.</li>
            <li> my skin felt so smooth and soft and not dry and scaly like usual.</li>
            <li> It dried fast on me, telling me that I have very dry skin this winter - my friend&#x27;s face is more oily and it took longer to dry.  </li>
            <li> I was once again looking for a new product when I found Adovia Facial Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> This 5.1 ounce tube is huge and will last a few months if used twice a week.</li>
            <li> very worried it&#x27;s going to dry up.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin meaning some of my skin is oily and some is extremely dry and the mask has really helped to even out my skin.</li>
            <li> Though my skin is dry all the time, this really worked well</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be dry and after using this mask, it was very oily for a couple days.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and are unsure of what to use to clean your face, pick up this Dead Sea Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is so smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> The mask has a light scent and as it dried, you could definitely feel your skin tightening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick yet easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> This mask dried on quickly on my face.</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency but goes on easily.</li>
            <li> My face is more clear and it has decreased the redness exponentially.  </li>
            <li> And like I said, a little goes a long way so there is more than enough for it to be used weekly or as needed for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This mask will deliver results like no other.  </li>
            <li> And I saw a major difference in my face after.</li>
            <li> well worth the mess.  </li>
            <li> Hey, forgot to say, the fine lines are gone in a week, you bet and the thicker ones become hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The major concerns that I ran into with my research were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left it on for about 10 minutes the first time, because I thought it might dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> comes out of the tube in a chalky greyish blue  dry substance, almost as dried mud, ok</li>
            <li> Perhaps the effect may even be better because my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out and in need of urgent moisturizing as it does after using the other ultra drying clays.</li>
            <li> I have used this mask several times over the past few weeks (more than suggested) and I have had positive results every time, no matter my skin issue.</li>
            <li> The end result was soft, supple skin that felt completely clean without feeling dry or tight.  </li>
            <li> I really struggle with dry skin and this product helps remove all the dead, dry skin and leaves my face very fresh and glowing.  </li>
            <li> My face felt smoother and softer to the touch and just generally CLEANER.</li>
            <li> and my skin is finally starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> It left my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;YOU WILL LOOK MUCH OLDER, and extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am over 30 years old, but I still get occasional acne.</li>
            <li> It contains aloe vera to balance the natural level of moisture, and Vitamin C for overall skin health.</li>
            <li> The product does feel s natural and somewhat gritty.</li>
            <li> mask itself is not at all gritty, which was pleasantly unexpected.</li>
            <li> (I left mine on for just over 5 minutes because of my uber sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I am adamant about taking care of my skin and am trying to stave off the inevitable wrinkles I know will come.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest with this mask to make sure you do a thin layer.</li>
            <li> (as air is the enemy) but making sure none falls on the jar&#x27;s rim or worse, on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right after applying it  I can feel the cooling sensation and little tingling on my skin.</li>
            <li> - I break out in hives at the thought of new products, so I am always very careful and hesitant to try new things.  </li>
            <li> And when it does dry, I can definitely feel my face tightening, which I don&#x27;t feel as significantly with other</li>
            <li> My skin remains in that improved state for about three days, so I got more out of the results by doing the &amp;#34;wet treatment&amp;#34;, and it also makes removal easier and less messy.</li>
            <li> I use a lot of masks, usually once a week because I believe they are the only thing that can get your skin deep clean and clear out things that are hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin very soft and really does take all the dead skin off...</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and the usual issues such as fine lines and have difficulty finding a mask that actually works.</li>
            <li> At first it was the same as any other mask:</li>
            <li> I have parts of my skin that are considered sensitive and other normal to even oily in the t-zone area.</li>
            <li> It deep cleanse my pores and left skin extremely soft!</li>
            <li> I do have eczema and psoriasis and it is helping to clear those patches also, which is a blessing since it is unattractive to have dead skin flaking off or building up in certain areas of your face.</li>
            <li> It has not shrunk the few large pores that I have, but it does leave my face feeling soft and exfoliated.  </li>
            <li> but  when putting it on, all I get is the look of a firemen that handled ashes, there is NO  thick layering possible as seen on pictures, no such deep color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many dead sea mud masks and all of them stung a little when applied.  </li>
            <li> I had read many reviews of a few different brands of Dead Sea Mud masks and they all mentioned how great these masks are and how bad the smell is.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product left my facial skin clear and oil-free.  </li>
            <li> I used this item the same day i received it, OMG it left my face feeling so soft and radiant</li>
            <li> The tube is useful, although the tubs are larger, every time you open up the lid, you are drying out the mask, so with a tube, there is much less air getting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35+ adult male and have had to deal with a sudden break out.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my face, but it does get rid of excess oil.</li>
            <li> Does not completely dry.</li>
            <li> I am bothered because all the 5 star reviews here say that the product is thick, goes on smoothly, has a slightly gritty texture, and not one mention of it stinging my face.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to try this and after removing the mask, its not dry at all.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking to test out a new mud mask, I highly recommend giving Adovia Spa&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask a try.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it leaves it very soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> and actually I have not had a major acne break out since using this mask either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when used on regularly we see a major difference in our skin.  </li>
            <li> This did not take long to dry and was quick and easy to rub off (as long as you rinse your washcloth off a few times, it does act a little bit like mud of course).</li>
            <li> also notice that using this on breakouts really dries them out and brings them to a head much quicker - even quicker than my usual benzoyl peroxide spot treatment!</li>
            <li> Mud Mask is made with Pure Dead Sea Mud that has the highest concentration of minerals which is vital for a facial skin treatment glow.</li>
            <li> I thought that was strange because mud masks are supposed to be thick so they can apply on easily.</li>
            <li> I have found that Dead Sea mud, the mud tends to still be as effective as other mud based masks, but tends to give less of the side effects like over drying.</li>
            <li> There is also a 100% money back guarantee so there really isn&#x27;t anything to loose !!</li>
            <li> The first few minutes that I had it on my face</li>
            <li> The previous Adovia mask I purchased before looked exactly as pictured, same color and consistency, this one I just received is completely different.  </li>
            <li> Just be sure to moisturize after you dunce it off since it usually dries my face out a little.</li>
            <li> First I want to give you a little back story.....</li>
            <li> , I know that sounds silly but some masks are so strong they can make your eyes water, this one doesn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I recommend giving this product a try, the bottle is very heavy which made me feel that it was worth every every cent.</li>
            <li> I saw negative reviews about how it was runny, but having owned the pure dead sea mud, it needs to be noted, that there is a lot of moisture that separates from the mud, so shake or press on the container gently w/o squeezing it too much to allow the moisture to mix back into the mud.  </li>
            <li> She was surprised with this as it didn’t dry her skin as some mud masks do.  </li>
            <li> Now in our family we only use Adovia moisturizing Soap, Adovia day moisturizing cream, mud mask, hand cream (professional size for year long).</li>
            <li> The mud mask dries fast, it feels weird, but cool as well.</li>
            <li> I first heard of Dead Sea Salts and Mud via one of those daily talk shows</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I first removed the top and saw the color, a brown mud color.  </li>
            <li> The next week I used it, the same firming was there, but the redness wasn&#x27;t as noticeable...and the 3rd week, it was barely a pinkness to my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience any of the redness that I normally do with other masks.</li>
            <li> Just a little- enough to get a little more attention to my oily days, and I don&#x27;t need to scrub on the dry days.</li>
            <li> It does stain white towels and unless you use oxiclean/and bleach with hot water it will be hard to remove so try using an old towel or maybe facial wipe?</li>
            <li> It never really looks dry, so you just have to gently touch it with your fingers to see if there is any transfer.</li>
            <li> You only need a thin layer, smooths on easily</li>
            <li> I have never used a mud mask that&#x27;s is not dry, but has the same cleaning efx of a traditional mud mask.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly, starts to work on your impurities almost instantly, smells a little like mud (obviously) and has a slight tingle factor as it works its magic!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure Dead Sea minerals and vegan.</li>
            <li> It smells a little funky, but it works and that to me serves the whole purpose.</li>
            <li> my pores and blackheads are really getting small and my acne is gone, but for one or two little bumps that aren&#x27;t very noticeable!</li>
            <li> Since there is no way to contact the seller to report an issue &amp;#34;perhaps a bad batch&amp;#34;, no link to the manufactures website to even ASK if it&#x27;s meant to be like this, I cannot in good faith recommenced this despite promotional pricing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it about 7-8 times and the bottle is still at least 2/3 of the way full, so this bottle should last for a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have never really followed much of a skincare routine, but I would definitely set one with these products as would other members of my family.</li>
            <li> Generally leave it on about 15 minutes or until dry.  </li>
            <li> My skin is normal with the occasional breakout spots in my T-zone, but I love it because I can literally feel it cleaning my skin and pulling out the bad stuff.  </li>
            <li> Quality: I&#x27;m surprised by all these other reviews saying the mask got rid of blackheads, because it did not get rid of mine (the stubborn ones on my nose and on the sides of my nostrils).</li>
            <li> Normally mud masks are a bit gritty and can also tend to sting a little.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the ingredients, mostly because my skin is very sensitive, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star only because of the short time I have been using it and that I can&#x27;t verify long term results.</li>
            <li> Now my skin is combination and gets really dried out (particularly in the t-zone and chin areas).</li>
            <li> First of all, a little bit goes a long way, so this single bottle will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> but I highly doubt there&#x27;s any dead sea mud in it.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I have been pretty dull looking.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I have been pretty dull looking.</li>
            <li> well first I had my doubts about this clay product because in the past I have always used clay masks that are applied to the face and then dry on the face, and by that</li>
            <li> Your scab will peel off quickly and no dark marks left behind!  </li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that if you are not careful this product can be super messy.</li>
            <li> You also only have to use a super thin layer, so this package will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m not sure how to explain what it smells like, because to me, the mask doesn’t really have a smell.</li>
            <li> and i had a minor breakout after the 2nd application.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this 1-2 times a week for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It is a very smooth but with tiny bumps that feel like dirty.</li>
            <li> with that being sad, I am unable to complete this, I love MUD baths &amp;#34;Glen Ivy Hot Springs&amp;#34; this  is NOT even close.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There is plenty of product in the tube, and I can see this lasting me a very long time.</li>
            <li> Mud masks have often left me dry and feeling a bit withered.  </li>
            <li> i washed it off and of course my face felt soft and refreshed but to my surprise the black head</li>
            <li> Let dry for about 10-15 minutes and then simply rinse off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, it helps put some oomph back in your skin!</li>
            <li> Reduce excess oils, minimize pores and experience radiant and clear skin with our Dead Sea Facial Mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to think, I will probably try a new mask now!</li>
            <li> The following day I noticed that all of the painful pimples on my forehead and hairline had dried out and everywhere else felt nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Also, it drastically improved the pretty serious sunburn that I had when I used it -</li>
            <li> Other ingredients, such as Evening Primrose Oil, Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil combine to provide deep moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I allow it to dry for approximately 15 minutes, sometimes a few more.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and used the mask on my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft and it feels a little cleaner too when I rinse it away.</li>
            <li> My skin is a harsh combination of oily and dry, while trying to be very sensitive about everything.</li>
            <li> Buying one product for the whole month is hard.</li>
            <li> Unlike other muds I have used it did not dry to the stuck face</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it is a bit more difficult to tell when it is dry compared to other masks.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, I cannot tell visually if it is cleaning my pores and pulling out excess oil as with some other products on the market (the ones that dry to a grey color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you have tried Mud Masks before or not, but if you haven&#x27;t, you really need to try it at least one time.</li>
            <li> The Aloe and Chamomile soothe and calm skin while the Vitamins A, &amp; C leave skin looking refreshed and renewed!&lt;br /&gt;I apply a thin layer, after I shower, once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used much cheaper stuff that worked at least as well.</li>
            <li> my only negative about this product is the normal price.</li>
            <li> and you get a long strip of product with one squeeze</li>
            <li> I tried another time this time I left it on for 20 minutes and still not much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Adovia’s purifying dead sea mud mask pulls out toxins while unclogging pores to rejuvenate skin naturally.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in the Dead Sea mask was what drew me in to try it.  </li>
            <li> I think the dead sea salts are the ones that make the skin feel so energized, radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> and they really go a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long</li>
            <li> I expected the same out of this mask.</li>
            <li> I had no excuse other than time</li>
            <li> and you cant get any natural than a mask from the dead sea</li>
            <li> It must be because this mud contains all natural organic extracts like Evening Primrose oil, Jojoba oils and Olive oil just to name a few.</li>
            <li> I can tell that this one has emollients because it feels almost like a lotion during application and as you rinse it off even though it dries down to a certain stiff texture.</li>
            <li> My previous mud mask came in an open container and got mold in it after only 3 uses (over about 2 months).</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer to a freshly washed face and allowed it to dry.</li>
            <li> It dried faster than other masks I have tried and left my skin soft and feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Also, I was surprised that the mask didn&#x27;t have a smell; for some reason I was expecting it to smell as rank as my other masks, but the lack of a scent was nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> You learn something new everyday!</li>
            <li> and I order the supplies for the year long at once and end up spending far less than what I used to spend for other products over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it does with clearing in the long run!</li>
            <li> I had it on longer than 20 minutes due to mom duties and simply forgetting it</li>
            <li> Definitely looking forward to purchasing other products by a do via too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will definitely order again and can&#x27;t wait to try other products.  </li>
            <li> I had it on longer than 20 minutes due to mom duties and simply forgetting it</li>
            <li> for other reviewers who said it was watery, perhaps they just need to give it a shake prior to dispensing because the water settles to the bottom.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer than it has in a long time!  </li>
            <li> and it goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so soft &amp; moisturized, I could hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long but I&#x27;ved use it</li>
            <li> it burned my face, my eyes had such a bad allergic reaction to it that I had to keep them shut most of the time I had it on.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to eat anything, or drink anything in an open container when wearing this mask; it flakes BAD.</li>
            <li> dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the product for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> When I felt the mask dry on the face, I figured that it was time to take it off, and it took about 20 minutes for the mask to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a pull of pores cleanse or dry affect</li>
            <li> and I found that it might dry my skin if I use it every day</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> and I heard that mud masks are not for dry skin</li>
            <li> I have seen some mud mask where you get the dry clay</li>
            <li> I just think it was too dry that it was causing an irritation.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked at how soft and smooth my face is after using this mask.  </li>
            <li> This mask helps with the flaky dry skin as well as the redness and itch that come with psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and this did not over dry my face.</li>
            <li> put this on and let it dry and was amazed at the difference in my skin when I went to take off the mask.  </li>
            <li> - you allow it to dry for 10-20 minutes and then rinse off.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin</li>
            <li> It wasn’t dry and still no irritation, itch, or anything of the sort going on.</li>
            <li> You could also just touch the mask with your finger and see if it is dry.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s going to dry out now.</li>
            <li> Also, that dry patch that is chronically in between my eyebrows was gone - no flakes or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a mud mask and it will still feel dry after washing off while tightening your skin.  </li>
            <li> but it stopped once the product started to dry.</li>
            <li> I can say some mask have made me feel dry after using theirs and this one seems to have kept my face hyrated.</li>
            <li> I then applied it and waited for it to dry to remove.</li>
            <li> I wash my face thoroughly and pat it dry.  </li>
            <li> I always tell the kids I can&#x27;t talk because it has to dry so</li>
            <li> and then they would dry out.</li>
            <li> It wasn’t dry and still no irritation, itch, or anything of the sort going on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some on the market.</li>
            <li> It is made with all natural ingredients , such as, Dead Sea Black Mud, beeswax, olive oil, evening primrose oil, and jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask claims that it reduces blackheads and acne, and serves as an exfoliator and deep facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask claims that it reduces blackheads and acne, and serves as an exfoliator and deep facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> Enough to protect it, but not too much to destroy the entire planet.  </li>
            <li> I have done lots of face masks before - usually the foofy, single use ones, or sometimes a hardcore professional grade one.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and oily and I usually can&#x27;t use mud masks or creams.</li>
            <li> I am have used it only twice but have already started seeing my dark spots fading</li>
            <li> My pores look so much smaller, my skin has a glow, and all the dark spots and dullness have disappeared from my face.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product, quite honestly.</li>
            <li> It’s messy to get out of the tube and if you don’t get enough the first time then the tube is very mess which means the counter is messy</li>
            <li> would have to use half a tube in layers &amp;#34;apply, dry, next layer apply and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this, so this tube will last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but this mud mask definitely helps me as a general skin care to help revive my skin when it seems dull.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combo skin so finding skincare products that work for me is hard.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry, I remove it by rinsing with cold water, then lightly pat my face dry and apply sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I probably use less than a teaspoon for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount and it will last you for months.</li>
            <li> For the summer especially, when my skin is typically overly oily, I am solely using this product when it comes to skincare because of how well it has worked for me.</li>
            <li> can definitely tell you that once you have the Mud Mask on, it will start to tighten and then you will feel the pull of the Mud tightening your face and you might even experience a slight tingling.</li>
            <li> I used my fingers to determine if the mask was still dry or wet.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels the same, aside from the slight irritation it caused me.</li>
            <li> so not sure if it helps with acne, but definitely have seen a difference with my pores being smaller.</li>
            <li> I expected my skin to feel dry</li>
            <li> I use the mash to exfoliate a little bit prior to letting it dry.</li>
            <li> you have a very dry nose like me, I would just avoid that</li>
            <li> The consistency of it is too liquidy and makes a big mess.</li>
            <li> The Dead Sea mud seems to pull out all the impurities out of my skin and leave it soft and supple, and I have noticed it is less oily as well.  </li>
            <li> While sitting there with the mud on my face, I expected it to get very dry and start to crack, but that is not what happened.</li>
            <li> It is a little gritty, so it exfoliates as you rinse it</li>
            <li> This product felt a little burning/ stinging sensation when i applied it, although it didn&#x27;t make my skin red or anything</li>
            <li> and I like this one because it&#x27;s a little bit different.</li>
            <li> I was extremely please also that it didn&#x27;t dry my face out after washing it off.</li>
            <li> but I do use their other product &amp;#34;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice African Black soap&amp;#34; and I like that.  </li>
            <li> tone looked dull after  catching cold.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hard making it unable for your face to move as most masks do.</li>
            <li> the first-time i got it, i was desperate and used it twice a day for the whole weekend, and it never dried out my face or anything.</li>
            <li> I did leave it on for about 25 minutes until it was real dry.</li>
            <li> It pulled all that icky stuff out of my face and made it feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what i had expected.  </li>
            <li> This mask just works immanently.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Adovia Facial Mask with Dead Sea Mud 1-2x per week for about a month now</li>
            <li> You apply it with strokes, no circular motion because it makes it harder to spread</li>
            <li> It contains dead sea mud which is packed with over 26 minerals that are essential for skin health to remove toxins while allowing your skin to breathe.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why when I heard about Adovia Mineral&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for my review of the Dead Sea Facial Mask!</li>
            <li> I have tried several Adovia dead sea products.</li>
            <li> So, I have to be careful when using masks.</li>
            <li> I had to get my washcloth, wet it, and wipe the mud off of my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used any type of mask before</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no real way to prevent it either.</li>
            <li> I also use the sulfur soap with Dead Sea Salt by Adovia daily, which I suspect is helping a lot.</li>
            <li> This product has been formulated to handle really harsh skin conditions such as Acne, Oily Skin, Blackheads, Eczema, and Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I will come back and do a product review after a few applications.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 15 min &amp; did a few chores around the house.</li>
            <li> is that it has 2 ingredients straight from the Dead Sea, mud and water from the Dead Sea when it has dried, pulls out toxins that may be present in your skin cells from your everyday diet.</li>
            <li> Judging from the small amounts I&#x27;ve used, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that this was just a bad seal with mine, and not the case with most other</li>
            <li> I am a custom to high end facial products and with this product not being that expensive</li>
            <li> I typically apply it and allow it to dry while I watch t.v. or type</li>
            <li> Instead of a thick mud I got a watery looking grey fluid that spilled.  </li>
            <li> Little irritated but not for long.</li>
            <li> You don’t need to use a lot, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I honestly never had any major skin problems, and I still don’t.</li>
            <li> Takes very little to cover my face and neck, so the 5 ounce tube will last a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other mud mask products but never have I been as pleased.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It allows me to do other things like wash the dishes or eat a snack, before washing it</li>
            <li> Sadly, the tube (packaging) doesn&#x27;t hold up: the precious mud started squirting up through the top seam :&#x27;(  </li>
            <li> The quality compared to other masks I&#x27;ve used is noticeable.</li>
            <li> There are no &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of product that has to be smoothed out on the face as with other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I cover a pimple with this mud the other night before bed.</li>
            <li> and I received this product before it was even due to come.</li>
            <li> Her psoriasis on her legs along with other areas is almost gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, but was pretty skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of facial masks in the past and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I have used alot of other brands of mask</li>
            <li> After rinsing it off, I saw I only needed a small amount of moisturizers on my face and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application: I did like this mask, and I feel like it does benefit my skin in other ways</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell: I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewers are talking about with the &amp;#34;light scent&amp;#34; nonsense, because it smells like I expect mud would.</li>
            <li> but It didn&#x27;t harden as much as other mask</li>
            <li> I often apply a  mask as a relaxing experience other than as a beauty product.</li>
            <li> I mean really dry, like brittle cracking dry; whereas this product doesn&#x27;t dry in that manner, rather it dries but stays supple on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea mud facial mask for a few months now.</li>
            <li> it was super cold and after about a minute my skin started to have a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> As the time goes by, the mask starts to dry and harden to a lighter shade of green.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this mask was not at all irritating.</li>
            <li> This makes a huge mess and becomes very difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find something that actually works</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually feeling like my skin is not so bad for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> It also only requires a thin layer so this bottle lasts a long time.</li>

            <li> It also doesnt show dark spots for when it digs into acne or blemishes like before.</li>
            <li> I used it every day, especially I sleep late.</li>
            <li> Just use a dark washcloth to wash off as it does stain the lighter ones.</li>
            <li> Being in my late 40&#x27;s age is starting to show but this mask seems to tighten my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been addicted to the Aztec mud masks for a while now, but after trying this mask, I&#x27;m completely sold.  </li>
            <li> When you are using the product be careful it can be messy and</li>
            <li> It was messy and although it is a mud mask, I expected that to happen.</li>
            <li> It says once a week or as needed and my old, tired, Mom-Hag face needed another go.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always worried about these types of things irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea is widely known for</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s one review who said Amazon should take the 5 stars down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fortunate (knock on wood) to have very clear skin since childhood aside from those dreadful pores that like to clog up no matter how often or how</li>
            <li> I mean keeping on schedule (once or twice a week and staying faithful to the schedule), the less issues I had the following weeks.</li>
            <li> As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> It was messy and although it is a mud mask, I have used other mask that were less troublesome.</li>
            <li> appeared to have glowing, even olor along with softness and less oily skin throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This product does tingle slightly while it is drying and firming</li>
            <li> I see results almost immediately (within the next few days at least).</li>
            <li> And, I noticed that I have less blackheads.</li>
            <li> This mud mask smells like a typical mud mask but not an overpowering smell.  </li>
            <li> After rinsing her face, she could see immediately the impurities and black heads coming out of her skin.  </li>
            <li> and a half stars</li>
            <li> With the product have noticed less blackheads.</li>
            <li> it seems to be less oily.</li>
            <li> but it did harden slightly</li>
            <li> My pores were even less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I typically use the peel away type masks, but gave this a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s it folks - less than 10 bucks a month</li>
            <li> One night I was sitting in bed watching tv, and when I looked down at my shirt, I had all these little black specks sitting on my chest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not suitable for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what results I should have expected.</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on my face for over 30 minutes and it still wet.</li>
            <li> The mud is a dark brownish green color.</li>
            <li> Created quite a mess.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The texture of the mask was not even - I recommend shaking the tube well before opening to avoid a mess.</li>
            <li> I usually go for hydrating masks at this time of year because we have rough winters</li>
            <li> It has a thick, grey &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; clay</li>
            <li> Had to transfer contents to a glass jar with a tightly sealed lid ...</li>
            <li> Typically when you put on masks, they feel really heavy and dense.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over half a year and have went through a few bottles in that time.</li>
            <li> The principal ingredients in this product are Dead Sea Black mud, Aloe Vera and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> The mask also helps any marks or dark spots left behind from scabs.  </li>
            <li> My face felt refreshed and may have been a little brighter and had alot washed away.</li>
            <li> a little watery</li>
            <li> It made me a little hesitant to want to use it.</li>
            <li> it did tingle a little but didn’t hurt the way some reviews have stated.</li>
            <li> I have notice my pores shrinking some in the little time I have been using this.</li>
            <li> My children asked if I painted on my face, that made me chuckle a little.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any dryness or redness as I have with other products in the past.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on this product.  </li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive when I removed the cap and saw the mask.  </li>
            <li> What little oils I did have in my skin this mask without a doubt pulled them out.</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Mask is made with Dead Sea Black Mud, Beeswax and a combination of Jojoba Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Olive Oil.</li>
            <li> If there were any down sides, it would be that you may get terrified looks from your family, because you look like a sea monster with it on!</li>
            <li> These reviews should be taken down immediately by Amazon!</li>
            <li> Adovia, you never let me down!</li>
            <li> I gently washed it off and splashed my face with cold water.</li>
            <li> The product was already completely dried out in the tube.</li>
            <li> I began to notice after using this product for a few weeks now; using the recommended usage.</li>
            <li> All of the ingredients are are sourced from the Dead Sea.</li>
            <li> Beware any dead sea mud mask you use, will have you feeling itchy while it is drying, it is the dead sea mud, not the brand.</li>
            <li> I get a few breakouts in these</li>
            <li> and it can be too harsh for your skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this mask is made with Dead Sea minerals, with Aloe Vera and Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I have grown up knowing the mystical health properties of Dead Sea mineral-based products.</li>
            <li> She loves all Dead Sea items.</li>
            <li> As it started dried my skin started tightening.</li>
            <li> After the mask dried I noticed the blackheads on my nose are out already.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I waited a while to post a review because I wanted to give it a few weeks of using this product, just to see the outcome, and wait if any changes in my skin would show.</li>
            <li> This mask was made in Israel and contains the highest and freshest concentration of Dead Sea Mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use this Dead Sea Mud Mask once a week</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud has Dead Sea Salt and mud properties that are known to help relieve Psoriasis.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the ADOVIA Purifying Mud Mask for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> The mask is made in Israel by the Dead Sea experts and contains the highest and freshest concentration of Dead Sea Mud.  </li>
            <li> The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask gets my 5 star of approval.</li>
            <li> , it made my skin softer and brighter and healthier and easily dried a few acne that I had around my chin</li>
            <li> I tried this product a few times and it never bothered my skin.</li>
            <li> the Dead Sea Mask was.</li>
            <li> I did not feel like I had a heavy or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; mud mask on my face.</li>
            <li> When I came across the opportunity to try the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t harsh and drying in the drying process.</li>
            <li> It is the color of Mud as it is truly from the Dead Sea.  </li>
            <li> so I have been applying the Dead Sea mud mask on areas that blackhead prone.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Besides the Dead Sea Mud, it contains Aloe Vera, Vitamin C, Beeswax, Jojoba, Evening Primrose and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has aloe, plant oils, and dead sea mud.  </li>
            <li> I just applied the mask and went relaxed while it dried.  </li>
            <li> On my skin, it has always promoted a few pimples on my chin and in between my lips and nose...</li>
            <li> After leaving it on my face for a few minutes I noticed the product STUNG.</li>
            <li> I have used Adovia products for a few years.  </li>
            <li> and it was a bit messy  </li>
            <li> It is MESSY as all get out when you wash it off.</li>
            <li> When I was looking up google for skin care products made of dead sea mud, I came across Adovia products.</li>
            <li> I received the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask to do a review&lt;</li>
            <li> Within three days, I had zero effects left behind from redness to swelling</li>
            <li> but I shower everyday, so</li>
            <li> I did like the way it felt as it dried.</li>
            <li> can’t wait to repeat the Adovia Purifying Mud Mask again in a few days.</li>
            <li> I placed a thin layer on my skin and left in on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have to scrub to remove the mask after it dried.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit messy and can squirt out a like liquid</li>
            <li> I use it about 1-2 times a week ( usually in the evening when I&#x27;m not rushed for time).The coverage does not feel as heavy as other mud masks that I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> and it costs a lot less than going to the spa!</li>
            <li> My face felt cleaner and less greasy for a few DAYS afterwards, too!</li>
            <li> In the past, the masks I have used have caused my face to feel extremely tight, but I didn&#x27;t have this issue with this mask.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a dramatic different with just 4 uses.</li>
            <li> For the past few weeks, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask.</li>
            <li> I have always been self conscious of my skin, trying all types of products, only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of Dead Sea Mud Masks in the past and they have been somewhat harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> The second bottle is very bad comparing to the first one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel too tight or crackly!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad when you wash it off...</li>
            <li> But a year ago, I had a pretty bad case of break out...</li>
            <li> I noticed for a few days after I used the mask my face was not oily like it usually is.</li>
            <li> so I need to slow down</li>
            <li> With time, I started getting better at differentiating what a clay base is and what mud is classified as, because I would get confused.</li>
            <li> Thick, creamy and hardened after 15-20 to give my skin that tight feeling.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t mind, but this mud mask did very little for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> It is messy when you wash it off and somewhat hard to get off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to apply a mask while you trying to avoid sections, but not with Dead Sea mud.</li>
            <li> usually apply this about 15-20 minutes before my shower.</li>
            <li> If you have acne or just small pimples it closes your pores and purges out oil, etc.</li>
            <li> like I usually have.</li>
            <li> It’s produced in small batches to ensure</li>
            <li> It not only lessened the excess oil, but it improved troubled areas, and has my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do know way back in the beginning, it was a weird feeling</li>
            <li> I know I don’t look like my usual self</li>
            <li> Not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be</li>
            <li> It is a squeeze tube and no more contaminated it.</li>
            <li> I usually use Origins, but wanted to give this a try</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thirdly and most annoyingly, they KEEP EMAILING ME to ask me to review the product -- which makes me want to give even fewer stars!</li>
            <li> I usually leave it on for about 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I had a small reaction  on neck from it, but it  worked wonders on my chin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Most products had reviews complaining of horrible scent to the products or a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> The mud comes in a small squeezable tube, the mud is a grayish color.</li>
            <li> I been using it past three weeks</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy mud masks they are very heavy</li>
            <li> It is very messy, a lot of watery stuff in the tube before you can get to the mud.</li>
            <li> You hardly realize it is there aside from the purifying tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> It never dries up and get hard.</li>
            <li> I applied it and washed it off right away because it burnt so bad!</li>
            <li> cuz my face has been oily and broke out lately..</li>
            <li> I also have a lot of stress lately and that does a number on the face.</li>
            <li> I used to have oily skin, but in my late 20&#x27;s my skin started to change.</li>
            <li> hoping to get at least 6-8 months out of this tube</li>
            <li> It dries in 10 or so minutes, depending on how thick you apply it.</li>
            <li> I felt like it was too thick.</li>
            <li> I used water to help apply it because it was so thick that it felt like it was scratching my face.</li>
            <li> The color of the mask looks like mud and has a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> I tried it with thick layer and didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> It goes on thick</li>
            <li> My product was thick and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I put a thick layer on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> if I’m stressed because I don’t have my usual glow or comment about how dull or tired I look.</li>
            <li> horrible, I tried because I loved the very expensive Vivo products,&lt;br /&gt;THIS</li>
            <li> when i was waiting for the mask to dry, my face felt a little bit irritated, but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is very unpleasant (very close to sewage).</li>
            <li> I hate when a mud mask dries to concrete on my face, leaving me with a stone face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask does smell slightly of aloe vera, but it&#x27;s really faint.</li>
            <li> After I did this mask, my skin felt drier without being tight or uncomfortable, and the about-to-breakout feeling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you would go to a spa, a dead sea mud mask could run you on the expensive side.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone who is obsessed with dead sea mud for its healing/detoxifying properties.</li>
            <li> Which is not particularly good.</li>
            <li> and after a few passes of a toner-soaked cotton ball, I looked like I&#x27;d just returned from an expensive spa facial!&lt;br /&gt;Adovia</li>
            <li> Lately, my skin has broken out with these tiny, annoying pimples.</li>
            <li> I have pretty nasty acne for my age ad</li>
            <li> Very hard to wash off though.</li>
            <li> I splashed little cold water (from the tap) on my face to close/shrink the poses.</li>
            <li> when I went to wash it off though, my face felt a little numb.</li>
            <li> it started to get a bit irritating</li>
            <li> The mask had also leaked all over the box, which was frustrating.  </li>
            <li> just a thin layer does wonders.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To use the mask you spread a thin layer onto your skin</li>
            <li> You need a thin layer of it</li>
            <li> Its frustrating.</li>
            <li> I applied a thin layer onto my face and felt a tingling like my skin was on fire that was over under 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> it is broken at the bottom of its package.</li>
            <li> The directions say to apply it thinly, which is a bit difficult to do, because it is rather thick, which is what you would expect from mud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other masks do.</li>
            <li> take these reviews seriously! -</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not seeing any dramatic results</li>
            <li> I think some of the residue might be inside the pores - which is not good!</li>
            <li> The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask got rid of my acne without any bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Goes on thin, dries without being uncomfortable, sand leaves skin silky.</li>
            <li> Poor/ inferior packaging made this product useless.</li>
            <li> 2nd tube was received as part of a promotion &amp; it was awful.  </li>
            <li> and I am addicted!  </li>
            <li> unfortunately I have to admit nothing happened.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> but after trying this mud mask it has approved it wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the expensive $65 jars of mud mask from the cosmetic retail stores and will not be wasting my money for the name again.</li>
            <li> Although I had not tried this product before, I was skeptical but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like it&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s not.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels weird after application.</li>
            <li> Expensive too, for the side effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please understand that I am not bothered by the mere fact that the mask is watery and stings my face.</li>
            <li> She was initially skeptical about this product’s claim that it removed impurities from the skin</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell to it too.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed by this.</li>
            <li> Any product that gave a hint that it may work was too expensive to continue for an extended period.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for my skin.</li>
            <li> you want be sorry .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a redhead, and it&#x27;s very tough to find skin products that won&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
            <li> the tip of my nose annoyingly tends to accumulate a bunch of little blackheads and this mask, after just a couple of uses, all but eliminated them!</li>
            <li> This is a serious product !!</li>
            <li> Bonus, you look like the creature from the black lagoon while it&#x27;s drying, scares the crap out of my toddlers!</li>
            <li> the negatives outweigh any positives I&#x27;ve noticed...and it definitely stinks.</li>
            <li> I use cold water.</li>
            <li> When i started using it, my face was breaking out like crazy because of hormone changes after having a baby.</li>
            <li> Suspecting it is fake product!</li>
            <li> terrible product , extremly hard to get off your face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this one I just received went bad or what,</li>
            <li> my aunt with cancer &amp;#34;I get facials all the time because my skin is so bad from the chemo</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t painful</li>
            <li> I tend to get really painful acne around my hairline and forehead</li>
            <li> I did try using it to see if maybe the formula had changed &amp; it burned my face :(</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 star, so try it for yourself you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Give it a shot you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this product.</li>

            <li> but beware of the horrible sulfur smell when rinsing from face.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I squeezed the bottle and the back blew out, but I like the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this mask for my mother and she absolutely loves it! I have always been a huge fan of products from the dead sea, so that&#x27;s the main reason why I got this. But I also liked the fact that it contains aloe vera and Vitamin C. This stuff is is easy to apply and is very smooth. It dries in 10 or so minutes, depending on how thick you apply it. It has this great cooling effect which my mother and I find very refreshing. I love it because you can kinda feel that its working. After it dries and it&#x27;s time to take it off, it washes off very nicely and leaves your skin feeling very clean and fresh. It&#x27;s really, really great stuff! This huge tube will last you forever so it&#x27;s totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received for testing and review. All thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I received the Adovia Mud Mask for free in return for writing a review on the product. I have very dry skin and used the mask on my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Mask was easy to apply and remove - not very thick like so masks and washed off easily without a need to scrub&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Not suitable for dry skin. The mask stung my cheeks (an area on my face that tends to be more dry)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the product for people with dry skin. For future uses, I will likely just apply to my T-zone.</li>
            <li> Great Mask, love it !!</li>
            <li> Weekly facial mask...good idea. This smells really great, not quite sinus clearing but getting there. Your skin does indeed look amazing immediately after you wash it off.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff! This product is really nice.</li>
            <li> I love it,leaves my face feeling clean and hydrated this is a MUST BUY for the price especially it&#x27;s awesome can&#x27;t get a better deal</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this cuz my face has been oily and broke out lately.. after I received it I went to reading some reviews.. (I know I should have done that first) well some of the 1 stars say that is was liquidy and burned their face. So here&#x27;s my review after trying it. I LOVE IT! It does not burn my face what so ever. It was NOT liquidy at all. it actually makes my face feel great &amp; fresh, I highly recommend it. There&#x27;s one review who said Amazon should take the 5 stars down. Well, I paid for my product and I highly recommend it to anyone! People need to realize that not everyone has the same skin type, and what works for me may not work for you! But there&#x27;s only 10 1stars compared to almost 400 5stars so that should say something! I&#x27;m personally glad that I purchased it!!</li>
            <li> I ordered it using my husband&#x27;s account.  Very happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;Skin tone looked dull after  catching cold.  However, after my first application, my skin tone was revived.  My face tone was alive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend to anyone to use this product if you want a brighter and revived complexion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne, however; I do have large pores and this is like a day at the spa. It tightens your face, makes the pores smaller. I do have eczema and psoriasis and it is helping to clear those patches also, which is a blessing since it is unattractive to have dead skin flaking off or building up in certain areas of your face.</li>
            <li> This was shipped quickly and packaged nicely. It goes on your face so smoothly and feels great. It is relaxing to use and I saw a difference in my skin after one use. It shrank my pores and softened my skin in one use. I love it. I cannot wait to see what a difference it makes after several uses.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best mud masks I  have ever used. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and refreshed after using. The 13 year old has used it as well and it has done wonders for her blackheads. Her skin looks so smooth after using. Very easy to apply and remove. I will be purchasing another after we finish this.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely loving this mask!  It has done some great things for my skin the couple of times I have used it.  I notice it is so much softer, it is addressing some problems with clogged pores, etc.  I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.I have used different masks before, but this is by far the best so far. You do not need to pile it on like most. You only need a thin layer, smooths on easily and it did no&#x27;t flake off all over your cloths. Dries quickly and washes off easily. No scrubbing needed like some that I have used. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth and my pores are barely visible. Has a light clean scent which I like. Tube says use 1x a week for best results. Takes very little to cover my face and neck, so the 5 ounce tube will last a while.</li>
            <li> Love this mask. Leaves my skin feeling super clean, soft,smooth, bright and visibly shrunk my pores.</li>
            <li> This is actually a really great product. It left my skin soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED OPINION AS WELL!</li>
            <li> As a dead see products lover I really like this facial mask, it works great and leaves the skin clean and soft. I hightly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Wow!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff makes my skin so soft!!!</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. I&#x27;ve only used it once, but loved the results.</li>
            <li> Love this, makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this mask before and the one I recently received is quite different.  The consistency is completely different and so is the color.  I&#x27;ve used many dead sea mud masks and all of them stung a little when applied.  This one does not sting at all.  The previous Adovia mask I purchased before looked exactly as pictured, same color and consistency, this one I just received is completely different.  I don&#x27;t know if this one I just received went bad or what, but I highly doubt there&#x27;s any dead sea mud in it.</li>
            <li> I like this mask a lot. It&#x27;s easy to use, dries quickly on your face, only squirts out enough for a thin layer (I usually glob too much mask on my face unevenly with other brands), and works with my adult-acne-prone fair, sensitive, oily skin. I like it and I&#x27;ve tried many masks. This one I will reorder and I don&#x27;t do that often (as a products junkie there is usually something newer &amp; better out there). It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it doesn&#x27;t claim to be. As far as masks go, this is a good one. If you&#x27;re on the fence about it, I say absolutely go for it.</li>
            <li> Noticed a big difference in the first use. My face felt refreshed and may have been a little brighter and had alot washed away. Nice little tingle while it&#x27;s drying and tightens up. We&#x27;ll see how it does with clearing in the long run! Smells pretty bad when you wash it off...like....mud :)</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it really helps with blackheads and pimples, it also leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift package.  I had not checked in with the individual on the outcome.  If there was a problem, I know they would have contacted me.</li>
            <li> When I went to squeeze the tube for the first time, the crimped end blew apart. The product was already completely dried out in the tube. Poor/ inferior packaging made this product useless.</li>
            <li> This mask will deliver results like no other.  It does what it says.  I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have never been an avid user of mud mask but I decided to give it a try.  I began to notice after using this product for a few weeks now; using the recommended usage. That the acne on my face has been clearing up.  I recommend trying out this product, i&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find it as helpful as it was for me.</li>
            <li> BOTTOM OF CONTAINER JUST STARTED LEAKING OUT OF BOTTOM OF SEAM</li>
            <li> This is the best mask I have ever used. I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in my skin in the last 3 weeks of using this product. I can literally see oils being pulled out of my pores once the mask dries up and my skin looks brighter and fresher after using.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have to be careful with the products I use to avoid breaking out in hives. I&#x27;ve tried other mud mask products but never have I been as pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any redness (or hives) while using this product. It has a nice smell, and it goes on easily. It also only requires a thin layer so this bottle lasts a long time. Packaging states about 30 uses which is almost two months the way I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply this about 15-20 minutes before my shower. It leaves my skin soft and washes off easily. It is well worth the investment. I also use the mud soap and love it! Together these would make a great addition to a gift basket!</li>
            <li> Makes you feel clean after you clean the mud off LOL</li>
            <li> I think I got a chemical burn on my face because of this! I applied it and washed it off right away because it burnt so bad! My skin is still recovering from this. I used a yogurt mask right after to help with the burn.</li>
            <li> I have loved every single thing in the Adovia line from their soap to their shampoo and conditioner.  The mud mask is no exception.  Leaves the skin very soft and clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received this mask free for writing a review.  The product was shipped and delivered quickly, and the tube is very attractive in blue and white.  I was a little skeptical when I first removed the top and saw the color, a brown mud color.  I don&#x27;t know what i had expected.  I put the mask on and it felt nice and cool to my face.  But I did not like the smell.  I first of all splashed water on my face to remove the mask, then used a bath cloth to wipe away any that remained.  The brown color would not rinse out of the cloth, but might come put in the laundry.  My skin felt really soft and smooth and pores did not seem as large.  I didn&#x27;t enjoy using the product because of the smell and the color.  However I will try it again because of the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> I got 2 tubes.  The 1st was a gift &amp; was amazing.  It cleared my skin &amp; made it feel soft.  I could go without makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2nd tube was received as part of a promotion &amp; it was awful.  Instead of a thick mud I got a watery looking grey fluid that spilled.  When I shake the tube I can hear sloshing.  I did try using it to see if maybe the formula had changed &amp; it burned my face :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order this product because the mud stuff is amazing BUT if you hear water moving when you shake it then return ASAP.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this mud mask, I love that it does not dry your skin after you remove it, as you have to with some other purifying mask, this one keaves your skin feeling flawless, it does not minimize pores but it does really deep clean them so they are not so aparent. I also love how easy application is as it comes in a tube and you get a long strip of product with one squeeze so it is very easy a clean to apply. If you have oily or dry skin this will be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> sure makes your face feel great.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my Adovia Mud Mask! It arrived in good time and was in great condition. All of the ingredients are are sourced from the Dead Sea. I love the smell of the mask. It smells fresh and clean. It is made with all natural ingredients , such as, Dead Sea Black Mud, beeswax, olive oil, evening primrose oil, and jojoba oil. The directions are simple and easy to follow. In less than a half an hour, I can complete a wonderful spa treatment right at home and it costs a lot less than going to the spa! I love this product and how smooth and clear it makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask. I have oily skin and it makes my skin feel amazing! It doesn&#x27;t smell bad like other masks do. I am VERY pleased with the results and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I find this very moisturizing for a mud mask which is a good thing since the one I normally use tends to dry my skin out no matter how little I use. I can tell that this one has emollients because it feels almost like a lotion during application and as you rinse it off even though it dries down to a certain stiff texture. It also doesn&#x27;t get as unbearably tight as other masks I have experienced and I love how it makes my skin look after. To read my full review go to thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was sent this product to try out and review.</li>
            <li> Dead Sea Mud Mask is awesome. Is very easy to apply. Right after applying it  I can feel the cooling sensation and little tingling on my skin. This mask just works immanently. About 10 minutes pass I can&#x27;t move my chicks. My skin was shrinking. I kept the mask for 15 minutes. I removed the mask with warm water. My face fell very clean and smooth. Little irritated but not for long. Definitely I used moisturizing cream after 30 minutes from removing the mask. I love how my skin feels and looks after.&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask is 100 natural  detoxifier and purifier that come from sea. Contains many minerals that are good for skin. Mask absorbs excess oil, dirt any toxins from your skin. It helps restore an even skin tone for a smoother complexion.&lt;br /&gt;Great for someone who has acne or very oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Very smelly face mask;leaves a huge ring in the tub if you use it in the bath; I just haven&#x27;t seen any difference with the product that would make me buy it again..the negatives outweigh any positives I&#x27;ve noticed...and it definitely stinks.</li>
            <li> horrible, I tried because I loved the very expensive Vivo products,&lt;br /&gt;THIS feeds off their reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU WILL LOOK MUCH OLDER, and extremely dry skin.  I looked like a sea turtle.  Thought about giving another try but just don&#x27;t want too.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. It does exactly what is it meant to do. No perfumes or dyes to interfere with the purity of the product. If you want a straight forward honest product this is it, if you prefer pretty colors and flowery smells then this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. super love it thank you very much</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and comes of clean. I love the way my face feels after I have rinsed it off in the shower. I would recommend this product especially for those who do their own facials.</li>
            <li> I do not have the clearest of skin, but I do like my face masks. Beware any dead sea mud mask you use, will have you feeling itchy while it is drying, it is the dead sea mud, not the brand. This is very easy to wipe off, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. The coloration in my skin improves after use as well. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided</li>
            <li> Works well. Saw improvement in my skin. Very hard to wash off though.</li>
            <li> My wife enjoys this product immensely, and her son is smooth and radiant after use.  Customer service was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I really like this mud mask. It definitely seems to work with minimizing my pores and I love how my skin feels after I use it. I have only used a couple of time but I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff i got this through brand backer and its amazing!</li>
            <li> This product is a great product to control and get rid of breakouts, this product firms and tightens my skin, I also use it on my neck, shoulders and chest as during the Spring transition I get a few breakouts in these areas.&lt;br /&gt; I noticed within a week of use my skin appeared to have glowing, even olor along with softness and less oily skin throughout the day. This product does tingle slightly while it is drying and firming but it is very tolerable and definately worth the results. This product has some very powerful amazing ingredients in it, containing dead sea water, dead sea mud, chamomile, aloe, and sunflower which are only some of the amazing ingredients. This product is made in Israel which I love they are using elements from the Dead Sea as a awesome resource to provide beneficial skincare that is really good for you.&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this product is that it has 2 ingredients straight from the Dead Sea, mud and water from the Dead Sea when it has dried, pulls out toxins that may be present in your skin cells from your everyday diet. Your face will feel clean and refreshed. Dead Sea mud has so many uses and has been used in ancient healing practices. I recommend giving this product a try, the bottle is very heavy which made me feel that it was worth every every cent.</li>
            <li> Usually when I buy mud masks they are very heavy but this one was very light on my skin.  When it washes off it does not leave my skin with that stuff feeling I normally get from using masks.  After the wash my face felt clean but soft.  I will definitely purchase this product again. I have been using this product for about 1 week now so will post more as time goes by.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Adovia Facial Mask with Dead Sea Mud 1-2x per week for about a month now and I am addicted!  It is very easy to put on and does not drip or anything, so I am able to go about doing whatever I want without having to worry about making a mess.  It comes off with a washcloth and warm water, and you can instantly see a significant difference in your skin upon washing it off.  My pores are smaller, and my skin tone is definitely more even.  The Dead Sea mud seems to pull out all the impurities out of my skin and leave it soft and supple, and I have noticed it is less oily as well.  I am very pleased with this mask, I have tried many mud masks in the past and most of them were nothing special but this one has definitely become my favorite!</li>
            <li> Awesome product, must try for yourself, makes face feel so good without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works quickly and produces great results. A+++</li>
            <li> i like it. it makes my face soft and calm after use. the first-time i got it, i was desperate and used it twice a day for the whole weekend, and it never dried out my face or anything. i like it and will recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is great as it was easy to use and it feels refreshing doing it. I had never done mud mask before but now I can understand why people were constantly doing it. It is a very smooth but with tiny bumps that feel like dirty. It looks and feels like mud but it does not smell, which is nice. You apply it with strokes, no circular motion because it makes it harder to spread and it can be too harsh for your skin. Leave it on for 10-20 minutes and then you rinse it and your face feel fresh and clean. You do your night time skin care routine and you are good to go. I really enjoy doing this and the product was great and I am glad to add this to part of my nighttime skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is very gentle compared to another I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn’t burn or tingle on the skin when applied nor does it cause my eyes to burn or water.  I can easily sit with this mask on for a good 45- 60 minutes before needing to wash it off. It allows me to do other things like wash the dishes or eat a snack, before washing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this mask is how well it cleans out my pores. I see results almost immediately (within the next few days at least). Every time I’ve used this, I’ve noticed clogged pores comes to the surface. I do hate this purging experience, but it’s nice to know that the product is working and that my pores are getting a good cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also notice that using this on breakouts really dries them out and brings them to a head much quicker - even quicker than my usual benzoyl peroxide spot treatment! I found that this makes a really good spot treatment as well because when the mask dries it becomes really hard and does not come off while sleeping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> I have received a sample of Adovia Purifying Mud Mask recently, and I am so glad to be finally ready to post a review about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that this mask is made with Dead Sea minerals, with Aloe Vera and Vitamin C. I have grown up knowing the mystical health properties of Dead Sea mineral-based products. I still always gravitate towards these products because I believe in the health properties of mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to try this mask out. It is very easy to apply on the face. You can either you your fingers or a sponge. You have to first clean your skin, and I used soothing toner to do that, and then apply the mask on clean skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am over 30 years old, but I still get occasional acne. My pores also tend to be clogged with oils. This mask is really a great find, because it helps to relieve your skin of all the toxins and oils that you don’t need clogging your pores. It also strengthens the skin, and smooths it out. I was so tired before applying the mask, but when I took it off, I felt like I have had a great rest. My skin felt rejuvenated immediately. I kept the mask for 20 minutes, and then used some cleansing cloths and warm water to take the mask off. It was very easy to take off. The mask felt great on the face. When I felt the mask dry on the face, I figured that it was time to take it off, and it took about 20 minutes for the mask to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn’t believe the feeling of the skin after taking the mask off. I felt like a new me. After the mask I applied a moisturising night cream on my face, and I am just so ecstatic I found this product and now I can use it once a week to improve my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review was made possible because I received a free sample of Adovia Purifying Mud Mask, and was able to try it, and am now expressing my honest opinion about it. I am thankful for this opportunity given to me to publish this sponsored post, and I am hoping to be a loyal customer of Adovia mineral skin care for years to come. This product is a keeper!</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of face masks, and this one didn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on super smoothly, and a little goes a long way. I probably use less than a teaspoon for my entire face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries in about 10 to 15 minutes, so its good if you&#x27;re in a hurry. As it dries, it feels like it is pulling the toxins out of your skin and tightening your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash it off with a washcloth. It is a little gritty, so it exfoliates as you rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time I did this mask, my skin felt oily and gross, like it does right before a breakout. After I did this mask, my skin felt drier without being tight or uncomfortable, and the about-to-breakout feeling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask contains aloe vera, so my skin felt moisturized instead of super dry, like how it feels after using a homemade clay mask. I didn&#x27;t even need to apply lotion after rinsing it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is silly, but I love the color of this mask. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample of this mask for the purpose of a review. All opinions are 100% mine.</li>
            <li> It really cleans deeply. My skin is much clearer after two uses.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS MASK!! Sadly, the tube (packaging) doesn&#x27;t hold up: the precious mud started squirting up through the top seam :&#x27;(  Had to transfer contents to a glass jar with a tightly sealed lid ...very worried it&#x27;s going to dry up.</li>
            <li> Love this product and brand. I use it a couple times a week and noticed a positive difference in my skin after the first use. I follow it with the Adovia Anti-wrinkle moisturizing cream and my face looks awesome. I recommend if you are looking for a mask treatment.  Huge plus for me is that it is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> This product seemed very high quality. It made my skin very soft and smooth. This is nice because with my rosacea it usually feels rough. I liked the firmer feel to my skin afterwards as well. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is amazing, it removes impurities and softens your skin. You only need a small amount and it will last you for months. It&#x27;s pure Dead Sea minerals and vegan. Compared to glamglow mud it&#x27;s affordable! A great brand! I was sent this to test but my review is genuine.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth it makes my skin feel after and how rejuvenated it feels. The mask washes off easily and doesn&#x27;t feel drying.</li>
            <li> Use that mask my face its hurt</li>
            <li> I have a problem with acne on my chin. Used this once and it purified my skin. It smells a little funky, but it works and that to me serves the whole purpose. When has this product been my whole life!! Thank you Adovia! I tried this product on my hands which were super dry and red from this winter. Let me tell you, my skin is soft and my hands look healthy again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s thick yet easy to spread.  Pleasant odor.  Comfortable on the skin.  And I do feel like it does a nice job removing impurities.</li>
            <li> Adovia Dead Sea Mask has really helped with my blackheads and tightened my pores. This mask is calming and healing and has reduced my breakouts significantly.</li>
            <li> use it 1 a week to cleanse my face. feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> Smooth and clear skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me.  Used it several times and can not tell any difference.  Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Product is good enough but seller&#x27;s deceptive behavior is maddening</li>
            <li> I used to use a St. Ives mud mask. This is soooo much better! And I feel great about the ingredients instead of using something that has chemicals and dyes in it. Makes my skin feel wonderful and tight!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine, just a little hurting to sensitive skin</li>
            <li> its one of the great products that i would recommend. it clears out my pores and fees good after using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what results I should have expected. I felt like my pores were smaller and my skin felt good. Although I can&#x27;t really say that I noticed any difference in the appearance of my skin on a daily basis. Some of the reviews thought that it was runny. I think that&#x27;s because they do not shake up the bottle thoroughly before using it. I felt like it was too thick. I used water to help apply it because it was so thick that it felt like it was scratching my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law. She loves all Dead Sea items. She insisted I try it as well. The quality compared to other masks I&#x27;ve used is noticeable. It goes on smooth and wipes off easily. My face felt amazing afterward and had a healthy glow! She loves the product as well. I will be purchasing my own now too! The shipping was super fast and came in perfect condition. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to test and review. The mud mask dries fast, it feels weird, but cool as well. The only problem, which isn’t really a problem at all is that it’s a bit itchy and if you accidentally itch your face or where ever you’ve put it on, the ‘dust’ from the mask goes everywhere. But that’s not really a bad problem for me. I’m not sure how to explain what it smells like, because to me, the mask doesn’t really have a smell. The mask made my skin feel wonderful and soft, even my mother said that my face looked different after using it. I will need to buy this, along with the Mineral Toner and Moisturizing Cream.</li>
            <li> This was a free item to try. I normally don&#x27;t buy facial masks but I do use their other product &amp;#34;Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice African Black soap&amp;#34; and I like that.  I have been using the facial mask once a week for a couple of months and did notice that it keeps my skin from breaking out and feeling greasy.  I would recommend it as it does what it claims.</li>
            <li> This is LITERALLY my new favorite thing ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been addicted to the Aztec mud masks for a while now, but after trying this mask, I&#x27;m completely sold.  I feel like this is the same idea, but it&#x27;s already mixed up for you, you can apply much thinner, and I cannot even express how incredible your face feels afterwards.  I&#x27;m looking forward to using this a couple of more times in the next few weeks and updating my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as for now, its my favorite! Goes on thin, dries without being uncomfortable, sand leaves skin silky. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this company&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;I use mud masks about 3 times a week and have very sensitive skin. This product felt a little burning/ stinging sensation when i applied it, although it didn&#x27;t make my skin red or anything and i had a minor breakout after the 2nd application. It did however leave my skin very, very soft.</li>
            <li> Left my skin feeling smooth and tightened. I also really like the smell of it, which is just a light fragrance. It spread very easily and tingled slightly while drying. It washes off easily and I didnt feel like it dried my skin out. Overall, very happy. I have larger pores, so I try to use a mask at least once a week, twice on a good week. A little goes a long way with this, so this tube will last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I received this offer, when it arrived the packaging was great, I was shocked at how big of a free sample I had gotten. I used it that evening as the direction stated,(10-20mins) and I cleaned my face, but my experience was not anything of a difference. I tried another time this time I left it on for 20 minutes and still not much of a difference. Tried again hoping for something, this time over night and unfortunately I have to admit nothing happened. I didn&#x27;t feel a pull of pores cleanse or dry affect and it has a strong odor. I didn&#x27;t benefit from this product so because it was free and I&#x27;ve had good experience with their bath salts I gave them 3 stars sorry Adovia but this isn&#x27;t very effective for me.</li>
            <li> I cannot explain how amazing this mask is! I ordered it before but the free one I received seemed to have a different texture, slightly gritty and with a shiny emollient (probably the olive oil). The old formula was awesome but this new one is just pure amazement I use it every day and I found that it might dry my skin if I use it every day so I need to slow down but sometimes that doesn&#x27;t stop me that&#x27;s how amazing it is. If you have acne or just small pimples it closes your pores and purges out oil, etc. I always wash my face prior to use. Thank you so much adovia for a wonderful mud mask!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend. she said it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Amazing mask! Nothing else out there that I love as much!</li>
            <li> Great product... Leaves your skin very soft and really does take all the dead skin off... Would highly recommend and I will be buying again</li>
            <li> The Adovia purifying dead sea mud mask is luxurious and rich and absorbed nicely into my skin. The mud goes on smooth and has a sweet earthy fragrance that enveloped my senses. I really love that this mud is in a convenient squeeze tube that makes applying it that much easier and less messy. I left my mask on for 15 minutes (it turned into a nice chalky earthy green color when it dried) and rinsed it off with warm water. My skin looked renewed and plumped with a very nice ‘glow’. Even the texture of my skin felt smoother to the touch. I really appreciate using quality beauty products and this mud mask has proven to be just that to me. On a side note, this product did not irritate my skin at all like many products do. I have hypersensitive skin and found I can only use products with the purest and finest ingredients. I’m happy to give this product a home in my cabinet. I received a complimentary sample of this product to try in return for a written review of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I love this mask.  It felt wonderful when I put it on as well as once I washed it.  My skin was so soft and felt clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> So i bought this product hoping it would be something amazing based on all the great reviews. For me i just dont see the magic happening. The consistency of it is too liquidy and makes a big mess. I prefer more of a thicker, clay type mask because it is easier to apply and you can feel that you have product on your face; where as Adovia is more on the watery side and applying it to your face makes you feel like youve hardly put enough. As far as removing blackheads, this product doesnt Cut it for me. After using it i didnt feel unclogged and i didnt see changes.</li>
            <li> Love this mask. Easy to use and my skin feels so nice after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Adovia Dead Sea mud facial mask for a few months now. My skin feels better than it has in years! I&#x27;ve always taken care with my skin and frequently try new products. This is one product I can honestly say I would like to keep in my mask rotation for a long time to come.  The very first time I used the product, I made a mess however. Be sure to knead the product a little before opening and trying to apply for the first time; then hopefully you won&#x27;t squeeze out tons of watery liquid before actually getting the mud mask out. It really is an awesome product though! Makes your skin feel as soft as a baby!</li>
            <li> Thick and a little gritty, this goes on nicely and makes my skin feel amazing after I wash it off. No scent really, just fresh, soft skin! I use it weekly in the hopes that it will keep blemishes away.</li>
            <li> I love the product and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Love it! First of all, a little bit goes a long way, so this single bottle will last a LONG time. Another awesome things to note: Adovia is always cruelty free and does not test on animals. Also, they offer an awesome money back guarantee if you are not satisfied for any reason, so you really can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I have super oily skin, so I was happy to hear that this mask could reduce oilyness and perhaps even make pores look smaller. I applied it as directed, and left it on for around 15 minutes. I have super sensitive skin, but did not experience any burning, itchyness or eye irritation. I gently washed it off and splashed my face with cold water. My face felt super soft, but not tight or irritated. And like I said, a little goes a long way so there is more than enough for it to be used weekly or as needed for quite a while.</li>
            <li> My honest opinion on this product was I really loved this mud mask I have used this brand in the past before and I love all the products including this mud mask. When you are using the product be careful it can be messy and a little watery so shaking it up helps. I love how the product comes on its easy to apply. I love how soft and clean my face felt after I used this product I really loved it. After I removed the mask I used a toner and a&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic Acid Serum and a coco butter cream and my skin felt great.</li>
            <li> This is my 1st time applying mud mask. I was worried how it would feel and affect my skin. I have extremely dry skin and I heard that mud masks are not for dry skin but after trying this mud mask it has approved it wrong. This mud mask is all natural. I have acne on my forehead, cheeks and chin area. Which leaves stain afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The mask comes in a tube. It is ready to use. I have seen some mud mask where you get the dry clay and you mix it with water. So this is not the case here. You get ready to use mud mask. I used my fingers to apply it. I washed my face and removed the oil or moisturizer I had on my face.  I tried this mask for 10-15 mins. As it started dried my skin started tightening. I have blackheads on my nose, big pores on top of cheek bones. After the mask dried I noticed the blackheads on my nose are out already. (You can see that in my photo with zoom in).&lt;br /&gt;I washed my face with warm water. It is easy to apply and rinse off. No stains on my face or sink. I splashed little cold water (from the tap) on my face to close/shrink the poses. My skin was so smooth, soft and clear. All of the sudden my face was looking so fresh and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;I must say it is a wonderdul product. Im looking forward to use it on weekly bases. Now I dont have to spend $50-$100 in the spa any more.&lt;br /&gt;Also please read the instruction before applying the mud mask so you know what you need to do.&lt;br /&gt;I am 100% satisfied and amazed with this mud mask. I would highly recommend it for all the skin tone. I received this mud mask on a promotion discount to give my honest opinion however it didnot affect my thoughts. Im free to write my personal experience.</li>
            <li> I actually use it as a scrub, because it is too drying to leave on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost two weeks so far so good 😊</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC Facial Mask!  With my 1st use of this product, I was hooked!  My skin was so so soft &amp; silky to touch after my 1st treatment!  I highly recommend this Mask as it truly is, the best mask of this kind that I have used.  I&#x27;ve already made another purchase for a 2nd unit as I simply do not want to run out of this &amp;#34;Must have&amp;#34; facial product!</li>
            <li> I applied this with a brush because of the consistency of the product which made using and applying the product challenging. It was messy and although it is a mud mask, I expected that to happen. It does stain white towels and unless you use oxiclean/and bleach with hot water it will be hard to remove so try using an old towel or maybe facial wipe? I have used a few of their products before and I am always impressed. I did notice my skin looked very radiant and smooth to the touch. I give it a 5 star, so try it for yourself you wont be disappointed. The only thing I wish this was supplied with was a brush for application</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean</li>
            <li> Facial masks are everything to me!! It&#x27;s great. Just be sure to moisturize after you dunce it off since it usually dries my face out a little. But I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mud mask!  Generous amount of product, and the packaging is nice as well.  The mask does not carry any heavy scent (barely detected any scent at all, which is perfect for me), and has a nice, thick texture that was relatively easy to apply to my face and neck.  I&#x27;m excited to see how it does for my skin over the long haul.  After using it for the last two weeks, my skin is a bit more clear and smooth.  Yay!</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and smoother!</li>
            <li> This mask is fantastic! My skin feels great after using it! Will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to run out definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling moisturized! It comes in a squeeze tube so there&#x27;s no dipping your hands into a jar. The mud mask spreads easily and doesn&#x27;t take too long to dry. The only thing is, I cannot tell visually if it is cleaning my pores and pulling out excess oil as with some other products on the market (the ones that dry to a grey color but then you could see &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; looking spots on your nose and T-zone where the excess oil was pulled from your pores).</li>
            <li> This is a really nice mud mask and has some really great things I love about it. This is the first mud mask I have had that you are able to squeeze easily out of a tube. I like how easy it is to apply to your face and spread out. It dries quickly and I left it on for 15 minutes it started to get a bit irritating so I washed it off. I just think it was too dry that it was causing an irritation. After it was washed off my face was extremely soft and smooth and I no longer had redness in my face like I usually have. My pores also looked a lot cleaner as well. I received this to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> This smells good when I put it on. It makes my all skin feel soft and smooth</li>
            <li> When I first received this product in the mail, I noticed that even though the Amazon outer packaging was undamaged, but the box was damaged.  The mask had also leaked all over the box, which was frustrating.  I contacted Adovia Customer Service, and they immediately sent out another product the next day.  I was pretty impressed with how quickly they responded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many other mud masks, but this one is different for sure.  The Adovia Mud mask is easier to apply and easily spreadable over the face.  There are no &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; of product that has to be smoothed out on the face as with other mud masks I&#x27;ve tried.  It dried quickly, and I rinse it with a wash cloth and warm water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Skin feels brighter, super soft, as well as moisturized!  I love all of the natural ingredients in this product, and this is a great mud facial that I can afford at home without the expensive spa facials that can cost over $100 each!</li>
            <li> I really loved this mask! It was very easy to apply as it wasn&#x27;t really a clay mask but more liquidy. I was able to evenly apply it and also remove from my fingers with minimal issue. Sometimes when using masks I find the mask itself doesn&#x27;t want to wash away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask really hit the spot for me as far as a quick but comfortable mask to wear during a bath or weekly. It definitely helped reduce sebaceous filaments too!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how wonderful this product is. I had read many reviews of a few different brands of Dead Sea Mud masks and they all mentioned how great these masks are and how bad the smell is. I went with this one due to  reviewers posts describing a pleasant smell, and the price was reasonable. So glad I went with this one. I like the smell (mild, pleasant, doesn&#x27;t linger after you rinse it off) and it feels amazing while on your face. It has a cooling factor, making me want to use this mask after a training session. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and it leaves it very soft and feeling refreshed. If I could, I would use this every night.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve always loved mud masks, but have avoided them in the winter months so I wouldn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I recently tried this anyway, and was surprised and pleased at how wonderful my skin felt afterwards. I made sure to follow up with a  moisturizer. There are a lot of great ingredients in this product and it&#x27;s finely made, just be sure you squeeze the tube to mix the clay a bit before you use.</li>
            <li> love how it leaves my face feeling super soft after each use</li>
            <li> Feels so good on my face!! I use it everyday. Have had it for a week, so not that long, but the texture feels amazing on my face.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my face immediately after the first use! I can&#x27;t really pinpoint what looks better about my face but I think it&#x27;s somewhere in my nose region. Absolutely love this product! Only suggestion I can make right now is to be more descriptive with how much you&#x27;re supposed to use. A &amp;#34;thin layer&amp;#34; is pretty general and can be interpreted many different ways.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout. Idk if the formula changed or what, but this made me break out.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this natural dead sea mud mask from Adovia. I have been buying the expensive $65 jars of mud mask from the cosmetic retail stores and will not be wasting my money for the name again. This 5.1 ounce tube is huge and will last a few months if used twice a week. I deal with acne prone skin that is very sensitive. During the first few uses of this mask you will notice a few more breakouts. That&#x27;s actually a good thing. It&#x27;s the mud pulling all the gunk out of your face. Once you&#x27;re out of the purging stage you will notice clearer skin, smaller pores, blackheads disappearing, and healthier looking skin. It helps control oil production as well. I absolutely love the feeling this mask leaves on my face once it&#x27;s washed off. This mask is great for sensitive skin like mine. I haven&#x27;t experienced any burning sensation and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin red. Once rinsed off, it reveals healthier, glowing skin that is so soft you just want to constantly touch your face. (But don&#x27;t do that!) The mud is extremely easy to spread evenly and easy to wash off. I absolutely love this mask and will continue to purchase it. *sample provided for testing and review*</li>
            <li> this product felt very nice on my skin. after washing it off it felt soft and clean but i still needed to moisturize.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soooooo soft and refreshed after using!!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I purchased this product as a promotional sample on the understanding that I shall write an unbiased and objective review;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm well first I had my doubts about this clay product because in the past I have always used clay masks that are applied to the face and then dry on the face, and by that I mean really dry, like brittle cracking dry; whereas this product doesn&#x27;t dry in that manner, rather it dries but stays supple on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that that type of fierce ultra drying of the clay was required in order to just as fiercely draw out the excess oils, toxins, black heads, acne, white heads, free clogged pores etc, etc., from the skin and so I had my doubts that this supple gentle clay would do just as good a job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise it did do just as good a job! My skin felt amazing and my pores on my nose (my problem area) had the same clean, polished effect that I gain from using a good microdermabrasion product or those other hefty &#x27;fierce&#x27; clays that I was just mentioning. I honestly would not have thought that this supple clay would have had the same effect but it has. Perhaps the effect may even be better because my skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dried out and in need of urgent moisturizing as it does after using the other ultra drying clays. What a pleasant surprise! You learn something new everyday!</li>
            <li> I was actually shocked at how soft and smooth my face is after using this mask.  It smells lovely, not overpowering, and you don&#x27;t need to cake it on to get results-- just a thin layer does wonders.  I&#x27;d given up on any facial masks, as I have incredibly sensitive skin, and most skin care products just seem to rip my face up-- this one hasn&#x27;t!!  Actually seems to make my skin feel better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is mild a and smells nice. After using it my skin feels great. I would recommend it to people who love natural products.</li>
            <li> Adovia’s purifying dead sea mud mask pulls out toxins while unclogging pores to rejuvenate skin naturally. It pulls out excess oil while offer beneficial essential minerals. Complexion will improve while reducing blackheads, blemishes, and acne. It is ideal for all skin types such as aiding in improvement to oily skin, blemishes, and eczema.  It’s all-natural, paraben free, with no added fragrance or color. It contains dead sea mud which is packed with over 26 minerals that are essential for skin health to remove toxins while allowing your skin to breathe. It contains aloe vera to balance the natural level of moisture, and Vitamin C for overall skin health. It’s produced in small batches to ensure freshness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mud mask has become my go-to because of the benefits, and how much of an improvement I have seen in my skin since I started using this product just once a week. I waited a while to post a review because I wanted to give it a few weeks of using this product, just to see the outcome, and wait if any changes in my skin would show. Now, if you have oily, or sensitive skin, I am going to recommend this to you. I have a mix of both, and this is why I’m recommending it to those who have similar skin times. It not only lessened the excess oil, but it improved troubled areas, and has my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an exfoliator, and moisturizer all in one, so who could be against giving it a try? I love that it is ready to use, and opens up my pores to remove excess oils, toxins, and any clogged pores. For the summer especially, when my skin is typically overly oily, I am solely using this product when it comes to skincare because of how well it has worked for me. It is 100% cruelty free, and Adovia never tests on animals, which for myself, and many others, is very important. They offer a one year guarantee without any questions asked for money back if you are not loving their products. However, give this a product a try, and I know you will love it.</li>
            <li> I like this mud mask. It goes on smoothly and dries pretty quickly. After rinsing off my skin feels so clean and taut. It makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I received free sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. It makes my face skin moisture and clean. I will suggest friends to try because it&#x27;s a really good product</li>
            <li> I have purchased several Adovia Natural products and I LOVE them all. Great Mask!</li>
            <li> I received this mud mask free to review on my fashion and beauty blog. I decided to leave a review on here as well because aside from the masks I make, this is the second best I&#x27;ve used. It gives me that fresh matte finish with the tighter pores and not shine. My skin feels smooth, not rough. I had no redness after wiping it off. It is a gentle mask to use. I will still us my mask as the primary but this is for when I forget to make a batch. A great back up for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 41-year-old Caucasian female with very oily skin and enlarged pores.  I use this product at least 3 times per week, and it does a great job removing the dirt &amp; oil.  It doesn&#x27;t clear it completely, but yes, it sure does help!  My skin always looks &amp; feels much better after using this.  Sometimes if I don&#x27;t wipe all of the mud from my face I can see where it&#x27;s sticking to the dirt in the pores.  That&#x27;s actually fine with me, because it helps me to locate pores that I can clear-out with my extractor tool.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just used it a day ago, n my face feels great.</li>
            <li> This is the best  mask i ever used! i always knew that dead sea has great product, but didn&#x27;t know its That good. my face feels like a baby! Love it!!</li>
            <li> As a mud mask it&#x27;s too watery for me. I usually leave it on my face for over 30 minutes and it still wet. Don&#x27;t see much improvement on my skin either. Will switch back to Queen Helene after I finish this tube. Update: I cover a pimple with this mud the other night before bed. The pimple was much smaller the next morning. I&#x27;ll continue using it for pimple treatment.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great!!!</li>
            <li> I love the luxurious feeling my skin gets after using a good facial mask. For the past few weeks, I’ve had the pleasure of using the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask. My skin feels great! My pores look smaller, and my complexion is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents do settle in the tube. I recommend shaking the tube and rolling it back and forth in your hands before using it. It comes out of the tube with a thick consistency and has good coverage as it goes on. The product does feel s natural and somewhat gritty. As you apply the mask, it feels like it’s getting to work.  You don’t need to use a lot, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The second bottle is very bad comparing to the first one. Suspecting it is fake product!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer:Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt; I love the packaging of this container. I love how sturdy the tube is. It is very easy to squeeze the product out and it stays clean. The box it came in is also sturdy and does not get banged up when I put the tube back in. The shipping was super fast and I received this product before it was even due to come. That was an awesome plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would go to a spa, a dead sea mud mask could run you on the expensive side. Being a mother, I cant afford one of these in a spa and nor do I have the time. However, I can now get a mud mask that provides the ingredients and results of a $120 facial at home! This mud mask contains 30 treatments which lasts for 3-4 months. This mask was made in Israel and contains the highest and freshest concentration of Dead Sea Mud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this Dead Sea Mud Mask once a week and it helps reduce the oil in my skin and helps with blackheads and pimples. It also makes my skin more clear and radiant. I feel amazing after using this product! In between my weekly use, if a pimple or blackhead pop up I use this as a spot treatment for just that area. I have seen great results in the oil control of my skin as well with the blackheads and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter, who has psoriasis, uses this product twice a week on the areas of the psoriasis. Dead Sea Mud has Dead Sea Salt and mud properties that are known to help relieve Psoriasis. On her legs is where she has it the worst and since using this product along with a great moisturizer we have seen incredible results. This mask helps with the flaky dry skin as well as the redness and itch that come with psoriasis. Her psoriasis on her legs along with other areas is almost gone. Not even medications from the dermatologist gave us great results as this product does. She is a super happy camper as I am also!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product gets a 5/5 from my daughter and I. We will also be purchasing more products from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.oducts from this company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.

            <li> This mud mask is really nice. It makes my skin feel really soft and it feels a little cleaner too when I rinse it away.</li>
            <li> As a beauty junkie I am always looking for the newest and greatest on the market, especially a product that will not break my budget! Throughout the years I have found that face masks come and go and some show results and some do not. I love face masks and the way my skin feels right after using them! I have (yikes...even at 31) acne prone skin that tends to be oily with dry patches in the winter and summer mostly. Skin concerns that are not always easy to deal with. The right face mask makes a world of difference to my skin. While there are many that I love I have not found a mud mask that I stand by 100%, but I think I just might have......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the ADOVIA Purifying Mud Mask for a few weeks now. At first it was the same as any other mask: apply, let dry and rinse off and love your renewed skin. Ok, my skin did feel smoother after my first use but I could not say there was a huge difference. ADOVIA Fast forward 3 weeks later where I have been using the ADOVIA Purifying Mud Mask for a month now and there is a clear difference. My skin is definitely smoother, my acne breakouts have calmed down (not gone completely but way better), and my face is moisturized and I no longer have an oily look to my skin! I am quite happy with this mask and would recommend it to anyone with any type of facial concerns.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft, smooth, and clean after I use this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if you have tried Mud Masks before or not, but if you haven&#x27;t, you really need to try it at least one time. I bet once you do, you will be hooked, just like I was! It is one of the few products that can really make a difference in how your skin feels almost immediately. The first time I used a Mud Mask, I was amazed at how smooth and silky my face felt after I washed all the mud off! So, when I had the chance to review Adovia&#x27;s Mud Mask, I was so pumped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely tell you that once you have the Mud Mask on, it will start to tighten and then you will feel the pull of the Mud tightening your face and you might even experience a slight tingling. I have been using this type of mask for years so I am used to it but I do know way back in the beginning, it was a weird feeling but you will get used to it. That&#x27;s how I know it&#x27;s got the right ingredients and that it is working properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia&#x27;s Mud Mask is made with Pure Dead Sea Mud that has the highest concentration of minerals which is vital for a facial skin treatment glow. The mask is made in Israel by the Dead Sea experts and contains the highest and freshest concentration of Dead Sea Mud.  It can reduce Oil and Blackheads and you will get more clear and radiant skin. It also works great for Eczema and Psoriasis as well due to Dead Sea salt and mud known properties that help relieve Eczema, Psoriasis and acne symptoms.</li>
            <li> DID NOTHING FOR MY SKIN. DID NOT GET RID OF FLAKINESS/DEAD SKIN AND DID NOT FEEL ANY TINGLING OR SMOOTH SKIN. I WILL CONTINUE TO USE MY OLD PRODUCTS. JUST WANTED TO TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THIS ITEM BUT TOO MUCH HASSLE.</li>
            <li> ive been using this product along with the soap for almost a week now and i am very very pleased with the results of it. it leaves my legs feeling very smooth and cleared my psoriasis to half of what they originally were. thanks so much, will be putting up the review this week on my blog.</li>
            <li> it did not do any think. i wish if returned.&lt;br /&gt;no idea why people are  giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a very good mud mask and it leaves your skin tingling while on for a little bit then it goes away. I rinsed it with warm water after the mask had dried and it left my skin very soft. I have a pic below with the mask on. The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask gets my 5 star of approval.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and highly recommend it.  It makes my skin soft and clear.  I use it on a weekly basis to keep the face in check.</li>
            <li> Love love love this. Did I mention I love this? Haha.... But seriously if you want something that feels great on your face and makes it feel clean than I tell ya this is a must but.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the ingredients, mostly because my skin is very sensitive, and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed! It contains mostly natural ingredients, and I love it. It didn&#x27;t irritate or dry out my skin, it smells nice, easy to wash off, helped with my dark spots which I have a lot off. I can&#x27;t wait to try out more of the adovia line.</li>
            <li> An ok mask, comes off pretty easy</li>
            <li> what a effective mask!&lt;br /&gt;I just love “Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask” despite I am very sensitive about my skin but when I used this mask, its result was very obvious, it made my skin softer and brighter and healthier and easily dried a few acne that I had around my chin</li>
            <li> Highly  recommended  perfect  for  all  skin  types</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations it left my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth and moisturized,  my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry at all. I would definitely recommend it and I plan on making this product a must have facial product for me. Although I had not tried this product before, I was skeptical but it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> Since there is no way to contact the seller to report an issue &amp;#34;perhaps a bad batch&amp;#34;, no link to the manufactures website to even ASK if it&#x27;s meant to be like this, I cannot in good faith recommenced this despite promotional pricing.&lt;br /&gt;If there is an issue, I want this handled through AMAZON tracked e-mails as with any item  that needs attention bought here.&lt;br /&gt;LINK to ADOVIA &amp;#34;http://www.adoviaspa.com/purifying-dead-sea-mud-mask/&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no issue with shipment  or seller themselves But the product I received.&lt;br /&gt;NONE of the pictures &amp;#34; including their own promo pics&amp;#34; from some reviewers apply to the actual density , liquidity which brings lack of quantity..&lt;br /&gt;Mine comes out of the tube in a chalky greyish blue  dry substance, almost as dried mud, ok but  when putting it on, all I get is the look of a firemen that handled ashes, there is NO  thick layering possible as seen on pictures, no such deep color and it doesn&#x27;t mix with water to get it thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I would have to use half a tube in layers &amp;#34;apply, dry, next layer apply and so on&amp;#34; to get anywhere close to a mask.&lt;br /&gt;So with that being sad, I am unable to complete this, I love MUD baths &amp;#34;Glen Ivy Hot Springs&amp;#34; this  is NOT even close.&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely have waited for an exchange but no such option is given here.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial, but the opinions in this review are 100% my own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a fair and sensitive skinned girl, I am always skeptical about trying new products. Anything and everything can set off breakouts that I have worked for years to get under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I read the list of ingredients, I knew this was a mask I could try. Beeswax, Dead Sea water/mud, papaya extract, Aloe Vera gel, vitamins a and c, camomile,  sunflower seed and jojoba oil, among other incredibly moisturizing ingredients make this a mask that every girl should have in her skin care regime. This product is also not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask itself is not at all gritty, which was pleasantly unexpected. The tube makes it very easy to get just the right amount, as you only need a thin layer. It goes on smooth and dries in about 20 minutes. After it dried, the mask washed off very easily with lukewarm water. I tried the mask on my hand first (in case of reaction) - it left my hand soft and supple with no itchiness. This truly is a mask for all skin types, as it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for shipping, packaging, and labeling: The product was shipped securely and in a timely manner. The tube comes in an outside box and it was shipped well enough that the box had no visible signs of bending/crushing. The packaging is gorgeous and reminds me of being in a spa with its silver/blue label. The labeling is very clear and professional looking.</li>
            <li> This has been the best mud mask I&#x27;ve bought so far. My skin is extremely sensitive and oily and I usually can&#x27;t use mud masks or creams. Nothing! I tried this product a few times and it never bothered my skin. It made my face feel clean and refreshing. My skin was very soft and it took a lot of the oil out. Love how when you first put it on you get a nice cool feeling and then it turns to a nice warm feeling. Love it! &amp;#34;These are my honest opinions after having tried this product&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This mud mask works excellent for those with acne prone and clogged skin. What&#x27;s great about this product is that it is completely natural compared to many other masks out in the market. If you can achieve the same effect by applying something more gentle on your skin, why not? I recommend using it twice a week, for 10 mins to clear out any impurities with your skin. Right after use, your skin not only feels smooth, but glows radiantly!</li>
            <li> What doesn&#x27;t help to boost your spirits like clean and happy skin? I&#x27;ve been fortunate (knock on wood) to have very clear skin since childhood aside from those dreadful pores that like to clog up no matter how often or how well I clean my skin. That&#x27;s why when I heard about Adovia Mineral&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I knew I had to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions on the bottle: I applied a liberal amount of the stuff (and yes it looks horrible haha but thankfully no scent) to my face concentrating on my T-zone. I highly recommend a cautionary amount whenever first trying new products if you have sensitive skin, especially if you have plans for that evening. Lol. Leave it on for between 20-30 minutes before rinsing it off with warm water and finally splashing some cool water on your face to help close your pores. The great thing about this particular mask is that it spreads like butter and does not crack or become uncomfortable when drying. You hardly realize it is there aside from the purifying tingling sensation. And the result? Very happy skin. I followed up my mud mask with my daily moisturizing cream and my skin felt so clean, soft and happy and was glowing (no makeup)! The company recommends once a week usage for optimal results and it can also be used for spot treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are you waiting for? If you&#x27;ve been looking to test out a new mud mask, I highly recommend giving Adovia Spa&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Mask a try. What do you have to lose with such a great money-back guarantee and those economical prices?</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! Works great!</li>
            <li> love how my face feels after I use this.  so soft!</li>
            <li> i like the feel and texture of this. i haven&#x27;t been using it like i should so i&#x27;m not seeing any dramatic results but it does feel really nice</li>
            <li> I bought this product, but was pretty skeptical. I am so glad that I did. It goes on so smooth, and makes my face look amazing. I feel like my skin looks 100 times better than before using this mask.</li>
            <li> This mud mask is refreshing and worked well on my sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve actually used it on my legs as well. Pleased with the results. I got this for review and to give my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li> This is great for mom&#x27;s spa night in! It has a fine exfoliating quality to it and rises off well. Once rinsed, your face feels cool and refreshed. I am very happy with this!</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorite masks! The formula is really nice. Leave on for 10-20 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t get really tight which is great. My skin felt fantastic after using this product. *sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> This mask had amazing coverage! Thick, creamy and hardened after 15-20 to give my skin that tight feeling. As I washed it off I could feel the tighness still there. Pores felt smaller and actually looked smaller too! finished it off with a vitamin c serum and a spray of rose water. Perfect feeling and I didnt even have to pay someone to do it!</li>
            <li> This is really awesome stuff! I have dry skin and this did not over dry my face. It left my face soft and smooth. I noticed a reduction in the fine lines and my pores. A spa like pampering at home for a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;ll take that any day! I am happy to recieve the Avodia dead sea mask to review. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great! The first day I applied the product I was able to def. feel the difference. I use it daily and my skin feels smoother. I would def. recommend.</li>
            <li> This one work good for my face i likely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I received this to review for free on my blog, you may read my full review here - [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am amazed by this mask.  I use a lot of masks, usually once a week because I believe they are the only thing that can get your skin deep clean and clear out things that are hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this on and let it dry and was amazed at the difference in my skin when I went to take off the mask.  My whole face was smooth, my pores looked smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!!  I am totally hooked.</li>
            <li> Fist I want to complement the company on having such wonderful customer service and extremely fast shipping. Awesome Job!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for my review of the Dead Sea Facial Mask! I have used a lot of facial masks in the past and I must say, none come even close in comparison to the Adovia. This is absolutely the best product I have ever used. Very seldom do I find a product that exceeds my expectations to the point of being in love with the product after the first use, but that is exactly the case with this mask. I was so surprised at how smooth and creamy the Dead Sea Mask was. In the past, the masks I have used have caused my face to feel extremely tight, but I didn&#x27;t have this issue with this mask. It was just an overall very refreshing feeling. It feels so good on my skin that I have actually used it twice this week already and I notice a huge difference in my skin.  I have combination skin meaning some of my skin is oily and some is extremely dry and the mask has really helped to even out my skin. My pores are so much smaller and my skin is soft and smooth. I am happy to report that I didn&#x27;t suffer from any redness or itching as I have with certain masks in the past. Definitely a product that I will continue using. After seeing the effects that the Adovia Dead Sea Facial Mask had on myself, my husband, my son and daughter, I would love to own the entire line of products. I know they would be well worth it. I have never really followed much of a skincare routine, but I would definitely set one with these products as would other members of my family.</li>
            <li> I received this mask to try out, and it is amazing! I wrote a review on my blog stating how good this mask is for anyone who wants to feel refreshed after wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t one of those constraining masks either. If you don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m talking about try out Freeman&#x27;s facial masks. Those always tighten up, and I can&#x27;t smile, or even say anything, this mask on the other hand is like the Body Shop&#x27;s tea tree mask. The thing I love about this mask is that it comes in a big squeeze tube bottle, so you have enough to last you a while. I haven&#x27;t even used up a third of this mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask does smell slightly of aloe vera, but it&#x27;s really faint. Overall I would recommend this mask to anyone who wants a relaxing hour or so!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference when using this, but it does leave your skin with that clean feeling - and that alone is worth it to me! I also love that it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this mask. With every application, my skin felt cleaner, tighter and healthier. It also worked great for my teenage daughter&#x27;s blackhead problem :) I have been telling everyone about how great this product is and I&#x27;m a customer for life! Give it a try... You will love it too!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty blogger and have the opportunity to review several beauty products. Its not often that I am Impressed right from the start with a product. But THIS mask... ITS AMAZING! From the very FIRST use this mask left me in awe!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, after the first use my skin felt amazingly good! Right away, I swear my skin felt so smooth and firmer after the first use! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! After a few more uses my skin cleared up and actually I have not had a major acne break out since using this mask either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose is the main spot on my face with big pores. I am constantly having to deal with black heads and trying to exfoliate to keep my nose looking smooth and clear. However, again, since using this mask, my nose has STAYED smooth and clear, and YES even my pores seemed to have shrunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely am loving this mask, and for the price (only $30) you cant beat it! That&#x27;s only $1 per use! Which is an amazing deal. If there were any down sides, it would be that you may get terrified looks from your family, because you look like a sea monster with it on! ;) haha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in more beauty reviews among other things like makeup looks and fashion, please check out my blog:&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Maria (aka agapelovegirl)</li>
            <li> I hate when a mud mask dries to concrete on my face, leaving me with a stone face.  The Adovia Mineral Purifying Mud Mask is amazing!  It goes on smooth (just a nice thin layer and spreads well!) - you allow it to dry for 10-20 minutes and then rinse off.  Honestly, the first time I used it, I only remembered to go rinse it off because I had set a timer on my phone - if I had not, I likely would not have remembered because it is so comfortable - I did not feel like I had a heavy or &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; mud mask on my face. I think I always thought in the past that you need that to get clean - but this mask leaves my skin feeling clean, healthy and all the extra &amp;#34;ick&amp;#34; is gone!  I will definitely be using this weekly for my own at home spa experience!</li>
            <li> I just began using this Purifying Mud mask and so far I am very pleased.  It&#x27;s easy to use - no long drawn out treatment process. All you do is clean your skin, apply the mask to your face and leave for 10-15 minutes. After the mask is completely dry, rinse with warm water in gentle circles, then follow up with a moisturizing cream.  I put it on before getting in the shower, and do something while it dries (make the bed, change out the laundry, get my clothes ready - anything really - 10 minutes goes by fast) then jump in the shower to rinse off.  Easy!  It&#x27;s too early at this point to say what long term benefits I will gain from using this product, but right off the bat my skin was softer after using it and had a nice &#x27;glow&#x27;.  It was also gentle on my face, and there was NO drying of my skin.  I LOVE that the ingredients are non-toxic, which is extremely important to me.  I recommend this product for anyone looking for a purifying mask.  It also has a nice packaging, and would recommend it for a gift as well. I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 star only because of the short time I have been using it and that I can&#x27;t verify long term results.</li>
            <li> I received this mask for free to try and this is my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan of mud masks, and have tried a ton of different kinds.  I enjoyed Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask and have incorporated it into my ongoing regular beauty routine.  The mask goes on cool and leaves my skin feeling fresh and rejuvenated without the mask feeling uncomfortably tight or tingly.  I also noticed my pores shrunk and my skin had a noticeable glow after using the mask.  It has been great way to defunk my skin after a long cold winter and get ready for summer.</li>
            <li> when i was waiting for the mask to dry, my face felt a little bit irritated, but nothing too bad. when I went to wash it off though, my face felt a little numb. after awhile the numbness went away leaving my skin nice and soft, but it was still a bit strange.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Adovia dead sea products. Their quality is amazing and this product is no different. I use this facial mask in the shower once a week. It doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin and I really appreciate that since I live in a desert climate. After using this mask, I notice my skin is super soft. I will reorder this product many times in the future!</li>
            <li> I was never a big face mask girl. I’ve used them on occasion but I honestly never had any major skin problems, and I still don’t. What I do have is age. I also have a lot of stress lately and that does a number on the face. I have had people ask me if I’m stressed because I don’t have my usual glow or comment about how dull or tired I look. I know I don’t look like my usual self and it saddens me. When I came across the opportunity to try the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask I couldn’t resist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask claims that it reduces blackheads and acne, and serves as an exfoliator and deep facial cleanser. It also claims it leaves skin radiant, younger looking, and smooth. I got it for the “radiant, younger looking, and smooth” claim and I can honestly say it does what it claims! As I mentioned, I have been pretty dull looking. The directions say wash your face, put the mask on for 10-20minutes, and wash off. I’m pretty certain I had it on longer than 20 minutes due to mom duties and simply forgetting it was on. Which brings me to a great point, no irritation. I had no weird tingling, itching, or tightening. I put it on and really forgot about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I washed it off my skin was more alive, very smooth, and felt super clean! It wasn’t dry and still no irritation, itch, or anything of the sort going on. I waited two days and used the mask again, same thing! It says once a week or as needed and my old, tired, Mom-Hag face needed another go. I honestly do love this product and absolutely recommend it for Mom-Hags everywhere! Of course I totally recommend it for anyone who wants clean, beautiful, soft skin, but trust me, Mom-Hags need it more!</li>
            <li> Adovia has some great products, this mask is wonderful! I have used it as a facial mask, body wrap and sometimes just as soap! Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial. &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]&lt;br /&gt;After the first use of this product the results were immediate. Actually while it was drying I could feel it tightening my face up. Once I rinsed it off with warm water my skin felt so smooth and soft and not dry and scaly like usual. I can&#x27;t believe the difference it made after one use. I will definitely be using this 1-2 times a week for as long as I can. Definitely looking forward to purchasing other products by a do via too.&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;lt;a href&#x3D;\\&quot;[...]\\&quot; rel&#x3D;\\&quot;nofollow\\&quot;&gt;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MANY different face masks (mud/clay/pumpkin/etc.) and I like this one because it&#x27;s a little bit different. Typically when you put on masks, they feel really heavy and dense. Even though the mud feels heavy in your hands, it feels really light and airy on your face. Once it&#x27;s on your face it has a cooling effect to it. I like that because it makes my skin feel really refreshed and &#x27;new&#x27;. I also noticed that it is a bit more difficult to tell when it is dry compared to other masks. It never really looks dry, so you just have to gently touch it with your fingers to see if there is any transfer. Not a big deal though! It does take a bit of rinsing (as most mud masks do) to get it off completely. However, it makes your skin feel really clean! It mentions that you should use a toner and moisturizer afterwards. I didn&#x27;t have a toner with me, but I did put on a moisturizer. Many hours later, my face still feels really soft and &#x27;fresh&#x27; Overall I really like this product! So happy to have been given the chance to try this and give my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with this company, not only did they ship the product out super fast to me, but it was also packaged really well and there was no leaking, etc.  I am always hesitant to order products that can easily squeeze out online, but this came packaged so well it would never have to be a worry!&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the best Facial Masks I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot.  I have a really oily T-zone and cystic acne so I am always on the lookout for the latest and greatest products.  It is hard for me to find something that actually works but this mask did the trick!</li>
            <li> I got this product to review. IT was a really good mask. I liked that you didn&#x27;t have to slather on a whole lot to get your face cleaned. It wasn&#x27;t harsh and drying in the drying process. It didn&#x27;t get hard making it unable for your face to move as most masks do. I was extremely please also that it didn&#x27;t dry my face out after washing it off. And I saw a major difference in my face after. I will surely be using this once a week for my acne.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I use it once a week and my skin feels and looks great.  Definitely recommend this mask</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over half a year and have went through a few bottles in that time. My newest bottle is a totally different formula then before?! It never dries up and get hard. It&#x27;s very smooth but doesnt spread evenly now. It also doesnt show dark spots for when it digs into acne or blemishes like before. I dont feel it works as well. No tingling or anything now. I&#x27;m not sure what to think, I will probably try a new mask now!</li>
            <li> Adovia Facial Mask is perfect for those days when coming back from work and feeling the pimples growing on my face. Not only is it tranquilizing but it causes my pimples to be removed and start the next day fresh! Pretty good for those who have a very active day being in all types of places that may carry dirt and germs harmful to your face.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I used it every day, especially I sleep late. This product makes my skin better and really work for acne.</li>
            <li> Before I even begin, can I just say...WOW! One is always a bit skeptical when a skincare product claIms to have so very many beneficial properties...and mud? Really? We&#x27;ve all played in mud as kids! How good can it be?! Let me tell you, this is some magical mud! After washing off the product, my skin all but glowed, it was so refreshed and radiant! My face felt smoother and softer to the touch and just generally CLEANER. All that&#x27;s great but here&#x27;s the truly fabulous part--the tip of my nose annoyingly tends to accumulate a bunch of little blackheads and this mask, after just a couple of uses, all but eliminated them! I mean, my nose was smoother to the touch and, upon close inspection, all but free of blackheads! I&#x27;m beyond impressed! In fact, I&#x27;m taking this product with me to India so that my sister can use it right before her wedding!</li>
            <li> As I have sensitive, oily skin, I am always cautious about trying new products for my face.  The natural ingredients in the Dead Sea mask was what drew me in to try it.  I was pleasantly surprised!  No redness, no irritation, no breakouts.  Nothing but soft, smooth skin.  The grittiness of the mask is just enough of a gentle exfoliator for sensitive skin.  It is also an easy application on and off the face, which is perfect for a mom of a toddler to use!  Once a week is how often they suggest to use the mask and that is about all I can handle.  But it&#x27;s the most perfect suggestion because it&#x27;s really all you need.  My skin looked radiant and felt soft for days!  My oil level also seemed to decrease.  I am very happy with Adovia&#x27;s Dead Sea Mask and am looking forward to trying more of their products!</li>
            <li> i have very sensitive skin prone to acne and i could tell a difference the next day after using it! no irritation, glowy, and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I really don know if its working or not but it makes my face feel soft as a consolation</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love this, really cleaned out my pores. I have an oily face, but also suffer from excema, this mask is actually a perfect mask for whatever balance I have been looking for.  It does not dry out my face, but it does get rid of excess oil.</li>
            <li> I truly love this Mask!!! I like how after you have let it sit on your face for the time as directed that you can add a bit of water and gently use it to further give your face an exfoliation treatment like no other.  It feels very gentle and pure.  It is the color of Mud as it is truly from the Dead Sea.  Your skin will glow and feel so healthy after just one use.  I will definitely be repurchasing this when I run out.  If you are looking for a great detoxing, exfoliating Natural Good for your Skin mask then you have found it right here!!!You will love it!</li>
            <li> The color of the mask looks like mud and has a thick consistency. The mud mask was easy to apply and didn&#x27;t have a smell. This was a huge plus for me because I don&#x27;t like added fragrances.I left my mask on for about 15 minutes before taking it off. I used my fingers to determine if the mask was still dry or wet. I have to say how much I loved the way my skin felt. My skin felt so smooth and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I like about this mask is that it can be used as a spot treatment and blackhead remover. I tend to get blackheads around on and around my nose so I have been applying the Dead Sea mud mask on areas that blackhead prone. And, I noticed that I have less blackheads. I have to admit that this is my new favorite facial mask and that I adding it into my skin routine now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free in exchance for my honest review.  First of all, this product shipped quickly, and was in PERFECT shape when it arrives.  The packaging is high quality - this is a gift worthy product, and would make a fantastic addition to a beauty gift basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin - I break out in hives at the thought of new products, so I am always very careful and hesitant to try new things.  I am happy to report that I had NOT ONE ill side effect of using this product.  It has a nice benign smell, and it goes on smooth and clean.  I actually forgot that I had it on - there is not sticky feeling or &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34; as it dries, which is very nice.  You also only have to use a super thin layer, so this package will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin was baby soft after I used this mask for the first time- absolutely loved it.  Also, it drastically improved the pretty serious sunburn that I had when I used it - it felt cool and nice on my burn and definitely made it less red instantly after removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly, highly recommend this facial mask as a part of your weekly beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I have only tried this once, but I really like it so far. I have sensitive skin, so I&#x27;m always worried about these types of things irritating my skin. But my skin felt great afterwards and didn&#x27;t feel abrasive or irritating at all. It left my skin feeling so soft &amp; moisturized, I could hardly believe it. I definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is that I may try washing my face after using the mask, rather than before. It says to use on clean skin, so I washed my face beforehand, but then I got a couple pimples on my forehead the next day. I think I just didn&#x27;t manage to clean it off completely and some residue stayed on my skin for too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, since it comes in a tube, rather than an open container, it will last longer. My previous mud mask came in an open container and got mold in it after only 3 uses (over about 2 months).</li>
            <li> I adore face masks and have fun experimenting with them. I used to have oily skin, but in my late 20&#x27;s my skin started to change. Now my skin is combination and gets really dried out (particularly in the t-zone and chin areas). So, I have to be careful when using masks. I have to make sure they don&#x27;t dry my face out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Adovia Dead Sea Mask is made with Dead Sea Black Mud, Beeswax and a combination of Jojoba Oil, Evening Primrose Oil and Olive Oil. It also has Aloe Vera, Chamomile, Vitamin A and Vitamin C. It has a thick, grey &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; clay texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the mask you spread a thin layer onto your skin (I just use my fingers to apply it) and leave it on for 10-20 minutes and then rinse off. The mask makes my skin feel cool and tingly. After removing the mask my skin feels really soft and moist. I can tell when it is time to remove the mask because it stops having the cool, tingly sensation and starts to feel tighter. You could also just touch the mask with your finger and see if it is dry. I remove it with warm water and a wash cloth. I love how easy it is to apply and remove this mask. I typically apply it and allow it to dry while I watch t.v. or type reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask is supposed to pull out toxins and impurities from your skin that would clog your pores. I have been using it about twice a week (it is recommended to use it once a week or as needed). Since I started using it my skin has seemed clearer and my pores do look smaller. I have used it about 7-8 times and the bottle is still at least 2/3 of the way full, so this bottle should last for a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this mask and I plan on buying a replacement when I run out.</li>
            <li> I like this product alot. Has helped clear my acne! There isn&#x27;t really a scent and it rubs on easily.</li>
            <li> I try to use this a couple times a month.  It has not shrunk the few large pores that I have, but it does leave my face feeling soft and exfoliated.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of acne, but it seems to clear that up a bit as well.</li>
            <li> Skin is smooth and awesome!</li>
            <li> My face felt so clean after using this mask. A little goes a long way too! You don&#x27;t need to cake it on to work. It also doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell which I appreciate. It came off very easily with a warm towel.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really smooth after I wash it off. Provides a refreshing experience.</li>
            <li> Talk about a nice, soft face afterwards. This is a real nice product, very thick, goes on easliy. Do not use a white or light towel to dry your face, unless you know this stuff is all off,  It stained the material. Other than that, it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and it has done nothing for my skin. The top closure blew open the last time I used it and I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s going to dry out now. Waste of money. Unhappy customer!!!</li>
            <li> Love this mask, it&#x27;s super creamy but has a slight scrub from the salt. I use the mash to exfoliate a little bit prior to letting it dry. Skin is soft and hydrated after use. Bonus, you look like the creature from the black lagoon while it&#x27;s drying, scares the crap out of my toddlers!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest facial ever.  It really shrinks my pores !!!</li>
            <li> This Adovia Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask arrived quickly in a nice box. The 5.1oz tube is sealed inside the lid, so you know it hasn&#x27;t been tampered with. Besides the Dead Sea Mud, it contains Aloe Vera, Vitamin C, Beeswax, Jojoba, Evening Primrose and Jojoba Oil.&lt;br /&gt;The Dead Sea is widely known for it&#x27;s many health benefits and healing properties. It boosts cell renewal, revitalizes your skin and tightens those pesky large pores. It infuses skin with minerals which firms skin and improves elasticity.  The Aloe and Chamomile soothe and calm skin while the Vitamins A, &amp; C leave skin looking refreshed and renewed!&lt;br /&gt;I apply a thin layer, after I shower, once a week. I allow it to dry for approximately 15 minutes, sometimes a few more. While it&#x27;s drying, it removes toxins and unclogs my pores. It also helps skin to look new and young. Once it&#x27;s dry, I remove it by rinsing with cold water, then lightly pat my face dry and apply sunscreen and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent dead sea mud facial mask! Wash your face, apply the mask, let it dry and rinse off, its that easy, your skin will love it!</li>
            <li> wonderful product, deep cleanse very well and shrinks pores. will buy again!</li>
            <li> I used this item the same day i received it, OMG it left my face feeling so soft and radiant, This will def be my staple facial mask. I have used alot of other brands of mask but i think this is finally what i have been searching for.</li>
            <li> I like it. after use it, my skin become smooth than before.</li>
            <li> Lately, my skin has broken out with these tiny, annoying pimples. They&#x27;ve been mostly on my forehead and chin, though some have appeared on my cheeks as well. I don&#x27;t normally use a mud mask, but I thought, &amp;#34;Why not?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some reviewers said that the product exploded a bit on their hands upon opening the top, I did not have that problem. The mud is a dark brownish green color. The directions say to apply it thinly, which is a bit difficult to do, because it is rather thick, which is what you would expect from mud!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, you are supposed to let it set for 10-20 minutes. While sitting there with the mud on my face, I expected it to get very dry and start to crack, but that is not what happened. As it dried, it felt really cool and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting it off of my skin was not as easy as simply, &amp;#34;rinising&amp;#34; it off. I had to get my washcloth, wet it, and wipe the mud off of my face. Once off, though, my skin felt really smooth and my pores were noticeably smaller - my pores are usually really large - or maybe I just notice them more, but in any case, they looked smaller to me. Also, that dry patch that is chronically in between my eyebrows was gone - no flakes or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, after two uses, (you are supposed to use it once a week or &amp;#34;as needed&amp;#34; so I use it twice a week) my pores and blackheads are really getting small and my acne is gone, but for one or two little bumps that aren&#x27;t very noticeable!</li>
            <li> Love this mask. I have had problems with acne since my early adulthood and struggled to find product that was gentle enough on the skin but that reduced my breakouts. I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long but I&#x27;ved use it a couple of times in the last weeks and my skin looks great! I started to see improvements after one use. It is probably one of the best mud masks I&#x27;ve tried. My breakouts seem to be caused my stress and hormones and this works great for me.</li>
            <li> I received this review for free for my unbiased opinion. It was a great mask, it actually did make my face feel firm and was really soft after application.</li>
            <li> Received this product through brandbacker for bloggers and it has become a favorite mask! Great product, makes my skin feel super fresh and soft!</li>
            <li> This is the first mask I have ever used that lived up to its promises.  I have tried many others, only to have them dry out my face.  I looked like a lizard shedding its skin every time.  Not with Adovia; my skin was very soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;The first two times I used it, I thought it was breaking me out.  But it pulled a lot of stuff out of my pores and didn&#x27;t require scrubbing to get it all off.  I&#x27;m a redhead, and it&#x27;s very tough to find skin products that won&#x27;t break me out.  The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask got rid of my acne without any bad reaction.&lt;br /&gt;When you use it, it&#x27;s a good idea to shake and knead the tube to distribute the liquid evenly.  I was surprised to see how far it goes; a little provides good coverage.  I left it on for about 10 minutes the first time, because I thought it might dry out my skin.  After rinsing it off, I saw I only needed a small amount of moisturizers on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I love about this product is that I can identify what&#x27;s in it.  It has aloe, plant oils, and dead sea mud.  It doesn&#x27;t have a lot of chemicals that will do God-knows-what to one&#x27;s body.  It&#x27;s also not animal tested, which is another big selling point.&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it&#x27;s expensive, but it&#x27;s not.  Judging from the small amounts I&#x27;ve used, it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I literally just took this mask off and flew to the computer to write this review. I had a couple blackheads sprinkled across my nose once I removed the mask they had shrunk to non existent. I am VERY happy !! My skin is so soft. You keep it on for 10-20 minutes, the length of a relaxing bath and boom beautiful skin. You need a thin layer of it so this tube will last a while It&#x27;s not tested on animals, I am huge advocate of that. Thumbs up on this product :-)</li>
            <li> Mud masks have often left me dry and feeling a bit withered.  The first time I tried this mud, it was very clinical.  I had the lights on bright, noted how the mud felt as it was on my face, wondering if my face would be red afterwards, and questioned how easy it was to remove.  To my utter delight, the mud felt silky, no skin reactions of any kind, and it came off super easy.    This mud mask must bring out things that are just under the surface because my face feels wonderful with each use and my pores appear smaller.

            <li> Great mask.  It made my skin so soft and wasn&#x27;t drying. I just applied the mask and went relaxed while it dried.  I have really liked the products I have tried from Adovia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did recieve this product thru a promotion for my review.</li>
            <li> I love that this mask is all natural and you can actually recognize &amp; pronounce the ingredients! It&#x27;s easy to use, comes in a very generous size tube...and didn&#x27;t leave any residue/stain on my washcloth or sink when you rinse it off! My skin felt much firmer after rinsing off (use a cool splash of water after &amp; really see your pores tighten up!) and I loved that about it.  My skin was very warm after and flushed/reddened.....and that did last several hours.  I was happy I didn&#x27;t have anywhere to go!!  It wasn&#x27;t painful, it was just &#x27;there&#x27;. The next week I used it, the same firming was there, but the redness wasn&#x27;t as noticeable...and the 3rd week, it was barely a pinkness to my cheeks.  So I&#x27;m sure this was just my skin&#x27;s reaction to having the impurities sucked out of it the first time...but I wanted to mention it because you might not want to try it for the first time before a big date or heading off to a wedding! I rated this a 5 star based on my experience with it after 3 weeks. After the first week, I would have probably given it a 4. I will definitely be keeping up with using this on a weekly basis and, while I did receive this product in order to facilitate a review of it, the above thoughts are my own honest opinion of the product and I am looking into other Adovia products to add to my skin care regime!</li>
            <li> It does not spread evenly. Does not completely dry. On my skin, it has always promoted a few pimples on my chin and in between my lips and nose... My skin feels weird after application. Needs to wash thoroughly many times to remove it. I think some of the residue might be inside the pores - which is not good! Hmm... wish I had better things to say. Expensive too, for the side effects.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.: Smell is very potent too: my eyes and nostrils burn and get irritated just by the smell.</li>
            <li> Wonderful facial mask.  Cleopatra&#x27;s Choice carries the entire line</li>
            <li> First off I wash my face with water and then I applied the mask to my face. When the mask first touch my face it was super cold and after about a minute my skin started to have a burning sensation. I felt like my skin was burning up. For example when you eat pepper for the first time and it starts to burn your mouth well that’s how it felt when I first had the mask on my face. It was about 10 minutes later then when my skin stop burning. This mask dried on quickly on my face. This is a picture of the mask on my mother face. This facial mask draws out impurities, toxins and excess oils leaving your skin feeling soft and clean. Dead Sea minerals nourishes and restores your skin vitality, stimulates blood circulation hence the burning sensation to your skin which results in a wonderful glow. I notice my skin some of the blackheads on my nose was cleared up a bit but it was still there. Overall I really like this product. It does make my skin feel great after using the Dead Sea Mud mask.</li>
            <li> This seller is soliciting positive reviews by giving away free products at a beauty bloggers site called Tomoson.com&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t take these reviews seriously! - over 200 five star reviews in a month!! It&#x27;s unheard of!! These reviews should be taken down immediately by Amazon! Do not purchase this product based on the reviews</li>
            <li> To potential buyers: BEWARE. Unlike many people who reviewed this product, I actually purchased this. When I bought it, I only looked at the 5 stars and was convinced. However, here is my reasoning for the 1 star. When I received this product, I noticed the consistency was very watery and dilluted. I thought that was strange because mud masks are supposed to be thick so they can apply on easily. The product was literally dripping and spewing from the tube. This makes a huge mess and becomes very difficult to apply. I used it anyways and did not think much of it. After leaving it on my face for a few minutes I noticed the product STUNG. I figured it was also just doing its job as a mask. Please understand that I am not bothered by the mere fact that the mask is watery and stings my face. I am bothered because all the 5 star reviews here say that the product is thick, goes on smoothly, has a slightly gritty texture, and not one mention of it stinging my face. This leaves me to conclude that I got sent a mask that was used, altered, returned, or defective. I must say I cannot write an honest review of how well it works, but I am scared to try it more since I feel it not what it is supposed to be. The product I was sent was extremely different from the pictures posted and I will take some pictures of my own as proof. This is something I put on my FACE! I cannot believe the dishonesty in the reviews and how many of them were sent free to the people who wrote the reviews. Even if they are being completely honest, I still feel there will be a heavy bias. I am returning this mask that I do not even know the contents of. This is unacceptable of Adovia to send a product like this to those who actually PAY for it instead of receiving it for free.</li>
            <li> I have used Adovia products for a few years.  I have purchased the pure mud as well.  This mud mask works similarly, but with a moisturizing effect.  It is a mud mask and it will still feel dry after washing off while tightening your skin.  When the mud is drying on my face, it tingles/itches as it cleans and tightens. I saw negative reviews about how it was runny, but having owned the pure dead sea mud, it needs to be noted, that there is a lot of moisture that separates from the mud, so shake or press on the container gently w/o squeezing it too much to allow the moisture to mix back into the mud.  It does help w/ closing my pores on my forehead and nose.  I don&#x27;t have acne prone skin, but this mud mask definitely helps me as a general skin care to help revive my skin when it seems dull.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> So i received this today after only waiting 2 days and heard so many positive reviews that i figured I&#x27;d give it a go tonight. First impression, I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but it freaking stung! Has anyone else have this problem? Not sure if that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s suppose to be but it stopped once the product started to dry. This is my FIRST time but I will eventually come back and update my review if I see/feel any changes.</li>
            <li> terrible product , extremly hard to get off your face. If ANY THING IT MAKES YOUR FACE DARKER ! it will clog you sink because when you wash it off the mud get stuck in the drain.it doesnt help acne at all !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now. (I use it twice a week) . You can feel it working when you apply it to your face. You can feel your face tighten. It also leaves my face smooth and less oily. Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> First off I loved the clean packaging, then I read the ingredients and I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;I mean all of the ingredients in the mask are awesome and good for you, also its not tested on animals!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to mud masks drying up my face but this one left it clarified and touch-ably soft :)&lt;br /&gt;I can go on and on but you&#x27;ll have to try it for myself &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I have acne and this didn&#x27;t make me break out. :D</li>
            <li> Most of us know the benefits of skin products containing Dead Sea Mud. The principal ingredients in this product are Dead Sea Black mud, Aloe Vera and Vitamin C. Other ingredients, such as Evening Primrose Oil, Olive Oil, Jojoba Oil combine to provide deep moisturizing. After using this product to clean and nourish my skin, my sensitive and combination skin feels soothed and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of this product to produce the desired effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mask works well in a short amount of time. Most of the time, I use it in the shower. After cleansing my skin, I apply the mask, leaving it on about 6 minutes before rinsing it off with lukewarm water. I also splash my face with cooler water to finish - before applying moisturizer.  Other times when I have time, I leave the mask on longer - and have my own &amp;#34;spa&amp;#34; moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat customer of this seller. The company provides excellent customer service and their products are great values! All of my purchases from this seller gets a five-star rating for customer service, price, products, free samples and their reward program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product works great but beware of the horrible sulfur smell when rinsing from face.</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is way more trouble than it&#x27;s worth. Tried it on blackheads on my nose, and it was just ok. It is very messy, a lot of watery stuff in the tube before you can get to the mud. By the time I finished, my sink looked I just washed up from working in the fields! Wouldn&#x27;t mind, but this mud mask did very little for my blackheads. I&#x27;ve used much cheaper stuff that worked at least as well.</li>
            <li> I love masks and typically spend a good amount on all of my skin care products since I have really sensitive skin. Here are my thoughts so far on this one. I love the look of the packaging. The colors are inviting and clean looking. I did NOT like that there wasn’t a tamper seal on either the box or the product under the lid. It made me a little hesitant to want to use it. also not having a tamper seal under the lid allowed some of the product to leak into the lid and it was a bit messy  from the get go. There doesn’t seem to be a smell when applying the product or while it is drying which is nice . It’s messy to get out of the tube and if you don’t get enough the first time then the tube is very mess which means the counter is messy and I don’t have too much time for messy beauty products. It dries very fast and is not the easiest to spread. Clean up is messy as well. It seems to go everywhere. The first few minutes that I had it on my face it did tingle a little but didn’t hurt the way some reviews have stated. I’ve found that about 15 minutes is a good amount of time before it starts to flake off.  My suggestion is to put it on and wash it off when you get in the shower. It is MESSY as all get out when you wash it off. I have noticed that it does have a not so pleasant smell when it’s rinsing off. The only way to describe it is that it smells like dirt. Overall I really like this product and will continue to use it on a weekly basis since I like the way my skin feels after using it. I&#x27;ll just make sure I have time to clean up from the mess</li>
            <li> This was a great product! Kind of messy to use, but well worth the mess.  I could feel my skin tingling and my pores &amp;#34;shrinking&amp;#34; as the mask was drying.  When I washed it off it came off easily and my skin felt soft, suptle and revitalized. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again!!</li>
            <li> My skin loves it very effective</li>
            <li> This product comes in high quality packaging and is packed with terrific ingredients for your skin.  The color is like charcoal gray mud and it has a charcoal smell.  It reminds me of a spa/facial product.  The mask is soothing in that it goes on smooth and cool, has a slight grit to the texture but not overly abrasive.  I sometimes add baking soda to my cleanser to get a mild exfoliating treatment out of it and that is what I would compare the grit size/texture to - baking soda.  It dried fast on me, telling me that I have very dry skin this winter - my friend&#x27;s face is more oily and it took longer to dry.  Rinsed off clean - again with a very mild exfoliating feeling and my skin did not feel tight, dry or sensitive in any way.  The end result was soft, supple skin that felt completely clean without feeling dry or tight.  My moisturizer glided on like a dream and absorbed well into the skin after.  I would recommend this product for anyone who is obsessed with dead sea mud for its healing/detoxifying properties.</li>
            <li> This is a serious product !! It really really works!!!!!!! I was very lucky to receive an opportunity to review this mud mask as part of a promotion. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I used this product. I&#x27;ve never really used any type of mask before and since I&#x27;m not getting any younger and I was presented with the opportunity I figured why not ! well I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been missing out on such a wonderful product for so long !!! If I knew how amazing this stuff makes your skin feel I would&#x27;ve been using this along time ago!! Everyone not just women but everyone should have this mud mask especially men who work outside in the elements this mud mask would be amazing and cleanse all the toxins from the day off of your face ! This would make a great Father&#x27;s Day gift . They may think you&#x27;re nuts at first but after they use it They will understand why you got it for them and if they don&#x27;t like it then you just scored big-time!! There is also a 100% money back guarantee so there really isn&#x27;t anything to loose !! My face really has never felt better!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great facial mask. It has a thick consistency but goes on easily. This did a great job of cleaning my skin. I use it on a weekly basis. I&#x27;ve been following with a moisturizer afterwards. Pleased with this product!!</li>
            <li> Since my better half tends to use these mud masks more than me, these are her observations.  This mud mask smells like a typical mud mask but not an overpowering smell.  This is not a big deal for her but some may not like the “mud” smell.  She was surprised with this as it didn’t dry her skin as some mud masks do.  She was initially skeptical about this product’s claim that it removed impurities from the skin but it really does work well for that.  After rinsing her face, she could see immediately the impurities and black heads coming out of her skin.  Overall, a really good mud mask that really does help clear the skin without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 and a half stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great product. This was like getting a facial at the salon without leaving your home and for a fraction of the price!! Really made my skin feel rejuvenated! And it&#x27;s a great exfoliator too!! This is a great reputable brand too in the skin care industry! It didn&#x27;t break out my sensitive skin either like many products do. This would make a great gift to pamper a new Mom too!!</li>
            <li> Using it and I like it! fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a charcoal color mud mask. I would suggest with this mask to make sure you do a thin layer. I tried it with thick layer and didn&#x27;t work as well. I have notice my pores shrinking some in the little time I have been using this. My face does feel very smooth after using this mask. I can say some mask have made me feel dry after using theirs and this one seems to have kept my face hyrated. I am glad I don&#x27;t have to dig out of a jar to get this product out. It is a squeeze tube and no more contaminated it. I would suggest after you have applied the mask to use a small fan brush to make sure it is even. With the product have noticed less blackheads. I feel this mask has made my face more glowing than before. I suggest when using any mask to use warm water to take it off then after all off the shock it I use cold water. This is something that has worked for me..As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> The best mud mask I used it every week makes my skin so smooth and soft recommended to the fullest try it</li>
            <li> So I bought this product thinking it was going to do miracles for me for $25 and all of the great reviews. Here was my experience- it burned my face, my eyes had such a bad allergic reaction to it that I had to keep them shut most of the time I had it on. It is messy when you wash it off and somewhat hard to get off. It has a weird smell to it too. And lastly it did not give me the results I was expecting for this price. I did see a small difference in reducing my breakouts, but I can buy a mask for less than a fifth of the price that not only gives me much better results as far as reducing acne, but it makes my skin glow, smooth and soft. Just thought I would try something new. I was not impressed by this.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived It was not sealed and It seems to be already used. The smell is very unpleasant (very close to sewage). After using it once the disgusting scent stayed on my face, pillow, and face for 2 days. Very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face mask in have ever purchased..I am a custom to high end facial products and with this product not being that expensive I thought it might be a not so great mask..Well it is great..Very authentic ingredients,  goes on smoothly, and my skin felt great afterwards. .</li>
            <li> I purchased and used this product about 1 month ago. I like facial masks but I never find time to do them. I wanted to do this review after using the mask. This product really is like mudd. I had muddy water come out before the mask mud, use caution. I then applied it and waited for it to dry to remove. After I removed it -it made my face feel smooth and tightened. I then applied Adovia night &amp; eye cream which was absorbed into my skin making it feel refreshed. I also use Adovia mud soap that&#x27;s really a great product that is available free with the purchase of the mask.</li>
            <li> The product works great. The flaw is with the packaging. The seal on the top of the tube split causing it to leak out or dry up. Otherwise it works well. Downfall is that I ise double every time as the tube leaks. There&#x27;s no real way to prevent it either.</li>
            <li> Let me start my review by saying that this is a very good product.  I did not give it five stars because of the consistency of the product which made using and applying the product challenging. It was messy and although it is a mud mask, I have used other mask that were less troublesome. Now the question is would I buy this product?.......yes, because of the very good results that I got from using this mud mask and in the end that is what matters most to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this wonderful product for about a week now. I can honestly say that this mask really works it gets all the dirt and grime off my face.  Keeps my acne at bay I would recommend this to every woman out there awesome stuff!!! Julietree</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin and have tried countless facial treatments and masks, some irritated my skin, others did not work at all. This mask is excellent and it does not irritate my skin. I used it once a week and my skin is finally starting to clear up. I also use the sulfur soap with Dead Sea Salt by Adovia daily, which I suspect is helping a lot. I recommend using both products together for best results.</li>
            <li> Quality: I&#x27;m surprised by all these other reviews saying the mask got rid of blackheads, because it did not get rid of mine (the stubborn ones on my nose and on the sides of my nostrils). Personally, I have not found anything that works as well as baking soda for getting rid of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application: I did like this mask, and I feel like it does benefit my skin in other ways so I will continue to use it until it runs out (which will be awhile because there is a lot of mask in this tube!). The top layer begin to dry very quickly, so you have to apply it somewhat quickly. And when it does dry, I can definitely feel my face tightening, which I don&#x27;t feel as significantly with other masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewers are talking about with the &amp;#34;light scent&amp;#34; nonsense, because it smells like I expect mud would. Which is not particularly good. But I tend to like nice smelling products which are probably not all the best things for your skin, so I choose to ignore the mud smell of this mask. My skin feels refreshed after this mask so overall I would say I like it!</li>
            <li> I give it more than 5 stars. I have a very dry flaky skin and fed up of trying so many products and spending thousands of $$$. Its frustrating. But this mud mask is cleansing as well as moisturizing too. When I was looking up google for skin care products made of dead sea mud, I came across Adovia products. When I spoke to the customer care, Sharon said Mud mask will make me more dry and that it may not be for me. But I wanted to try this and after removing the mask, its not dry at all. Though my skin is dry all the time, this really worked well and you skin will feel soft and radiant like a baby. I think the dead sea salts are the ones that make the skin feel so energized, radiant and soft. Hey, forgot to say, the fine lines are gone in a week, you bet and the thicker ones become hardly visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I saw so many amazing reviews about Adovia products and wanted to try. First thing is they are a bit pricey, but not so much as many other fancy products in the market and they really go a long way. The best part is if I order more than $25, on Cleopatra&#x27;s choice website, they give me free samples and let me try their other products and see if they are for me or not. Now in our family we only use Adovia moisturizing Soap, Adovia day moisturizing cream, mud mask, hand cream (professional size for year long). We have been using these products for more than 3 years and I order the supplies for the year long at once and end up spending far less than what I used to spend for other products over the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, they did increased the prices recently, but I know there is nothing better for us than Adovia.</li>
            <li> Love my new facial mask! My face feels so smooth, fresh and clean after using it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller!!</li>
            <li> I have never used a mud mask that&#x27;s is not dry, but has the same cleaning efx of a traditional mud mask. This feels more creamy mud works realy good with my skin, and even when it&#x27;s dried up after 20 min, you don&#x27;t see any crack, which is really good. It won&#x27;t create more lines ! Also easy to cleanse with water. My face looks brighter after used just once and feels hydrated which is very amazing!</li>
            <li> My wife loves the stuff after the first use! Said her face feels better than ever!</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel. I use it nightly and I love it</li>
            <li> Love it!  Leaves skin soft and clean!</li>
            <li> Great product it truly does reduce your pores instantly!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft am hoping with time will diminish scars. Will follow up.</li>
            <li> Great product. Used it on a girls weekend and we all did facials and we all felt like we had smoother faces. Just use a dark washcloth to wash off as it does stain the lighter ones.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and I like it. It dried faster than other masks I have tried and left my skin soft and feeling refreshed. I do plan on using this once a week to see more results with my skin. I recommend this mask to anyone who is looking for a nice quick mask to apply while having a spa night at the comfort of your own home. I wrote more thoughts on my blog: polished247.com.</li>
            <li> I use masks every so often and never once have I come across one that did what this one did! I have used it a couple times so far and my skin is very sensitive. It did not bother my skin at all. In fact, it was fun applying it to my face! This did not take long to dry and was quick and easy to rub off (as long as you rinse your washcloth off a few times, it does act a little bit like mud of course). The shipment was incredibly fast (I received this for free to review and ordered it through amazon as though I purchased it), packaging kept the product well protected and the box was not damaged at all. I&#x27;m very pleased with this. If you have sensitive skin and are unsure of what to use to clean your face, pick up this Dead Sea Facial Mask. I love it! I applied moisturizer cream after applying it and my skin has been clean ever since.</li>
            <li> I was chosen to test this lovely product and am so thrilled to tell you my experience with it. I have been using this mask for a week now and it has amazed me!! My skin feels so smooth and soft after using and lovely to touch. I have oily spots on part of my face which was always bothersome and now that I have been using this product it seems to be less oily. It is very gentle but effective at cleaning. It does such a great job that I almost feel guilty applying makeup. You will just love the results!!</li>
            <li> I really liked how this mask helped to clean out my pores. After getting the junk out they appear to be smaller. I love the squeeze container that it comes in. It makes it easier to get the amount that I want to use....no wasting of the product. The blue colors on the packaging made me feel like I was at a sap in my own home. Very upscale feel with the packaging. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I used the Facial Mask it is was so invigorating. My face felt really good after it was all over. Adovia has provided 30 facials in one bottle and I took full advantage of that. I used this product every few days to keep my face looking fresh and blemish free. This product has been formulated to handle really harsh skin conditions such as Acne, Oily Skin, Blackheads, Eczema, and Psoriasis. The service was also great The package came right on time, it was intact, and the packaging was just as you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I will receive a low value free gift from the manufacturer for&lt;br /&gt;posting this review.

            <li> Does not work at all! It burns! I usually use Origins, but wanted to give this a try</li>
            <li> My daughters and i use this and we love it! All of our adovia products are the best so far!</li>
            <li> Really great mud mask. I like that it dries quickly and it smells and feels very purifying. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and the usual issues such as fine lines and have difficulty finding a mask that actually works. This one did! I am very happy with the results as my skin was clearer after using it but it also seemed healthier. I would recommend this and will definately be getting again!</li>
            <li> This is a great mask.  Effective, affordable, large long lasting tube, and chemical free!  I will buy again when I run out</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the product, quite honestly. First of all, I&#x27;ve used other Dead Sea mus before on my face and this just didn&#x27;t work quite the same magic. Additionally, the product did not come in a tube as pictured, which I was actually really excited about. It came in a tub which is much messier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thirdly and most annoyingly, they KEEP EMAILING ME to ask me to review the product -- which makes me want to give even fewer stars!</li>
            <li> really cant see the effect....</li>
            <li> I received the Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask to do a review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this mask for about 3 weeks now.  I use it about 1-2 times a week ( usually in the evening when I&#x27;m not rushed for time).The coverage does not feel as heavy as other mud masks that I have used in the past.  I wash my face thoroughly and pat it dry.  Then I apply the mask to my face and under my chin.  The directions say to leave it on for 10-20 minutes.  I usually leave it on for about 20 minutes.  I have very oily, hyper pigmented skin and occasional breakouts. When I rinse the mask off, my skin is baby soft, more toned and appears lighter. My pores seem smaller.I have a glow for hours after I apply the mask.  My oiliness and breakouts have reduced since I began using the masks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel comfortable when the mask is on my face and under my chin. I do not have a tight pulling feeling as I have experienced with other masks and it still allows elasticity in my face when I talk or smile. There is no offensive odor.  The mask does not crack and crumble like some mud masks that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tube should last me about 3 months using it 1-2 times a week. I will definitely continue to use this product....</li>
            <li> this is the only face mask we use!  when used on regularly we see a major difference in our skin.  my only negative about this product is the normal price. notice here on amazon it is 26.00 has been know to go up to 52.00.  If the seller can keep the price at a reasonable rate I would recommend to anyone.  I have given this to family members to use as well.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample to try and then write a review of this product.  It is a very good product and I will be looking into other items that Adovia sells.  If there products are as good as this one I will be a loyal customer.  I loved the look of my skin after only using it two times.  I added it to my weekly routine, using it twice a week.  It left my skin moist, soft and smooth.  The only suggestion I would make is do not use a white wash cloth to remove as it stained and was not removed after several washing.  I would suggest this to anyone looking for a mud mask.  It was very good and did exactly what was promised.  I loved the mask.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great customer service, and my package arrived promptly.....and that&#x27;s about where everything great stops. The mask was a little watery at first, but I shook the bottle really good to mix the separated liquid back into the mud mask before applying it the times after, and it went on smoothly. I have sensitive skin, so I found that this mask made my face burn a little bit in my more sensitive areas (i.e. around the nose). It was also very itchy around my jawline. Be sure not to eat anything, or drink anything in an open container when wearing this mask; it flakes BAD. One night I was sitting in bed watching tv, and when I looked down at my shirt, I had all these little black specks sitting on my chest. I&#x27;d brush them off and more would fall and settle within seconds. So just slight movement of your face will loosen up the mask and cause specks to shed very easily. I can&#x27;t really say I have noticed a difference in my skin since using this mask.  My skin looks and feels the same, aside from the slight irritation it caused me. Also, I was surprised that the mask didn&#x27;t have a smell; for some reason I was expecting it to smell as rank as my other masks, but the lack of a scent was nice and convenient.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I never ever leave reviews but I had to on this one.  This literally dramatically reduced my acne after 2 uses.  It is amazing</li>
            <li> Sure cleans out the pores...</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this mask! I haven&#x27;t used it long so not sure if it helps with acne, but definitely have seen a difference with my pores being smaller. It makes my face fek very clean, smooth, and soft after using! No harsh smells or redness....nothing but goodness! Do recommend and will buy more!</li>
            <li> This is a very good mud mask, it left my skin looking and feeling great. I feel like it deep cleaned my pores, because they are noticeably smaller.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have always been self conscious of my skin, trying all types of products, only to be disappointed. Any product that gave a hint that it may work was too expensive to continue for an extended period. I was once again looking for a new product when I found Adovia Facial Mud Mask. I will definitely order again and can&#x27;t wait to try other products.  I&#x27;m 45 and I&#x27;m actually feeling like my skin is not so bad for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this didn&#x27;t work for my skin. My skin tends to be dry and after using this mask, it was very oily for a couple days. I even had someone at work ask if I was ok because I looked like I was perspiring (shiny face)!!! UGH!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best facial mask you&#x27;ll ever buy. It&#x27;s worth every penny. My skin is normal with the occasional breakout spots in my T-zone, but I love it because I can literally feel it cleaning my skin and pulling out the bad stuff.  It&#x27;s refreshing and I am constantly buying it for other people to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to everyone I know...actual quotes:&lt;br /&gt;- my teenage sister &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t want to use too much because I don&#x27;t want to waste it&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- my friend with adult acne &amp;#34;I love that facial mask you recommended, can I use it more than once a week?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;- my aunt with cancer &amp;#34;I get facials all the time because my skin is so bad from the chemo but this stuff is amazing and makes my skin feel great! I want to bathe in it.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Can you say where the heck has this product been!!! Being in my late 40&#x27;s age is starting to show but this mask seems to tighten my skin a lot. My pores seem noticeably smaller. It gives you a smooth complexion and rid you of oily residue.  Great for fine lines!!!!</li>
            <li> Great natural face mask.  I use this about once a week or when I feel I need a deep clean on my face to unclog my pores.  It works really well at minimizing my pores and helps keep my face from breaking out.  It is not drying and is actually moisturizing and and has vitamin c to help fight free radicals.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s even helping to fade my acne scars!</li>
            <li> This Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is so smooth and creamy. I was not expecting that. Normally mud masks are a bit gritty and can also tend to sting a little. This went on almost like putting creamy frosting on my face. It felt amazing and while I did not have the tightening feeling while it was drying I do feel my skin extremely smooth after each use. It rinses off easily without excessive scrubbing. I love this mask. My skin loves it more than me. I was sent this for review, however I only express my honest thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> Use this once a week and it works great</li>
            <li> I am using it to clear and prevent my skin from irritation related to a contact dermatitis on my shoulders and it works great.</li>
            <li> This facial mask was free.  I have been procrastinating my review for a while.  I love this product effect on my mature skin removing impurities, aiding the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> Just amazing!!!  My face is so soft and smooth after I use this mask!! I&#x27;ve always used the peel off masks but after using this just once I&#x27;m hooked!!! I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this. The bottle came apart at the top when I went to use it for the first time. Created quite a mess. I was only able to use the mask that one time, and it was fairly decent. Perhaps that this was just a bad seal with mine, and not the case with most other bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> This mask leaves your skin feeling soft and revitalised</li>
            <li> I love face mask and use them weekly. That is my pamper me time. I always tell the kids I can&#x27;t talk because it has to dry so that buys me about 15 minutes of almost silence. when I&#x27;m done with my mask my face feels soft and refreshed. I expected the same out of this mask. It is a mud mask so it&#x27;s a medium consistency but very easy to see if you are putting enough on. My children asked if I painted on my face, that made me chuckle a little. I left it on for 20 minutes but It didn&#x27;t harden as much as other mask but it did harden slightly ( I will never tell my children.)  i washed it off and of course my face felt soft and refreshed but to my surprise the black head I was just fussing about on my nose were completely gone. My nose is smooth as silk with no blackhead in site. Needless to say I was sooo happy about that because I had pore strips on my shopping list. I LOVE this mask and would recommend it to anybody. This is a new must have in my beauty collection. I did receive this product complimentary but the opinion expressed is all mine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while. It is wonderful and my face feels so soft and clean after use. When i started using it, my face was breaking out like crazy because of hormone changes after having a baby. This product has really helped with the breakouts as well as preventing new ones. The only complaint that I have is that if you are not careful this product can be super messy.</li>
            <li> I like using this product... I do not know that it has significantly helped my complexion so far, but it does feel like it cleanses it well, and my skin feels nice after I wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have been using mud masks since High School and even found that they are a great way to use as an acne (overnight) spot treatment. I don&#x27;t wake-up with red and blown up blemishes and the mud aids in drying out the pimple or bringing it up to the surface. Nonetheless, the pimple will be dealt with and gone the following day. With time, I started getting better at differentiating what a clay base is and what mud is classified as, because I would get confused. You had muds with regions, locations, to even different claims but they all purified. I have found that Dead Sea mud, the mud tends to still be as effective as other mud based masks, but tends to give less of the side effects like over drying. I have parts of my skin that are considered sensitive and other normal to even oily in the t-zone area. It&#x27;s hard to apply a mask while you trying to avoid sections, but not with Dead Sea mud. Each company has its own blend, so trying them out has been interesting in seeing how well they perform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adovia Mineral Skin Care, is a company that carries everything from masks, creams to even soap bars derived from more kinder and natural ingredients. Their Purifying Mud Mask fits the line perfectly and I also like that they bottled the product in a squeeze bottle, so no jar to use that always makes me hurry up and try to scoop product out while racing for time (as air is the enemy) but making sure none falls on the jar&#x27;s rim or worse, on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I found that Adovia knows a lot about the products they make and this was seen by the indications/Directions listed. Most people apply masks, allow them to dry for 20 to 30 minutes, and then rinse. Muds work best when kept in a moist environment, whether this be a shower or sauna, to even a sink filled with hot water that is giving off steam. It keeps the ingredient in their active state and allows more of that &amp;#34;gentle pulling&amp;#34; and purifying of the skin&#x27;s surface to take place. This increases circulation and aids in promoting a better looking skin&#x27;s surface after treatment. This is why our face looks so smooth and has that beautiful natural glow after a mud mask treatment. I found that if I do the application in the shower, my results last longer. My skin remains in that improved state for about three days, so I got more out of the results by doing the &amp;#34;wet treatment&amp;#34;, and it also makes removal easier and less messy. I tried the Adovia Purifying Mud Mask for a period of one month and I used it once a week and did some spot treatments as needed. I am satisfied with the product&#x27;s consistency and it&#x27;s wet enough to make application a cinch but not so wet that I am chasing it. I even treated my chest area because bikini wearing season is here! No matter where applied, I got positive results that lasted. Less breakouts or skin issues and who doesn&#x27;t like flawless (or as closest as I can get) skin? I like getting maybe 1 pimple and then having clear skin. I also found that Adovia&#x27;s mask helped speed up the healing process and drying out period. If I got a &amp;#34;blinder&amp;#34;, those pimples that can&#x27;t make-up their mind about coming up all the way or going away, no problem as the mask&#x27;s influence made them decide really quickly. I found 75% just gave up the and left, while 25% would come up within 24 hours so I could pop (hey, I&#x27;m not walking around with a whitehead) and then they would dry out. Within three days, I had zero effects left behind from redness to swelling being totally gone. The mask also helps any marks or dark spots left behind from scabs.  Your scab will peel off quickly and no dark marks left behind!  The more religious you are about using it and by this I mean keeping on schedule (once or twice a week and staying faithful to the schedule), the less issues I had the following weeks. I skipped a week and by day 12, I could tell my skin was starting to get problematic again. I had no excuse other than time but I shower everyday, so I could have easily taken the bottle in with me.

            <li> Shipping was fast. I did like the way it felt as it dried. It didn&#x27;t feel too tight or crackly! I had a small reaction  on neck from it, but it  worked wonders on my chin!&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> It is always such a refreshing feeling to get a facial with some kind of face mask. I wish I could go to the spa and get the facials on a regular basis. Since I don’t put that on my list of priorities, I do it on my own when I can find a good one. I couldn’t wait to try out the Adovia Purifying Mud Mask. My daughter and I decided to apply it together, after all spa treatments are always more fun when you do it with a friend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask went on very smooth and dried rather quickly. I did leave it on for about 25 minutes until it was real dry. It washed off fairly easy and left our faces feeling very soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t wait to repeat the Adovia Purifying Mud Mask again in a few days. There is just nothing like that fresh feeling after a mask treatment. I am so excited to find an all natural combination of Pro-Vitamins B5 and E that rejuvenates and refreshes my skin. The best part is I can apply it at home!</li>
            <li> This mask is so wonderful! It goes on silkily smooth and leaves my face feeling clean and soft. One less thing to worry about  Basically, my skin looks great and feels even better! If you&#x27;re on the fence about this product, give it a try! The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Mask claims that it reduces blackheads and acne, and serves as an exfoliator and deep facial cleanser. It also claims it leaves skin radiant, younger looking, and smooth. I got it for the “radiant, younger looking, and smooth” claim and I can honestly say it does what it claims! As I mentioned, I have been pretty dull looking. The directions say wash your face, put the mask on for 10-20minutes, and wash off. I’m pretty certain I had it on longer than 20 minutes due to mom duties and simply forgetting it was on. Which brings me to a great point, no irritation. I had no weird tingling, itching, or tightening. I put it on and really forgot about it. When I washed it off my skin was more alive, very smooth, and felt super clean! It wasn’t dry and still no irritation, itch, or anything of the sort going on. I waited two days and used the mask again, same thing! It says once a week or as needed. I honestly do love this product and absolutely recommend it for everybody everywhere! Of course I totally recommend it for anyone who wants clean, beautiful, soft skin, trust me you want be sorry .  I received this product for free for review purposes all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I rarely apply mud mask to my face and the latest I can remember will be 6 months ago when I bought a small sachet in Target just to try it out. It was fine and I really didn&#x27;t notice anything so I didn&#x27;t really thought much of buying a mud mask again. When this opportunity knocked on me on trying a new kind of mud mask I was excited to try something new. And its just not new but better because of its dead sea mineral properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I received this, I was surprised at the packaging of the product. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a large and for the lack of word, fat container filled with dead sea mud mask goodness. This is good for 30 sessions of mud mask that can make you save up - that is not going to the spa anymore spending on those sessions of mud mask therapy. You can do it at home at you own convenience. Now let&#x27;s tackle the formula inside. It was easy to squeeze out and its very smooth to touch and easy to apply. I applied a thin layer onto my face and felt a tingling like my skin was on fire that was over under 2 minutes. I&#x27;m not bothered by that because I didn&#x27;t have rash or irritation afterwards even if I have sensitive skin. It just felt that the formula is working on my face. After more than 20 minutes, I washed it off with lukewarm water and pat dry with a towel. My skin felt really really smooth to touch and looks very bright and radiant! I do wish I have their toner and moisturizer to follow with to see more wonderful results.</li>
            <li> I received this mud mask for free to review and this is my honest opinion. I tend to get really painful acne around my hairline and forehead, I think it&#x27;s hormonal. This mask left my skin feeling really hydrated afterwards which is something I didn&#x27;t expect, most likely due to the amount of essential oils in it. I really liked that. It didn&#x27;t smell odd and felt nice upon application. The following day I noticed that all of the painful pimples on my forehead and hairline had dried out and everywhere else felt nice and soft. I also have psoriasis on my ankle and I plan on using it there and will update my review once I have done so. Overall, I don&#x27;t exactly have consistent face care regime but this mask has me wanting to adhere to one because it is easy, effective, and non drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get a lot of time to do masks and lounge about most days, but I was excited to receive a tube of this mud to try and review. I made some time to use it! I have sensitive skin but it is also oily certain times of the month, and then super dry during other times. Buying one product for the whole month is hard. I have used this mask several times over the past few weeks (more than suggested) and I have had positive results every time, no matter my skin issue. What I really like is the exfoliating that it does. Just a little- enough to get a little more attention to my oily days, and I don&#x27;t need to scrub on the dry days. I had smaller pores, my face felt smooth and I never had any issues with skin reactions etc.&lt;br /&gt;I got my product super fast, and I was pleased with the packaging. Enough to protect it, but not too much to destroy the entire planet.  A great buy! Thanks!</li>
            <li> First I want to give you a little back story..... I have been having some serious issues with breaking out and noticing that my pores are more visible than I would like them to be. So, I have been looking for a good product to help me with these issues. I have been doing a lot of research and product comparisons online, trying to find the perfect product to meet my needs. The major concerns that I ran into with my research were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I couldn&#x27;t find a acne/blemish product that didn&#x27;t completely dry you out or didn&#x27;t cause more blemishes in the end.&lt;br /&gt;2. Most products had reviews complaining of horrible scent to the products or a greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;3. The price of the products! Some ranging from $45-$75 and some upwards of $100 or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with all that, I have been very weary to purchase a product. Then I came across this product. I figured why not give it a chance? I have nothing to lose! So that is just what I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I decided to give this a try! I found out that I really enjoy this product, more than I ever imagined that I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mud mask is very smooth and creamy. It goes on thick but it is NOT greasy at all. It is really easy to apply. Simply squeeze some out of the tube onto your fingers. Apply to your face by smoothing with your fingers. Let dry for about 10-15 minutes and then simply rinse off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that I can attest to some of these statements made by the manufacturer. I could definitely tell, after just one use, that it tightened my skin and reduced my pimples. My pores were even less noticeable. My face felt cleaner and less greasy for a few DAYS afterwards, too! I absolutely LOVE this product! I will definitely be purchasing this product again! The best part...its only $30!</li>
            <li> oh my god. it is broken at the bottom of its package.</li>
            <li> This product left my skin feeling smooth, healthy and blackhead free after just ONE application! The price may seem a little steep, but for the amount you get it is well worth the price!! If you have blackheads, it gets rid of them! If you have dry skin, it helps put some oomph back in your skin!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this for review. However all opinions are my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love facial masks There is something that just makes you feel even more clean after using them. I typically use the peel away type masks, but gave this a try. I have pretty nasty acne for my age ad have heard good things about dead sea mud helping. This mask was rather easy to apply. considering most mud masks are really goopy and don&#x27;t spread very evenly, this was actually pretty smooth and I was able to get great coverage before spots started drying. I left it on for a bit and you can feel it tighten as it dries. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have an obnoxious smell so it was very tolerable. It washed off easily with warm water and made my face very smooth! I didn&#x27;t get any dryness or redness as I have with other products in the past. I have used weekly for the last month and have definitely noticed a reduction in my acne. It is not gone, but it is much lighter and I have fewer breakouts than before. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great facial mask to add to their facial cleaning routine!</li>
            <li> I like the way this product left my facial skin clear and oil-free.  It brought some below the surface debris closer to the surface and allowed me to easily extract them without roughly squeezing and bruising my face.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for an intense pore cleanser that is not harsh and drying.  The product had a light pleasant smell and spread on easily and creamily and washed off just as easily.</li>
            <li> Great mud mask. I like this very much and would buy again.</li>
            <li> I used it for 3 or 4 times . I haven&#x27;t seen any change on my skin</li>
            <li> I am beyond THRILLED to find such an amazing mask at such a reasonable price!  It goes on so smoothly, starts to work on your impurities almost instantly, smells a little like mud (obviously) and has a slight tingle factor as it works its magic!&lt;br /&gt;My face felt so smooth and amazing after I removed the mask (I left mine on for just over 5 minutes because of my uber sensitive skin) and after a few passes of a toner-soaked cotton ball, I looked like I&#x27;d just returned from an expensive spa facial!&lt;br /&gt;Adovia will have me as a customer for life! Their products are far superior to anything I&#x27;ve bought at beauty stores! I&#x27;m so excited to have stumbled upon them!</li>
            <li> Reduce excess oils, minimize pores and experience radiant and clear skin with our Dead Sea Facial Mask. This Mud Mask Tightens and Purifies Pores leaving a Clear, Smooth &amp; Younger Looking Complexion, I love the smells, I got this product on a discount for review purposes</li>
            <li> My skin is a harsh combination of oily and dry, while trying to be very sensitive about everything. I often apply a  mask as a relaxing experience other than as a beauty product. With my latest break out I needed more.. I first heard of Dead Sea Salts and Mud via one of those daily talk shows and I began to research some of its benefits. Things such as it having many of the minerals and healing properties. When given the opportunity to review this product using a discount, I thought why not. The mud comes in a small squeezable tube, the mud is a grayish color. I applied a thin layer to a freshly washed face and allowed it to dry. Unlike other muds I have used it did not dry to the stuck face cant smile or crack all over and flake everywhere, I was impressed. With a warm face towel I began simply removing the mud and finished with a few splashes to the face to make sure I rinse everything. My skin felt softer, refreshed and smooth. I plan to use this twice a week to assist with my t zone as it is my problem area. I can see using this as spot treatments as well as a full mask.</li>
            <li> I have tried this brand before and loved it so i was excited to get the mask! It is awesome! I love the way my skin feels after using it. It is a decent size and easy to use! Very gentle on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used the mask so I can&#x27;t tell if I like it or not. It went on smooth and there was a brief tingle and then a refresshing feel as it was drying. But... I opened the top for the first time and as I squeezed the tube, the back of the tube EXPLODED. I wasn&#x27;t very happy about that because I had to scoop it out of the tube and find another container to put it in. I will come back and do a product review after a few applications.</li>
            <li> I been using it past three weeks and I can see my face changing. Clearly my big pore</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to help with break-outs. She loves it. It is a big star at sleep overs too.</li>
            <li> great for cleaning pores and you cant get any natural than a mask from the dead sea also the service is excellent for they sent it to me in a flash</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a mud mask. I suffer from hormonal cystic acne along my neck/jawline, but the rest of my face can&#x27;t really handle harsh acne products. This mask feels like a spa treatment in your home. I placed a thin layer on my skin and left in on for 20 minutes. I felt a pleasant tightening as it dried. I didn&#x27;t appreciate any foul odor. I actually removed this in the shower with my hands because I don&#x27;t like to scrub with a washcloth to get masks off, and it came off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for other reviewers who said it was watery, perhaps they just need to give it a shake prior to dispensing because the water settles to the bottom. My product was thick and luxurious. My skin feels very soft and looks brighter! The tube has A LOT of product in it, so I will be able to enjoy my masks for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am adamant about taking care of my skin and am trying to stave off the inevitable wrinkles I know will come.  I have tried numerous mud masks as part of my cleaning/moisturizing regiment so I was happy when I was given this one to test for quality.  This is the first one I have tried that comes in a squirt tube.  All others have been in a jar with a screw top lid.  When you first squeeze out the product, it kind of spit and sputtered and got mask on my yellow top, hence the 4 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was thinner than others I have tried but not runny.  It smoothed on easily using my fingers but a brush could be used as well if you prefer that type of application.  The mask has a light scent and as it dried, you could definitely feel your skin tightening.  I felt no burning sensation whatsoever.  I left it on for about 15 minutes before rinsing.  He came off easily and left my skin feeling tighter and the pores on my nose looked smaller.  Overall, this is a decent mask for the price.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combo skin so finding skincare products that work for me is hard. I received this mud mask to review and love it. It is easy to apply and get evenly unlike other masks I have used. It didn&#x27;t bother me or break me out. It does smell a little funky like most mud masks do. After using my face feels so soft, amazing, and looks great. This is a really nice mud mask. I received a sample to review.</li>
            <li> This is Definately a mud mask. It pulled all that icky stuff out of my face and made it feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant on this product.  I am very sensitive to smells and I was afraid that it would smell nasty.  It does not smell bad at all!  Once applied it feels very refreshing to my face.  It comes off very easily when you are ready to take it off.  I really struggle with dry skin and this product helps remove all the dead, dry skin and leaves my face very fresh and glowing.  My skin feels softer than it has in a long time!  The bottle is pretty big and it goes a long way!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> Great mask, takes about 15 minutes to dry you can see it pulling the oil and impurities out of your pores. Recommend using every 3 days, or as needed. Doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin like some on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a MUD mask.  I was a little apprehensive when I removed the cap and saw the mask.  It really looks like mud.  The directions are easy to follow and the mask goes on smoothly.  The smell is light and pleasant.  It rinses easily.  The mask leaves the face soft and smooth.  I really love this mask!</li>
            <li> This was a nice surprise. I have done lots of face masks before - usually the foofy, single use ones, or sometimes a hardcore professional grade one. This was surprisingly gentle and more effective than I honestly expected it to be.&lt;br /&gt;The texture of the mask was not even - I recommend shaking the tube well before opening to avoid a mess. Once mixed well, though, I found it had a pleasant texture and little to no odor. It spread evenly over my skin and did not cause any burning sensation at all. When I removed it, my skin felt tight and clean, and completely un-irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this got four stars instead of 5 is I feel it could have been a bit stronger as a skin detoxifier without hitting the threshold of discomfort some masks give. Otherwise, I think it is a nice quality skin mask.</li>
            <li> I LOVE face masks! Adovia is one of my favorite products and love there mud mask! It&#x27;s easy to apply and easy to wash off and my face feels so soft after using the mask! It also helps rid the blackheads and unwanted blemishes! I received this as a sample to test and review!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for about 3 weeks now - twice per week. The mask goes on like a traditional &amp;#34;mud mask&amp;#34;. There is plenty of product in the tube, and I can see this lasting me a very long time. I leave it on for 15 minutes, then rinse and moisturize. My face feels really nice and fresh after using the product, though longer term use will be needed to see if there is any long lasting affects. Adovia sent me this product for review, and I think it&#x27;s a quality product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Adovia makes great products, and this Mud Mask is no exception. I love how smooth my skin is after use.  What a great quality product that clarifies and exfoliates for radiant skin. My skin is left feeling softer and smoother.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I really loved this Dead Sea Mud Mask. I have used a lot of Dead Sea Mud Masks in the past and they have been somewhat harsh on the skin. The Adovia brand was very gentle and when I washed it off I did not experience any of the redness that I normally do with other masks. It left my face feeling soft, clear and vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is a great mud mask.  I love that it comes in a tube and is already mixed so I just have to put on my face and neck.  I put a thick layer on my face and neck.  Generally leave it on about 15 minutes or until dry.  Then wipe off and splash some cool water on my face.  It reduces the oil on my skin.  It tightens and smoothes my skin.  If you have blemishes it&#x27;s a great spot treatment for blackheads.  I was lucky to have gotten this complimentary  to try and give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> One of the best mud masks I&#x27;ve used. I had no redness after using, and the consistency is perfect. It was easy to apply evenly and I didn&#x27;t have to scrub to remove the mask after it dried.</li>
            <li> For the most part my skin is normal, without breakouts, and not really oily. I love face masks though and this a good one. If it has been sitting for a little while, make sure to shake the tube before using or it may separate and be watery looking. The mask can be applied with either your fingertips or a brush but either way it applies rather smoothly. I love how easy it was to apply. The mask is a deep army green color and doesn&#x27;t really have any scents to it. It does do a great job at exfoliating the skin because it does have extremely tiny granules in it. It almost feels like very very fine sand, in a good way. I left my mask on for about 10 minutes before washing it off. As the time goes by, the mask starts to dry and harden to a lighter shade of green. It doesn&#x27;t harden so much though where you can&#x27;t talk like some masks which I love. It was easy to wash off as well. What little oils I did have in my skin this mask without a doubt pulled them out. I expected my skin to feel dry but it didn&#x27;t. I did apply a moisturizer afterwards and now my skin is extra smooth and soft. I would definitely continue to use this face mask. I did receive a complimentary product in hopes for a review. Regardless, my thoughts and opinions are completely my own and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I definitely loved this product!</li>
            <li> I usually go for hydrating masks at this time of year because we have rough winters but I was asked to give my opinions on the quality and overall appeal because I am in the esthetics field.&lt;br /&gt;The things I like about the Adovia Mud Mask:&lt;br /&gt;- The tube is useful, although the tubs are larger, every time you open up the lid, you are drying out the mask, so with a tube, there is much less air getting in.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a neutral scent, I know that sounds silly but some masks are so strong they can make your eyes water, this one doesn&#x27;t! I personally like the scent of the mask, it smells clean instead of some of the others I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;- There is good &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; The mask spreads nicely and that&#x27;s allowed me to use less.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping to get at least 6-8 months out of this tube and I&#x27;ve never been all that great at using as little as possible :)&lt;br /&gt;If you have a very dry nose like me, I would just avoid that area.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like the Adovia Mud Mask, the hydrating, brightening and smoothing effects are wonderful.</li>
            <li> As someone who has acne prone skin, I was very excited to try out this mask to help combat the blemishes and blackheads. I&#x27;ve already seen a great improvement in clearer skin and less blackheads! My skin feels super smooth after using the mask. This is a great way to treat yourself to spa treatments without the hefty price tag, and I love that the tube is a good size that will definitely last for months. Love these dead sea products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest...I&#x27;m a 35+ adult male and have had to deal with a sudden break out.  I used to struggle with it as a teen, and then it was fine in my 20s and early 30s with the occasional bump here and there.  But a year ago, I had a pretty bad case of break out...no idea what triggered it.  I was frantically trying everything, including this product.  While I think this product is good in itself, it did not help with my break out situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I visited a dermatologist recently and was trying the medication he recommended.  That didn&#x27;t seem to do the trick either, till I STUMBLED INTO A MIRACLE OTC CURE!  CVS didn&#x27;t have stock of the original prescription, but they offered me another over-the-counter product as an alternative.  I took it reluctantly...and boy did it work!!!  It is called PANOXYL...it&#x27;s a creamy medicated face wash, and only costs 10 bucks (and will last more than a month). This is all I use now instead of soap for my face...that&#x27;s it...nothing fancy.  I&#x27;m also using organic lemon juice (dip a cotton ball in it and apply it on my face and leave it on for 15 mins)...that seems to help with lightening up the marks left by acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it folks - less than 10 bucks a month and I&#x27;m good to go now!  This may not work for everyone, but it did for me, and wanted to share it here.</li>
            <li> The Adovia Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask is a great mask!  I have combination skin and some problems with adult acne and this product has really made a difference. My face is more clear and it has decreased the redness exponentially.  Pores are far tighter and my skin is more smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply and remove.  It didn&#x27;t leave the tightness that some masks do! Shake well before you apply it.</li>
            <li> Works great to keep complexion even on the face.  It helps with my problem areas.</li>
            <li> works great love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> It makes your skil fresh, clean and healthy</li>
            <li> I loved using this product it renewed my skin and made it so soft only thing was the smell while washing it off, it wasnt the greatest smell but all in all great product</li>
            <li> This product gently tightened, then after rinsing left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. The most important factor, and benefit, to me is that it is cruelty free. In the interest of disclosure, this product was provided for me to sample free of charge.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!!!! My skin is so clear, youthful, and refreshed when I use it!!!! It tingles like Noxzema but it&#x27;s all natural. It can be a bit messy and can squirt out a like liquid but it&#x27;s mud!!!! The end result is all I care about though - which is glowing youthful skin. 🌞This is truly a spa quality product - that you can use in the comfort of your own home. Give it a shot you won&#x27;t be disappointed. And just in case you&#x27;re wondering I wasn&#x27;t paid to give this review. 🌞</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Leaves my face feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product so I could review it.  I wanted to give it time so I would write an accurate review.  I have been using it once a week.  I am 68 and have combination skin with oily T zone.  The mask makes my skin feel clean and definitely clear and smooth.  What I have noticed was this:  I have a skin condition which many people with oily skin get.  It&#x27;s called sebacous hyperplasia.  I get it on my forehead and it comes and goes.  It&#x27;s tiny bumps where the oil glands kind of get inflamed, not pimples, but tiny bumps.  They seem to be totally gone.  I am thinking it is the mask and therefore I will definitely keep using it, if not just for that, but for the whole benefit.  I did not find it moisturizing though, but I use moisturizer.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very effective... I am have used it only twice but have already started seeing my dark spots fading</li>
            <li> I am really been enjoying this mask. It is like a spa mask at home! It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent which is a plus and goes on super smooth. It makes my skin look and feel flawless. I have noticed a dramatic different with just 4 uses. My pores look so much smaller, my skin has a glow, and all the dark spots and dullness have disappeared from my face. This mask has quickly became one of my holy grail beauty products.</li>
            <li> I love this mask, it leaves my skin so smooth and really helped with acne and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Adovia products, and this was in no way a let down! Leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean of any impurities, and I notice fewer blemishes and blackheads. I anticipate that only getting better and better with weekly use. This is a generous supply for the money. Adovia, you never let me down!</li>
            <li> Love the way this felt on my face as it dried and when I washed off my face I could feel all the impurities on my face gone left my skin feeling smooth and clean</li>
            <li> I am a huge lover of mud masks! I love trying all different types. This one made my skin feel nice and smooth afterwards. It had a nice clean but not tight feeling which I like that. I don&#x27;t like feeling like I can&#x27;t move my face muscles. I also noticed my pores looked smaller which is a big plus for me. I noticed for a few days after I used the mask my face was not oily like it usually is. I like this mud mask and give it two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This has to be the best Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask I have ever used. I was selected to receive a complementary sample of it to try and give my honest opinion on how I liked it. It was packed securely. When I opened the box the mud was in a really nice squeeze tube so when it came out it was velvety smooth and had no odor whatsoever. It was easy to apply a think layer; and it felt wonderful on my face because I used an upward motion as I massaged it into my skin. I left it on for 15 min &amp; did a few chores around the house. When I washed the mud off my skin felt extremely hydrated and so silky smooth, I didn&#x27;t even need to put a moisturizer on. I also noticed that my red cheeks were not red anymore. It must be because this mud contains all natural organic extracts like Evening Primrose oil, Jojoba oils and Olive oil just to name a few. This mud works great at healing my red cheeks and it works great on my sensitive skin. This mud has now become part of my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I really love this mud mask. I suffer from acne and it seems that it&#x27;s helping combat it. It helps with exfoliating so I&#x27;m seeing a lot of my pesky blackheads vanish which is a huge deal to me. I have been using it often and am for sure seeing real results. I will be repurchasing this product as I intend on keeping it as a part of my beauty routine. My skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years, and the fact that my acne is dissipating is a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I really like this mask, my face felt so good after using it. I am truly looking forward to my next &amp;#34;mask day&amp;#34;. I have very sensitive skin and this mask was not at all irritating. Definitely recommend if you love that fresh feeling after a mask.</li>
            <li> I liked this much more than the one that comes in a jar. It deep cleanse my pores and left skin extremely soft!</li>
