            <li>its fine.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for providing me with clearer skin conditions and a feeling of better self esteem!</li>
            <li>It still works fantastic if you use it as directed.  </li>
            <li>For a non-prescription facial cleanser that is inexpensive, this is a great way to go.</li>
            <li>So Far So Good..</li>
            <li>Been using Cuticura for years and it works, keeps my face clear and it smells good too (the soap).</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t overdry &amp; after you use it, it leaves your face feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Give it a try, it&#x27;s not pricey and it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>This is a best kept secret for sure.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel tighter and squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>Cleans the pores on my face great and does not leave my skin dry.  </li>
            <li>Face feels so clean after using this soap</li>
            <li>I dont feel this soap does anything special.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Great product really does help clear the acne FAST!  </li>
            <li>so i am sure that touching door handles and such are the reason for my break outs.  </li>
            <li>I have used this soap for years and still love it as much as I did when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; product, but with all the benefits and good results without the \\&quot;new</li>
            <li>At some point I started using a variety of moisturizing cleansers which are supposedly better than soap and water for mature skin.</li>
            <li>If u have problem skin, I advise you to try this product it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Cleared my skin right up</li>
            <li>I saw several dermatologists, took different antibiotics, and many, many prescription topicals!</li>
            <li>Super Fast Shipping .</li>
            <li>I find this soap to be mild and gentle so am using it as a bath soap and also.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin users; use soap less and product might be more effective.</li>
            <li>Walgreens used to carry it as well as some supermarkets, but haven&#x27;t been able to find except on-line for several years.</li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I first got wind of it on acne.org.</li>
            <li>I am now 62 and it keeps my face smooth and young....</li>
            <li>sure to use different rags for each soap</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Great for delicate skin.</li>
            <li>It works much BETTER than Proactiv for me, and over a year later I still haven&#x27;t used up this 1 bar, even though I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li>Hard to find at retail anymore, this is the best skin soap for clearing up facial breakouts, itching skin, cleaning cuts and scrapes and keeping my hands sanitized.</li>
            <li>makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Old, tried and true.</li>
            <li>I could easily buy bacterial soap from my local stores</li>
            <li>After spending lots of money on pro active and many others this simple inexpensive bar of soap more than cured the problem.</li>
            <li>Very clean while not being dry.</li>
            <li>This soap makes you feel the absolute cleanest you can feel.  </li>
            <li>I had some very stubborn acne and upon using it for a week, the severity of it has diminished.</li>
            <li>and my daughters think it&#x27;s time to invest in stock, because the whole tribe uses it.</li>
            <li>I has always been a very dependable product</li>
            <li>This is definitely a cheap, lasting soap that will make your skin healthier.</li>
            <li>Thanks much.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that this product is still around, although harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have to worry about lotion.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up so much just by using this soap.</li>
            <li>but the next morning after using cuticura, i could already see a significant reduction in the size of my blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend everyone to keep a bar of this soap in their medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li>I started using this soap in high school</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Cuticura.</li>
            <li>Nothing else works especally if you have hormonal acne from high testoterone</li>
            <li>And the best part is that I tried that medication again for my other illness that made my acne worse.</li>
            <li>This soap is NOT A CURE,  but it does clear your acne, by saying that,  just know that if you stop using the soap the acne will be back.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!!</li>
            <li>I used to use Cuticura Medicated Anti-Bacterial Soap in the late &#x27;70s to mid-&#x27;80s when I was a teen / young adult and LOVED IT !!!  </li>
            <li>Even new products have been introduced.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My face is finally clear!</li>
            <li>This is the only soap I have found that works on my oily skin to keep it clear and relatively pimple free.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>I use it once a day in the morning shower and my skin is so soft!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m an active guy, so I&#x27;m often very sweaty and sometimes don&#x27;t shower off right away.</li>
            <li>If you rub too hard it can cause more acne.</li>
            <li>It clears up your skin and keeps it clear.  </li>
            <li>Been using in shower for all over freshness since I was about 14 years old.  </li>
            <li>my acne was completely gone.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised Amazon offered it.  </li>
            <li>and now I am 44 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have suffered with adult acne since my early twenties, and I am now thirty-six.</li>
            <li>It smells soft as well</li>
            <li>I used this soap as a teenager along with the ointment, and as a young woman continued to use it to cleanse my face but added a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But this stuff works well on backacne so far.</li>
            <li>Most of them caused excessive drying, yet did not clear up the acne.</li>
            <li>I only been using this soap twice a day for three days now, and wow!</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent, wash twice a day, and stick with it, but I have so much less acne now that it has to be doing something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment.</li>
            <li>So far I like this product, it does leave you a bit dry</li>
            <li>If the scent is a little intense, get the white bar.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I saw several dermatologists, took different antibiotics, and many, many prescription topicals!</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping .</li>
            <li> I find this soap to be mild and gentle so am using it as a bath soap and also.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin users; use soap less and product might be more effective.</li>
            <li> Walgreens used to carry it as well as some supermarkets, but haven&#x27;t been able to find except on-line for several years.</li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I first got wind of it on acne.org.</li>
            <li> I am now 62 and it keeps my face smooth and young....</li>
            <li> sure to use different rags for each soap</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great for delicate skin.</li>
            <li> It works much BETTER than Proactiv for me, and over a year later I still haven&#x27;t used up this 1 bar, even though I use it pretty much every day.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at retail anymore, this is the best skin soap for clearing up facial breakouts, itching skin, cleaning cuts and scrapes and keeping my hands sanitized.</li>
            <li> makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Old, tried and true.</li>
            <li> I could easily buy bacterial soap from my local stores</li>
            <li> After spending lots of money on pro active and many others this simple inexpensive bar of soap more than cured the problem.</li>
            <li> Very clean while not being dry.</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel the absolute cleanest you can feel.  </li>
            <li> I had some very stubborn acne and upon using it for a week, the severity of it has diminished.</li>
            <li> and my daughters think it&#x27;s time to invest in stock, because the whole tribe uses it.</li>
            <li> I has always been a very dependable product</li>
            <li> This is definitely a cheap, lasting soap that will make your skin healthier.</li>
            <li> Thanks much.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that this product is still around, although harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have to worry about lotion.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up so much just by using this soap.</li>
            <li> but the next morning after using cuticura, i could already see a significant reduction in the size of my blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend everyone to keep a bar of this soap in their medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap in high school</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Cuticura.</li>
            <li> Nothing else works especally if you have hormonal acne from high testoterone</li>
            <li> And the best part is that I tried that medication again for my other illness that made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> This soap is NOT A CURE,  but it does clear your acne, by saying that,  just know that if you stop using the soap the acne will be back.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!!</li>
            <li> I used to use Cuticura Medicated Anti-Bacterial Soap in the late &#x27;70s to mid-&#x27;80s when I was a teen / young adult and LOVED IT !!!  </li>
            <li> Even new products have been introduced.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My face is finally clear!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have found that works on my oily skin to keep it clear and relatively pimple free.</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> I use it once a day in the morning shower and my skin is so soft!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m an active guy, so I&#x27;m often very sweaty and sometimes don&#x27;t shower off right away.</li>
            <li> If you rub too hard it can cause more acne.</li>
            <li> It clears up your skin and keeps it clear.  </li>
            <li> Been using in shower for all over freshness since I was about 14 years old.  </li>
            <li> my acne was completely gone.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised Amazon offered it.  </li>
            <li> and now I am 44 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with adult acne since my early twenties, and I am now thirty-six.</li>
            <li> It smells soft as well</li>
            <li> I used this soap as a teenager along with the ointment, and as a young woman continued to use it to cleanse my face but added a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But this stuff works well on backacne so far.</li>
            <li> Most of them caused excessive drying, yet did not clear up the acne.</li>
            <li> I only been using this soap twice a day for three days now, and wow!</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent, wash twice a day, and stick with it, but I have so much less acne now that it has to be doing something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment.</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, it does leave you a bit dry</li>
            <li> If the scent is a little intense, get the white bar.  </li>
            <li> (I only use it on my face because I like it to last as long as possible.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hard to find, harmon drug has it but other than that</li>
            <li> The key is to use a diffrent wash cloth for your acne area then the rest of your body so you dont spread the germs and oils that make acne worse, then ONLY twice a week or so use those scrub gloves (VERY GENTLY) to exfolitae the areas.</li>
            <li> today is the third day i&#x27;ve used it, and the stubborn zits i&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for weeks, are now minimal, and i&#x27;m hopeful that if i continue this regimen, they&#x27;ll be completely gone within the next few days to a week.  </li>
            <li> I had used this for a few years but stopped using it because the store near my house stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I looked for it again for a really long time and found it here</li>
            <li> the only slight problem is that after using, my skin feels somewhat taught, so in combination with the soap, i apply ponds dry skin cream, so i would recommend a moisturizer in conjunction with the soap for those of you with dry/combination skin, especially during these winter months.  </li>
            <li> I also have some other physical conditions that require me to take medication.</li>
            <li> i purchased a bar of cuticura at a local pharmacy the other day, after trying everything else.  </li>
            <li> my skin was doing really very well until the last few months, and i still am not completely sure what&#x27;s causing my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave the skin dry either.</li>
            <li> The soap doing make your face feel kinda dry</li>
            <li> I still get the occasional pimple when I&#x27;m extremely stressed, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> I love it and was disappointed when my local store discontinued stocking it.</li>
            <li> It is hard milled, so lasts a long time, especially if you stand it on end to dry between uses.</li>
            <li> Take a bath with a cup of bleach in the bath water, soak for a half hour on your back side, then flip over, and soak for a half hour on your front side.  </li>
            <li> So I am back to my regimen of Cuticura soap and water, and a small amount of the ointment at night.</li>
            <li> so I had to forgot about it and use other unsatisfactory products for years.  </li>
            <li> and this is one of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t dry out or break out my skin.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this product didn&#x27;t really dissapoint.</li>
            <li> And it is not dry in the least!</li>
            <li> One particularly promising medication that I took in the past made my acne even worse!</li>
            <li> Worked for a little.</li>
            <li> Now, I have found the soap again and will be purchasing a few bars.</li>
            <li> I found this soap a few years ago when I was suffering from a breakout that would not go away and</li>
            <li> Money wasted because it didn&#x27;t anything as claimed.</li>
            <li> (no more than that)&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Cleared up ugly rash on back no doubt created or made worse from chlorine in showerhead water supply.</li>
            <li> This will seriously reduce your severe acne symptoms!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the worst soap I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s low on the list.</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> I used to spend money on Proactiv but that got too expensive to I decided to order this bar.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, when I found this product I was skeptical!</li>
            <li> Too bad, you can&#x27;t find Cuticura at any store.  </li>
            <li> I had horrible acne until I started using this soap.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I sometimes got sporadic acne that was especially unfortunate because of my job, so I looked into ways to help mitigate some of my skin issues.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i bought this for the anti bacterial every day use. it is helping what it was intended for</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have found that works on my oily skin to keep it clear and relatively pimple free.</li>
            <li> This soap makes you feel the absolute cleanest you can feel.  Been using in shower for all over freshness since I was about 14 years old.  Still love it at 58!  Can&#x27;t find locally anywhere anymore.  Walgreens used to carry it as well as some supermarkets, but haven&#x27;t been able to find except on-line for several years.</li>
            <li> It worked for awhile but it did not rid me of my acne.</li>
            <li> It works so well and my skin feels great! Very clean while not being dry. This is a best kept secret for sure.</li>
            <li> I had used this for a few years but stopped using it because the store near my house stopped carrying it. I started using another product, but I started breaking out again. I tried to chalk it up to stress alone, but realized that my breakouts increased at the same time I stopped using Cuticura. Now, I have found the soap again and will be purchasing a few bars.</li>
            <li> Not the best for my combo skin type, but I was told it was a great product which is why I purchased. For sensitive skin users; use soap less and product might be more effective. Yet, great for antibacterial purposes.</li>
            <li> I started using Cuticura when I was 14.  I got into some Poison Ivy &amp; this is what the drugstore told my parents to use.  WOW!  It worked wonderfully on the rash, soothed the itching, &amp; (a nice side efftect) my acne was completely gone.  I have used this soap since then &amp; I am 42 now.  I have been complimented on my skin at Mary Kay &amp; Avon parties.  When they asked what I used I simply replied Cuticura soap; they were not impressed. :-)  Cuticura soap is AMAZING product.</li>
            <li> Super Fast Shipping . So Far So Good.. I See My Pimples Drying Up. My Face Feels Clean After Using It.. &amp; It Smells Great.. Will Update In a Week ..</li>
            <li> I like this soap a lot.  It helps out with oily skin definitely!  But I use Neutrogena Acne Scrub too and using both of them together has helped reduce my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment. I used it on my body and my face, and didn&#x27;t get the results I was hoping for at all. It wasn&#x27;t the worst soap I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s low on the list.</li>
            <li> When ordered, this item was out of stock.  I cannot find this product anymore.  So sad.</li>
            <li> I received this item FASTER than I thought I would. It has a nice fragrance and appears to be doing exactly what it claims! I had some very stubborn acne and upon using it for a week, the severity of it has diminished. Thanks for providing me with clearer skin conditions and a feeling of better self esteem!</li>
            <li> Been using Cuticura for years and it works, keeps my face clear and it smells good too (the soap).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this for years because of my oily skin. Even at 65 I get blemishes if I don&#x27;t use it on my face and shoulders. Got my grandkids using it and my daughters think it&#x27;s time to invest in stock, because the whole tribe uses it.</li>
            <li> I found this soap a few years ago when I was suffering from a breakout that would not go away and &amp; I was instantly hooked. I looked for it again for a really long time and found it here so I ordered it &amp; it still amazes me! Cleared my skin right up but I do let it sit on my face like a mask and I wash my face with it twice a day as well. I will be ordering again!!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughters hair when she acquired a fungus from someone at school years ago by washing her hair daily with it.  She overcame the problem with flying colors.  I&#x27;m now recommending it for my grandchildren...I highly recommend everyone to keep a bar of this soap in their medicine cabinet. \\&quot;It&#x27;s an oldie but goodie\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since I was a child.  Too bad, you can&#x27;t find Cuticura at any store.  I was surprised Amazon offered it.  It is a great product to keep the face clear from unwanted pimples, zits etc.  I use it first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> My mother introduced me to Cuticura medicated soap during my teenage years for help with skin blemishes. It&#x27;s an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; product, but with all the benefits and good results without the \\&quot;new fangled\\&quot; hype and sales pressures. I love it and was disappointed when my local store discontinued stocking it. I was very happy to find it on Amazon, so I purchased several in order to keep a stock on hand at home.</li>
            <li> Cuticura medicated soap has been used by my family since in the 1940&#x27;s.  I has always been a very dependable product</li>
            <li> I used Cuticura soap for a number of years It made my skin feel so good and smooth but for a number of years I have been able to find it in the Detroit area.  I went to the last place I purchased it &amp;#34;Walgreens&amp;#34; Drug Store Highland Park, Michigan and was told they did not sell it anymore but recommended I go on the web to Amazon and I am so happy to be able to purchase it again.  I have beautiful skin and Cutucura is the only soap I have ever used on my face. I will recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I only been using this soap twice a day for three days now, and wow! The acne I had is clearing up. Blacks soaps, Noxzema, and Mary Kay products work, but this give me faster results. Reminds me of the Mary Kay acne treatment gel in that, as soon as I use it, the bumps start drying up. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or leave the skin dry either. Is also good to use elsewhere. Just fabulous!</li>
            <li> Ive used this soap for years. great product.</li>
            <li> I dont feel this soap does anything special. I&#x27;ve always used Dial soap but I thought i&#x27;d give this a try. I still prefer my dial soap.</li>
            <li> Cleared up ugly rash on back no doubt created or made worse from chlorine in showerhead water supply. This product was recommended years ago by childhood Jewish physician who was ahead of his time. It&#x27;s great it is still available.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for oily skin!! I&#x27;ve used it for over a week and it works well for me and I&#x27;ll buy more!</li>
            <li> always great for acne</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s healing attributes are amazing&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years to reduce the bumps and oily skin</li>
            <li> This soap is great for severe acne disease, (or hidradenitis suppurativa). It&#x27;s good with a hot bleach bath! It makes your skin feel tighter and squeeky clean.  Take a bath with a cup of bleach in the bath water, soak for a half hour on your back side, then flip over, and soak for a half hour on your front side.  Use the Cuticura soap.  Do this once a day, every day, (and I stress every day).  You should be diligent about this daily bath routine because you need to remove the oil off of your skin, like a person needs to remove oil out of their hair, (that has oily hair)!  This will seriously reduce your severe acne symptoms! All in the name of good skin health, our largest organ!</li>
            <li> BEST SOAP EVER REALLY WORKS HELP WITH KEEPING FACE CLEAN AND SMOOTH.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap in high school and now I am 44 years old.  I have the best skin because of this soap, and ocnstantly get compliments on my skin.  I had horrible acne until I started using this soap.  I use it once a day in the morning shower and my skin is so soft!  I highly recommend Cuticura.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice soap and lathers up perfectly.  Great for both my face and for shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> I have suffered with adult acne since my early twenties, and I am now thirty-six. I also have some other physical conditions that require me to take medication. One particularly promising medication that I took in the past made my acne even worse! I had to change my medication because the acne was so severe. I tried everything to control the acne, but nothing worked! I saw several dermatologists, took different antibiotics, and many, many prescription topicals! Nothing worked! I tried what seems like every over-the-counter topical treatment that is out there! Most of them caused excessive drying, yet did not clear up the acne. Needless to say, when I found this product I was skeptical! Well, I am thrilled to say that this is my miracle soap! It actually works! Imagine that! A product that actually does what it says! My face is finally clear! And it is not dry in the least! I no longer try to hide my face with my hair. And the best part is that I tried that medication again for my other illness that made my acne worse. Well now it does not even give me a pimple! It truly is a miracle! I now keep several bars on hand, so that I never run out! I cannot believe how cheap it is either! I honestly would pay hundreds of dollars for a product that works this well! I wish I would have tried it a decade ago!</li>
            <li> While using this soap, I got more acne than I started with.</li>
            <li> Have used it for 40 plus years.</li>
            <li> This is a very remarkable product. I first got wind of it on acne.org. A member of the website explaiined that she had been using it for for her acne scar &amp; said it seemed to work great for her existing acne as well. So I decided to give it a try. Needless to say, this product didn&#x27;t really dissapoint. This product doesn&#x27;t overdry &amp; after you use it, it leaves your face feeling fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> I truly love this soap. I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps that doesn&#x27;t dry out or break out my skin. Would recommend to others. It smells soft as well</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my face and it&#x27;s great for keeping acne under control without being too drying. I used to spend money on Proactiv but that got too expensive to I decided to order this bar. It works much BETTER than Proactiv for me, and over a year later I still haven&#x27;t used up this 1 bar, even though I use it pretty much every day. (I only use it on my face because I like it to last as long as possible.) This is definitely a cheap, lasting soap that will make your skin healthier. I still get the occasional pimple when I&#x27;m extremely stressed, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> its fine.  Could not find it in the stores anymore.  It suits my purpose.  Thanks much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok it has a strong scent</li>
            <li> I used this soap as a teenager along with the ointment, and as a young woman continued to use it to cleanse my face but added a moisturizer. At some point I started using a variety of moisturizing cleansers which are supposedly better than soap and water for mature skin. Recently I looked at my face in a magnifying mirror and discovered that I have some blackheads. Yuck! So I am back to my regimen of Cuticura soap and water, and a small amount of the ointment at night. I find this soap to be mild and gentle so am using it as a bath soap and also. It is hard milled, so lasts a long time, especially if you stand it on end to dry between uses. It is a medicinal soap which contains Phenol, so doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;perfumey\\&quot; . Not a big deal for me, but might bother some people. Odor does not linger once rinsed off, though. I am so glad that this product is still around, although harder to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful soap.  It clears up your skin and keeps it clear.  I have tried many, many products.  This soap is a wonderful find for both the adults and teenagers in our family.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin hydrated and soothing formula</li>
            <li> So far I like this product, it does leave you a bit dry but if you use a good moisturizer you will fair well.  I touch my face alot during the day (i recognized that) so i am sure that touching door handles and such are the reason for my break outs.  So i try to wash my hands much much more.. (almost O.C.) LOL!! but anyway.. when i wash my face at night and moisturize i notice in the morning my skin is a lot smoother.  Give it a try, it&#x27;s not pricey and it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> i purchased a bar of cuticura at a local pharmacy the other day, after trying everything else.  my skin was doing really very well until the last few months, and i still am not completely sure what&#x27;s causing my breakouts.  but the next morning after using cuticura, i could already see a significant reduction in the size of my blemishes.  today is the third day i&#x27;ve used it, and the stubborn zits i&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for weeks, are now minimal, and i&#x27;m hopeful that if i continue this regimen, they&#x27;ll be completely gone within the next few days to a week.  the only slight problem is that after using, my skin feels somewhat taught, so in combination with the soap, i apply ponds dry skin cream, so i would recommend a moisturizer in conjunction with the soap for those of you with dry/combination skin, especially during these winter months.  merry christmas and God bless,  amy :)</li>
            <li> Only thing I use to wash my face. Have used it for 30 years or better.  A great product.  Keeps my skin looking great</li>
            <li> Nothing else works especally if you have hormonal acne from high testoterone but this stuff is AMAZING. It&#x27;s super hard to find, harmon drug has it but other than that you gotta buy it online but it works well. The key is to use a diffrent wash cloth for your acne area then the rest of your body so you dont spread the germs and oils that make acne worse, then ONLY twice a week or so use those scrub gloves (VERY GENTLY) to exfolitae the areas. If you rub too hard it can cause more acne. But this stuff works well on backacne so far.</li>
            <li> used this all thru highschool for my acne.  Then no one around here carried it anymore.  I was so blessed to find it on Amazon.  I am now 62 and it keeps my face smooth and young....I love this soap.</li>
            <li> Did not work, maybe it&#x27;s the skin type I have, but it this soap did not work.  Tried Nutregena instead.</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by a dermatologist. Old, tried and true.</li>
            <li> This is a bacterial soap. Money wasted because it didn&#x27;t anything as claimed. I could easily buy bacterial soap from my local stores</li>
            <li> Just like I remembered it to be</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> Cleansed well and did not give me pimples. I think they actually kept it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bar of soap for about 5 years now. It does the job at a good price.  It lasts for months and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I used to use Cuticura Medicated Anti-Bacterial Soap in the late &#x27;70s to mid-&#x27;80s when I was a teen / young adult and LOVED IT !!!  Then, mysteriously, it disappeared from store shelves.  You couldn&#x27;t google things in the &#x27;80s so I had to forgot about it and use other unsatisfactory products for years.  Recently, on a quirk, I was surfing Amazon and looked it up --- and to my surprise, it was all over the place.  Even new products have been introduced.  But the soap I used decades ago was still there (the box design hadn&#x27;t even changed).  It still works fantastic if you use it as directed.  If the scent is a little intense, get the white bar.  Lastly, I ordered it and received it two days later.&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  You wash your face one time with this soap and you&#x27;ll see and feel the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> For a non-prescription facial cleanser that is inexpensive, this is a great way to go. Kept my face from getting oily, I think it works just as well as cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Great product really does help clear the acne FAST!  I use this soap along with koijic acid soap,  they get rid of pimples,  white heads and blackheads over night.&lt;br /&gt; Steps I use:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash face with circuits,  be sure to leather. Rinse face.&lt;br /&gt;2.wash face with koijic avoid soap let it sit for about 3min (no longer) it will start to sting if you leave it on more than that. Rinse face WELL.&lt;br /&gt;TaDa!  Lol&lt;br /&gt;Few Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1.Be sure to use different rags for each soap&lt;br /&gt;2.change out your rags every 3days&lt;br /&gt;3. The soap doing make your face feel kinda dry but it leaves a glow on your face on you don&#x27;t really have to worry about lotion.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use twice: day and night for best results. (no more than that)&lt;br /&gt;5. This soap is NOT A CURE,  but it does clear your acne, by saying that,  just know that if you stop using the soap the acne will be back.&lt;br /&gt;THANKS!! GREAT SOAP I WOULD TRULY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> This soap is not for everyone, but a good brand!</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way!  Fast delivery, perfect secure packaging, great product!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I been using this product for 3 weeks. My skin looks great right after I wash my face but sense my skin is oily by the end of the day it oily again. I haven&#x27;t had any new bumbs appear so that is a good thing. I am gonna keep using this product, just wish I coyld by it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at retail anymore, this is the best skin soap for clearing up facial breakouts, itching skin, cleaning cuts and scrapes and keeping my hands sanitized.</li>
            <li> makes my skin super soft! Love!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for years and still love it as much as I did when I first used it.  Cleans the pores on my face great and does not leave my skin dry.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product, and will be ordering more soon. My face has cleared up so much just by using this soap. If u have problem skin, I advise you to try this product it is worth it. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have no acne and never had any.  I just like this soap and use it every morning.  It is perfect.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift. Hard to find these days.</li>
            <li> Face feels so clean after using this soap</li>
            <li> Have been using this soap for many years.  Excellent, especially for soaping face before administering shaving cream.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Worked for a little. For some reason the acne kept coming back. One day I was about to shave, i lathered this up and put it all over my beard. The razor literally glided over my face. Works better as a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Safe and effective.  Great for delicate skin. Pleasant  scent.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best cure for facial blemish problems. After spending lots of money on pro active and many others this simple inexpensive bar of soap more than cured the problem. The best purchase by far.</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and I&#x27;m an active guy, so I&#x27;m often very sweaty and sometimes don&#x27;t shower off right away. As a result, I sometimes got sporadic acne that was especially unfortunate because of my job, so I looked into ways to help mitigate some of my skin issues. Honestly, I have tried a lot of things, and I have gotten the best results from this. My acne has all but disappeared. You have to be consistent, wash twice a day, and stick with it, but I have so much less acne now that it has to be doing something.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I have found that keeps my daughter face from breaking out and we have tried everything. I use it now to on my face and my back since in the summer I sometimes breakout. Love this soap.</li>
