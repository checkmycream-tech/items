            <li>I started using this Cuticura face soap after my grandmother recommended it back in high school.</li>

            <li> Any other soap or body wash makes my sensitive skin break out.  </li>
            <li> If you ever have dry or moist skin, this blue soap does wonders in neutralizing it out of the abnormal state.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Cuticura for minor skin irritations as well as dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft but not too dried out.  </li>

            <li> I use it from time to time and it seems to work well and is not overly harsh at all.  </li>
            <li> made me super dry and just horrible- ended up giving it away</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly difficult to find locally and is no bargain when I do happen upon a bar.</li>
            <li> Triclocarban has been shown to artificially amplify the effects of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone, which could promote the growth of breast and prostate cancer.</li>
            <li> I also used this soap on one of my children with a scalp condition in the late 1960&#x27;s</li>

            <li> In laboratory studies, trilocarban has been shown to disrupt hormones and can encourage the growth of drug-resistant bacteria or \\&quot;superbugs.\\&quot; Animal studies have shown both of these chemicals (triclocarban and triclosan) can interfere with hormones critical for normal development and function of the brain and reproductive system.Triclosan has been associated with lower levels of thyroid hormone and testosterone, which could result in altered behavior, learning disabilities, or infertility. Triclocarban has been shown to artificially amplify the effects of sex hormones such as estrogen and testosterone, which could promote the growth of breast and prostate cancer. Furthermore, laboratory studies suggest that triclosan and triclocarban may be contributing to antibiotic resistance in bacteria known to cause human infections.  [...]</li>

            <li> I have used Cuticura for over twenty years. I prefer the original medicated bar over the oatmeal bar becaus eI have pretty oily skin. It has become increasingly difficult to find locally and is no bargain when I do happen upon a bar. I ususally buy several bars at a time from Amazon which lasts between 10-14 months. The bigger bars are a better value because there is less waste, but they are not as nice for camping and travel. I have very sensitive skin and have never had a problem with this soap. I typically apply it only to my face and neck and use a good body wash for the rest of my body.</li>

            <li> Clear skin but you have to use a moisturizer after you use it. The soap makes your skin VERY DRY but the benefits out ways the dryness.</li>
            <li> This Cuticura soap was the single best agent to fight my acne as an adolescent 30 years ago. I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t carry it in the drugstores anymore, but I&#x27;m thankful we can still find it online on Amazon. Even though I&#x27;m a middle-aged adult, I still experience skin blemishes from sweating a lot during workouts. The Cuticura is still the best facial soap I&#x27;ve ever used to keep my skin clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I wish they sold it at regular stores! It is great for your skin, my husband and I have been using this for ten years. The soap is very dense, if you just use to to cleanse your face one bar will last 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> Cuticura Medicated – Anti-Bacterial Bar Soap brought relief to a skin irritation I was suffering.  It has a fresh clean smell that I like.  It is not a heavy medicine smell that will leave you feeling like you just stepped out of the hospital.  I recommend it highly especially if there is an itchy skin irritation, even the scalp.</li>
            <li> This has helped me clear up my cystic acne on my back. I wont use anything else. Its worth a try if you are suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> Great for normal skin, not so much for oily skin. I much prefer the exfoliating bar!</li>
            <li> And since I can no longer purchase it at a local store, I am grateful to be able to now buy this wonderful soap in bulk.</li>
            <li> This leaves your skin soft but not too dried out.  It works great for my middle age skin when I have acne break-outs, but my 12 year old son also uses it.</li>
