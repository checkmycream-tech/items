            <li>I really liked this all natural product.</li>
            <li>was provided Cellulite treatment Gel Cream for Skin by true</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s great to get results on the buttocks, I am more concerned about my inner thigh cellulite because the cellulite begins right where the bottom of a pair of modest shorts would end, thereby drawing one&#x27;s eyes right to my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to using this product even so much more!</li>

            <li>I guess that&#x27;s why the photo features a picture of the buttocks as opposed to one&#x27;s legs (smile).  </li>

            <li>and this gel does take a good half hour to set in my skin.</li>
            <li>am holding our for the Shessentials to come back because between the two of them, my inner thighs and buttocks would be in really great shape.  </li>
            <li>legs are in good shape and have a fair amount of muscle, but the inner thigh area is just tough to beat.  </li>
            <li>whatever reason, this cream worked much better on my buttocks than it did on my inner thighs.  </li>
            <li>However, the Shessentials worked better on my inner thighs than my buttocks.  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty well</li>

            <li>I, most definitely, gained a new outlook on organic beauty products!</li>
            <li>I experience a gentle tingling and for me that is a sign the product is plumping and tightening just as advertised.</li>
            <li>but this takes much longer.</li>
            <li>She does not have much Cellulite</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife because she&#x27;s always complaining about her cellulite, which doesn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really think this product works .i used it for two weeks</li>
            <li>Seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;the same size true</li>
            <li>i will send it back and ask for full Refund</li>
            <li>While waiting, I laid down across my bed and Googled the top ingredients in the Cellulite Treatment Gel.</li>
            <li>While waiting, I laid down across my bed and Googled the top ingredients in the Cellulite Treatment Gel.</li>
            <li>is like a face primer, but with a slight stickiness which mostly absorb away as it dries</li>
            <li>Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I mixed it with a smaller amount of BB Cream and the large pores on my nose...DISAPPEARED!!!</li>
            <li>The first was, &amp;#34;SHESSENTIALS Cellulite Cream Skin Tightening and Body Firming Treatment&amp;#34;; however, this cream is currently unavailable on Amazon&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I gently massaged the gel for about a minute and repeated this about 10 minutes later.</li>
            <li>she is not heavy</li>
            <li>So no messy drips.</li>
            <li>Either way, I feel like a winner because the plumping and tightening effects turned into a few more personal pluses before the week&#x27;s end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I am not seeing a daily improvement but just results of an almost instant noticeable improvement that just eventually wear off as the Cellulite Gel does throughout the day.</li>
            <li>My last science test (so far!)</li>
            <li>My last science test (so far!)</li>
            <li>I have barely done any exercising</li>
            <li>I use it 3 times every day, not always the same times though because I get busy</li>
            <li>Barely uses it, so don&#x27;t know if it actually works.</li>
            <li>noticed that the treatment gel&#x27;s main ingredients are in some of my other beauty products.</li>
            <li>I notice a little but after reading all the reviews I thought I would really see something</li>
            <li>So, just to peak my curious mind further, the last couple days I have spent some time testing the True You Organics Cellulite Gel on other areas I wanted to plump and tighten.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s just been a full week since I began using True You Organics Cellulite Gel and I have been applying it as directed on the small dimpling area on my lower buttocks. I experience a gentle tingling and for me that is a sign the product is plumping and tightening just as advertised. When it&#x27;s dry, (within approximately 20-30 minutes), I see and feel the ugliness of aging that found a home on my butt has diminished. Unfortunately, I am not seeing a daily improvement but just results of an almost instant noticeable improvement that just eventually wear off as the Cellulite Gel does throughout the day. Again, it has only been a week and I doubt that even an intensive cosmetic treatment or surgery would have me seeing 100% results. Either way, I feel like a winner because the plumping and tightening effects turned into a few more personal pluses before the week&#x27;s end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that the treatment gel&#x27;s main ingredients are in some of my other beauty products. So, just to peak my curious mind further, the last couple days I have spent some time testing the True You Organics Cellulite Gel on other areas I wanted to plump and tighten. For my first random experiment, I applied it to my entire eye area. The gel&#x27;s coolness was instantly refreshing and so were the disappearing lines under my eyes. My eyelids are often puffy from allergies. I swear they retain water. At least to me they look water-logged.  Anyway, I gently massaged the gel for about a minute and repeated this about 10 minutes later. I waited a bit for the gel to absorb into my skin...I could feel the gel doing its thing (much more my face than my butt felt).&lt;br /&gt;I then realized the texture of the True You Organics Gel is like a face primer, but with a slight stickiness which mostly absorb away as it dries but this takes much longer. Now I feel like I am playing scientist with experimenting when I stumbled upon another idea...I mixed it with a smaller amount of BB Cream and the large pores on my nose...DISAPPEARED!!! Filled in like potholes! Now, when I went to apply a liquid foundation over, it wasn&#x27;t blending as I hoped, but I only waited about five minutes drying time like I would a primer and this gel does take a good half hour to set in my skin. I will be trying this technique again, for sure. My last science test (so far!) was this morning. I put the gel in the ice box (refrigerator) for about an hour then applied it as an all over face mask. I started applying a thin layer but immediately changed my mind and applied it thick. While waiting, I laid down across my bed and Googled the top ingredients in the Cellulite Treatment Gel. I&#x27;m definitely looking forward to using this product even so much more! I wish it was sold in a larger pump size! I firmly believe products have varying effects on different people and different skin (types, tones, textures, etc.)...even our own body has these skin variances on our different body parts. I, most definitely, gained a new outlook on organic beauty products! Thank you, True You Organics!&lt;br /&gt;Please Note: I received this product in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I admit, I&#x27;m kind of in a happy shock. I would never have guessed this product was going to bring me so much fun and become an added benefit to my beauty products in more ways than one!)...DISAPPEARED!!! Filled in like potholes! Now, when I went to apply a liquid foundation over, it wasn&#x27;t blending as I hoped, but I only waited about five minutes drying time like I would a primer and this gel does take a good half hour to set in my skin.

            <li> Reducing leg swelling.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I am 5&#x27;4&#x27;&#x27; and 125 pounds I use it as suggested on the label and it didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all.</li>
            <li> This cellulite gel does seem to smooth out my cellulite. I just started using it so it&#x27;s not 100% gone, but it has reduced a bit already so I look forward to seeing the results after using for a few months!</li>
            <li> i got this product but not the same shape as the picture&lt;br /&gt;the same size true&lt;br /&gt;but not the same shape and look different from the picture&lt;br /&gt;and it came to me dusty like it was drop and found in there store&lt;br /&gt;i am not in USA otherwise i will send it back and ask for full Refund</li>
            <li> I never saw a change in my cellulite, and mine isn&#x27;t that bad....AND the bottle is tiny!! I woulnd&#x27;t recommend this product to ANYONE!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts long. I probably got about 2 months worth of usage out of this. I had cellulite on both upper thighs and as of today I DO NOT SEE THEM! I have barely done any exercising so it&#x27;s all 100% this cellulite gel!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything. The creams are always expensive with no results. It&#x27;s nice to finally find something that works. You guys have gotten a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried four cellulite creams and there are two that showed results by the time the bottle was empty.  The first was, &amp;#34;SHESSENTIALS Cellulite Cream Skin Tightening and Body Firming Treatment&amp;#34;; however, this cream is currently unavailable on Amazon&#x27;s website.  The other is this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason, this cream worked much better on my buttocks than it did on my inner thighs.  I guess that&#x27;s why the photo features a picture of the buttocks as opposed to one&#x27;s legs (smile).  However, the Shessentials worked better on my inner thighs than my buttocks.  While it&#x27;s great to get results on the buttocks, I am more concerned about my inner thigh cellulite because the cellulite begins right where the bottom of a pair of modest shorts would end, thereby drawing one&#x27;s eyes right to my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My legs are in good shape and have a fair amount of muscle, but the inner thigh area is just tough to beat.  Nevertheless, I am going to purchase this cream again (just added it to my cart today) and give it another shot at the inner thighs.  Even if the results aren&#x27;t great, it won&#x27;t be for not because I will also use it on my buttocks and I am fairly confident that it will continue to smooth out the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am holding our for the Shessentials to come back because between the two of them, my inner thighs and buttocks would be in really great shape.  Still, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this Cellulite Treatment Gel. She does not have much Cellulite she is not heavy she just needs to tone her body. She has been using it for several weeks. She is starting to see a difference on her legs. She also has been exercising so I am sure that is helping to.&lt;br /&gt;She has slight cellulite on the inner part of her thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She feels it is make a slight difference and with her exercising and walking. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my unbiased review and opinion. All opinions and words are my own.</li>
            <li> I really liked this all natural product. It is a gel... So no messy drips. The smells is great... Fruity clean. However... For the price... The bottle seems way too SMALL. Ouch... My purse is crying. I would have like a bit more in that bottle... It doesn&#x27;t last long. However if price is not a problem... The product does appear to work as they claim... My bum is getting smooth! Ready for my bikini;)</li>
            <li> Wow!! Really was skeptical about this cellulite cream because I doubt that these things work but I actually saw a difference! I use a bath spunge and scrub my thighs before rubbing the cream in. I use it 3 times every day, not always the same times though because I get busy so I do whenever I have free time. Love true you and recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife because she&#x27;s always complaining about her cellulite, which doesn&#x27;t bother me much but i want her to be happy with herself... It seems to firm her skin well and she said she loves the fruity smell and the fact that it&#x27;s organic. Wife&#x27;s happy, i&#x27;m happy what more can i say...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really think this product works .i used it for two weeks and I did not see any slight change</li>
            <li> I notice a little but after reading all the reviews I thought I would really see something&lt;br /&gt;I had the same results with drug store products</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a smooth cream to put on and I am not sure of it&#x27;s effect on my skin at this point.  Not enough of it for the price and not easy to come out of the bottle so I probably will not purchase this again.  I would appreciate someone telling me some good information on this product and why they continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Used for two months and no change occurred</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle aged with a lot of body changes one being increased cellulite, and I don&#x27;t expect any miracle but so far I believe this to be working and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well it got rid I about of my cellulite and I&#x27;m still using it to get rid of the rest</li>
            <li> i am very skeptical when I use these cellulite gels. There are so many and most of them are just claiming to do something but they are just plain old moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this gel cream thinking it might be the same , but after regularly using I noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;There is no miracle cream for cellulite but this surely has improved the over all look of the un wanted cellulite on the back of my thigh. Its not gone 100% but it has made the skin firmer and better.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product ,it has beautiful easy to pump bottle and the smell is amazing too.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided Cellulite treatment Gel Cream for Skin by true you organics in return for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Fabulous  Cellulite Treatment Gel Cream! I love the fact that its organic! Seems to be working very well. My thighs are so  much soother! I have to say it does warm up after a bit of time. Which I have no problem with. It almost feels like it melting the fat away. I can say that I will have to buy another bottle after I finish this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Got it a year ago.. Barely uses it, so don&#x27;t know if it actually works. Smells good but feels watery..</li>
