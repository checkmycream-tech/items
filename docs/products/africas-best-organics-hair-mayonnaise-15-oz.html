            <li>i would surely reccomend this product for people who need a good treatment on their hair(:</li>
            <li>Nice product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own with ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>her hair was easy to detangle and smelled so good.</li>
            <li>Will forever love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Since it is a protein conditioner, I plan to use it once a month or two the most.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>many products</li>
            <li>LOVE MY HAIR CONDITIONER</li>
            <li>I use to pay $20 for salon hair treatments twice a month and let me tell you, this stuff works 5 times better than the salon treatments.</li>
            <li>It can stay for 3 or 4 days without adding more water.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>One thing I wasn&#x27;t pleased with is the title...</li>
            <li>my hair in love with this , and i&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li>However, it builds up on the hair, so the hair must be washed more often to keep the hair mayonnaise from building up and turning into dandruff-like flakes.  </li>
            <li>As my hair grew out, I used this product to keep my hair manageable until I was able to get it cut and reshaped.  </li>
            <li>my hair is softer, healthier and more manageable.</li>
            <li>i love this product, been using it for months and would continue using it.</li>
            <li>What works for one person or even most people may not work for you.  </li>
            <li>and I love it..</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Love mostly that I can use it &amp; still be comfortable with having my hair touched or resting my head on upholstery without embarrassing results!</li>
            <li>After trying many products touting their \\&quot;light\\</li>
            <li>MIRACULOUSLY SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>Best product for wash days or when hair is dry.</li>
            <li>After doing research, this was one of the best things for protein treatment of  dry damage hair.</li>
            <li>The oz and price was very good too compared to local BSS.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy and applies easily.</li>
            <li>this is very good for people that hot comb their hair or just go natural.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>so if you use sulfate free shampoo it will still come out.</li>
            <li>This is a good product in making your hair soft and for breakage....</li>
            <li>so make sure you get the right one when you order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new favorite hair product. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it my hair grew about an inch maybe more in that week</li>
            <li>its amazing on my hair, make it soft and helps alot ,would recomemed this product</li>
            <li>and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel like pillow soft after every use and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my hair comes out feeling strong and soft.</li>
            <li>If it builds on the hair so quickly, it may clog pores.</li>
            <li>Strengthened my hair and thickened the edges tremendously</li>
            <li>Hair mayonnaise is great for curls and gentle enough to leave on overnight.</li>
            <li>Currently I am using Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise, but in the future I will be switching to Africa&#x27;s Best Hair Mayonnaise.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li>the smell might not bother some but the musky strong smell is too much.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for me and my daughter every since she was in elementary school</li>
            <li>Love this product so much , I will definitely repurchase :)</li>
            <li>Btw I am aware of the lack of true organics.</li>
            <li>This is nicely priced and very effective, blends well with other oils (I like to add some extra virgin olive oil and  pure jojoba oil)</li>
            <li>I use it right out the shower.</li>
            <li>My denman brush glided right through my hair.</li>
            <li>It provides great softness and manageability at every use and the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li>It always leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most definitely be buying it there from now on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty curly/wavy.</li>
            <li>Though I am white, I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and light.</li>
            <li>I just started using this stuff and it works so well on my whole family&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>so try that place first...</li>
            <li>For the first time I used my leave in conditioner (which is a silicone-free rinse out conditioner) as a rinse out conditioner to combat the drying effects of the SLS in the shampoo and detangle my hair, and I could feel the moisture return to my hair which seemed to be blocked by this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was after shampooing her hair I rubbed some through and let it sit over night.</li>
            <li>I will not be buying no more of african best products...</li>
            <li>it left my hair softer and more manageable than the 8$ shampoo that is suppose to be the &amp;#34;it thing&amp;#34; for</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it isn&#x27;t so curly, but it curls in 5-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My hair was dry and broke very easily however, after the first use it felt so silky and managable.  </li>
            <li>so i had a lot of new growth, really minimized the new growth and made my hair soft than before, hoping that it minimizes shedding with continued use, so far i&#x27;m happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could tell how much softer my hair was right as the product was coming out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to do her hair so quick and easy since this last transition back to natural.</li>
            <li>After giving Africa&#x27;s Best products a try I will never go back to the super expensive flops I used before.</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t see any change in texture or shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use the organic root stimulator Olive oil cream which works very well.</li>
            <li>and it really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Really helps to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff is really silky, helps with tangles, and moisturizes really well for the price.</li>
            <li>Do you know how much it is in Walmart?</li>
            <li>The directions don&#x27;t really specify how often you should use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really believe that it is all fully organic.</li>
            <li>Amazon charges too much for this product.  </li>
            <li>It really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>The shipping was well package and fast.</li>
            <li>However, it can be very runny.</li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves the product.</li>
            <li>I really should have checked the ingredients before I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Once I was ready to use it, I did read the ingredient list, and upon seeing &amp;#34;mineral oil,&amp;#34; warning bells rang immediately.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my mother&#x27;s hair because her hair is really damagedd and sheds alot.</li>
            <li>I had been using Aphogee Keratin reconstructed every week, not realizing that it was damaging my hair from over use (too much protein, manage balance of protein and moisture).</li>
            <li>Really conditions the hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to pay this much, but I would after using it.</li>
            <li>I just bought the product today and went to grease my hair and as soon as I put it on, it instantly melted on my hair causing my roots to be smooth.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is seeking moisture rich hair.</li>
            <li>Tried it for the first time today, made my hair really soft while i was washing it.</li>
            <li>Today I washed with a full shampoo - with SLS - to totally clarify my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is hands down one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried for coarse African American hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest this product to any Caucasian with fried hair.</li>
            <li>My hair also grows a little more, my friends even notice at times.</li>
            <li>we rinsed this out and her hair was SO SOFT !!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a waste of money otherwise. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Thank you, was tempted to end transitioning because hair was such a struggle because did not have right moisture protein balance.</li>
            <li>The smell very nice but unfortunately</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t seem to work well unless it is used on newly washed hair.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I&#x27;ve found it on the cheap locally.. Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much because I have used similar products that were too greasy, heavy or that otherwise made my hair not &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Natural hair came out very soft.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s an adult now.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft and NO</li>
            <li>I have an 18 ounce that was 3 bucks and change, and here on Amazon, the stuff is nearly NINE dollars for the 15 ounce.</li>
            <li>You are getting ripped completely off, people if you buy it from here.</li>
            <li>Yes Walmart is A WHOLE LOT cheaper, but I&#x27;m currently in an area where this product isn&#x27;t sold for miles</li>
            <li>This product used as a leave in will give you soft defined curls.</li>
            <li>It keeps the hair soft and manageable and helps with growth.  </li>
            <li>This product allowed my hair to grow in soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It really made a big difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>c,4a hair, and in the 1 year I transitioned and the 2 1/2 years I&#x27;ve been fully natural</li>
            <li>and she has a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to hair being soft until the product dries</li>
            <li>detangling my natural hair is a breeze.  </li>
            <li>, it works well with a heating cap, leaves your hair soft, moisturized, tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Surprised that this is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m looking for a gentle, daily use shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair got hard at first touch, but knowing that&#x27;s how strong protein conditioners work, I figured I&#x27;d use a moisturizing deep conditioner afterwards, and all would be well.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very dry and in much need of conditioning; I loved hair mayo due to its consistency, it is not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li>I can definitely see how it will stop a lot of my breakage - since dryness is my main problem.</li>
            <li>I noticed that when I use it consistently my hair breaks a lot less and my edges grow back a little more.</li>
            <li>No complaints with the product itself, only that it was packed so full to the brim that some of the product came out of the container and went onto the other things I&#x27;d ordered.</li>
            <li>I have type 3b/c hair and had a hard time finding a light product that makes my hair stay soft and shiny even after it dries.</li>
            <li>This product works really well on dry curly hair.</li>
            <li>This deep conditioning treatment makes my hair silky smooth without the harsh, often overpriced, salon treatment.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this, at least to people who have my type of hair.</li>
            <li>Save your shipping and handling costs and buy it from an actual store somewhere near you.</li>
            <li>Instantly my hair is soft when applying the mayonnaise.</li>
            <li>Her hair was soft the entire day.</li>
            <li>As far as growth, I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet, but then again I have only used a handful of times.  </li>
            <li>at this point, you can barely see the part in the front</li>
            <li>After the last relaxer it was very damaged and extremely dry.</li>
            <li>is an unpretentious, very affordable, generously rich treatement for thick, natural, black, 4-a type hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and it curled my thick, wiry, 4 b/c, TWA right up!  </li>
            <li>and then it&#x27;s either hard, flaky or just absorbed all the way.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> i love this product, been using it for months and would continue using it.</li>
            <li> What works for one person or even most people may not work for you.  </li>
            <li> and I love it..</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love mostly that I can use it &amp; still be comfortable with having my hair touched or resting my head on upholstery without embarrassing results!</li>
            <li> After trying many products touting their \\&quot;light\\</li>
            <li> MIRACULOUSLY SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> Best product for wash days or when hair is dry.</li>
            <li> After doing research, this was one of the best things for protein treatment of  dry damage hair.</li>
            <li> The oz and price was very good too compared to local BSS.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy and applies easily.</li>
            <li> this is very good for people that hot comb their hair or just go natural.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> so if you use sulfate free shampoo it will still come out.</li>
            <li> This is a good product in making your hair soft and for breakage....</li>
            <li> so make sure you get the right one when you order.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new favorite hair product. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it my hair grew about an inch maybe more in that week</li>
            <li> its amazing on my hair, make it soft and helps alot ,would recomemed this product</li>
            <li> and it was full of hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel like pillow soft after every use and it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my hair comes out feeling strong and soft.</li>
            <li> If it builds on the hair so quickly, it may clog pores.</li>
            <li> Strengthened my hair and thickened the edges tremendously</li>
            <li> Hair mayonnaise is great for curls and gentle enough to leave on overnight.</li>
            <li> Currently I am using Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise, but in the future I will be switching to Africa&#x27;s Best Hair Mayonnaise.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
            <li> the smell might not bother some but the musky strong smell is too much.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for me and my daughter every since she was in elementary school</li>
            <li> Love this product so much , I will definitely repurchase :)</li>
            <li> Btw I am aware of the lack of true organics.</li>
            <li> This is nicely priced and very effective, blends well with other oils (I like to add some extra virgin olive oil and  pure jojoba oil)</li>
            <li> I use it right out the shower.</li>
            <li> My denman brush glided right through my hair.</li>
            <li> It provides great softness and manageability at every use and the scent is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and easy to detangle.</li>
            <li> It always leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most definitely be buying it there from now on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> Though I am white, I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and light.</li>
            <li> I just started using this stuff and it works so well on my whole family&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> so try that place first...</li>
            <li> For the first time I used my leave in conditioner (which is a silicone-free rinse out conditioner) as a rinse out conditioner to combat the drying effects of the SLS in the shampoo and detangle my hair, and I could feel the moisture return to my hair which seemed to be blocked by this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was after shampooing her hair I rubbed some through and let it sit over night.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying no more of african best products...</li>
            <li> it left my hair softer and more manageable than the 8$ shampoo that is suppose to be the &amp;#34;it thing&amp;#34; for</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it isn&#x27;t so curly, but it curls in 5-15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair was dry and broke very easily however, after the first use it felt so silky and managable.  </li>
            <li> so i had a lot of new growth, really minimized the new growth and made my hair soft than before, hoping that it minimizes shedding with continued use, so far i&#x27;m happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could tell how much softer my hair was right as the product was coming out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to do her hair so quick and easy since this last transition back to natural.</li>
            <li> After giving Africa&#x27;s Best products a try I will never go back to the super expensive flops I used before.</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t see any change in texture or shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use the organic root stimulator Olive oil cream which works very well.</li>
            <li> and it really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Really helps to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really silky, helps with tangles, and moisturizes really well for the price.</li>
            <li> Do you know how much it is in Walmart?</li>
            <li> The directions don&#x27;t really specify how often you should use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really believe that it is all fully organic.</li>
            <li> Amazon charges too much for this product.  </li>
            <li> It really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The shipping was well package and fast.</li>
            <li> However, it can be very runny.</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves the product.</li>
            <li> I really should have checked the ingredients before I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Once I was ready to use it, I did read the ingredient list, and upon seeing &amp;#34;mineral oil,&amp;#34; warning bells rang immediately.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my mother&#x27;s hair because her hair is really damagedd and sheds alot.</li>
            <li> I had been using Aphogee Keratin reconstructed every week, not realizing that it was damaging my hair from over use (too much protein, manage balance of protein and moisture).</li>
            <li> Really conditions the hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to pay this much, but I would after using it.</li>
            <li> I just bought the product today and went to grease my hair and as soon as I put it on, it instantly melted on my hair causing my roots to be smooth.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is seeking moisture rich hair.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today, made my hair really soft while i was washing it.</li>
            <li> Today I washed with a full shampoo - with SLS - to totally clarify my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried for coarse African American hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest this product to any Caucasian with fried hair.</li>
            <li> My hair also grows a little more, my friends even notice at times.</li>
            <li> we rinsed this out and her hair was SO SOFT !!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money otherwise. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Thank you, was tempted to end transitioning because hair was such a struggle because did not have right moisture protein balance.</li>
            <li> The smell very nice but unfortunately</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t seem to work well unless it is used on newly washed hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I&#x27;ve found it on the cheap locally.. Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much because I have used similar products that were too greasy, heavy or that otherwise made my hair not &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Natural hair came out very soft.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s an adult now.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky soft and NO</li>
            <li> I have an 18 ounce that was 3 bucks and change, and here on Amazon, the stuff is nearly NINE dollars for the 15 ounce.</li>
            <li> You are getting ripped completely off, people if you buy it from here.</li>
            <li> Yes Walmart is A WHOLE LOT cheaper, but I&#x27;m currently in an area where this product isn&#x27;t sold for miles</li>
            <li> This product used as a leave in will give you soft defined curls.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair soft and manageable and helps with growth.  </li>
            <li> This product allowed my hair to grow in soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It really made a big difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> c,4a hair, and in the 1 year I transitioned and the 2 1/2 years I&#x27;ve been fully natural</li>
            <li> and she has a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to hair being soft until the product dries</li>
            <li> detangling my natural hair is a breeze.  </li>
            <li> , it works well with a heating cap, leaves your hair soft, moisturized, tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Surprised that this is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m looking for a gentle, daily use shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair got hard at first touch, but knowing that&#x27;s how strong protein conditioners work, I figured I&#x27;d use a moisturizing deep conditioner afterwards, and all would be well.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very dry and in much need of conditioning; I loved hair mayo due to its consistency, it is not greasy or messy.</li>
            <li> I can definitely see how it will stop a lot of my breakage - since dryness is my main problem.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I use it consistently my hair breaks a lot less and my edges grow back a little more.</li>
            <li> No complaints with the product itself, only that it was packed so full to the brim that some of the product came out of the container and went onto the other things I&#x27;d ordered.</li>
            <li> I have type 3b/c hair and had a hard time finding a light product that makes my hair stay soft and shiny even after it dries.</li>
            <li> This product works really well on dry curly hair.</li>
            <li> This deep conditioning treatment makes my hair silky smooth without the harsh, often overpriced, salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this, at least to people who have my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Save your shipping and handling costs and buy it from an actual store somewhere near you.</li>
            <li> Instantly my hair is soft when applying the mayonnaise.</li>
            <li> Her hair was soft the entire day.</li>
            <li> As far as growth, I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet, but then again I have only used a handful of times.  </li>
            <li> at this point, you can barely see the part in the front</li>
            <li> After the last relaxer it was very damaged and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> is an unpretentious, very affordable, generously rich treatement for thick, natural, black, 4-a type hair like mine.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and it curled my thick, wiry, 4 b/c, TWA right up!  </li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s either hard, flaky or just absorbed all the way.</li>
            <li> In summary, this product sucked the moisture from my hair, would not allow me to replace moisture - even water, decreased manageability of my hair, and destroyed my curl pattern resulting in full blown frizzy Afro.</li>
            <li> Me, hubby, and kids have ridiculously curly hair that gets dried out easily.</li>
            <li> , my hair has never been so dry, and I have never had instant Afro like that.  </li>
            <li> Hair has now air dried and is so soft and manageable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Mexican/French descent w/thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> It doesnt work for long hair.</li>
            <li> What I do after a wash is twist my hair with the hair mayonnaise and let it dry</li>
            <li> Works well even if you apply on dry hair too.</li>
            <li> Applied this with coconut oil to dry hair, parted in four sections.</li>
            <li> My hair is normally incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> Well now i been natural for the past 7 month and decided to give this a try</li>
            <li> Went back to recommended products in the science of black hair and saw root stimulator version of this.</li>
            <li> Amazon should be ashamed of themselves, supporting such a falsely advertised product!</li>
            <li> The next day added a little bit to brush into ponytail.</li>
            <li> No much difference wasting of money</li>
            <li> after that i sit under the dryer with a wet towel and plastic cap on my head for 30minutes.</li>
            <li> A bit pricier than I expected,</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t be fooled by catchy names and empty lies.  </li>
            <li> As soon as the shampoo touched my hair, it was instantly, and I mean instantly, pliable.  </li>
            <li> and it made my hair softer then any other hair moisturize.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Well spent 4 dollars!</li>
            <li> I put a generous amount on my wet hair in the morning and voila!  </li>
            <li> In the past I would just rinse the previous day&#x27;s product out with water but water alone doesn&#x27;t seem to get this product out well enough.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt stronger and less breakage.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dyed a permanent black hair color, so my hair is indeed damaged.  </li>
            <li> one thing I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t like is that I need to shampoo my hair every morning to get the previous day&#x27;s product out.  </li>
            <li> : I put the conditioner on first when my hair is dirty</li>
            <li> The second day, after restyling (retwisting) my twists were lank and weighed down, and I had worse frizz.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the little bits of herbs that come in it, but hey for the results I see I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I blow dried it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I needed something heavy to handle my course wiry hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair had air dried hard from Aphogee.</li>
            <li> but it is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It leaves hair greasy and hard to comb.</li>
            <li> I cut out all of her relaxer and her hair feels thick, hard to hold ANY moisture</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and my hair soaks it up.</li>
            <li> (i think so anyways) and it leaves my hair feeling thick and looking shiney.  </li>
            <li> it is thick.</li>
            <li> I have thick African-American almost medium-length hair</li>
            <li> least 4 treatments in one jar!</li>
            <li> Not sure what Amazon is trying to do here, but when I saw the sticker price, I was a little shocked.</li>
            <li> At first I hated this stuff because it gave my hair a really weird, almost wax-like texture.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a rip-off buying from Amazon.</li>
            <li> After using ORS mayo for over 6 months, I grew tired of the sticky buildup felt on my hair each time I used it.</li>
            <li> I felt something was wrong</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair, get this!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair but alot of it.</li>
            <li> so I put it on dirty hair.</li>
            <li> It make your scalp itch like crazy...</li>
            <li> Its wasn&#x27;t very expensive either.</li>
            <li> My experience was so bad.  </li>
            <li> the name &#x27;originals&#x27; was written on it instead :(</li>
            <li> there are pthalates, paraben and sulfates and dangerous artificial colors!!!</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> but it itch your scalp real bad...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will forever love this stuff. Been using this product for me and my daughter every since she was in elementary school and she&#x27;s an adult now. It is a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Leaves my hair silky smooth. I bought this from Amazon BUT today I saw it at Walmart for way cheaper! I&#x27;ll most definitely be buying it there from now on. I have very thin hair but alot of it. It&#x27;s pretty curly/wavy. This product smells good and softens hair win/win!</li>
            <li> I purchased this locally for under four dollars.  I wanted to purchase some Aphogee (either the two step or the two minute treatment) but they didn&#x27;t have it stock.  I purchased this because my hair is feeling busted lately so in short of taking a pair of scissors, I decided to use this.  It smells herbal but it is not overwhelming.  I left it in my hair for about an hour and rinsed thoroughly. My hair felt stronger and less breakage.  Since it is a protein conditioner, I plan to use it once a month or two the most.</li>
            <li> This will be the last time I purchase this product. Not sure exactly what it does. I have used it on my hair but I really don&#x27;t see any change in texture or shine. I&#x27;ll continue to use the organic root stimulator Olive oil cream which works very well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best things to use if you want to grow your hair longer. The first time I tried it my hair grew about an inch maybe more in that week( it was a big noticeable difference). I used this four times out of the week and left it in there for like an hour and then rinsed out. I blow dried it about three times(easier for me) otherwise left it curly... and I greased my scalp twice. I only shampooed my hair once out of that week. If I wanted to wash again I would only use conditioner. (Keep your scalp moisturized.)</li>
            <li> I used this years ago when I was a buyer for afro products. Though I am white, I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really does what it says. I use it as both a daily moisturizer and a deep conditioning treatment. Really helps to strengthen hair.</li>
            <li> I had never taken good care of my hair and throughout the years of heat products and dying, it became crispy and fried like straw. The hairdresser would cringe when she saw it. I had used plenty of products that had come to no fix for my problem. One day, I ventured out into the Ethnic Hair care section of my local dollar store. The products made great promises at a really cheap price. After giving Africa&#x27;s Best products a try I will never go back to the super expensive flops I used before. My hair began to fix itself AND grow at the same time, almost two inches over the summer! I would highly suggest this product to any Caucasian with fried hair.</li>
            <li> I used to use this when i had a perm and it made my hair softer then any other hair moisturize. Well now i been natural for the past 7 month and decided to give this a try and yep it still works the same. After i wash out the hair mayonnaise i leave (Lustrasilk olive oil cholesterol) mixed with EVOO on my hair hopeful this stop the breakage &amp; damage. :) But the HAIR MAYONNAISE ROCKS! GIVE IT A TRY</li>
            <li> I use this product interchangeably along with others. It is affordable and does the job. It provides great softness and manageability at every use and the scent is not overwhelming. I am not one for reading labels on my products and maybe I should start. I knew this wasn&#x27;t organic and many products I use aren&#x27;t...I would very much likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> LOVE MY HAIR CONDITIONER</li>
            <li> My sister told me about this and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Great product.  I also use the leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Tried it for the first time today, made my hair really soft while i was washing it. I&#x27;m transitioning so i had a lot of new growth, really minimized the new growth and made my hair soft than before, hoping that it minimizes shedding with continued use, so far i&#x27;m happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by the way this came in a 15oz bottle when i ordered the 18oz so make sure you get the right one when you order. hopefully i can find this at wallmart</li>
            <li> I used this product after taking out my braids. My hair felt soft and light. I don&#x27;t think my hair has ever felt that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Mexican/French descent w/thick, long hair. I straighten it every weekend and I ride a Harley, so my hair breaks, splits &amp; gets damaged. I use to pay $20 for salon hair treatments twice a month and let me tell you, this stuff works 5 times better than the salon treatments. My hair stylist asked what I&#x27;m using bc my hair is so healthy!     I get @ least 4 treatments in one jar! I do the reverse: I put the conditioner on first when my hair is dirty (Start applying 2\\&quot; away from the scalp and saturate hair thru the ends). When done, I braid my hair, tie a bandana over my head and leave it in overnite. In the morning I just shampoo the conditioner out (add&#x27;l conditioner is NOT necessary or your hair w/be oily). My hair is silky soft and NO MORE breaks or split ends! I treat my hair to this stuff twice a month. This product definately gets 2 thumbs up for the quality &amp; price.</li>
            <li> I just started using this stuff and it works so well on my whole family&#x27;s hair! Me, hubby, and kids have ridiculously curly hair that gets dried out easily. This stuff is really silky, helps with tangles, and moisturizes really well for the price. It&#x27;s my new favorite hair product. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;One thing I have to say though, it&#x27;s a rip-off buying from Amazon. DO NOT buy this product from Amazon! Go to Walmart, Target, beauty supply store, ANYWHERE but here at Amazon. Do you know why? Because the container is for some reason 8 dollars. Do you know how much it is in Walmart? THREE DOLLARS and CHANGE. Why the hell is it EIGHT bucks here, I will never know. There is NO size difference. I have an 18 ounce that was 3 bucks and change, and here on Amazon, the stuff is nearly NINE dollars for the 15 ounce. You are getting ripped completely off, people if you buy it from here. Save your shipping and handling costs and buy it from an actual store somewhere near you. It&#x27;s a waste of money otherwise. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and I hope you can find it cheaper somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I&#x27;ve been using it on/off for years! I noticed that when I use it consistently my hair breaks a lot less and my edges grow back a little more. My hair also grows a little more, my friends even notice at times. I don&#x27;t like the little bits of herbs that come in it, but hey for the results I see I don&#x27;t mind. I can pick those twigs right out, lol! Yes Walmart is A WHOLE LOT cheaper, but I&#x27;m currently in an area where this product isn&#x27;t sold for miles so Amazon it is for me.</li>
            <li> This is hands down one of the best products I&#x27;ve tried for coarse African American hair. Over the years, I&#x27;ve tried MANY products, from Pantene to Garnier, to Suave, everything! This deep conditioning treatment makes my hair silky smooth without the harsh, often overpriced, salon treatment. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product, but what I will say is that it&#x27;s about $4.00 at your local Walmart. Not sure what Amazon is trying to do here, but when I saw the sticker price, I was a little shocked. Definitely cheaper elsewhere so try that place first...whatever you do, make sure you pick this product up!!!</li>
            <li> I have type 3b/c hair and had a hard time finding a light product that makes my hair stay soft and shiny even after it dries. What I do after a wash is twist my hair with the hair mayonnaise and let it dry and it looks nice like that. The next day I take the twists apart with my fingers and put it into a style. It can stay for 3 or 4 days without adding more water. I love this.</li>
            <li> IF you read the ingredients you&#x27;ll notice there are pthalates, paraben and sulfates and dangerous artificial colors!!! HOW DO THEY GET AWAY WITH CALLING THEMSELVES ORGANIC?! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves, supporting such a falsely advertised product! I would NOT use this on myself, but especially on my kids. TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair about two months ago and I got this product to help my hair. I used it as directed and then when I brushed my hair out, I looked into the brush and it was full of hair. My hair is breaking off! I am so upset. My head was itchy and the hair just keeps coming out.</li>
            <li> One of the best product</li>
            <li> The smell very nice but unfortunately the box it was damage</li>
            <li> It doesnt work for long hair. It leaves hair greasy and hard to comb.</li>
            <li> No much difference wasting of money</li>
            <li> Love this product so much , I will definitely repurchase :)</li>
            <li> my hair looks and feels amazing i mixed this with avocado and honey&lt;br /&gt;and i got complements that my hair looks softer and shiner&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> I bought this a couple of years ago and liked it. I recently decided to revisit using it. I love the smell and my hair comes out feeling strong and soft. There are lots of emollients along with the protein ingredients for a great balance.</li>
            <li> I use this product and would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed and I use this product as a leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s the only thing I put in my hair and I love it. It&#x27;s thick and my hair soaks it up. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 10 years. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is seeking moisture rich hair. This product used as a leave in will give you soft defined curls. $5 at drug stores and chain stores.</li>
            <li> I was worried for not seeing results I felt something was wrong and when I checked to see whether &#x27;organics&#x27; was written on it after seeing a post on insta i found out that it didn&#x27;t! the name &#x27;originals&#x27; was written on it instead :( So dissapointed!!</li>
            <li> This product works really well on dry curly hair. Hair Mayo brought moisture and definition to my hair. My hair was very dry and in much need of conditioning; I loved hair mayo due to its consistency, it is not greasy or messy. Though I would not recommend using it every day because it will create build up in your scalp. The directions don&#x27;t really specify how often you should use it. I love it! Try it. Its wasn&#x27;t very expensive either. One thing I wasn&#x27;t pleased with is the title... I don&#x27;t really believe that it is all fully organic.</li>
            <li> my hair in love with this , and i&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years.  But, I had stop and re-started.  It keeps the hair soft and manageable and helps with growth.  However, it builds up on the hair, so the hair must be washed more often to keep the hair mayonnaise from building up and turning into dandruff-like flakes.  I would use this on the hair only, not on the scalp.  If it builds on the hair so quickly, it may clog pores.</li>
            <li> I loved this product in my relaxer, i had to purchase it. Best product for wash days or when hair is dry. Makes my hair soft and easy to detangle. I</li>
            <li> Great for bleach damaged hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazon charges too much for this product.  It should be about $4, not 8.  Other than that, this is a great product.  I shaved my head last year and wanted to let my hair grow out.  As my hair grew out, I used this product to keep my hair manageable until I was able to get it cut and reshaped.  This product allowed my hair to grow in soft and manageable.  So, after my hair grew back I kept using this product to keep my hair conditioned.</li>
            <li> Organics Hair mayonnaise is a very good treatment for hair.  My hair was dry and broke very easily however, after the first use it felt so silky and managable.  It really made a big difference in my hair! It really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> The shipping was well package and fast. After doing research, this was one of the best things for protein treatment of  dry damage hair. So I bought it. However, it can be very runny. Learning how to apply. The oz and price was very good too compared to local BSS.</li>
            <li> Strengthened my hair and thickened the edges tremendously</li>
            <li> Instantly my hair is soft when applying the mayonnaise. Just what I want!</li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves the product. It always leaves my hair feeling soft and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this product 0 stars.  I know after conditioning with a protein conditioner one must condition with a moisturizing conditioner.  That did not work for me.  I really should have checked the ingredients before I bought this.  Once I was ready to use it, I did read the ingredient list, and upon seeing &amp;#34;mineral oil,&amp;#34; warning bells rang immediately.  I should have never put this conditioner in my hair.  My hair got hard at first touch, but knowing that&#x27;s how strong protein conditioners work, I figured I&#x27;d use a moisturizing deep conditioner afterwards, and all would be well.  That did not happen.  This product sapped all the moisture out of my hair.  My ends were knotted as they had never been before.  Using my moisturizing leave in didn&#x27;t even work.  My homemade flaxseed gel with added oils did soften my hair enough to comb the knots out and twist my hair, but manipulating my twist out into a style produced instantly frizzy Afro puffiness.  I have 3b,c,4a hair, and in the 1 year I transitioned and the 2 1/2 years I&#x27;ve been fully natural, my hair has never been so dry, and I have never had instant Afro like that.  The second day, after restyling (retwisting) my twists were lank and weighed down, and I had worse frizz.  Today I washed with a full shampoo - with SLS - to totally clarify my hair.  As soon as the shampoo touched my hair, it was instantly, and I mean instantly, pliable.  For the first time I used my leave in conditioner (which is a silicone-free rinse out conditioner) as a rinse out conditioner to combat the drying effects of the SLS in the shampoo and detangle my hair, and I could feel the moisture return to my hair which seemed to be blocked by this conditioner.  I rinsed the moisturizing conditioner out, and I could actually comb through my hair with nothing on it.  I am now deep conditioning with another moisturizing conditioner as I write this review.  My experience was so bad.  In summary, this product sucked the moisture from my hair, would not allow me to replace moisture - even water, decreased manageability of my hair, and destroyed my curl pattern resulting in full blown frizzy Afro.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel like pillow soft after every use and it smells pretty good. There will never be another deep conditioner for me!</li>
            <li> I picked this product up over the weekend to make another attempt to help my daughter&#x27;s hair. After the last relaxer it was very damaged and extremely dry. I cut out all of her relaxer and her hair feels thick, hard to hold ANY moisture and she has a sensitive scalp. The first thing I noticed was after shampooing her hair I rubbed some through and let it sit over night. The next day added a little bit to brush into ponytail. I&#x27;ve never been able to do her hair so quick and easy since this last transition back to natural. For me it&#x27;s like a miracle product. I&#x27;m used to hair being soft until the product dries and then it&#x27;s either hard, flaky or just absorbed all the way. Her hair was soft the entire day. For an every day moisturizer is great! I can&#x27;t wait to try it as a deep conditioner. Works well even if you apply on dry hair too. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I used this product as a before shampoo treatment so I put it on dirty hair. I left this product on the ends of my hair overnight (i don&#x27;t condition my roots because I like some volume) with a conditioning cap and washed it out the next morning. I could tell how much softer my hair was right as the product was coming out of my hair. Hair mayonnaise is great for curls and gentle enough to leave on overnight. The products in it are water soluble so if you use sulfate free shampoo it will still come out.</li>
            <li> Currently I am using Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise, but in the future I will be switching to Africa&#x27;s Best Hair Mayonnaise.  My hair is dyed a permanent black hair color, so my hair is indeed damaged.  I have been looking at the reviews on Africa&#x27;s Best Hair Mayonnaise and the review seem to be leaning more favorable to Africa&#x27;s Best Hair Mayonnaise!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good (i think so anyways) and it leaves my hair feeling thick and looking shiney.  If you have thin hair, get this!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and the price is wonderful...</li>
            <li> This is soften my hair and makes hair grow. I no longer perm my hair this is very good for people that hot comb their hair or just go natural. Adds strength back to hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few years now. I use it right out the shower. It&#x27;s not too greasy and applies easily.</li>
            <li> I used this on my mother&#x27;s hair because her hair is really damagedd and sheds alot. i put this on her hair and let her sit under the dryer with this for about 30mins. we rinsed this out and her hair was SO SOFT !! her hair was easy to detangle and smelled so good. i would surely reccomend this product for people who need a good treatment on their hair(:</li>
            <li> detangling my natural hair is a breeze.  after that i sit under the dryer with a wet towel and plastic cap on my head for 30minutes. my hair is softer, healthier and more manageable. i love this product, been using it for months and would continue using it.</li>
            <li> No complaints with the product itself, only that it was packed so full to the brim that some of the product came out of the container and went onto the other things I&#x27;d ordered. A bit pricier than I expected, but I&#x27;ve used this before and it&#x27;s really good for my hair so I will buy it again probably!</li>
            <li> Whew! What a miracle. I had been using Aphogee Keratin reconstructed every week, not realizing that it was damaging my hair from over use (too much protein, manage balance of protein and moisture). Went back to recommended products in the science of black hair and saw root stimulator version of this. In the store that was 12 and this was 4.  Hair had air dried hard from Aphogee. Applied this with coconut oil to dry hair, parted in four sections. Sat with cap on for 30 mins. Hair felt like silk. My denman brush glided right through my hair. Perfect slip, as if I had got a relaxer! Hair has now air dried and is so soft and manageable! Thank you, was tempted to end transitioning because hair was such a struggle because did not have right moisture protein balance. Figure out what your hair needs, everyone will have a different experience. Well spent 4 dollars! Btw I am aware of the lack of true organics. Works for anyhow.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Really conditions the hair.  As far as growth, I haven&#x27;t noticed any yet, but then again I have only used a handful of times.  Smell is good too.</li>
            <li> Been using this for sometime now..its amazing on my hair, make it soft and helps alot ,would recomemed this product</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  I tried it and it did not do anything for my hair, so it just sits in my cabinet.  I bought it based on the reviews, but it is as one person said, you have to try it for yourself.  What works for one person or even most people may not work for you.  I bought another product and I love it..</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, and prone to dryness, brittleness, and breakage. At first I hated this stuff because it gave my hair a really weird, almost wax-like texture. Then I realized that I was probably supposed to use just shampoo, and not conditioner after leaving this stuff in. Lo and behold, my hair was hydrated and great looking after trying that out. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I use it on my hair sometimes before I wash it or after I shampoo my hair. I put on a plastic cap wrap it up to deep condition. Once I remove everything my hair just bounces and curls on it&#x27;s own with ringlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I cannot stand is that it&#x27;s too perfumy..the smell might not bother some but the musky strong smell is too much.</li>
            <li> This is nicely priced and very effective, blends well with other oils (I like to add some extra virgin olive oil and  pure jojoba oil), it works well with a heating cap, leaves your hair soft, moisturized, tangle-free.&lt;br /&gt;This is an unpretentious, very affordable, generously rich treatement for thick, natural, black, 4-a type hair like mine. It&#x27;s a keeper. I strongly recommend this, at least to people who have my type of hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good product in making your hair soft and for breakage....There was people making reviews saying that this product make your hair itch...It make your scalp itch like crazy...i actually used another african pride product made my scalp itch...I dont know what they put in it but it itch your scalp real bad...I will not be buying no more of african best products...</li>
            <li> Natural hair came out very soft.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel like straw!! Never would have thought that given all the good reviews! Smell is not that pleasant either:( oh well.</li>
            <li> it left my hair softer and more manageable than the 8$ shampoo that is suppose to be the &amp;#34;it thing&amp;#34; for&lt;br /&gt;dreadlocks. just rinse well girls it is thick. don&#x27;t be fooled by catchy names and empty lies.  205 girl out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to pay this much, but I would after using it. Luckily, I&#x27;ve found it on the cheap locally.. Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much because I have used similar products that were too greasy, heavy or that otherwise made my hair not &amp;#34;touchable&amp;#34;. Surprised that this is so moisturizing. I have not used as a rinse-out yet. My hair is normally incredibly dry. I have found a wonderful shampoo/conditioner duo &amp; I love that I now have this for my leave-in. I can definitely see how it will stop a lot of my breakage - since dryness is my main problem. Love mostly that I can use it &amp; still be comfortable with having my hair touched or resting my head on upholstery without embarrassing results! lol</li>
            <li> Is it good for hair color ?</li>
            <li> After using ORS mayo for over 6 months, I grew tired of the sticky buildup felt on my hair each time I used it. I saw breakage to the point I thought my journey would end with an earlier big chop!! I remember using this product years prior and decided to give it another go....best idea ever! Hair is moisturized and shiny and easier to maintain. Gonna stock up!</li>
            <li> After trying many products touting their \\&quot;light\\&quot; formulas I realized I needed something heavy to handle my course wiry hair.  I tried this product and it curled my thick, wiry, 4 b/c, TWA right up!  I put a generous amount on my wet hair in the morning and voila!  When you first put it on it isn&#x27;t so curly, but it curls in 5-15 minutes.  Next I spray oil sheen for shine and then hair spray for hold.  Without the hairspray the curls begin to fall or poof around midday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t like is that I need to shampoo my hair every morning to get the previous day&#x27;s product out.  In the past I would just rinse the previous day&#x27;s product out with water but water alone doesn&#x27;t seem to get this product out well enough.  The product doesn&#x27;t seem to work well unless it is used on newly washed hair.  I guess that is what you get with a heavier product.  Now I&#x27;m looking for a gentle, daily use shampoo.</li>
            <li> I discover that im allergic to protien</li>
            <li> I just bought the product today and went to grease my hair and as soon as I put it on, it instantly melted on my hair causing my roots to be smooth. I have thick African-American almost medium-length hair and I&#x27;m 9 weeks post relaxer now and my roots ALWAYS go in a dire state of depression and at this point, you can barely see the part in the front but now you can! MIRACULOUSLY SMOOTH! I highly recommend this product. :)</li>
