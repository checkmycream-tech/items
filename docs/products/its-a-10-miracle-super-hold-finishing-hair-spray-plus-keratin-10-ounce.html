            <li>Works good on fine hair.</li>

            <li>Love all products of</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>It does not hold as well as the &amp;#34;freeze spray&amp;#34; I have been using, but neither does it make my head itch like most hairspray does.</li>
            <li>Love this light product for my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly my fault why I don&#x27;t like this spray.</li>
            <li>and I have recommended it to friends who also love it.</li>
            <li>Better value here than in beauty shops.</li>
            <li>Not bad tho !</li>
            <li>Easy to brush out.</li>
            <li>Too strong of a hold for me.</li>
            <li>I am certain you two will love it!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of</li>
            <li>Holds all day, keeps my hair smooth,</li>
            <li>This stuff is so good it keeps my bangs from going flat, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li>It is advertised as a super hold</li>
            <li>I must say that It goes on a bit sticky but quickly drys</li>
            <li>Would have given a 5 star if it worked better in high humidity</li>
            <li>I have used hairspray forever, as I have fine straight hair that wilts within minutes of styling.  </li>
            <li>great if you want super stiff hair that you can&#x27;t move until you wash it.</li>
            <li>It is nice but the smell isn&#x27;t quite the same.</li>
            <li>and I like a lighter more natural hold</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still better than most other sprays.</li>
            <li>It hold very well but doesn&#x27;t make the hair looked glued into place.</li>
            <li>I like this product very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this hairspray.</li>
            <li>Notified seller &amp; they had one out to replace it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>like the hold, but it is kind of stiff.  </li>
            <li>It lasts all day long and is easy to brush out at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It holds well - I can use it as I hot roll my hair and the style lasts for days (as long as I don&#x27;t brust it out) - or use it to style my  hair quickly with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>favorite hairspray, not to heavy but holds really well</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t give as much of a wow factor as many of the other its a 10 products have for me.</li>
            <li>I have short hair, and this spray holds it just right.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>were we live and</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>This works better in the humidity than my usual Elnett, but I don&#x27;t like the crunchy texture.</li>
            <li>Love this hairspray, holds well without looking stiff!</li>
            <li>Like the way it&#x27;s not stiff and holds hair in place.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, this helps with the humidity in summer.</li>
            <li>It looks vey natural and you can still run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li>, this was my least favorite.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make the hair feel soft but hold it in place.</li>
            <li>My hair has never held better and you only need a little and only once</li>
            <li>Product does actually have a super hold, but doesn&#x27;t make hair feel weighed down.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all, and I have heavy coarse hair.</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all, and I have heavy coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This is the third hair spray can that I bought to replace the previous ones that also had the a spray issue where it shoots out drizzles of hair spray instead of a showering effect as how it&#x27;s normally suppose to.</li>
            <li> It allows you to make a quick adjustment after you spray to ensure your hair is the way you want it and it holds without a heavy stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> When applied the hair stays in place but it is very stiff and very drying.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel dry when on, but holds well.</li>
            <li> Love this product but hate hairspray in general!  </li>
            <li> More expensive than what I usually spend on hairspray but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> You only need to use a little to maintain your hair style without gluing your hair together.</li>
            <li> Windy days are no problem because hair just goes back with a little smoothing down with hands.  </li>
            <li> and it weighed my hair down instead of giving it volume.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t spray the front of my hair, it just falls down in my eyes.  </li>
            <li> is the firm hold spray..  </li>
            <li> It was too firm for me.</li>
            <li> Not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> A hair spray can is useless if it only shoots out a concentrated stream of hair spray which then crystallizes your hair in uneven streaks.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair totally stiff and brushes out easily...best hairspray ever!</li>
            <li> Holds nicely, not sticky.</li>
            <li> I have extremly thick hair and this.spray can hold it.  </li>
            <li> Unbelievable hold, even in our Florida humidity!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really not that crazy about this one.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this has an awful fragrance, cloying and stale, so whether or not it&#x27;s an effective hairspray is beside the point.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out so badly and made my hair so stiff.  </li>
            <li> The nozzle is broken AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and leaves your hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> We have horrible humidity in the summer</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Best holding hair spray I have been able to buy for years.</li>
            <li> My wife says it works and it comes at a very attractive price. What else is there to say?</li>
            <li> Smells horrible and leaves your hair feeling dry</li>
            <li> Great hairspray. Holds nicely, not sticky. Smells great!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair in place. Not sticky or gummy. Easy to brush out. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this product but hate hairspray in general!  Does the job without stickiness or flakes.  I am a total Fan of all It&#x27;s a Ten products!  This one is no different.</li>
            <li> Love all products of It&#x27;s a 10!!</li>
            <li> This hair spray does everything it says it will do. The best hair spray I have ever used, holds and easy to brush out. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, this helps with the humidity in summer.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray, holds well without looking stiff!</li>
            <li> This It&#x27;s a 10 is the firm hold spray..  They also make a flexible.  Both are great for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the hold, but it is kind of stiff.  I did not notice a difference with the keratin&lt;br /&gt; versus the flexible hold with no keratin.&lt;br /&gt;I use both depending on the occasion.</li>
            <li> Greatest hair spray that I have ever used. Leaves hair shiny and flexible but still holds style. Just love it.</li>
            <li> Good hold. Not sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> The product and service met and exceeded expectations</li>
            <li> Finally a hairspray that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like straw!!  Holds all day, keeps my hair smooth, no frizz &amp; the best part is I can get a brush through it without pulling my hair out!</li>
            <li> More expensive than what I usually spend on hairspray but decided to give it a try. So glad I did. I haven&#x27;t bought a different brand since trying this one.</li>
            <li> I have extremly thick hair and this.spray can hold it.  It looks vey natural and you can still run your fingers through your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! It hold very well but doesn&#x27;t make the hair looked glued into place. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of It&#x27;s a 10 products but I&#x27;m really not that crazy about this one.  Makes your hair feel dry when on, but holds well.</li>
            <li> Love it! Won&#x27;t leave home without it. It allows my hair to move without giving up the style. Probably one of the best I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I like this product very well. It does not hold as well as the &amp;#34;freeze spray&amp;#34; I have been using, but neither does it make my head itch like most hairspray does. You can continue to style while spraying. It does not claim to be a freeze spray and that is what I was used to, but I like the versatility with this spray.</li>
            <li> Love this light product for my hair! Holds in place but doesn&#x27;t feel like it</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product. Based on the good reviews I was for sure this was going to be an excellent product but after the first use my hair looked greasy /wet and it weighed my hair down instead of giving it volume. I have fine hair that&#x27;s a layered bob (think of Victoria Beckham&#x27;s short haircut).  Out of all the hair sprays I&#x27;ve used, this was my least favorite.</li>
            <li> It is nice but the smell isn&#x27;t quite the same. Not bad tho !</li>
            <li> I hope to never be without this!.  It has replaced my Kenra ultra hold, and lasts and lasts, without making my hair into a helmet.</li>
            <li> great if you want super stiff hair that you can&#x27;t move until you wash it.</li>
            <li> Best hairspray ever - I love this line of products.</li>
            <li> I read good things about this in a magazine review.  If I don&#x27;t spray the front of my hair, it just falls down in my eyes.  This is a good light spray and holds my hair in place all day.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much at all, and I have heavy coarse hair. It lasts all day long and is easy to brush out at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This dried my hair out so badly and made my hair so stiff.  It took every bit of softness out of my hair!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t give as much of a wow factor as many of the other its a 10 products have for me. Arrived on time but I think I will try a different hair spray next time.</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray!  I have short hair, and this spray holds it just right.  Windy days are no problem because hair just goes back with a little smoothing down with hands.  Perfect.</li>

            <li> Holds well, helps fullness-a bit crunchy however</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair, love it</li>
            <li> I have used hairspray forever, as I have fine straight hair that wilts within minutes of styling.  This hairspray actually does what hairspray is meant to do....it holds your style without feeling like you have a helmet head.  It brushes out beautifully and, even then, holds your style.  I actually wake up in the morning without frightful bed-head, though I know that bed-head IS a style nowadays to some people.  Try it.  I am certain you two will love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly my fault why I don&#x27;t like this spray. It is advertised as a super hold and I like a lighter more natural hold so I should not have bought it. It will cement your hair in place so if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then this is definitely it.</li>
            <li> This hairspray is amazing!  We have horrible humidity in the summer were we live and this hairspray does wonders!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this has an awful fragrance, cloying and stale, so whether or not it&#x27;s an effective hairspray is beside the point.</li>
            <li> My hair has never held better and you only need a little and only once and it holds until you wash your hair again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. You only need to use a little to maintain your hair style without gluing your hair together. Very easy to brush out. Adds body.</li>
            <li> Very happy with performance of this hairspray - I just wish it smelled alittle better.  Although the smell is not offensive, just smells like hair spray.</li>
            <li> Like the way it&#x27;s not stiff and holds hair in place.</li>
            <li> Great hold, even in humidity</li>
            <li> favorite hairspray, not to heavy but holds really well</li>
            <li> THE BEST hair spray I&#x27;ve ever used.  It holds well - I can use it as I hot roll my hair and the style lasts for days (as long as I don&#x27;t brust it out) - or use it to style my  hair quickly with a blow dryer. (I spray after I&#x27;m done) -  This stuff is so good it keeps my bangs from going flat, even on rainy days.</li>
            <li> This product is the only one I have found that keeps my hairstyle for several days.  I must say that It goes on a bit sticky but quickly drys and you can brush to feel like there is no product in the hair but the style stays.  I have fine hair and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.  Well worththemoney and I have recommended it to friends who also love it.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good to say about it&#x27;s a 10 products. my hair is shiny , mnever looked better!!!!</li>
            <li> Product does actually have a super hold, but doesn&#x27;t make hair feel weighed down. I would recommend this to my friends</li>
            <li> Better value here than in beauty shops. Works good on fine hair. Would have given a 5 star if it worked better in high humidity but it&#x27;s still better than most other sprays.</li>
            <li> It was too firm for me. They seller agreed to take back which was helpful.</li>
            <li> Too strong of a hold for me.</li>
            <li> Works great with fine hair.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:5c6e8b5774cc61e9e23ca6c044d523c2]] The nozzle is broken AGAIN. This is the third hair spray can that I bought to replace the previous ones that also had the a spray issue where it shoots out drizzles of hair spray instead of a showering effect as how it&#x27;s normally suppose to. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 years now, and only recently have I began to experience these manufacturing defects. Perhaps its the seller...or perhaps now its the manufacturer. A hair spray can is useless if it only shoots out a concentrated stream of hair spray which then crystallizes your hair in uneven streaks. Stay away from this seller.</li>
            <li> Leaves white specks on your hair</li>
            <li> Excellent product great hold</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, but not overpowering.  Holds great.</li>
            <li> I really like this hairspray. It allows you to make a quick adjustment after you spray to ensure your hair is the way you want it and it holds without a heavy stiff feeling.</li>
            <li> Holds well &amp; combs out nicely later. I did have a problem with the nozzle. Notified seller &amp; they had one out to replace it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with product &amp; seller.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make the hair feel soft but hold it in place. When applied the hair stays in place but it is very stiff and very drying.</li>
            <li> This works better in the humidity than my usual Elnett, but I don&#x27;t like the crunchy texture. It feels like my hair is breaking off when I brush it after using this spray.</li>
            <li> Really liked the product!</li>
