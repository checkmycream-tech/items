            <li>, I am finally able to say \\&quot;I love my hair!\\&quot; after more than 50 years of hating it!</li>
            <li>i am pleased with my purchase of the ghd styling iron.</li>
            <li>Item is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I purchased it from Amazon after pricing it at over $200 most places.</li>
            <li>The price was also much better from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT USE TENSION</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>She just had to have them &amp; says they are fantastic!</li>
            <li>we&#x27;ll see if that helps with the damage that I&#x27;m sure this will do.  </li>
            <li>We now have 2! and love them.</li>
            <li>These are the best flat irons I have ever used</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE BEST FLAT IRON I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!   </li>
            <li>I cannot even begin to tell you how great they are - buy them and look forward to a new life of the shiniest, smoothest hair imaginable...</li>
            <li>Even better I did not feel the need to constantly touch it up, and it was also great at adding a curl/wave.  </li>
            <li>Granted, I have fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolute dream!! :)</li>
            <li>I have these irons over one year now and they are still fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this to ANY girl who wants an amazing straight look!!!</li>
            <li>I can smooth it out so quickly and easily</li>
            <li>In England these are approaching some kind of cult status and every girl I know adores them!     </li>
            <li>ghd MK3 Professional Hairstyling Iron makes me love my kinky, curly, frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>often flat ironing would make it look funny, but this was beautiful.</li>
            <li>FInally, amazon made good</li>
            <li>so of course said sure, and in after the quickest straightening time ever, I had pin straight, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I had a chemical straightener on my hair because it was so straight&#x3D;).</li>
            <li>All claims made for this product are true.</li>
            <li>Quickly and safely straightens hair without much effort.</li>
            <li>Before this I had a $30 revlon iron and that did not work very well at all so this is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>this straightener is worth the price you pay for it.</li>
            <li>I purchased the MK3 Professional Iron hoping it would be better than the ones sold at the Beauty supply companies.   </li>
            <li>I had bought a cheaper imitation that just didn&#x27;t work like I had wanted, this one is great and very versatile.  </li>
            <li>I decided to buy the GHD flat iron after using my friend&#x27;s during a weekend in Vegas and loving it.  </li>
            <li>I did try it out right after lunchtime</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It was my first expensive iron, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of months the gold on the inside of the plates began coming off.  </li>
            <li>My hair ALWAYS get frizzy or somewhat curly during the day, but ever since I started using this it stays nice and straight all day long.  </li>
            <li>Even in our record temps and humidity my hair stays straight!  </li>
            <li>So, although I love this flat-iron, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use on a fine-haired friend.</li>
            <li>I got the ghd over a Chi because I had heard that ghd&#x27;s last longer and are more durable.</li>
            <li>The Ghd actually feels beneficial for hair and along with the ease and speed of straightening with it,it deserves top marks.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have fine hair, it makes a lot of marks if you are too slow (again, just takes some getting used to I&#x27;m sure!).</li>
            <li>I love my flat irons.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than the store brand flat irons, and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I initially thought that the inch wide would not be enough but it works perfect.</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron, but it takes some getting used to if you are used to cheaper, less hot irons.</li>
            <li>After using it, I would certainly agree on its quality.</li>
            <li>Could have shipped a little quicker, but overall I am very pleased with this transaction!</li>
            <li>I decided to spend a little more money for GHD, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>and you will have silky smooth hair almost instantly.</li>
            <li>It REALLY gets your hair straight.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how well it did my bangs, because i have very blunt fringe and</li>
            <li>Just blow drying it straight</li>
            <li>and it got my hair amazingly straight.  </li>
            <li>but you really don&#x27;t need to do that with this one.</li>
            <li>One sweep through on a section of hair, and it is straight.  </li>
            <li>It will cause your hair to be flat, but if you tease your hair, you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Less than a year after purchase, the top part is not heating very well at all.  </li>
            <li>Also, so far it does not appear that the unit gets too hot to hold onto.    </li>
            <li>The iron heated up quickly, and glided smoothly through my hair whether I had small or large sections in it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I hope to update my review in a few months to let you know how the iron holds up to use. :)</li>
            <li>This flat iron worked really well at first.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to re-do sections, one smoothing action with these will tame even the most uncontrollable hair.    </li>
            <li>I first found about GHD&#x27;s last year when I was in England.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>So the first time I heard about a GHD flat iron was during my cousin&#x27;s wedding, it was one of the gifts she&#x27;d recieved.</li>
            <li>but it makes it clear in the packaging</li>
            <li>and it was so soft.</li>
            <li>They heat up instantly &amp; leave the hair sleek &amp; straight in a matter of minutes.</li>
            <li>I always use a salon thermal protectant, but have noticed one piece of my hair that I frequently straighten looking frazzled.  </li>
            <li>Mission complete.  </li>
            <li>but so far I have remembered to shut if off after each use.</li>
            <li>did not make a difference in my hair and doesn&#x27;t completely straighten the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have ringlet-curly, frizzy in humidity, hair, and it would take forever to get it straight, only to have it frizzy again by the afternoon.  </li>
            <li>I decided to really try out the flat iron</li>
            <li>Even my tips, which were extremely fried, were flat and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look naturally straight as opposed to stick straight with a little frizz.  </li>
            <li>and i asked if I could flat iron my hair since it had been so long since it was straight,</li>
            <li>I just received my ghd professional flat iron today.  </li>

            <li> I just received my ghd professional flat iron today.  </li>
            <li> I became obsessed and bought many similar designed flat irons in hopes to achieve the same straightening effect</li>
            <li> I thought the pink &amp; black travel case was funny until she told me the contents.</li>
            <li> Not very happy since I wanted a professional flat iron and paid this much to have one.</li>
            <li> Before I thought flat irons only flatens hair; I didn&#x27;t know it curls and flips also!  </li>
            <li> just does not last long enough and makes my hair frizzy.  </li>
            <li> , then I tried the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> While I was studying abroad in Florence, my flat iron stopped working</li>
            <li> (I couldn&#x27;t wait), so my hair has been dry for several hours.  </li>
            <li> so I washed my hair and let it dry naturaly</li>
            <li> I wasted money and bough two different hair curlers before I learned of the GHD flat iron.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair flat but doesnt weigh it down.</li>
            <li> USING OTHER FLAT IRON WOULD ONLY LEAVE ME WITH A SMOOTH AFRO :(  </li>
            <li> THAT I NEVER WEAR OUT DUE TO ITS UNRULYNESS.   </li>
            <li> My drying time has been cut in half (I have medium-length, semi-thick hair).  </li>
            <li> and so I had been living without one for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY TIGHTLY CURLED HAIR</li>
            <li> Although expensive they will last and give you the \\&quot;hairdresser\\</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about buying such an expensive hair straightener, but this one works soooooo well.  </li>
            <li> The tendency is to squeeze hard while ironing</li>
            <li> and I can do thick chunks</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> If I am wrong please let me know</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with the Hairsytyling Iron</li>
            <li> Grrr!  </li>

            <li> I moved over to the USA in January from England and I can&#x27;t even begin to tell you how devastated I was that my GHDs did not work over here.    These are the best flat irons I have ever used and you will have silky smooth hair almost instantly. You don&#x27;t need to re-do sections, one smoothing action with these will tame even the most uncontrollable hair.    In England these are approaching some kind of cult status and every girl I know adores them!     I cannot even begin to tell you how great they are - buy them and look forward to a new life of the shiniest, smoothest hair imaginable...</li>
            <li> My mother and I have kinky, curly, and frizzy hair.  I decided to really try out the flat iron so I washed my hair and let it dry naturaly, then I tried the flat iron.  My hair has never looked so good then I tried it on my moms hair with the same results.  Even better I did not feel the need to constantly touch it up, and it was also great at adding a curl/wave.  I love this product!</li>
            <li> ghd MK3 Professional Hairstyling Iron makes me love my kinky, curly, frizzy hair!  I can smooth it out so quickly and easily, I am finally able to say \\&quot;I love my hair!\\&quot; after more than 50 years of hating it!</li>
            <li> Died after two months.....company wouldn&#x27;t honor warranty since purchased through amazon.   At 1st amazon refused to replace without charging 80% of cost.   FInally, amazon made good but I learned a lesson about buying electronics from amazon</li>
            <li> Omg! I absolutely love this flat iron! It was my first expensive iron, and I&#x27;m very happy with it. It REALLY gets your hair straight. Even my tips, which were extremely fried, were flat and smooth. All of my hair is very smooth! My hair has a lot of movement. It will cause your hair to be flat, but if you tease your hair, you&#x27;ll be fine. It&#x27;s a lot better than the store brand flat irons, and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I wasted money and bough two different hair curlers before I learned of the GHD flat iron.  Before I thought flat irons only flatens hair; I didn&#x27;t know it curls and flips also!  Then I researched and compared the GHD brand and the CHI brand.  I decided to spend a little more money for GHD, but it was well worth it. It makes your hair shiny and so convenient to use.</li>
            <li> The description says universal voltage making me think it was dual voltage. It is not universal... it is only 120v. If I am wrong please let me know but it makes it clear in the packaging it is not dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Item is fantastic!  Could have shipped a little quicker, but overall I am very pleased with this transaction!</li>
            <li> I have these irons over one year now and they are still fantastic.  Huge in Europe its good to see them here in the US too as they really beat all the others when it comes to top quality and excellent results.  Although expensive they will last and give you the \\&quot;hairdresser\\&quot; look every time.      All girls should have one...</li>
            <li> This flat iron worked really well at first.  Within the first couple of months the gold on the inside of the plates began coming off.  Less than a year after purchase, the top part is not heating very well at all.  The auto shut off feature keeps coming on and staying on.  Not very happy since I wanted a professional flat iron and paid this much to have one. Would not buy another GHD even though my hair stylist recommended this brand....</li>
            <li> I am soooooooo happy with my purchase. I love my flat irons. Best investment to date.</li>
            <li> My beautician used this brand of straightener for my hair after a haircut. She indicated it was an excellent one.  I purchased it from Amazon after pricing it at over $200 most places. After using it, I would certainly agree on its quality. The price was also much better from Amazon.</li>
            <li> While I was studying abroad in Florence, my flat iron stopped working and so I had been living without one for a few weeks. On my way back home to NY, I visited a friend in London. I saw the GHD in her bathroom and i asked if I could flat iron my hair since it had been so long since it was straight, so of course said sure, and in after the quickest straightening time ever, I had pin straight, shiny hair. It was amazing, it looked and felt so healthy and it was so soft. I was amazed at how well it did my bangs, because i have very blunt fringe and often flat ironing would make it look funny, but this was beautiful. When I got back to the states I ordered one. It is amazing, you will not be disapointed</li>
            <li> I had bought a cheaper imitation that just didn&#x27;t work like I had wanted, this one is great and very versatile.  Go to the company website for style ideas and videos!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST FLAT IRON I HAVE EVER USED IN MY LIFE!   I HAVE VERY TIGHTLY CURLED HAIR THAT I NEVER WEAR OUT DUE TO ITS UNRULYNESS.   USING OTHER FLAT IRON WOULD ONLY LEAVE ME WITH A SMOOTH AFRO :(  I ACTUALLY HAVE DIFFERENT HAIR AFTER USING THE GHD.   I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT DOES NOT USE TENSION, THAT WAS ALWAYS A CONCERN FOR ME AND MY CURLS.   THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT! I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about buying such an expensive hair straightener, but this one works soooooo well.  It makes my hair look naturally straight as opposed to stick straight with a little frizz.  My hair ALWAYS get frizzy or somewhat curly during the day, but ever since I started using this it stays nice and straight all day long.  Definitely a great buy!</li>
            <li> I just received my ghd professional flat iron today.  I did try it out right after lunchtime (I couldn&#x27;t wait), so my hair has been dry for several hours.  The iron heated up quickly, and glided smoothly through my hair whether I had small or large sections in it.  It straightened my hair on only one pass! Granted, I have fine, curly hair.  But it straightened it and gave it a nice shine.  Even in our record temps and humidity my hair stays straight!  If I had known it would work this well, I would have bought one years ago.  Just blow drying it straight just does not last long enough and makes my hair frizzy.  Also, so far it does not appear that the unit gets too hot to hold onto.    I talked to my hairstylist, and she uses GHD.  So that swayed me to buying a GHD over a Sedu.  We had both heard how the CHIs short out.      Probably the only things I would change would be to add a temperature level control to it and an auto shut off.    I hope to update my review in a few months to let you know how the iron holds up to use. :)</li>
            <li> I recently bought these straighteners for my Wife. She just had to have them &amp; says they are fantastic! They heat up instantly &amp; leave the hair sleek &amp; straight in a matter of minutes. Great product &amp; diffinitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I first found about GHD&#x27;s last year when I was in England.&lt;br /&gt;Very impressive. They do a wonder.&lt;br /&gt;I guess Im like an addict now.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the GHD flat iron after using my friend&#x27;s during a weekend in Vegas and loving it.  I have fine, naturally curly hair and it got my hair amazingly straight.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars, however, is that I think it may have damaged my hair a bit. I always use a salon thermal protectant, but have noticed one piece of my hair that I frequently straighten looking frazzled.  Grrr!  So, although I love this flat-iron, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for daily use on a fine-haired friend.</li>
            <li> This iron warms up enough to use with in a minute.  I have very thick hair and I can do thick chunks and it will straighten no problem.  This morning I used it to curl the ends of my hair and worked great!    I initially thought that the inch wide would not be enough but it works perfect. Before this I had a $30 revlon iron and that did not work very well at all so this is a huge improvement.  I did purchase a heat protector from my salon to protect my hair from the heat... we&#x27;ll see if that helps with the damage that I&#x27;m sure this will do.  I have received compliments from everyone since I purchased including one friend that is a hair dresser said that it looked liked I had a chemical straightener on my hair because it was so straight&#x3D;). Mission complete.  I do wish it had a auto shut off but so far I have remembered to shut if off after each use.</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron, but it takes some getting used to if you are used to cheaper, less hot irons. The tendency is to squeeze hard while ironing but you really don&#x27;t need to do that with this one. Also, if you have fine hair, it makes a lot of marks if you are too slow (again, just takes some getting used to I&#x27;m sure!).</li>
            <li> this straightener is worth the price you pay for it. I got the ghd over a Chi because I had heard that ghd&#x27;s last longer and are more durable. i think buying the ghd straightener was a great investment. i would recommend it!</li>
            <li> All claims made for this product are true. Have tried several hair straighteners before and found flaws in all of them. Also the guilt factor in frying my hair so often by using any of these straighteners was enormous. The Ghd actually feels beneficial for hair and along with the ease and speed of straightening with it,it deserves top marks.</li>
            <li> So the first time I heard about a GHD flat iron was during my cousin&#x27;s wedding, it was one of the gifts she&#x27;d recieved. I thought the pink &amp; black travel case was funny until she told me the contents. I became obsessed and bought many similar designed flat irons in hopes to achieve the same straightening effect and I will tell you, this is THE best straightener I have EVER used!!!! The others don&#x27;t even come CLOSE to my GHD ....I recommend this to ANY girl who wants an amazing straight look!!! It&#x27;s an absolute dream!! :)</li>
            <li> This is the very best straightener we have ever found.  My daughters have struggled with curly/frizzy hair since they were in middle school, and we have bought several irons which either didn&#x27;t work well, or damaged their hair.  Our hair salon used this type, and suggested we order one for our private use.  We now have 2! and love them.</li>
            <li> I purchased the MK3 Professional Iron hoping it would be better than the ones sold at the Beauty supply companies.   I was not impressed with the Hairsytyling Iron did not make a difference in my hair and doesn&#x27;t completely straighten the hair.  It was a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> Best hair straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Quickly and safely straightens hair without much effort.</li>
            <li> I was torn between the Chi and the GHD, but trusted the reviews I read, so went for the GHD.  I love it!!  I have ringlet-curly, frizzy in humidity, hair, and it would take forever to get it straight, only to have it frizzy again by the afternoon.  My drying time has been cut in half (I have medium-length, semi-thick hair).  One sweep through on a section of hair, and it is straight.  No need to go over it.  The straightness holds throughout the day,unless, of course, I get caught in the rain! I highly recommend this product.</li>
