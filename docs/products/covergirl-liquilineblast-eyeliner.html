            <li>B002HK2GOO Tweezerman Deluxe Cosmetic Sharpener]]</li>
            <li>Nice marketing twist, but you should consider the consequences of customers who will now go elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Love it, very easy to use, glides on and stays on.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and in perfect packaging, thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Very smooth application, not like a pencil.</li>
            <li>I liked how easily I could apply it, but will not wear again.</li>
            <li>I use it to put in my water line, not on the top of my eyes.</li>
            <li>First things first: this is the best eyeliner out there.</li>
            <li>All time favorite liner.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner is great, goes on smooth and looks great but doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re better off going to a drugstore and getting it.</li>
            <li>love how it goes on, in the water lines, and around the lid.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>I will never switch to anything else. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>And after about 3 attempts to sharpen, most of the penciled was gone because it kept braking again and again.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It looks like a pencil but goes on more like a liquid.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love this type of liner.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended--the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried for such a great cost.</li>
            <li>Finally an eye liner that doesn&#x27;t require sharpening, goes on easily without sticking or smearing and looks great all day!</li>
            <li>you could use the smudger, it works fine, I use a brush and its even better imo.</li>
            <li>I love how smoothly it goes on</li>
            <li>Glides on easy with no tug and pull.  </li>
            <li>Before sharpening, it went on easily, and stay put.</li>
            <li>It goes on really, really easily and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>People ask me all the time how I get it so dark and perfect</li>
            <li>I wish I would&#x27;ve bought something else personally, but if you&#x27;re an experienced liquid eyeliner person or makeup person, then I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine and enjoy this product...</li>
            <li>Smooth, easy and long-lasting...</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and easily.  </li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Important to Note</li>
            <li>But it goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Gotta on smoothly and quickly and lasts for quite some time.</li>
            <li>and you just have to stroke once to get full color.</li>
            <li>so if you take the time to read these sort of beauty product reviews, you&#x27;re probably way more ahead than I am and might not have as much difficulty.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at CVS , it went on esily left nice lines , but smudges easily</li>
            <li>Great Smooth Dark, Intense Pigment Eyeliner!</li>
            <li>First eyeliner that does not disappoint!</li>
            <li>It sharpens well if you have the right sharpener</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even get my started in sharpening this thing I feel better to see so many other people have problems with this!</li>
            <li>used my cover girl sharpener and it worked fine with no trouble</li>
            <li>I love this eyeliner and will never look back!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does accentuate my eyes!</li>
            <li>First of all, you must use a pencil sharpener.  </li>
            <li>Stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t put makeup often, so it is kind of difficult to use eyeliner, but this one is really easy to apply on the eyes and easy to take off too.</li>
            <li>I expected to be able to roll out the eye liner as it was used and then I realized that I need to sharpen it ...  .</li>
            <li>The product smudges to much would like to try something else that stays on all day with out the smudge</li>
            <li>Goes on easy ,is super black ,and stays put .So</li>
            <li>Other eyeliners that i&#x27;ve tried I have to go over top of it multiple times because it is so light.</li>
            <li>You have to buy a special sharpener to be able to cut through the hard plastic coating of the pencil.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get it more sharp with an exacto knife, but this product is so creamy that it promptly broke off and the sharp plastic side went up into my eyelid.</li>
            <li>Wife did not like this due to not being able to sharpen it.  </li>
            <li>i would not buy another brand as long as this is still available.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on smoothly and lasts all day long.</li>
            <li>It goes on very thick and heavy, you basically have to get it perfect it on the first try and then smudge it off</li>
            <li>This purchase was for a friend of mine because I recommend it so highly that I bought it as a gift.</li>
            <li>I bought the black fire and the blue and both go on great and last all day</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to control the line, mess free (no random spots, splotches, or uneven area</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, does not irritate sensitive eyes and is a rich, deep black.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>Who wants to pay $7 for eyeliner that barely lasts a week?</li>
            <li>A lot of websites say to use a regular pencil sharpener to sharpen this pencil, but that didn&#x27;t work for me for the first 10+ times.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I have finally found an eyeliner that I really really like!  </li>
            <li>I use a little primer over my eye, but I think it should work fine without ad well.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered it from amazon and although it came quickly, the packaging (of the liner not the box it was shipped in) was already open and without a cap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked high and low for an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li>I got it because I have such difficult time putting on liquid eyeliner, but I love how it looks, so I thought the pencil form (like that I generally use) would be much easier.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup expert - just a regular working lady with very little time to get ready -</li>
            <li> Last long.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a long lasting liner, buy the liquid by covergirl</li>
            <li> The plastic is also likely to retain sharp tips (which is just about the last thing you want to put next to your eye!).  </li>
            <li> it stays on all day long, ive been using it for 3 years, i only bought it online because my local rite aide closed.</li>
            <li> but this lasted all day long no issues or smudging.</li>
            <li> After only a few hours it&#x27;s almost gone (for the second day in a row), I ended up having to borrow a co-workers liner to fix it.</li>
            <li> Even if I tear up from allergies or something it doesn&#x27;t wear off, unless I am actively wiping it.</li>
            <li> 2 hours after putting this on I had dark shadows under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible with liquid liners, but regular pencils don&#x27;t give the same smooth look.</li>
            <li> I had to whittle it down to get to a point where it could be sharpened with a pencil sharpener.</li>
            <li> You can go with a thin swipe of the liner for a classy-chic look, or make a thick line for a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> I am SO annoyed that I spent $8 on an eyeliner that &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; like it would be the standard twist-type when you need to extend the product.  </li>
            <li> Also an hour after applying the eyeliner was all smuggled and I ended with black circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> After using this for three days the tip needs sharpening and if you try to sharpen it it breaks off into a liquid mess.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the sharp sides were enough to cut me, but my eyelid is now painful, sensitive to the touch, and I hope it&#x27;s not infected.</li>
            <li> (I have the black), and it ran from my water line down past my eyelashes, as if I had been crying.</li>
            <li> or if you like the very dark and heavy, goth/emo/vampire look...</li>
            <li> : This is pencil you sharpen even though it looks like plastic (This tripped me up for a few days)</li>
            <li> It was a waste of $7.</li>
            <li> put eyeliner on my water line and have trouble finding anything that stays .I</li>
            <li> I usually have issues with my eyeliner coming off mid-day</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> My liner was too dried out to even try on my hand!</li>
            <li> The plastic stick is so hard compared to the soft liner that it is impossible not to crush or break the liner as you sharpen it.  </li>
            <li> I had to take to google to try and figure it out and was really feeling quite stupid turns out</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smear like my usual eyeliner!  </li>
            <li> Very expensive for so little.</li>
            <li> This does the trick, but is difficult to sharpen.</li>
            <li> Whatever, it&#x27;s expensive and I can&#x27;t afford to be wasteful.</li>
            <li> they are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s a pencil!</li>

            <li> Its perfect. The only one my wife like.</li>
            <li> 2 hours after putting this on I had dark shadows under my eyes. I liked how easily I could apply it, but will not wear again.</li>
            <li> best eyeliner ever!!!</li>
            <li> The plastic stick is so hard compared to the soft liner that it is impossible not to crush or break the liner as you sharpen it.  The plastic is also likely to retain sharp tips (which is just about the last thing you want to put next to your eye!).  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> It is indeed basically liquid eyeliner in the form of a pencil. I got it because I have such difficult time putting on liquid eyeliner, but I love how it looks, so I thought the pencil form (like that I generally use) would be much easier. Not the case. It goes on very thick and heavy, you basically have to get it perfect it on the first try and then smudge it off so you don&#x27;t look like a vampire... I wish I would&#x27;ve bought something else personally, but if you&#x27;re an experienced liquid eyeliner person or makeup person, then I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be fine and enjoy this product... or if you like the very dark and heavy, goth/emo/vampire look...</li>
            <li> I purchased this at CVS , it went on esily left nice lines , but smudges easily and I was left with eyeliner smudged to my cheeks! Don&#x27;t even get my started in sharpening this thing I feel better to see so many other people have problems with this! When I was at the Christmas tree shop yesterday I bought a second one just so I could look on the package for sharpening instructions! ( there aren&#x27;t any) I had to take to google to try and figure it out and was really feeling quite stupid turns out most of the Internet can&#x27;t sharpen this either which makes me feel better!! Why can&#x27;t it just be a twist up? Why does it have to encased in plastic which you must try to sharpen!!</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy and long-lasting...this stuff is amazing. I fell asleep with it on one night and I woke up and it was nearly perfect. I usually have issues with my eyeliner coming off mid-day but this lasted all day long no issues or smudging. I am sold!     Important to Note: This is pencil you sharpen even though it looks like plastic (This tripped me up for a few days)</li>
            <li> Do not like the product and it does not having any wearing power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked high and low for an eyeliner that doesn&#x27;t smudge. This does the trick, but is difficult to sharpen.</li>
            <li> I am SO annoyed that I spent $8 on an eyeliner that &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; like it would be the standard twist-type when you need to extend the product.  Nope.  You have to buy a special sharpener to be able to cut through the hard plastic coating of the pencil.  What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used! It goes on smooth and easily.  It has the look of liquid liner, but not the hassle.  I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Have been using for months. Glides on easy with no tug and pull.  Lasts all day. Removes with soap and water. Couldn&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is the best. I use it to put in my water line, not on the top of my eyes. But it goes on so smooth and you just have to stroke once to get full color. Other eyeliners that i&#x27;ve tried I have to go over top of it multiple times because it is so light. loveeeee it</li>
            <li> I loved this eyeliner, until I had to sharpen it. Before sharpening, it went on easily, and stay put. After sharpening, it went on grey-ish (I have the black), and it ran from my water line down past my eyelashes, as if I had been crying. After only a few hours it&#x27;s almost gone (for the second day in a row), I ended up having to borrow a co-workers liner to fix it. I will not buy this ever again.</li>
            <li> First things first: this is the best eyeliner out there. You can go with a thin swipe of the liner for a classy-chic look, or make a thick line for a more dramatic look. It works just like a liquid liner, but without all of the smudging and dry-time. I can fall asleep with it on, wake up the next morning, and it&#x27;s still in place! I love this eyeliner and will never look back! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> All time favorite liner. It glides on and stays in place.</li>
            <li> i would not buy another brand as long as this is still available. love the way it goes on and stays on all day!</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is great, goes on smooth and looks great but doesn&#x27;t last all day so I end up re-applying.  It sharpens well if you have the right sharpener, I use the [[ASIN:B002HK2GOO Tweezerman Deluxe Cosmetic Sharpener]] and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I always look at the percentage and the price..this person happened to have both and now I know why.  Everything was great including the packaging.</li>
            <li> If you want to buy is eyeliner you&#x27;re better off going to a drugstore and getting it. I recently ordered it from amazon and although it came quickly, the packaging (of the liner not the box it was shipped in) was already open and without a cap! My liner was too dried out to even try on my hand! It was a waste of $7.</li>
            <li> love how it goes on, in the water lines, and around the lid. you could use the smudger, it works fine, I use a brush and its even better imo. love this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted..fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this is the best. I will never switch to anything else. &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does accentuate my eyes! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on smoothly and lasts all day long. First eyeliner that does not disappoint! You do need makeup remover to remove or fix a mistake.</li>
            <li> best eyeliners made for edging eyelids. Last long.  go on smooth. great colors</li>
            <li> What you see is all you get! This eyeliner does not twist up. Who wants to pay $7 for eyeliner that barely lasts a week? Nice marketing twist, but you should consider the consequences of customers who will now go elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought the black fire and the blue and both go on great and last all day I love it. I only wish the blue was darker. After using this for three days the tip needs sharpening and if you try to sharpen it it breaks off into a liquid mess.  Don&#x27;t buy this if you want a long lasting liner, buy the liquid by covergirl it is a brush applicator.</li>
            <li> First of all, you must use a pencil sharpener.  I almost threw it out because I thought it was self-sharpening pencil, but it&#x27;s not.  Anyway, it is great.  It goes on really, really easily and lasts all day.  I compare it to Tarte&#x27;s eyeliner which is $18 and only lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I expected to be able to roll out the eye liner as it was used and then I realized that I need to sharpen it ...  . And after about 3 attempts to sharpen, most of the penciled was gone because it kept braking again and again. Also an hour after applying the eyeliner was all smuggled and I ended with black circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and in perfect packaging, thank you so much! I definately reccomend this eyeliner it stays on all day long, ive been using it for 3 years, i only bought it online because my local rite aide closed.</li>
            <li> The product smudges to much would like to try something else that stays on all day with out the smudge</li>
            <li> I love this eyeliner!!!! Simply one of the besti have ever used.  Gotta on smoothly and quickly and lasts for quite some time.</li>
            <li> My favorite eye liner! This purchase was for a friend of mine because I recommend it so highly that I bought it as a gift. Love it, very easy to use, glides on and stays on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no makeup expert - just a regular working lady with very little time to get ready - so if you take the time to read these sort of beauty product reviews, you&#x27;re probably way more ahead than I am and might not have as much difficulty. A lot of websites say to use a regular pencil sharpener to sharpen this pencil, but that didn&#x27;t work for me for the first 10+ times. I had to whittle it down to get to a point where it could be sharpened with a pencil sharpener. I was able to get it more sharp with an exacto knife, but this product is so creamy that it promptly broke off and the sharp plastic side went up into my eyelid. Whatever, it&#x27;s expensive and I can&#x27;t afford to be wasteful. I didn&#x27;t think the sharp sides were enough to cut me, but my eyelid is now painful, sensitive to the touch, and I hope it&#x27;s not infected. This product has just been a nightmare from start to finish.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about needing a &amp;#34;special&amp;#34;sharpener .I tried to figure out what that meant but couldn&#x27;t .I went ahead and ordered it .I put eyeliner on my water line and have trouble finding anything that stays .I actually googled &amp;#34;best eyeliner for water line&amp;#34; and this came up .I love it !Goes on easy ,is super black ,and stays put .So when it needed sharped I was scared .I used my cover girl sharpener and it worked fine with no trouble what so ever .Yeah !</li>
            <li> LOVE Liquiline Blast! People ask me all the time how I get it so dark and perfect and they think I use liquid eyeliner (I just cannot handle that stuff)...they are shocked when I tell them it&#x27;s a pencil! I love how smoothly it goes on and I never have to reapply during the day (unless I smudge). Even if I tear up from allergies or something it doesn&#x27;t wear off, unless I am actively wiping it. I will never use another eyeliner again!</li>
            <li> Wife did not like this due to not being able to sharpen it.  When the tip becomes used up it is gone.  Very expensive for so little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put makeup often, so it is kind of difficult to use eyeliner, but this one is really easy to apply on the eyes and easy to take off too. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Great Smooth Dark, Intense Pigment Eyeliner! Goes on smooth, does not irritate sensitive eyes and is a rich, deep black. Stays on pretty well.</li>
            <li> Very smooth application, not like a pencil. I use a little primer over my eye, but I think it should work fine without ad well.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I have finally found an eyeliner that I really really like!  It looks like a pencil but goes on more like a liquid.  It doesn&#x27;t smear like my usual eyeliner!  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m horrible with liquid liners, but regular pencils don&#x27;t give the same smooth look. That&#x27;s why I love this type of liner. It&#x27;s easy to control the line, mess free (no random spots, splotches, or uneven area like I get when I try to use liquids). Liner goes on easily, looks great, and lasts. Also, the smudger works well - perfect combination of stiffness and softness to get the smudge you&#x27;re going for, if you want.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner!!! Finally an eye liner that doesn&#x27;t require sharpening, goes on easily without sticking or smearing and looks great all day! My sister introduced me to it because she loved it--now I&#x27;m hooked! Highly recommended--the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried for such a great cost.</li>
