            <li>The Myo Tape is great it makes measuring yourself easier.  </li>
            <li>Great price for 2 items</li>
            <li>Both of these items work great.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great there is something inexpensive to aid in measuring body fat via calipers but</li>
            <li>But The Tape Is Great &amp; For The Price</li>
            <li>The measuring tape is great.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was great and all, but i didn&#x27;t like that the tape measurer started off almost at 2 inches..</li>
            <li>Works and i&#x27;m happy with the quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>should* be a really great, inexpensive way to self-measure; but the retractor broke immediately.</li>
            <li>This set is a great way to get started monitoring your percentage of body fat.</li>
            <li>Great value for the buck</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great instrument for you to keep track of your body fat lose.</li>
            <li>These two items are great for keeping an eye on the amount of fat lost, rather than going by the bathroom scale alone and having fluctuating results.</li>
            <li>They both work great</li>
            <li>This works great.  </li>
            <li>Tape measurement works great and holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to know fat loos vs muscle gain.</li>
            <li>The tape measure I think works great</li>
            <li>Happy with the product.</li>
            <li>A great tool to keep track of your progress in fitness</li>

            <li>Happy with purchase for the money</li>
            <li>Great tool for fitness tracking.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s great for measuring bicep, chest, leg girth without having to fight with a tailors tape measure).  </li>
            <li>Great for the prices as well.  </li>
            <li>The myo tape works great.  </li>
            <li>The Myotape is great for taking measurements when you don&#x27;t have a partner to assist -</li>
            <li>A great combination in trying to manage and monitor body composition</li>
            <li>But it works great</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>This tester and tape are great.</li>
            <li>For under $10 this is a great deal.</li>

            <li>Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>Great measurement and accuracy</li>
            <li>This is a great product to have while in the process of losing weight or maintaining.</li>
            <li>for the myotape -- it is a great tool and the fact that it comes with the caliber is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, Work Great</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for testing your body fat percentage.</li>
            <li>Gave it five stars because it does what&#x27;s supposed to do and works great.</li>
            <li>This would be a great product to use to measure your biceps by yourself.</li>
            <li>Great tool to help you keep on track with your fitness</li>
            <li>Awesome tool for measuring on your own.  </li>
            <li>great for tracking progress</li>
            <li>Not so great in practice.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>but the tape is great.</li>
            <li>The measuring tool was great, but the calipers we&#x27;re spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great product if all you need is to measure your % body fat.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>great package, great product, timely delivery</li>
            <li>The measuring tape is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and the materials are of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li>Very accurate tape and the best thing</li>
            <li>I have used it successfully now for almost two years, and have targeted and rid myself of problem areas by doing so.</li>
            <li>loving it!..</li>
            <li>The myotape, however, it excellent for measuring circumferences and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use!</li>
            <li>If it is actually accurate - this is the BEST.</li>
            <li>Both the MyoTape and body fat tester work perfectly out of the box and have given me accurate measurements.  </li>
            <li>not so good either; I doubt the accuracy of these - feels so plastic-y</li>
            <li>The good thing was it was so inexpensive that I had no guilt over tossing it into the garbage can.</li>
            <li>good for calipering of problem areas.  </li>
            <li>Good way to track the quality of your progress</li>
            <li>Product is good as described.</li>
            <li>good idea and price</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>calipers are probably also great--they feel like good quality--</li>
            <li>but you can find good info online.</li>
            <li>The one good thing about this item is the measuring tape.</li>
            <li>The tape i just as good.</li>
            <li>Good price, good qualify...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>This is a good tool to measure body fat.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m good at percentages, just not this form of percentages.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and the quality is good.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a good deal.</li>
            <li>The MyoTape is a good build though.</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a really good one.</li>
            <li>But, the cost and quality are good for the price.</li>
            <li>the measuring tape is good if you are measuring yourself.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any good</li>
            <li>everything works perfectly and the price is amazingly cheap considering in a store</li>
            <li>Caliper doesnt work that good...</li>
            <li>Good price, but measuring tape is a hassle to do if your by yourself</li>
            <li>The caliper on this is good but the tape is not.  </li>
            <li>A good product for the prize.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>good reminder that im still fat.</li>
            <li>and it fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>like this set also because the price is good.</li>
            <li>Good Price too.</li>
            <li>but they are good for the price</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>good deal though.</li>
            <li>I wanted the caliper, but thought that this combo was a good value.  </li>
            <li>Once you hear the click your good.</li>
            <li>This $9.10 (free shipping) purchase is one of the best investments that I&#x27;ve made along my fat loss journey.</li>
            <li>It gives good measurement.</li>
            <li>This was a good product for the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good, affordable caliper and measurement tape.</li>
            <li>Good products for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price though.</li>
            <li>It is pretty awesome though, including the measuring tape, that is also awesome. :)</li>
            <li>I received the product quickly and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>The calipers are very simple to use and although they might not be the best of the best, they get the job done.</li>
            <li>This is actually great and from what I heard, this is very accurate.</li>
            <li>It looks cheap but works very good.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with the AccuMeasure MyoTape MT05</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with both of these products.  </li>
            <li>Great for measuring fat people at work, fat people love to know how fat they are.</li>
            <li>The calipers are okay, nothing great, but again, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Works great, could include some more literature</li>
            <li>The tape measure works great, love it.  </li>
            <li>chart that comes with it isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;m not going to deduct a star for that since you can find a better chart on line for free.</li>
            <li>Love both products!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I love the results of this caliper, but that&#x27;s not the caliper&#x27;s fault!  </li>
            <li>I have 5% more to go!</li>
            <li>I love that I can use the MyoTape to measure myself and I don&#x27;t have to have anyone do the measuring for me, since I don&#x27;t want anyone else to see the results!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize, it&#x27;s what I needed for a great price, and I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone needing a set of easy to use skinfold calipers and girth measuring tools.</li>
            <li>its easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li>I think the tape measure is a great idea, and you can measure by yourself (though it&#x27;s not that easy).  </li>
            <li>The caliper is great, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Instructions are easy to follow having the tape measure was great as well.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great spreadsheet out there you can use, along with these tools, to get fairly accurate measurements.</li>
            <li>its amazing the difference you see even if you don&#x27;t lose any pounds on the scale.  </li>
            <li>The fat tester is great and it gives accurate measurement of body fat.</li>
            <li>The two combined make a nice fitness toolkit to help measure your progress.</li>
            <li>I liked that part, but the body fat tester is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the calipers as much as I liked the tape measure.</li>
            <li>The product comes with a guide on how to convert the pinch measurements to body fat %, but honestly, I cannot evaluate the ease of making the conversion, I use an online calculator and just plug the values in.</li>
            <li>The tape measure is nice too because I can take my own measurements without having to have someone help me with a measuring tape now.</li>
            <li>The measurement tape is definitely handy</li>
            <li>Once you made the measurement, you have to move the indicator to get the measurement, the tester does not do it on its own as claimed.</li>
            <li>much appreciative of the quickness and ease of buying.</li>
            <li>measuring tape was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>chart was nice</li>
            <li>-- If you know what you are doing, I am sure this is a perfectly good tool, based on everything that I have read.</li>
            <li>Nice to have around for measuring progress.</li>
            <li>I like and these two items come in handy for taking your own measurements as well as others in my group.</li>
            <li>if you use it correctly 3-Is all you need to do the job You can just buy the Caliper itself without the measuring tape, hwever the tape is handy and locks in place.</li>
            <li>Nice just to throw in the gym bag and log your results.</li>
            <li>The tape is a nice addition since it can lock in place.</li>
            <li>The wrap-around tape measure fits nicely into a slot to hold it into place while you read the measurement.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and items were perfectly packed.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and work amazingly well for the price!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with these calipers and make sure that you read the directions how to use them.  </li>
            <li>While the most accurate measurements I have seen come of the multi-site pinch test (like 5 or so pinches on arms, legs, chest, etc...), this is a great at-home DIY tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to start keeping more detailed measurements of your body, this is a great place to start.</li>
            <li>These are great and accurate tools that everyone into fitness and/or a healthy lifestyle should have.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Have used it in a classroom setting at the university and students loved how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>Awesome product and fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>Good Quality, Easy to use.</li>
            <li>The calipers seem good and the tape measure is easy to use, but the instructions weren&#x27;t all that helpful for measuring body fat.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use by yourself.</li>
            <li>The pin holder on the tape measure makes it very easy.  </li>
            <li>Well made, bonus tape measure makes self measurements very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and read.  </li>
            <li>The spring loaded mechanism makes it very easy to use one handed.</li>
            <li>it makes it very easy.  </li>
            <li>Makes it very easy to take measurements without assistance.</li>
            <li>It makes it very easy to do self-measurements.  </li>
            <li>The measuring tape is very easy as well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and calculate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I was able to use the fat tester right away with brilliant results.</li>
            <li>but I honestly believe I&#x27;m more like 14%.</li>
            <li>but I think I liked the measuring tape more than the fat tester.</li>
            <li>These would not be a good fit for those planning to use it twice a day for an year..</li>
            <li>as for the calipers I struggled getting a good accurate reading with.</li>
            <li>Not as accurate as I hoped, but good for the price</li>
            <li>but it sure as hell will keep you honest about it.</li>
            <li>caliper and measuring tape worked good and gave an accurate measurement when used with 3 point body fat testing</li>
            <li>wrap the tape around your waist, arm or leg, click it into the socket on the handle, and when you press the button it will retract to where you can take a good accurate measurement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is really cheap for what you get, and that makes this a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The price is really cheap for what you get, and that makes this a good deal.  </li>
            <li>Price was right and it works great for me and my clients.</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Easy to use!</li>
            <li>BUT - this is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Great way to keep track of your progress when the scale isn&#x27;t changing much!</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised, great product for the price.</li>
            <li>works great does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Got here in great time and is exactly what i needed for the Navy BCAs.</li>
            <li>Is exactly as described at a great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can now easily figure out my body fat percentage!</li>
            <li>the locking mechanism means you get very accurate measurements every time.</li>
            <li>You get a very accurate measurement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen and they are very cheap.</li>
            <li>It does what it is meant to do and is very cheap.</li>
            <li>An easy way to measure your own inches.</li>
            <li>The handy pocket size guide to easy to read and understand....</li>
            <li>The Myotape is very cheap, but it&#x27;s ok for someone looking for a first-time kit, for the price.</li>
            <li>The tape measure works just fine and is handy for getting your body dimensions by yourself.</li>
            <li>Great tool and super useful!</li>
            <li>I like using this, as accurate as it can be!</li>
            <li>Save time and frustration by getting a more durable instrument.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be 100% sure on the accuracy</li>
            <li>Love the Mayo Tape.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought them together.</li>
            <li>I love the myotape.</li>
            <li>The tape measure is an excellent addition especially if you have to measure tricky areas like your arms.  </li>
            <li>I needed more than just measuring my weight since I am trying to build muscle and having the caliper lets me do that,  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>Too many folds now.</li>
            <li>so, then I am more like 11.5% fat instead of the 9.6%</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure every MyoTape isn&#x27;t like mine.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent personal body fat tester kit for the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li>My advice for you just take it :).</li>
            <li>and I love the tape measure</li>
            <li>The clicks are separated by 1 inch increments, so you won&#x27;t get any more accuracy than 1 inch increments (25mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The calipers also provide a more stable reading than my Tanita conductivity based scale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even comes with a measuring tape, makes it all better.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend looking into a better set of calipers.</li>
            <li>If you are into body building, you are going to love these.  </li>
            <li>The Fat Measure Is Ok</li>
            <li>It would be better if the measuring tape stopped every cm.</li>
            <li>My favorite item is the MyoTape.</li>
            <li>So really the tape is not that great...</li>
            <li>If you buy this set, be sure to go online and download better body fat charts and tips on measuring.</li>
            <li>The plastic is more sturdy</li>
            <li>Was able to get all of the measurements that I need.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to make sure that I was losing fat and not muscle.  </li>
            <li>Better instructions for use can be found online.</li>
            <li>It would have been better if there a bit closer.</li>
            <li>Liked it for a cheap solution to measuring your body fat..</li>
            <li>I did google more places to measure on you</li>
            <li>body then in the instructions and feel like it is a better number than what is give from the instructions.</li>
            <li>The accumeasure worked okay for measuring fat.</li>
            <li>Wish i had more ...</li>
            <li>this is kind of light weight and flimsy</li>
            <li>Not too many ways to measure fat percentage at home.</li>
            <li>and i am glad for the internet.</li>
            <li>Love the myotape measurer.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:) :)</li>
            <li>Measured myself, checked the chart, and it says I&#x27;m sexy.  </li>
            <li>I use the tape most often.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was more durable - either heavier stock paper or laminated.</li>
            <li>I love being able to measure my arms with out having someone help me.</li>
            <li>gave as a gift and it was enjoyed</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>The tape measure works great but feels as if it will break if not used gently.  </li>
            <li>I love this measuring tape.  </li>
            <li>we figured it out, it made a lot more sense.</li>
            <li>I rest better at night knowing my information is protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The measuring tape is very simple to use, no it isn&#x27;t perfect, but again it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this, but was just beginning to look at monitoring my body fat percentage and wanted something inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>I bought this set because I wanted a better method of measuring my body fat than the percentage listed on my scale.  </li>
            <li>The tape measurer I value the most, definitely better than a sewing measurer.</li>
            <li>As for the actual measuring: The biggest challenge was to perfect the measuring technique.  </li>
            <li>I do love that</li>
            <li>body fat caliper is slightly more intricate/complicated to use.</li>
            <li>Basically, make sure to read the included instructions before measuring.</li>
            <li>i get a better reading</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>the body fat percentage can jump by 2% or more per line on the graph, and the graph is in 2mm segments.</li>
            <li>I love the measuring tape and the ease of the use.</li>
            <li>I also used fat % charts from some reputable fitness websites - the charts that came with the calipers</li>
            <li>I suggest Youtube for more information on how to use it rather than the index card sized instructions they provide.</li>
            <li>I love this tape measure because you can measure yourself.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not all that skilled with calipers</li>
            <li>and i was hoping for a better measure than this.</li>
            <li>Try getting a better one</li>
            <li>Love the MyoTape.  </li>
            <li>Love the tape measure.</li>
            <li>The calipers are ok though.</li>
            <li>i love this product.....  </li>
            <li>The MyoTape works well, but these are the lousiest, most flimsy calipers ever.  </li>
            <li>This worked much better for me than the ballpark number I get from the enclosed card and one</li>
            <li>I ended up looking it up online to see a better explanation of the chart based off of the series of measurements rather than just 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I do love the tape measure that it comes with.</li>
            <li>I feel that the more points you use, the better because you get more accuracy.</li>
            <li>People have differences, and using more skinfold sites can account for these differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly just bought it for the skinfold caliper, so I do not plan on using the tape</li>
            <li>but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, so you have to pay close attention to make sure you know when it closes together.  </li>
            <li>The tape works ok too.  </li>
            <li>a good buy, gotta master the pinch but worth it</li>
            <li>So many times I looked at the weight &amp; it just didn&#x27;t change compared to two&lt;br /&gt;weeks</li>
            <li>I seem to be gaining more muscle, so am not seeing any downward movement on the scale.  </li>
            <li>Works Great price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to use and easy to read.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to measure with the metope since it is designed to stay in a circle, which is very nice for forearm, chest, calves,</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to use if you are measuring body fat, very easy to use and instructions are clear.</li>
            <li>It is very nice and  useful, for me it is my correct choice, and in addtion it is original (made in USA), just read instruction and take all measurment and it will be correct.  </li>
            <li>Being able to grasp the suprailiac skinfold for bodyfat measurements takes some practice, but the quality of the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The caliper takes some skill to use accurately, but the tape is very easy indeed.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and accurate, too.  </li>
            <li>is you can use it on your own to get easy and accurate measurements.</li>
            <li>The caliper is very accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The caliper is all plastic and should be treated with care, but if used properly is very accurate and easy to use.     </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very accurate.</li>
            <li>I use it to measure my waist and it does a pretty good job on that.</li>
            <li>With practice, reading accuracy is around +- 1-2mm which corresponds to about +- 0.8-1.6% which is still pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Item works pretty good, I would recommend this to anyone who trying to keep an eye on their body fat measurements.</li>
            <li>I can still get it to work, but fair warning for those that have it happen on the first try.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and, most importantly, is easy to use ACCURATELY.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re measuring by yourself, you can do it easily and accurately!</li>
            <li>The calipers are easy to use and the measurement of them is ballpark accurate!</li>
            <li>It is easy to tell when you have applied the appropriate amount of pressure in measuring because it clicks into place.  </li>
            <li>Love the tape measure, make it easy to do the measurements for yourself.</li>
            <li>Goes up to 60 inches so it will be able to fit around MOST peoples waists/chests.</li>
            <li>Looked cheap, didn&#x27;t think the caliper would be very accurate.</li>
            <li>The slider on the caliper makes it perfectly easy to read your own results while using these products alone, and the auto retract feature on the tape is a quick and efficient way to make sure you&#x27;re getting accurate readings.</li>
            <li>this package you get the calipers and a MyoTape tape measure which allows you to lock the tape measure in place for more accurate readings.  </li>
            <li>it helps you track your progress more efficiently and accurately than the body fat scale.</li>
            <li>BUT all you have to do to make it more accurate is</li>
            <li>hardest part is making sure that you measure accurately and correctly each time.</li>
            <li>In order to get a more accurate body fat percentage, the person must be doing a triceps skinfold AND subscapular skinfold.</li>
            <li>Much more accurate than the electronic ones.</li>
            <li>might be the most accurate of all, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li>I was able to accurately gauge my body fat.</li>
            <li>I have a scale that shows body fat percentage but wasn&#x27;t sure that it was accurate</li>
            <li>After doing some research, i decided calipers would be the most accurate at home method i could use.  </li>
            <li>For a more accurate result, i suggest searching online for a multi-point measurement instead of the one location measurement the chart says.  </li>
            <li>I still suggest using multi-point measurements and a website to run the numbers in order to have a more accurate assessment of your body fat.  </li>
            <li>I still suggest using multi-point measurements and a website to run the numbers in order to have a more accurate assessment of your body fat.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find the two products together for a great deal as I needed a measuring tape too.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s much better measuring protocols online for free.</li>
            <li>With the measurements of the more advanced caliper when I brought him into our campus clinic, it was found he has a body fat percentage of 21%.</li>
            <li>I was not planning on buying the myotape, it just came with the calipers, but when i got it and used it, it was amazingly simple and brilliant.</li>
            <li>Percentage of body fat is MUCH more important.  </li>
            <li>The measurement chart could be more precise.</li>
            <li>The calipers are all plastic, so there is probably some change with time, but there are good for keeping track of progress which is what really matters anyway.  </li>
            <li>the measuring tape is nice however and makes it worth buying.</li>
            <li>but it is definitly a good start for anybody who wants to track their progress.</li>
            <li>Easy, cheap, and accurate!</li>
            <li>The fat checker as I call it, is easy to use and is more accurate than figuring your BMI by just height and weight.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy to use, no need more than that to check your body fat!&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>I love being able to get an accurate measurement because I can wrap the tape around my body parts without needing help from someone else to make sure I&#x27;m doing it right.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use, but I feel like the measurements might be innaccurate.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to use, but</li>
            <li>The Myotape and Accu-Measure are both easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the chart that comes with the kit, and the fat tester is easy to read.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and works well.</li>
            <li>Now it could just be me, but I don&#x27;t find it to be all that easy.</li>
            <li>The caliper is easy to use and he could tell me his body fat percentage within 5 minutes of taking it out of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>tape measure wasn&#x27;t as easy.</li>
            <li>It is actually easy to do</li>
            <li>I looked online, but it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I thought it would be, there weren&#x27;t any additional instructions on the manufacturers web site.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Has marker tab which makes using without help extremely easy.  </li>
            <li>However it pops out easily while trying to make the measurement.  </li>
            <li>but the MyoTape is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>This measuring tape is easy to use and functions as it described.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li>the body caliper has helpful, easy to follow instructions and the measuring tape is easy to use by myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, the instruc card explains everything</li>
            <li>Easy to use and helpful.</li>
            <li>The measuring tape makes self-measuring easy, since it just locks into place, and can retract with the push of a button.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I can measure body fat easily.</li>
            <li>On the bright side, the tape measure seems decent and you can use it with one hand, like for measuring biceps.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, and comes with the instructions, and was recommended by the author of \\&quot;Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle\\&quot;, Tom Venuto.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to use and compact</li>
            <li>convenient and easy to use</li>
            <li>The MyoTape makes it really easy to measure your body without help:  </li>
            <li>Really easy to use, however, the chart for correlating the measurements to body fat levels might be off...</li>
            <li>MyoTape is easy to use also.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy the measure waist, arms and whatever else easily by yourself.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use for measuring yourself.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of practice to get it right, but very happy with the overall performance of both these items.</li>
            <li>But the tape works perfect and I enjoy seeing and knowing my muscles are growing where I want them, and other parts are shrinking where I want them to.</li>
            <li>Easy way to get accurate measurements.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, accurate, inexpensive and a device that I will use for years to come.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to accurately measure muscles size.</li>
            <li>It works the way it supposed to and has an easy to read chart that comes along with it and instructions of how to accurately use it.</li>
            <li>Seems accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Pros: Inexpensive, accurate and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>This is just an easy to use and accurate set of body measurement tools.</li>
            <li>The advantage to the tool is that it easily and accurately performs the fat pinch test.  </li>
            <li>The tape measurer is cool too -- now I can track my measurements over time a bit more accurately.</li>
            <li>but it does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li>The AccuMeasure is fine.</li>
            <li>The calipers are fine.</li>
            <li>the accu-measure still works fine though</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and it&#x27;ll work fine.</li>
            <li>Both sets have worked fine for me.</li>
            <li>: I purchased these calipers 5 years ago and I still have them and they work fine.</li>
            <li>The % body fat measure came with less than perfect instructions.</li>
            <li>Fine for a one time, or home use type scenario.</li>
            <li>(it is plastic after all) but still works perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li>The caliper works fine once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure is perfect for self-measuring; it&#x27;s got a spring that winds up the tape measure or draws it tight.  </li>
            <li>Be advised that a PERFECT bodyfat reading is very tricky even with advanced equipment, but you don&#x27;t need perfect -- I take 5 readings every Sunday, average them, and use that to help figure my calorie intake for the next week.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>Cheap little plastic tool that works just perfectly!</li>
            <li>It works fairly well, but I also ordered the Slim Guide caliper and liked that a little better.</li>
            <li>but it seems accurate.  </li>
            <li>The AccuMeasure measure tabs are not as accurate as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li>with the MyoTape was a huge added bonus.</li>
            <li>The myo tape does not measure accurately as it the tape measure itself begins at 2 inches and 3 centimeters, which in turn requires me to do the math to determine the correct measurement.</li>
            <li>I purchased the items for accurate measurements for a nutrition program.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an accurate measuring tool for body fat and muscle size.</li>
            <li>one that the results wouldn&#x27;t be accurate-</li>
            <li>is that the scale may not be accurate.</li>
            <li>the body fat calipers and the tape measure enables me to have an accurate understanding of my progress.</li>
            <li>For measuring one spot on the body it is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li>Fairly accurate for a plastic caliper.  </li>
            <li>Learn to use it and take accurate measurements, so you know your body/fat proportions in relation to your weight.</li>
            <li>and I figured it might be useful some day when I wanted more accurate readings.  </li>
            <li>I got this to get an accurate measure of my body fat.</li>
            <li>The instructions that come with this don&#x27;t seem to be all that accurate or reliable.  </li>
            <li>Two inches on someone&#x27;s waist is a huge difference.</li>
            <li>However, my partner wanted to accurately measure her body fat as well</li>
            <li>We use a lot of online sources for additional test sites to gauge accurate body fat.  </li>
            <li>In my case, it was a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>Seems fairly accurate</li>
            <li>so you can get accurate measurements.</li>
            <li>Accurate results</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s accurate</li>
            <li>I tried to use it and immediately noticed that you could not caliper under 10 mm,  which is a huge problem.  </li>
            <li>It is not as accurate as I hoped</li>
            <li>As accurate as it can be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is</li>
            <li>If you need something extremely accurate, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap caliper</li>
            <li>Its cheap, but gets the job done for personel use.  </li>
            <li>The myotape is great compared to using a regular tape.</li>
            <li>The material is cheap, but I knew that from he beginning.</li>
            <li>This caliper is great for use with external BMI calculators.</li>
            <li>I recommend getting either a more professional caliper with better instructions or a scale that measures fat (check reviews for the most accurate one).</li>
            <li>am not saying don&#x27;t buy these - there is nothing else in this price range - and it is worth getting them with the tape measure, but it did make me hungry to buy a better pair.</li>
            <li>Great purchase, so i can finally keep track of my &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; and my &amp;#34;bulks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The tape measure is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Cheap feeling, but works</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price :)</li>
            <li>I ordered and had the items shipped for free.</li>
            <li>However the tape measure alone is worth the cost of this product, so if you want to try calipers i would suggest this for sure.</li>
            <li>works great... is simple to use and requires no fuss..</li>
            <li>Lightly built from plastic,  </li>
            <li>The measuring tape is a great tool especially when you want to see where you are losing those inches.</li>
            <li>The tape is amazing and really simplifies the process of taking body measurements.</li>
            <li>And they are precise.</li>
            <li>Feels cheap and could break.</li>
            <li>Get this if you need a cheap caliper for school.</li>
            <li>Looked in the mirror and confirmed said sexiness.</li>
            <li>Cheap, plastic, but does the job.</li>
            <li>The tape works great but the calipers (the reason I ordered the product) are totally inconsistent.</li>
            <li>Some reviewers have commented on the \\&quot;cheap plastic\\&quot; this caliper is made of.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cheap plastic -</li>
            <li>Great for a very low price.  </li>
            <li>I am still learning how to get really smooth</li>
            <li>but I decided to give it a try since hydrostatic weighing isn&#x27;t available in my area</li>
            <li>cause it has a button that you can push that retracts the tape after you secure the end in a holder</li>
            <li>Incredibly cheap and innacurate device.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe this product has such great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Important things to remember</li>
            <li>This set is compact and light, so I can bring it during travel.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool if used with the proper instructions and calculations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s into sports, fit life, and body building.</li>
            <li>I know that calipers/impedance measuring devices are not the most accurate, but if you get consistent readings over a period of time it is easy to see the % change when dieting/bulking.</li>
            <li>Tape Measure is wonderful, durable, the calipers is pretty flimsy and doesn&#x27;t look like its going to hold up very long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to get consistent results with this, which is what counts most when you&#x27;re trying to lose fat.</li>
            <li>but I recieved it 5 days earlier and with free shipping!!!</li>
            <li>So it is very useful.  </li>
            <li>Very useful caliper and tape measure.</li>
            <li>Perhaps very good users of this can get value out of it, but I think it just gives a very rough idea.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something quick and easy to determine my body fat.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure makes it easy to take and read your measurements, and the quality it adequate for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all cheap plastic, but no need for any special expense here.  </li>
            <li>Good: simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It measures pretty accurately and they will never lie to you!  </li>
            <li>This caliper works great for measurements but the reference chart they give you is very inaccurate, mostly because they only have you measure from your abdominals.  </li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for, nothing more and nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This helped us measure our bodies more consistently with our BMI.</li>
            <li>I was familiar with this set because I had them before but lost them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these items for a couple of months and, while I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using the calipers correctly, I have to say that the Myo Tape is absolutely awesome.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency: Accuracy aside, calipers give me the most consistent reading.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the price!    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique shape contours to the body and</li>
            <li>Pretty inexpensive and ok for the price.  </li>
            <li>The online calculator and this caliper have matched within 0.5% every time I&#x27;ve compared them, so my confidence in the accuracy of this product has gone up significantly.</li>
            <li>Good tool for tracking weight loss and general health</li>
            <li>The tape measure is great also because it stays tight to your skin and reads accurately!</li>
            <li>but once you figure it out it is very easy to use and very handy for measuring certain areas where you&#x27;d normally need another person to do it for you, thanks to the quick snap end.  </li>
            <li>The calipers are better at detecting body changes than the tape measure as they provide a more sensitive measure.  </li>
            <li>seller shipped it quickly and cheaply</li>
            <li>I used the caliper to check my BF pretty regularly and it is a accurate as the measurements I&#x27;ve had done at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the tape measure to self-measure for a custom wetsuit and it worked great.</li>
            <li>These calipers work just fine and the myotape is extremely useful.</li>
            <li>Nothing really special about this product.</li>
            <li>While there is nothing special per se about this body caliper, it does do the job.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an inexpensive weight measuring tool that works for the right price, this is it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Obviously this isn&#x27;t as accurate as the more scientific tests that require a lab, but for the price, it&#x27;s a decent approximation.</li>
            <li>Its just to get a decent gauge of your fat (although i don&#x27;t know why I felt there would be more data available with these).  </li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed when i got this little thing.</li>
            <li>Pretty straightforward and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, and the measuring tape makes it so much easier to take your own measurements.  </li>
            <li>The tape is more accurate and easier to use than normal measuring tape.</li>
            <li>Good product, more accurate than many more expensive options.</li>
            <li>It took about three seconds to master the use of these sweet products, and now I can confirm the fact that I&#x27;m slim and athletic any time I need to.</li>
            <li>They give you basic instructions on use and its a good way to keep track of your size and fat %.  </li>
            <li>The tape is so cool.</li>
            <li>I actually use the tape in conjunction with a decent scale to get great and easy results.</li>
            <li>So this is a good buy and definitely recommend purchasing this product!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li>Good enough for now!</li>
            <li>and I think i will really like it more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+Calipers provide a nice audible click when measurement is complete.</li>
            <li>For me it is much easier and better to use the scale that I purchased as well.</li>
            <li>To keep it short, I don&#x27;t think putting the scale in increments of 10 for mm is a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to get more careful with what I eat and both of these are excellent tools for tracking your progress.</li>
            <li>I use this for 7 and 9 point bodyfat tests, and nothing beats the tried and true caliper method.  </li>
            <li>a true 5 stars product and</li>
            <li>this thing is cool.</li>
            <li>the myotape is cool too.</li>
            <li>i did not want to invest much and works ok for my needs.</li>
            <li>tape works fantastically well, only good things to say about that.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of doing skin fold measurements, but this low cost caliper is up to the task and the MyoTape measuring tape makes the job of taking girth measurements a good bit easier.</li>
            <li>especially I got it for a good price.</li>
            <li>Love the tape; it makes keeping metrics on my body that much easier.</li>
            <li>Good deal for the low cost.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a cool tape measure that also can be used solo</li>
            <li>Probably not the gold standard but a good way to track progress.</li>
            <li>not bad.</li>
            <li>this Accumeasure bundle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.  </li>
            <li>this Accumeasure bundle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.  </li>
            <li>&quot; rather quickly when you press the button and is kind of loud.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to track my progess and this is easy to use and nice to see inches go down instead of just looking at a scale.</li>
            <li>Cheap construction , clicker doesnt click right.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but the price was right.</li>
            <li>If you do it right, it&#x27;s accurate to within 1%.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and is consistent in its measurements.</li>
            <li>but it is easy to use and seems to work consistently.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and great for keeping track of body fat when you&#x27;re trying to lose a few pounds.</li>
            <li>Obviously, if you want to get the most accurate reading, you need to go to a facility with the proper machines to measure you, but this works great for measuring week-to-week progress during body recomp.</li>
            <li>It provides an accurate body fat measurement, which is more useful when trying to get in shape than your actual weight many times.</li>
            <li>The caliper is just fine for a cheap caliper, but it&#x27;s the tape that is really the star here.  </li>
            <li>These tools were super easy and very helpful in allowing me to track my weight loss-would recommend them to anybody looking to get into shape!</li>
            <li>If I do body measurements and plug them into the online body fat calculators (the kind the US Navy uses) they have on the internet, I&#x27;ve only got 24% body fat which is more logical.</li>
            <li>Overall  - Good complimentary combination of products - Get your measurements with the tape, assess your body fat percentage with the caliper.</li>
            <li>It makes measure quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best quality caliper, but it definitely works well enough to track your weight loss progress.</li>
            <li>I could subtract the extra inches from what I measure, but it would have been nice if it was accurate.</li>
            <li>I have been on a weight loss mission for about a month now and wanted to get more measurements than just my weight, because I am someone who is more motivated when I can see change in various ways.</li>
            <li>This is a far more accurate, dependable, and affordable method of measuring fat than any electromagnetic scale I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>I already own a digital scale with body fat reading and wanted to see how accurate those readings were.  </li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly and was packaged without any issues.  </li>
            <li>Overall though, a nice cheap way to measure body fat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received quickly from seller</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything super fancy.</li>
            <li>Spend five or 10 more bucks to get a decent one.</li>
            <li>I like the tape measure much better than a regular one because it locks in and cinches up for a more consistent accurate measure.  </li>
            <li>Seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>Plenty of videos on YouTube demonstrating accurate use with this exact product.</li>
            <li>Takes pretty accurate readings.</li>
            <li>but I believe it to be pretty accurate.</li>
            <li>However, I did not use the directions or fat % charts that came with the calipers, as they are NOT going to give you accurate or consistent results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for personal use more than for professional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get positioning down, but this was a great product for the price and does the job</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, accurate, and makes me very conscious of where my shortcomings are.</li>
            <li>maybe for some this is ok, but i was trained on the larger caliper and found that it was much easier to use and more accurate.</li>
            <li>MyoTape is my new go to &amp; when I lose more body fat, I&#x27;ll use the AccuMeasure.</li>
            <li>The tape is a great improvement over a normal dressmaking cloth tape, especially when I get to limb measurements where I used to struggle to keep the tape level and in place.</li>
            <li>It does a great job, exactly what it is expected to do&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>The tape measure works very well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Measurements are easy to ready for both the calipers and the measuring tape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and comes with very helpful directions.</li>
            <li>The body fat test kit is straight forward and easy to read.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Incidentally, the MyoTape seems good based on my limited use.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty close!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s consistent!</li>
            <li>Overall, the calipers were easy to use (with a little help) and a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li>Easy to use - not as accurate as the more expensive models, but measurements are repeatable so a good way to measure progress for fat loss</li>
            <li>Great little kit for anyone needing to monitor body fat.</li>
            <li>It was hard to get an accurate reading without great effort.</li>
            <li>This product is very high quality, very professionally designed &amp; very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>So many articles online reiterate the difficulty in precision needed with multiple readings to get an accurate number.  </li>
            <li>i do wonder how accurate it really is.. just a thought..</li>
            <li>The instruction was really simple, which if you wanted more of a accurate reading, there are thousands of internet method on how to measure.</li>
            <li>Until digital BIA gets more accurate with , calipers are the way to go.</li>
            <li>Using the tape measure is a breeze and it takes accurate and fast measurements.</li>
            <li>otherwise it would have been really useful.</li>
            <li>the tape thing is pretty cool -</li>
            <li>It was certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li>If you just want to see for fun then $4 is a no-brainer</li>
            <li>That makes this worth it.  </li>
            <li>I took a more detailed reading using another website and the difference was only 0.40.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase just for that</li>
            <li>This combo of tape measure and body fat gauge is well worth it for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is lost cost and well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Included are calipers and tape, which was nice since I could not only track body fat but also muscle gain too!  </li>
            <li>It is worth buying.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>you can use this to get a set of averages that are fairly useful.</li>
            <li>Myotape alone is worth this purchase.</li>
            <li>I found out my measurements are 32.5&amp;#34; bust, 26.5&amp;#34; waist, &amp; 32&amp;#34; hips; it&#x27;s useful for helping me keep track of my progress.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tape is actually pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>Seeing results using this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I only wanted to Myo Tape, but the Body Fat tester was a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>it will not make you lose weight if you do not change your eating and do not exercise, but it&#x27;s nice to see improvement daily when you do the right thing.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, yet very useful devices to track your fitness progress.</li>
            <li>Having made a New Year&#x27;s decision to start the Primal Blueprint diet, I needed a fast, easy, accurate way to measure body fat.  </li>
            <li>The Personal body fat tester is super easy to use and appears to be accurate.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>The caliper is way more accurate, especially if you are consistent in where you take measurements and the amount of body mass you use for the reading.  </li>
            <li>but I usually prefer to just disregard their instructions and follow instructions online which provide more points of reference and a more accurate calculation.</li>
            <li>The price seemed a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I did receive the AccuMeasure and it does the job right, but I didn&#x27;t receive the Myotape.</li>
            <li>The MyoTape&#x27;s measurement starts right before two inch mark throwing off all my measurements.</li>
            <li>May have to do a couple of times to get right</li>
            <li>like the caliper because of the clicking mechanism, then you know it&#x27;s at the right spot.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and the price was right.</li>
            <li>Price is right as well.</li>
            <li>so it has to suck right?</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>The price was right, though.</li>
            <li>They get the job done decently but are not as accurate as I&#x27;d prefer.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and looks simple.</li>
            <li>The body fat tester is easy to use, instructions very clear.  </li>
            <li>which is why I did not give fewer starts, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t think they are quite good enough to really use - which is why I did not get more</li>
            <li>easy to use, it seems to work well, although the system with one point measurment could be replaced with a multiple point testing, available on internet anyway.</li>
            <li>Simple, easy and cheap.</li>
            <li>The reason the chart varies with age is that older people supposedly carry more fat around their internal organs where it can&#x27;t be easily measured.  </li>
            <li>I used this to keep proper track of all muscle growth, size and body fat % all very durable and compact to able to take with you wherever you may be!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I docked a star for the amount of practice required to get a good reading and I regularly take multiple readings and use the average, but the calipers are the most effective way to track progress in fat percentage</li>
            <li>This product is great for people who are starting get back in shape.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is great for beginners and does its job ONLY if you know how to do your calculations and skinfolds correctly.</li>
            <li>As a personal trainer and aspiring physique competitor, it&#x27;s important to me that I have an accurate way to track my body fat percentage and those of my clients.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea for personal trainers to get something like this for extensive testing and measurements of clients.</li>
            <li>Came super fast through UPS (Amazon Prime) and does the job</li>
            <li>The calipers are nice, but the act of measuring body fat via calipers is limited in accuracy.</li>
            <li>So far it seems pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Caliper is very cheap and can feel flimsy in the hand when using with larger bodies.</li>
            <li>These are very cheap and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Even though I originally purchased this set primarily for the calipers, the MyoTape is the only part I still use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>The caliper is fine but the tape started at the nearly 2 inche mark.</li>
            <li>- I can finally get accurate measurements!</li>
            <li>Then you can remove the tape from your arm and take a closer look at what your measurement is exactly.</li>
            <li>With this item that you can have an idea of the body fat, but not the exact percent.</li>
            <li>The casing accounts for around the first one and three quarter inches</li>
            <li>They say inch above hip bone, but my hip bone is in more than one point.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Much more consistent measurements over standard tape measures.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>so you can undo the pin and see your exact results.  </li>
            <li>I actually have more fat using this gadget than when I check using height and weight.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly like I needed it to.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>The calipers with this set has not failed but I have no means of evaluating the accuracy.</li>
            <li>I like these calipers because there is an indicator for when you should stop squeezing, so you don&#x27;t squeeze too much!  </li>
            <li>It makes it possible to tape yourself in most places.</li>
            <li>If you are consistent with the measuring they should let you know whether or not you are losing fat, which is why I bought them.  </li>
            <li>But you will definitely have to go online to download a better chart and instructions on how to use this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use the skin caliper, first slide the &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Remember that with any type of skin calipers, you will get an approximation, not the exact amount of body fat.</li>
            <li>Then again it is only from the one spot it tells you to test when most of my issue is just my gut.</li>
            <li>I was 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and about 180 pounds when I first tried this</li>
            <li>Gives me a consistent reading when I use it.</li>
            <li>so she could get consistent readings.  </li>
            <li>but it read my fat levels about 7% higher than what they were.</li>
            <li>This is very affordable and practical!</li>
            <li>Plus the shipping and price got my real satisfactions!</li>
            <li>stays safely on the counter next to my creatine and vitamins.  </li>
            <li>First set of calipers.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who is interested or a beginner in fitness</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, durable and gives consistent results when performed correctly.</li>
            <li>and really I am not sure how much more sophisticated they would need to be.  </li>
            <li>Product exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Could never quite figure out how to get the body fat tester to stay consistent</li>
            <li>and I also have a regular tape measure but wanted to make sure that I was measuring consistently.  </li>
            <li>These tools do exactly what I need them to do.  </li>
            <li>It seemed to work ok at first but gave wildly different test results.</li>
            <li>However, I rated the product 4 stars because I really like the measuring tape!</li>
            <li>These items have performed exactly as I needed them to.</li>
            <li>The calipers work, but feel pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>When I first received this product, I thought, \\&quot;How is this going to do what I need it to do\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Consistent is accuracy, and you want a consistent result all the time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This has done exactly what I need it to and has held up.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a button to automatically tighten the tape for a consistent reading --</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this because my weight fluctuates daily, but with this I can see that the fat levels don&#x27;t, and I can focus on muscle status.  </li>
            <li>But, after 2 or 3 attempts I was able to properly use the body fat caliper.  </li>
            <li>First time using products like this and don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>In that, I wasn&#x27;t entirely pleased because the instructions have you ONLY measure your waist.  </li>
            <li>These simple, effective, and accurate tools are all you need to translate what your scale says into what your weight actually means.  </li>
            <li>They work very well!</li>
            <li>I think a simple sewing type tape measure works much better.</li>
            <li>Caliper is a tad flimsy, but seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>This scale has a slider that stops at the exact measurement and it clicks to tell you it is there.</li>
            <li>As humbling as it is to have my wife take my body fat readings, I compared them to the ones that my trainer took and they were pretty close.  </li>
            <li>I read the directions and did exactly what I was supposed to do, however, the item did not work correctly.  </li>
            <li>A regular tape measure will give you much more consistent measurements.</li>
            <li>I might even like this product more when I can actual see changes over time from exercising.</li>
            <li>And this whole set is affordable!</li>
            <li>You get exactly what is advertised here, and it was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>Actually use the tape more often.</li>
            <li>Using the Fat Calculator might be a bit of a challenge at first, but you can do it.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it the click that tells you the measurement had been achieved stopped working.</li>
            <li>simple, economical and easy operable.</li>
            <li>as you use it more the plastic begins to wear and becomes less accurate.</li>
            <li>It comes with a chart for a reading from a single location, but there are great websites out there that allow you to enter readings from multiple locations and extrapolate calculations.</li>
            <li>I had a more thorough bodyfat measurement done at the gym and the results were quite a bit different than from my AccuMeasure calipers, however, I chalk this up to user error on my part, and for a general idea of where you&#x27;re at, these calipers work just fine.     </li>
            <li>Unbeatable for the price, I wish the instructions on measuring where a little more detailed for the calipers</li>
            <li>Nice adjunct to all of my other fitness toys.</li>
            <li>If you really want to measure yourself with this MyoTape, be sure to hold the plastic at exactly the same place to reduce variability.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure is great and is the same style i have been using in the military for years for body fat measurements.</li>
            <li>I would have liked more than one way to approximate your bodyfat.</li>
            <li>The quality seems good enough to last.</li>
            <li>Overall a good low cost combo for home use</li>
            <li>Just be sure to use them properly, and don&#x27;t use too much force as you may accidentally break something.</li>
            <li>you really want to use these tools to properly assess your body fat, I will add information for you in the comments to help you get the most out of the tool.  </li>
            <li>Thank god I didn’t spend much for this product, wasn’t useful and looked very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The caliper works great and the tape is very useful in keeping track of waist size or whatever, but the chart used to measure body fat % is useless.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use especially if you know what you are doing ;)   </li>
            <li>You have to read the directions and measure yourself the same way in the same place each time in order to get the most accurate results.</li>
            <li>You can get a more accurate value by taking multiple measurements in different places on the body and using a chart online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I trust the friction in the plastic to provide the appropriate force consistently for accurate measurements.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll get a more accurate final number for total body-fat percentage that way rather than just measuring one site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>To measure fat with calipers you need to know exactly where and how much skin to grab</li>
            <li>oh well it was the tape I really wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li>Myotape is so convenient, fast and Consistent in result.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure is definitely higher quality than the fat caliper, but both work very well.  </li>
            <li>Yes, I am not fat and consider myself to be in a good shape, however, the measurements I was getting were giving me bodybuilder type fat percentages and I have a small belly, so there is no way my body fat is below 10%.  </li>
            <li>Third time&#x27;s a charm, I&#x27;ll give this outfit one more try as Myotapes have a decent reputation.</li>
            <li>Always compare to your own measurements too, not other peoples as all bodies are different.</li>
            <li>The only minor quibble is that the peg that holds the tape in the slot easily pops out of place, but I have become used to keeping a finger over it to avoid the problem for the most part.</li>
            <li>My only criticism would be that the end of the tape falls out of the slot too easily, which is why I gave it a 4 star instead of five.</li>
            <li>Simple tool that easy to use and even easier with the given directions.</li>
            <li>Easy to use once you actually read the directions and practice with it.  </li>
            <li>Easy enough to use.  </li>
            <li>i totally recommend this, it is easy to use even for a beginner and is execcelent to keep track of your measssures and body fat</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s a bit flimsy and would slip out easily when trying to measure different body parts.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy too use and measures spot on every time.</li>
            <li>only gripe with the tape is that the end of the tape easily slips out of the notch for it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and within ten minutes I had everything calculated out.</li>
            <li>First couple of tries yield varying numbers but it gets better with practice.</li>
            <li>Simple product makes it easy to get readings to help me get to my fitness goals.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure is easy to use, especially when measuring circumferences (waist, leg, arm, neck).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with very simple and clear instructions and is super easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fat caliper itself is really simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The calipers will probably hold up okay, since they are basically a single injection molded piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have a smart phone, they also have a web site.</li>
            <li>For the calipers, the readings indicate I&#x27;m at a certain bodyfat percentage, but I don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me and I will certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>this way, you can account for errors in process or errors in the certain location that you used.</li>
            <li>I needed a simple, fast, and easy way to take measurements.</li>
            <li>recommend these skin calipers, it should hold up just fine for personal use.</li>
            <li>However, I am a beginner and after trying to follow the enclosed instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and then searching the web for even more detailed instructions, I cannot manage to get the same reading every time, because I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the exact placement for the caliper and even when i think I am in the same spot, my readings come out completely</li>
            <li>Just need to make measurements occasionally, and these work fine for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty clever the way the calipers click at the point of body fat measurement.</li>
            <li>This is an essential tool and has helped me tremendously, because, scales lie!</li>
            <li>The body fat measure is a little on the flimsy-feeling side, but overall this is a great value.</li>
            <li>The caliper is clearly not made to a high standard of quality, but it is good anyways.</li>
            <li>So simple to use, yet accurate.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t accurate enough.</li>
            <li>A DEXA scan might be the only way to accurately do this.</li>
            <li>This really is the only thing you need for accurate measurement.  </li>
            <li>The attached sheet for body-fat percentages may not be that accurate in that it only takes into account one measure (the fat around your waist).</li>
            <li>While it isn&#x27;t 100% accurate, after learning how to use it, it&#x27;s within 1% of the bodyfat reading on the medical scale at my mothers</li>
            <li>Dont really use it alot at the moment</li>
            <li>This really helps when I try to measure myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tape measure is very is to use.</li>
            <li>If you are weight lifting and building muscle it can be very disheartening to look at the scale at the end of the week and not see any loss there.  </li>
            <li>it is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>They both work better than I expected.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt; to track what I eat, how much exercise and my measures.</li>
            <li>so one cannot expect too much -</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Thanks .</li>
            <li>The MyoTape makes it so much easier to do measurements by yourself.</li>
            <li>Wish I had spent more money on something of quality.</li>
            <li>The price was very affordable</li>
            <li>The tape is very handy,too.</li>
            <li>And I really like the automated measuring tape that it comes with.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s the whole matha part</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to describe here.</li>
            <li>Plus, all those electric instruments don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>So THIS is what you really want so to measure your body fat.</li>
            <li>This is a very simple to use and cheap tool that anyone can use to measure the body fat.</li>
            <li>I started the Insanity workout and wanted to know how much progress I was making</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who truly wants to know their fitness levels instead of stepping on a scale.</li>
            <li>Much easier to track my losses and gains.</li>
            <li>I am very inaccurate with the calipers, I probably wont use them (we have a scale that tracks fat%).  </li>
            <li>This is a very incorrect way to estimate how much body fat percentage you have.</li>
            <li>With this caliper he was found to have a body fat percentage of22% (Really close).</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really know what I needed.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use the calipers as much as the measuring tape.</li>
            <li>Very helpful tools in meeting my fitness and body shaping goals.&lt;br /&gt;Owning</li>
            <li>The tape was just an added bonus, really .</li>
            <li>I now know how fat I am, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>the tape works really well</li>
            <li>Very versatile measuring tool.</li>
            <li>much easier to check measurements with that tape.</li>
            <li>labeled to be the real thing but</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real mccoy.</li>
            <li>These have been very helpful in measuring my body fat and inches.  </li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use than a tailor&#x27;s tape.</li>
            <li>The MyoTape alone is worth the price of the complete set.</li>
            <li>If you want your body fat tested, get a real kit.  </li>
            <li>The body fat tester doesn&#x27;t stay clicked, so you can&#x27;t really read the results by yourself.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast and arrived intact.</li>
            <li>Very well done.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who wants to keep track of their body fat.</li>
            <li>The reading, because it was taken from the thinnest part of my body gave a reading that was MUCH too lean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really like the MyoTape.  </li>
            <li>If you are someone who is concentrating on fat loss, or muscle growth, you really need this because otherwise you really can&#x27;t tell what is going on with your body.  </li>
            <li>and I am really getting into excersing and weight lifting.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is not much to tell but I am sure this is wut</li>
            <li>For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much in this department.  </li>
            <li>I was very please with this item.  </li>
            <li>and I do not store much fat there.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure is also very convenient when trying to measure yourself.</li>
            <li>I am very unsatisfied and now I have to look for another to buy.</li>
            <li>As Americans, we rely too much on scale weight as THE measure of health.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li>are a bit high!  </li>
            <li>I really think these tools will help people in their weight loss goals.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to get what i paid for.</li>
            <li>I read the directions over and over and still don&#x27;t think i really understand how to use this.</li>
            <li>The caliber is made of such a cheap plastic that the lock doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The caliper,  is measuring so much lower than the electric hand held.  </li>
            <li>It came with a caliper for testing body fat, but isn&#x27;t very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I took the multi-point measurements, plugged it into a simple website calculator, and got a precise answer of \\&quot;18.3%\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Only using one point isn&#x27;t enough because some people carry more fat in the legs than their stomach, or some people carry more fat in their upper body than lower body, etc.</li>
            <li>Very affordable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Then then fat caliper helps some much to show you improvement.</li>
            <li>I would suggest getting higher quality metal calipers or taking many measurements with these to find an average.</li>
            <li>The directions for how to use the calipers to take a proper body fat % reading could be more clear.</li>
            <li>Using an average will make it more consistent.</li>
            <li>( I mean a really good one.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>So 1 star due to build quality on the tape, 5 stars for the accu-measure, figure 3 is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and big enough for my 250 pound girth.</li>
            <li>Especially for all those that want to watch their New Years resolutions come true!</li>
            <li>You have to pinch the skin super tight, it hurts, which would be fine if the thing worked.  </li>
            <li>This allows you to apply consistent force on the calipers and usually not cause any pain to the person being measured.  </li>
            <li>The Body Fat Tester is a little more difficult to figure out, however once you understand it, I feel like it is much more accurate than the digital kind.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to track my progress in other ways.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t spend more money on the other skinfold calipers as these can also be used for other skinfold tests requiring measurements from other parts of the body.</li>
            <li>While seeing the digital readings is very cool (sometimes disappointing, but cool...), I&#x27;m not convinced they are the most accurate.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the instructions correctly or got confused after reading too many reviews on too many different related products on Amazon, or both :)  </li>
            <li>I am not a body builder or athlete, this kit is good enough for me to track down my body fat.</li>
            <li>Took less than a few minutes to do and the results were consistent with what the gym was able to do with their supposedly better equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>The caliper works well as long as you take accurate measurements and use a tool online to determine your percentage.  </li>
            <li>Well, that isn&#x27;t true, there were instructions on how to use the actual product, but not how to figure out any results from it.  </li>
            <li>This is a good inexpensive simple way to measure your body fat percentage without resorting to the more expensive products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe this was true, especially because I started out at almost 30% body fat</li>
            <li>I really like the measuring tape, but the fat tester doesn&#x27;t come with enough instructions about where to you should take the different measurements to get a better idea of your body fat percentage.</li>
            <li>Not complicated, although difficult to keep an accurate measure through time, still is a good reference to use at a low price tag...</li>
            <li>I compared my AccuMeasure reading to a popular digital hand-held fat analyzer, and the two numbers came out to be almost exactly the same (within like .2%).</li>
            <li>I guess in hind sight, I would have used google to look for \\&quot;body fat calculator\\&quot;, but, being new to this whole fitness thing</li>
            <li>Seller was fast, everything was in new condition, no hiccups.</li>
            <li>The AccuMeasure and Myotape were just as I expected them to be-accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Both products were shipped quickly and came together in the same box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quick, simple solution if you&#x27;re wanting to get a handle (no pun intended) on your fat percentage.</li>
            <li>and you can get a decent approximation of your body fat</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>To be sure I was getting accuracy, I measured the same site 3 different times.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>Quality is decent and a must have.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still a decent deal for the tape, but I would have given 5 stars if they dropped the price and removed the body fat analysis caliper.</li>
            <li>The calipers are not very good imo, kinda flimsy and just not something I use, so its kind of a throw away gift I think.</li>
            <li>It only measures one area of your body fat, but its basic design is pretty clever and it seems to be accurate.</li>
            <li>Not really sure how accurate this is since I haven&#x27;t been able to cross check it,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both.</li>
            <li>its highly recommended in a lot of fitness websites etc etc.</li>
            <li>highly recommend you purchase this if you&#x27;ve done your research and know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s probably because of the high fat percentage on me.</li>
            <li>just have to lose a little more weight</li>
            <li>Just make sure your body isn&#x27;t retaining a ton of water, or those calipers will be of little use on your stomach.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s durable and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will break as easily as some of the other ones I tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these several times and as long as I&#x27;m using them properly, they work just fine, I just don&#x27;t enjoy what it tells me.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend got his professionally done and the calipers in this set were very close to what the professionals said.</li>
            <li>Simple straight forward and accurate especially for it cost.</li>
            <li>I like it has inch and cm, and the system to block in position is great for the difficult measurements</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not overweight, I&#x27;m just not in the shape I used to be, so buy these if you&#x27;re trying to become a professional bodybuilder and the results won&#x27;t sting as much.</li>
            <li>Tester is on point and the myotape is much easier then the old school tailor type ruler I used to use.</li>
            <li>I have read about cheap copies of this product that don&#x27;t snap very well and provide inaccurate results but we compared this to a professional one and it was pretty much dead on.</li>
            <li>If you want heavy duty calipers, you&#x27;ll have to pay more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not going to break with normal use.</li>
            <li>I rely more on calipers.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I did use it a few times after a night of drinking (which the instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t);</li>
            <li>The physical quality of these products is good, not amazing, but for this price point they&#x27;re very well constructed.    </li>
            <li>Once I had an accurate triceps measurement and had a chance to practice my other measurements, I realized I was actually getting consistent readings!  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t super excited by the result, meaning I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it was considering the measurements from other systems.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>This was inline with some handheld units and other scales I have used, so I think they work just fine.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this if you&#x27;re prone to low self-esteem, otherwise go right ahead.</li>
            <li>This makes taking some self measurements very hard to do, it would be nice if the whole thing just stayed put.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In other words - I was doing it correctly and getting accurate results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;v used Body Fat calipers before so nothing really new there</li>
            <li>The tape is the BEST every for measuring and acurracy; however, the &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; calibrater is confusing and hard to use.</li>
            <li>For the average person at home, this works just fine.</li>
            <li>Again, use the same skin calipers at the same time each day before exercise and you&#x27;ll get an accurate measurement over time.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t vouch for the overall accuracy of this caliper since I haven&#x27;t been weighed in water yet, but it&#x27;s reassuring to know that it&#x27;s accurate according to another independent source.  </li>
            <li>I brought this mainly for the waist measurement, as the caliper is too early for me to get.</li>
            <li>On advanced, more expensive calipers there is no guessing on what the measurement is.</li>
            <li>: the tape -- clever idea to have the loop and it works fine, but the retractor is glitchy and I suspect it may not last too long.</li>
            <li>This product is a basic too but very relaiable, I would really reccomend it&lt;br</li>
            <li>Measuring Tape: The tape retracts with a push of a button ensuring a nice tight fit, that won&#x27;t droop down your back (if you were measuring yours stomach).  </li>
            <li>The measurement you get is very sensitive to the exact way you grab the skin fold and apply the calipers relative to the skin fold.  </li>
            <li>The caliper will take you a couple to trys to get an average / accurate measurement.</li>
            <li>As many times as you may use these, which is not many, this is it.</li>
            <li>Using a fat caliper and getting consistent results requires some practice, and this caliper is no different.</li>
            <li>This is why it is important for us as registered dietitians to get the average of 3 skin fold</li>
            <li>Exactly what was described and what I needed to further my fitness goals</li>
            <li>It starts at 2\\&quot;, which I can understand can be compensated by the looping function of the product, but I am consistently getting larger measurements.</li>
            <li>Had to have a friend help me on this one, had never used them before and the directions were pretty simple</li>
            <li>I just wanted a simple caliper and that is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li>The caliper is of low quality, but it measure consistently too.</li>
            <li>I think it is better to go online, search for \\&quot;body fat calculator\\&quot; which will calculate your body-fat by taking into account measurements from other parts of your body (arm, thigh, back, etc).</li>
            <li>Love the tape measure I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using the calipers</li>
            <li>I was using another brand that required (4) measurements in different areas of the body and it required another person to get the readings as it did not have the scale slider that stops at the exact measurement.</li>
            <li>I bought this product a couple years ago, but have only used it a handful of times when i first bought it 2 years ago and both items are no longer functional.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a higher quality one when I start actually working with clients.</li>
            <li>The Personal body fat need a little bit to get use to it, but after you know what you are doing, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li>It took me a little bit to figure out how it worked, but it&#x27;s really easy once you figure it out.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and comes with a little guide on where you should be...</li>
            <li>Easy instructions and be a little tricky to use by yourself.  </li>
            <li>The claims about the tester was less than accurate.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use but still not accurate.</li>
            <li>FYI - female users need to take a triceps measurement, which requires the help of a second person (this is NOT a problem with the AM-3000 calipers, it&#x27;s true of ALL calipers).  </li>
            <li>It is going down daily. :)</li>
            <li>(Incidentally, the included MyoTape is very nice for taking bodily measurements, or even other round objects.)</li>
            <li>Before starting a new workout regimen I purchased this set to do semi-accurate measurements all-around.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t come with much instructions for the questions you&#x27;ll have and not very accurate you have to be extra precise.</li>
            <li>Get a regular tape measure at half the price and wiht greater versatility.</li>
            <li>I was able to get measurements within less than 1mm, every time, over several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3-6-12:</li>
            <li>However, it pulls tight and then snaps, but does not take an accurate measurement.  </li>
            <li>It is very hard to get a consistent, accurate reading, not because the product is defective or anything, it is just combersome to use and get the exact same pressure and the exact same place every time.</li>
            <li>Its been a few months and its been working fine...</li>
            <li>&quot; things that are right next to the numbers all the way to the RIGHT, then press down lightly on the calipers to measure the fat, when you hear a slight click, let go and read the numbers.</li>
            <li>Feels a little cheap but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>The fat caliper feels a little flimsy, and takes a somewhat sensitive touch to properly use it (i.e. detect/judge when the rounded plastic tip has snapped into the eye socket fitting, which dictates when you stop pinching the skin fold and check the thickness of the skin fold to determine your body fat).  </li>
            <li>they seem cheap and difficult to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>It came with clear instructions on how to take measurements.  </li>
            <li>It does not measure the same as a regular tape measure and broke real fast.</li>
            <li>Get the Body fat Calculator app by Linear software to complete the package.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve not had any problems.</li>
            <li>The body fat measurer comes with complete instructions and a lookup table to map the mm fat you pinch with body fat % for your age and gender.</li>
            <li>I was told I would get the product early November</li>
            <li>the measuring tape my kit came with started at nearly 2\\&quot; --</li>
            <li>Now, if only my body fat weren&#x27;t so high!</li>
            <li>Well, at least now I know. :-)</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve went from 25% to 15% body fat in 3 months.  </li>
            <li>My only issue is that they don&#x27;t really tell you how to use the caliper, but I already knew how to use and which part you are supposed to measure.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the locks, or clicks between measurement increments are a bit too far apart.</li>
            <li>The sheet included offers instructions instructions that are clear and a chart on what your body fat percentage is based on your readings.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the Body Fat Tester; just never seemed to work properly for me.</li>
            <li>I have it since 09/2010 and used frequently to check on my progress as I age.</li>
            <li>Tape measure so much easier than regular sewing tape measure.</li>
            <li>The measuring tape is much easier to use than a regular tape because you can hold the mark.</li>
            <li>Tape measure spring holding up so far.</li>
            <li>my body fat percentage was lower than the chart that came with this and my old unreliable scale.  </li>
            <li>Body far calipers</li>
            <li>Also, since the bolt does not lock in place I frequently had difficulties taking measures of my arms.</li>
            <li>But they are not for anyone doing this professionally.</li>
            <li>It marked me as 22%.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rely on calculations based on height and bodily measurements as they are VERY inaccurate if you have any appreciable amount of muscle mass.  </li>
            <li>This is the only caliper that I really trust.</li>
            <li>so a measurement of 6-7mm for a 40 year old man is 10.5% and 8-9mm is 12.7%.</li>
            <li>So, I used the directions on a couple of different fitness websites: Pinch up as much skin/fat as you can, without pinching the muscle or getting muscle into the measurement.  </li>
            <li>My only thing is that you can&#x27;t really tell if you&#x27;re squeezing 12 or 11 centimeters on the caliper, but that&#x27;s how the chart is organized.  </li>
            <li>The real problem is I was using it to track progress for several weeks before I realized it.</li>
            <li>If I squeeze the caliper completely shut it gauges to about 6 mm.</li>
            <li>Was off by 6% compared to professional fat loss test....</li>
            <li>This chart tells you to pinch one area of your body, above the hip bone, when in reality you need to pinch a few others to get better results.</li>
            <li>Not too complicated to learn how to use, intuitive but good manual and network offer.</li>
            <li>Tape is good, calipers are useless until you&#x27;re sub 15% bf</li>
            <li>The product is a good buy for casual users.</li>
            <li>and it is still a plain tape and not some magical digital device, but it still feels somewhat inaccurate at times.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a little off, it won&#x27;t make a significant difference.  </li>
            <li>The tape measure, on the other hand, worked as expected, appears and feels to be a decent quality product, and was easy to use to measure the circumference of my thighs, arms, chest, etc.</li>
            <li>Cool, but my tape measure came with the tape half ripped out of the plastic end....</li>
            <li>instructions come on a single, two-sided card and are pretty straight-forward.</li>
            <li>Plus I am not sure how accurate it is to begin with as it came back as a much lower body fat percentage than I would have guessed.</li>
            <li>You definitely need practice to begin getting accurate, or at least consistent measurements.</li>
            <li>Other reviews have listed websites that are useful for getting accurage measurements.  </li>
            <li>The Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester is very accurate and gives me the same results ( plus or minus .5% )as my digital scale when it measures my body fat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a personal trainer and Fitness Technician, I&#x27;ve used all sorts of gadgets and some of them get pretty fancy and some of them are basic.  </li>
            <li>By the way, down 2% body fat since I started getting back in shape and keeping accurate measurements with this.</li>
            <li>caliper is a little weak but is a great product</li>
            <li>Not sure how accurate the skin pincher is</li>
            <li>I thought it would be easy for a single person to use, given the way it the loose end loops around the body and clips back into the rest of the tape measure.</li>
            <li>The one chart that comes with this set is a little too basic to give you an accurate percentage.</li>
            <li>My husband and I recentely started a new fitness journey and wanted a simple at-home way to check our progress and results.</li>
            <li>I use to be really skinny (95 lb, 5.02 tall, small frame) but put a lot of weight after I got married (175 lb)</li>
            <li>Also, the tape has a handle retrieval and locking mechanism, which while very simple, makes measurements much easier (especially by yourself).</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what else to say except that I wish the guide for the Personal Fat Tester was in larger print.</li>
            <li>- it makes it so much easier to measure yourself, especially in places like the thighs and upper arms.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for a while and messed around with them at first to get the hang of them, but they are extremely helpful with keeping track of fitness progress.</li>
            <li>The major issue is the part that is supposed to click.  </li>
            <li>calipers are easy to use, but difficult to get consistent results with.  </li>
            <li>This was kind of confusing to figure out, the instructions are clear but it is harder to do, which the instructions actually state.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, there is nothing to keep the tape connected to the handle except gravity so unless you&#x27;re holding the tape right side up, it&#x27;s pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s hard to give accurate results.</li>
            <li>The body fat pincher is a bit cheaply made but at this price I hardly hold it against it.</li>
            <li>Tape measure is cheap, its hard to use because the tape will slip and you cant measure with it.</li>
            <li>The shipping arrived on time,  and good conditions, the accu measure  its difficult to use, probably if you are very fat woks, but for people with just a little bit over weight not.</li>
            <li>If you are a high performance athlete I could see where more costly tools might be called for, but for the vast majority there is no good reason to buy anything more expensive than these.</li>
            <li>I was at first skeptical that the AccuMeasure would be so accurate with just one skinfold measurement.</li>
            <li>I have nothing to compare the results but at least it is cheap and</li>
            <li>These work as described and give my a general idea of my bodyfat trends.  </li>
            <li>Definitely is a plus if you&#x27;re embarrassed to ask others or dont have friends comfortable with pinching you body fat (it does sound a bit awkward).  </li>
            <li>But in general, i like this product and recommend this.</li>
            <li>They are a cheap and affordable way to help you in your weight/fitness goals, and, since you can measure yourself, nobody else has to know how big or small</li>
            <li>The calipers indicate proper pressure for measurement intuitively, but the instructions for the location aren&#x27;t clear to me.</li>
            <li>I get different readings when I use an old fashioned measuring tape.</li>
            <li>I only give 4 stars because the MyoTape has already become warped near the chuck at the end of the tape.  </li>
            <li>caliper feels like it could break at any second, thus far it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It is kind of difficult to use these on yourself.  </li>
            <li>In the past, I had always used digital and they would always break, including my body fat scale which is totally unreliable for accurate measurements.</li>
            <li>the body fat caliper is very small and cheap.</li>
            <li>the plastic handle off the tape measure tore off the other day as i gently pulled it out</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;ll be buying something a little more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions and confirmed without a doubt that I am a fat ass that needs to lose some serious weight.</li>
            <li>Takes a little practice, but after a few tries, it&#x27;s pretty easy to confirm how fat you are with relative precision.</li>
            <li>I went into a store the other day and saw this EXACT same caliper for $15.00... and that was only for the caliper alone!</li>
            <li>It may take a little practice to get consistent.  </li>
            <li>I was first concerned that if I didn&#x27;t purchase a digital (more expensive!)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hard to measure exactly the same spot twice or even to know that you&#x27;re exactly at the halfway point.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not an issue specific to this product; it just seems to come with the territory of calipers in general.</li>
            <li>Both function well, but are generally somewhat flimsy and low tech.  </li>
            <li>Simple process of making a loop, putting desired body part through (I guess anything goes O.O), hitting the retract button, then taking the measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, the caliper is worth the small price I paid - and the tape measure can be seen as a bonus.</li>
            <li>I found this particular body fat measurer difficult to use and I am unsure how accurate it is.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not getting consistent readings, you may need to practice a little more (you may be measuring in slightly different spots or at the wrong point on the skin fold).  </li>
            <li>We ended up just measuring each other, which is what we would do with a normal tape measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The tool itself was easy to use (although a little painful as most calipers are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Unfortunately this item is very accurate.</li>
            <li>Makes it kinda tough to get a grip on an accurate measurement.</li>
            <li>too bad, the design could be good.</li>
            <li>Tape is good, caliper is quite bad.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> so you cant expect the best for that price.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent way to stay motivated because you can see your progress!</li>
            <li> The best part is the myotape that comes with it.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s about time i purchased a measure, and i&#x27;m really happy i did.</li>
            <li> Great items, the caliper is sturdy and great quality.</li>
            <li> The Myo Tape is great it makes measuring yourself easier.  </li>
            <li> Great price for 2 items</li>
            <li> Both of these items work great.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great there is something inexpensive to aid in measuring body fat via calipers but</li>
            <li> But The Tape Is Great &amp; For The Price</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is great.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was great and all, but i didn&#x27;t like that the tape measurer started off almost at 2 inches..</li>
            <li> Works and i&#x27;m happy with the quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> should* be a really great, inexpensive way to self-measure; but the retractor broke immediately.</li>
            <li> This set is a great way to get started monitoring your percentage of body fat.</li>
            <li> Great value for the buck</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great instrument for you to keep track of your body fat lose.</li>
            <li> These two items are great for keeping an eye on the amount of fat lost, rather than going by the bathroom scale alone and having fluctuating results.</li>
            <li> They both work great</li>
            <li> This works great.  </li>
            <li> Tape measurement works great and holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way to know fat loos vs muscle gain.</li>
            <li> The tape measure I think works great</li>
            <li> Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> A great tool to keep track of your progress in fitness</li>

            <li> This was inexpensive and has been a great tool in shaping my body.</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase for the money</li>
            <li> Great tool for fitness tracking.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s great for measuring bicep, chest, leg girth without having to fight with a tailors tape measure).  </li>
            <li> Great for the prices as well.  </li>
            <li> The myo tape works great.  </li>
            <li> The Myotape is great for taking measurements when you don&#x27;t have a partner to assist -</li>
            <li> A great combination in trying to manage and monitor body composition</li>
            <li> But it works great</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> LOL</li>
            <li> This tester and tape are great.</li>
            <li> For under $10 this is a great deal.</li>

            <li> Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Great measurement and accuracy</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have while in the process of losing weight or maintaining.</li>
            <li> for the myotape -- it is a great tool and the fact that it comes with the caliber is great.  </li>
            <li> Great product, Work Great</li>
            <li> works great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for testing your body fat percentage.</li>
            <li> Gave it five stars because it does what&#x27;s supposed to do and works great.</li>
            <li> This would be a great product to use to measure your biceps by yourself.</li>
            <li> Great tool to help you keep on track with your fitness</li>
            <li> Awesome tool for measuring on your own.  </li>
            <li> great for tracking progress</li>
            <li> Not so great in practice.</li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> but the tape is great.</li>
            <li> The measuring tool was great, but the calipers we&#x27;re spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great product if all you need is to measure your % body fat.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> great package, great product, timely delivery</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and the materials are of excellent quality.  </li>
            <li> Very accurate tape and the best thing</li>
            <li> I have used it successfully now for almost two years, and have targeted and rid myself of problem areas by doing so.</li>
            <li> loving it!..</li>
            <li> The myotape, however, it excellent for measuring circumferences and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> If it is actually accurate - this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> Both the MyoTape and body fat tester work perfectly out of the box and have given me accurate measurements.  </li>
            <li> not so good either; I doubt the accuracy of these - feels so plastic-y</li>
            <li> The good thing was it was so inexpensive that I had no guilt over tossing it into the garbage can.</li>
            <li> good for calipering of problem areas.  </li>
            <li> Good way to track the quality of your progress</li>
            <li> Product is good as described.</li>
            <li> good idea and price</li>
            <li> Good</li>
            <li> calipers are probably also great--they feel like good quality--</li>
            <li> but you can find good info online.</li>
            <li> The one good thing about this item is the measuring tape.</li>
            <li> The tape i just as good.</li>
            <li> Good price, good qualify...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> This is a good tool to measure body fat.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m good at percentages, just not this form of percentages.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and the quality is good.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> The MyoTape is a good build though.</li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a really good one.</li>
            <li> But, the cost and quality are good for the price.</li>
            <li> the measuring tape is good if you are measuring yourself.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any good</li>
            <li> everything works perfectly and the price is amazingly cheap considering in a store</li>
            <li> Caliper doesnt work that good...</li>
            <li> Good price, but measuring tape is a hassle to do if your by yourself</li>
            <li> The caliper on this is good but the tape is not.  </li>
            <li> A good product for the prize.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> good reminder that im still fat.</li>
            <li> and it fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> like this set also because the price is good.</li>
            <li> Good Price too.</li>
            <li> but they are good for the price</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> good deal though.</li>
            <li> I wanted the caliper, but thought that this combo was a good value.  </li>
            <li> Once you hear the click your good.</li>
            <li> This $9.10 (free shipping) purchase is one of the best investments that I&#x27;ve made along my fat loss journey.</li>
            <li> It gives good measurement.</li>
            <li> This was a good product for the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good, affordable caliper and measurement tape.</li>
            <li> Good products for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price though.</li>
            <li> It is pretty awesome though, including the measuring tape, that is also awesome. :)</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li> The calipers are very simple to use and although they might not be the best of the best, they get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is actually great and from what I heard, this is very accurate.</li>
            <li> It looks cheap but works very good.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the AccuMeasure MyoTape MT05</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with both of these products.  </li>
            <li> Great for measuring fat people at work, fat people love to know how fat they are.</li>
            <li> The calipers are okay, nothing great, but again, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great, could include some more literature</li>
            <li> The tape measure works great, love it.  </li>
            <li> chart that comes with it isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;m not going to deduct a star for that since you can find a better chart on line for free.</li>
            <li> Love both products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I love the results of this caliper, but that&#x27;s not the caliper&#x27;s fault!  </li>
            <li> I have 5% more to go!</li>
            <li> I love that I can use the MyoTape to measure myself and I don&#x27;t have to have anyone do the measuring for me, since I don&#x27;t want anyone else to see the results!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize, it&#x27;s what I needed for a great price, and I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone needing a set of easy to use skinfold calipers and girth measuring tools.</li>
            <li> its easy to use and works great.  </li>
            <li> I think the tape measure is a great idea, and you can measure by yourself (though it&#x27;s not that easy).  </li>
            <li> The caliper is great, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Instructions are easy to follow having the tape measure was great as well.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great spreadsheet out there you can use, along with these tools, to get fairly accurate measurements.</li>
            <li> its amazing the difference you see even if you don&#x27;t lose any pounds on the scale.  </li>
            <li> The fat tester is great and it gives accurate measurement of body fat.</li>
            <li> The two combined make a nice fitness toolkit to help measure your progress.</li>
            <li> I liked that part, but the body fat tester is a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the calipers as much as I liked the tape measure.</li>
            <li> The product comes with a guide on how to convert the pinch measurements to body fat %, but honestly, I cannot evaluate the ease of making the conversion, I use an online calculator and just plug the values in.</li>
            <li> The tape measure is nice too because I can take my own measurements without having to have someone help me with a measuring tape now.</li>
            <li> The measurement tape is definitely handy</li>
            <li> Once you made the measurement, you have to move the indicator to get the measurement, the tester does not do it on its own as claimed.</li>
            <li> much appreciative of the quickness and ease of buying.</li>
            <li> measuring tape was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> chart was nice</li>
            <li> -- If you know what you are doing, I am sure this is a perfectly good tool, based on everything that I have read.</li>
            <li> Nice to have around for measuring progress.</li>
            <li> I like and these two items come in handy for taking your own measurements as well as others in my group.</li>
            <li> if you use it correctly 3-Is all you need to do the job You can just buy the Caliper itself without the measuring tape, hwever the tape is handy and locks in place.</li>
            <li> Nice just to throw in the gym bag and log your results.</li>
            <li> The tape is a nice addition since it can lock in place.</li>
            <li> The wrap-around tape measure fits nicely into a slot to hold it into place while you read the measurement.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and items were perfectly packed.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and work amazingly well for the price!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these calipers and make sure that you read the directions how to use them.  </li>
            <li> While the most accurate measurements I have seen come of the multi-site pinch test (like 5 or so pinches on arms, legs, chest, etc...), this is a great at-home DIY tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to start keeping more detailed measurements of your body, this is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> These are great and accurate tools that everyone into fitness and/or a healthy lifestyle should have.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and of good quality.</li>
            <li> Have used it in a classroom setting at the university and students loved how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Good Quality, Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The calipers seem good and the tape measure is easy to use, but the instructions weren&#x27;t all that helpful for measuring body fat.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use by yourself.</li>
            <li> The pin holder on the tape measure makes it very easy.  </li>
            <li> Well made, bonus tape measure makes self measurements very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and read.  </li>
            <li> The spring loaded mechanism makes it very easy to use one handed.</li>
            <li> it makes it very easy.  </li>
            <li> Makes it very easy to take measurements without assistance.</li>
            <li> It makes it very easy to do self-measurements.  </li>
            <li> The measuring tape is very easy as well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and calculate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was able to use the fat tester right away with brilliant results.</li>
            <li> but I honestly believe I&#x27;m more like 14%.</li>
            <li> but I think I liked the measuring tape more than the fat tester.</li>
            <li> These would not be a good fit for those planning to use it twice a day for an year..</li>
            <li> as for the calipers I struggled getting a good accurate reading with.</li>
            <li> Not as accurate as I hoped, but good for the price</li>
            <li> but it sure as hell will keep you honest about it.</li>
            <li> caliper and measuring tape worked good and gave an accurate measurement when used with 3 point body fat testing</li>
            <li> wrap the tape around your waist, arm or leg, click it into the socket on the handle, and when you press the button it will retract to where you can take a good accurate measurement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is really cheap for what you get, and that makes this a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The price is really cheap for what you get, and that makes this a good deal.  </li>
            <li> Price was right and it works great for me and my clients.</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Easy to use!</li>
            <li> BUT - this is so easy to use!  </li>
            <li> Great way to keep track of your progress when the scale isn&#x27;t changing much!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> works great does exactly what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Got here in great time and is exactly what i needed for the Navy BCAs.</li>
            <li> Is exactly as described at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can now easily figure out my body fat percentage!</li>
            <li> the locking mechanism means you get very accurate measurements every time.</li>
            <li> You get a very accurate measurement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen and they are very cheap.</li>
            <li> It does what it is meant to do and is very cheap.</li>
            <li> An easy way to measure your own inches.</li>
            <li> The handy pocket size guide to easy to read and understand....</li>
            <li> The Myotape is very cheap, but it&#x27;s ok for someone looking for a first-time kit, for the price.</li>
            <li> The tape measure works just fine and is handy for getting your body dimensions by yourself.</li>
            <li> Great tool and super useful!</li>
            <li> I like using this, as accurate as it can be!</li>
            <li> Save time and frustration by getting a more durable instrument.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be 100% sure on the accuracy</li>
            <li> Love the Mayo Tape.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought them together.</li>
            <li> I love the myotape.</li>
            <li> The tape measure is an excellent addition especially if you have to measure tricky areas like your arms.  </li>
            <li> I needed more than just measuring my weight since I am trying to build muscle and having the caliper lets me do that,  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> Too many folds now.</li>
            <li> so, then I am more like 11.5% fat instead of the 9.6%</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure every MyoTape isn&#x27;t like mine.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent personal body fat tester kit for the price you pay for it.  </li>
            <li> My advice for you just take it :).</li>
            <li> and I love the tape measure</li>
            <li> The clicks are separated by 1 inch increments, so you won&#x27;t get any more accuracy than 1 inch increments (25mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The calipers also provide a more stable reading than my Tanita conductivity based scale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even comes with a measuring tape, makes it all better.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend looking into a better set of calipers.</li>
            <li> If you are into body building, you are going to love these.  </li>
            <li> The Fat Measure Is Ok</li>
            <li> It would be better if the measuring tape stopped every cm.</li>
            <li> My favorite item is the MyoTape.</li>
            <li> So really the tape is not that great...</li>
            <li> If you buy this set, be sure to go online and download better body fat charts and tips on measuring.</li>
            <li> The plastic is more sturdy</li>
            <li> Was able to get all of the measurements that I need.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to make sure that I was losing fat and not muscle.  </li>
            <li> Better instructions for use can be found online.</li>
            <li> It would have been better if there a bit closer.</li>
            <li> Liked it for a cheap solution to measuring your body fat..</li>
            <li> I did google more places to measure on you</li>
            <li> body then in the instructions and feel like it is a better number than what is give from the instructions.</li>
            <li> The accumeasure worked okay for measuring fat.</li>
            <li> Wish i had more ...</li>
            <li> this is kind of light weight and flimsy</li>
            <li> Not too many ways to measure fat percentage at home.</li>
            <li> and i am glad for the internet.</li>
            <li> Love the myotape measurer.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :) :)</li>
            <li> Measured myself, checked the chart, and it says I&#x27;m sexy.  </li>
            <li> I use the tape most often.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was more durable - either heavier stock paper or laminated.</li>
            <li> I love being able to measure my arms with out having someone help me.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift and it was enjoyed</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> The tape measure works great but feels as if it will break if not used gently.  </li>
            <li> I love this measuring tape.  </li>
            <li> we figured it out, it made a lot more sense.</li>
            <li> I rest better at night knowing my information is protected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is very simple to use, no it isn&#x27;t perfect, but again it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this, but was just beginning to look at monitoring my body fat percentage and wanted something inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this set because I wanted a better method of measuring my body fat than the percentage listed on my scale.  </li>
            <li> The tape measurer I value the most, definitely better than a sewing measurer.</li>
            <li> As for the actual measuring: The biggest challenge was to perfect the measuring technique.  </li>
            <li> I do love that</li>
            <li> body fat caliper is slightly more intricate/complicated to use.</li>
            <li> Basically, make sure to read the included instructions before measuring.</li>
            <li> i get a better reading</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> the body fat percentage can jump by 2% or more per line on the graph, and the graph is in 2mm segments.</li>
            <li> I love the measuring tape and the ease of the use.</li>
            <li> I also used fat % charts from some reputable fitness websites - the charts that came with the calipers</li>
            <li> I suggest Youtube for more information on how to use it rather than the index card sized instructions they provide.</li>
            <li> I love this tape measure because you can measure yourself.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not all that skilled with calipers</li>
            <li> and i was hoping for a better measure than this.</li>
            <li> Try getting a better one</li>
            <li> Love the MyoTape.  </li>
            <li> Love the tape measure.</li>
            <li> The calipers are ok though.</li>
            <li> i love this product.....  </li>
            <li> The MyoTape works well, but these are the lousiest, most flimsy calipers ever.  </li>
            <li> This worked much better for me than the ballpark number I get from the enclosed card and one</li>
            <li> I ended up looking it up online to see a better explanation of the chart based off of the series of measurements rather than just 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do love the tape measure that it comes with.</li>
            <li> I feel that the more points you use, the better because you get more accuracy.</li>
            <li> People have differences, and using more skinfold sites can account for these differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mostly just bought it for the skinfold caliper, so I do not plan on using the tape</li>
            <li> but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, so you have to pay close attention to make sure you know when it closes together.  </li>
            <li> The tape works ok too.  </li>
            <li> a good buy, gotta master the pinch but worth it</li>
            <li> So many times I looked at the weight &amp; it just didn&#x27;t change compared to two&lt;br /&gt;weeks</li>
            <li> I seem to be gaining more muscle, so am not seeing any downward movement on the scale.  </li>
            <li> Works Great price and fast shipment.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to use and easy to read.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to measure with the metope since it is designed to stay in a circle, which is very nice for forearm, chest, calves,</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to use if you are measuring body fat, very easy to use and instructions are clear.</li>
            <li> It is very nice and  useful, for me it is my correct choice, and in addtion it is original (made in USA), just read instruction and take all measurment and it will be correct.  </li>
            <li> Being able to grasp the suprailiac skinfold for bodyfat measurements takes some practice, but the quality of the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The caliper takes some skill to use accurately, but the tape is very easy indeed.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and accurate, too.  </li>
            <li> is you can use it on your own to get easy and accurate measurements.</li>
            <li> The caliper is very accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The caliper is all plastic and should be treated with care, but if used properly is very accurate and easy to use.     </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very accurate.</li>
            <li> I use it to measure my waist and it does a pretty good job on that.</li>
            <li> With practice, reading accuracy is around +- 1-2mm which corresponds to about +- 0.8-1.6% which is still pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Item works pretty good, I would recommend this to anyone who trying to keep an eye on their body fat measurements.</li>
            <li> I can still get it to work, but fair warning for those that have it happen on the first try.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and, most importantly, is easy to use ACCURATELY.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this in the mail!</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re measuring by yourself, you can do it easily and accurately!</li>
            <li> The calipers are easy to use and the measurement of them is ballpark accurate!</li>
            <li> It is easy to tell when you have applied the appropriate amount of pressure in measuring because it clicks into place.  </li>
            <li> Love the tape measure, make it easy to do the measurements for yourself.</li>
            <li> Goes up to 60 inches so it will be able to fit around MOST peoples waists/chests.</li>
            <li> Looked cheap, didn&#x27;t think the caliper would be very accurate.</li>
            <li> The slider on the caliper makes it perfectly easy to read your own results while using these products alone, and the auto retract feature on the tape is a quick and efficient way to make sure you&#x27;re getting accurate readings.</li>
            <li> this package you get the calipers and a MyoTape tape measure which allows you to lock the tape measure in place for more accurate readings.  </li>
            <li> it helps you track your progress more efficiently and accurately than the body fat scale.</li>
            <li> BUT all you have to do to make it more accurate is</li>
            <li> hardest part is making sure that you measure accurately and correctly each time.</li>
            <li> In order to get a more accurate body fat percentage, the person must be doing a triceps skinfold AND subscapular skinfold.</li>
            <li> Much more accurate than the electronic ones.</li>
            <li> might be the most accurate of all, I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> I was able to accurately gauge my body fat.</li>
            <li> I have a scale that shows body fat percentage but wasn&#x27;t sure that it was accurate</li>
            <li> After doing some research, i decided calipers would be the most accurate at home method i could use.  </li>
            <li> For a more accurate result, i suggest searching online for a multi-point measurement instead of the one location measurement the chart says.  </li>
            <li> I still suggest using multi-point measurements and a website to run the numbers in order to have a more accurate assessment of your body fat.  </li>
            <li> I still suggest using multi-point measurements and a website to run the numbers in order to have a more accurate assessment of your body fat.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find the two products together for a great deal as I needed a measuring tape too.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s much better measuring protocols online for free.</li>
            <li> With the measurements of the more advanced caliper when I brought him into our campus clinic, it was found he has a body fat percentage of 21%.</li>
            <li> I was not planning on buying the myotape, it just came with the calipers, but when i got it and used it, it was amazingly simple and brilliant.</li>
            <li> Percentage of body fat is MUCH more important.  </li>
            <li> The measurement chart could be more precise.</li>
            <li> The calipers are all plastic, so there is probably some change with time, but there are good for keeping track of progress which is what really matters anyway.  </li>
            <li> the measuring tape is nice however and makes it worth buying.</li>
            <li> but it is definitly a good start for anybody who wants to track their progress.</li>
            <li> Easy, cheap, and accurate!</li>
            <li> The fat checker as I call it, is easy to use and is more accurate than figuring your BMI by just height and weight.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, no need more than that to check your body fat!&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I love being able to get an accurate measurement because I can wrap the tape around my body parts without needing help from someone else to make sure I&#x27;m doing it right.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, but I feel like the measurements might be innaccurate.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to use, but</li>
            <li> The Myotape and Accu-Measure are both easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the chart that comes with the kit, and the fat tester is easy to read.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy as it looks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and works well.</li>
            <li> Now it could just be me, but I don&#x27;t find it to be all that easy.</li>
            <li> The caliper is easy to use and he could tell me his body fat percentage within 5 minutes of taking it out of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> tape measure wasn&#x27;t as easy.</li>
            <li> It is actually easy to do</li>
            <li> I looked online, but it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I thought it would be, there weren&#x27;t any additional instructions on the manufacturers web site.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Has marker tab which makes using without help extremely easy.  </li>
            <li> However it pops out easily while trying to make the measurement.  </li>
            <li> but the MyoTape is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li> This measuring tape is easy to use and functions as it described.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> the body caliper has helpful, easy to follow instructions and the measuring tape is easy to use by myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, the instruc card explains everything</li>
            <li> Easy to use and helpful.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape makes self-measuring easy, since it just locks into place, and can retract with the push of a button.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I can measure body fat easily.</li>
            <li> On the bright side, the tape measure seems decent and you can use it with one hand, like for measuring biceps.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, and comes with the instructions, and was recommended by the author of \\&quot;Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle\\&quot;, Tom Venuto.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to use and compact</li>
            <li> convenient and easy to use</li>
            <li> The MyoTape makes it really easy to measure your body without help:  </li>
            <li> Really easy to use, however, the chart for correlating the measurements to body fat levels might be off...</li>
            <li> MyoTape is easy to use also.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy the measure waist, arms and whatever else easily by yourself.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to use for measuring yourself.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of practice to get it right, but very happy with the overall performance of both these items.</li>
            <li> But the tape works perfect and I enjoy seeing and knowing my muscles are growing where I want them, and other parts are shrinking where I want them to.</li>
            <li> Easy way to get accurate measurements.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, accurate, inexpensive and a device that I will use for years to come.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to accurately measure muscles size.</li>
            <li> It works the way it supposed to and has an easy to read chart that comes along with it and instructions of how to accurately use it.</li>
            <li> Seems accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Pros: Inexpensive, accurate and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> This is just an easy to use and accurate set of body measurement tools.</li>
            <li> The advantage to the tool is that it easily and accurately performs the fat pinch test.  </li>
            <li> The tape measurer is cool too -- now I can track my measurements over time a bit more accurately.</li>
            <li> but it does the job just fine.  </li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure is fine.</li>
            <li> The calipers are fine.</li>
            <li> the accu-measure still works fine though</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and it does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and it&#x27;ll work fine.</li>
            <li> Both sets have worked fine for me.</li>
            <li> : I purchased these calipers 5 years ago and I still have them and they work fine.</li>
            <li> The % body fat measure came with less than perfect instructions.</li>
            <li> Fine for a one time, or home use type scenario.</li>
            <li> (it is plastic after all) but still works perfectly fine.  </li>
            <li> The caliper works fine once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure is perfect for self-measuring; it&#x27;s got a spring that winds up the tape measure or draws it tight.  </li>
            <li> Be advised that a PERFECT bodyfat reading is very tricky even with advanced equipment, but you don&#x27;t need perfect -- I take 5 readings every Sunday, average them, and use that to help figure my calorie intake for the next week.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Cheap little plastic tool that works just perfectly!</li>
            <li> It works fairly well, but I also ordered the Slim Guide caliper and liked that a little better.</li>
            <li> but it seems accurate.  </li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure measure tabs are not as accurate as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> with the MyoTape was a huge added bonus.</li>
            <li> The myo tape does not measure accurately as it the tape measure itself begins at 2 inches and 3 centimeters, which in turn requires me to do the math to determine the correct measurement.</li>
            <li> I purchased the items for accurate measurements for a nutrition program.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an accurate measuring tool for body fat and muscle size.</li>
            <li> one that the results wouldn&#x27;t be accurate-</li>
            <li> is that the scale may not be accurate.</li>
            <li> the body fat calipers and the tape measure enables me to have an accurate understanding of my progress.</li>
            <li> For measuring one spot on the body it is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li> Fairly accurate for a plastic caliper.  </li>
            <li> Learn to use it and take accurate measurements, so you know your body/fat proportions in relation to your weight.</li>
            <li> and I figured it might be useful some day when I wanted more accurate readings.  </li>
            <li> I got this to get an accurate measure of my body fat.</li>
            <li> The instructions that come with this don&#x27;t seem to be all that accurate or reliable.  </li>
            <li> Two inches on someone&#x27;s waist is a huge difference.</li>
            <li> However, my partner wanted to accurately measure her body fat as well</li>
            <li> We use a lot of online sources for additional test sites to gauge accurate body fat.  </li>
            <li> In my case, it was a huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> Seems fairly accurate</li>
            <li> so you can get accurate measurements.</li>
            <li> Accurate results</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s accurate</li>
            <li> I tried to use it and immediately noticed that you could not caliper under 10 mm,  which is a huge problem.  </li>
            <li> It is not as accurate as I hoped</li>
            <li> As accurate as it can be.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is</li>
            <li> If you need something extremely accurate, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> This is a cheap caliper</li>
            <li> Its cheap, but gets the job done for personel use.  </li>
            <li> The myotape is great compared to using a regular tape.</li>
            <li> The material is cheap, but I knew that from he beginning.</li>
            <li> This caliper is great for use with external BMI calculators.</li>
            <li> I recommend getting either a more professional caliper with better instructions or a scale that measures fat (check reviews for the most accurate one).</li>
            <li> am not saying don&#x27;t buy these - there is nothing else in this price range - and it is worth getting them with the tape measure, but it did make me hungry to buy a better pair.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, so i can finally keep track of my &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; and my &amp;#34;bulks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The tape measure is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cheap feeling, but works</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price :)</li>
            <li> I ordered and had the items shipped for free.</li>
            <li> However the tape measure alone is worth the cost of this product, so if you want to try calipers i would suggest this for sure.</li>
            <li> works great... is simple to use and requires no fuss..</li>
            <li> Lightly built from plastic,  </li>
            <li> The measuring tape is a great tool especially when you want to see where you are losing those inches.</li>
            <li> The tape is amazing and really simplifies the process of taking body measurements.</li>
            <li> And they are precise.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap and could break.</li>
            <li> Get this if you need a cheap caliper for school.</li>
            <li> Looked in the mirror and confirmed said sexiness.</li>
            <li> Cheap, plastic, but does the job.</li>
            <li> The tape works great but the calipers (the reason I ordered the product) are totally inconsistent.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have commented on the \\&quot;cheap plastic\\&quot; this caliper is made of.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s cheap plastic -</li>
            <li> Great for a very low price.  </li>
            <li> I am still learning how to get really smooth</li>
            <li> but I decided to give it a try since hydrostatic weighing isn&#x27;t available in my area</li>
            <li> cause it has a button that you can push that retracts the tape after you secure the end in a holder</li>
            <li> Incredibly cheap and innacurate device.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this product has such great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Important things to remember</li>
            <li> This set is compact and light, so I can bring it during travel.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool if used with the proper instructions and calculations.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s into sports, fit life, and body building.</li>
            <li> I know that calipers/impedance measuring devices are not the most accurate, but if you get consistent readings over a period of time it is easy to see the % change when dieting/bulking.</li>
            <li> Tape Measure is wonderful, durable, the calipers is pretty flimsy and doesn&#x27;t look like its going to hold up very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to get consistent results with this, which is what counts most when you&#x27;re trying to lose fat.</li>
            <li> but I recieved it 5 days earlier and with free shipping!!!</li>
            <li> So it is very useful.  </li>
            <li> Very useful caliper and tape measure.</li>
            <li> Perhaps very good users of this can get value out of it, but I think it just gives a very rough idea.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something quick and easy to determine my body fat.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure makes it easy to take and read your measurements, and the quality it adequate for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all cheap plastic, but no need for any special expense here.  </li>
            <li> Good: simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It measures pretty accurately and they will never lie to you!  </li>
            <li> This caliper works great for measurements but the reference chart they give you is very inaccurate, mostly because they only have you measure from your abdominals.  </li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for, nothing more and nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This helped us measure our bodies more consistently with our BMI.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with this set because I had them before but lost them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these items for a couple of months and, while I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using the calipers correctly, I have to say that the Myo Tape is absolutely awesome.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency: Accuracy aside, calipers give me the most consistent reading.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the price!    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique shape contours to the body and</li>
            <li> Pretty inexpensive and ok for the price.  </li>
            <li> The online calculator and this caliper have matched within 0.5% every time I&#x27;ve compared them, so my confidence in the accuracy of this product has gone up significantly.</li>
            <li> Good tool for tracking weight loss and general health</li>
            <li> The tape measure is great also because it stays tight to your skin and reads accurately!</li>
            <li> but once you figure it out it is very easy to use and very handy for measuring certain areas where you&#x27;d normally need another person to do it for you, thanks to the quick snap end.  </li>
            <li> The calipers are better at detecting body changes than the tape measure as they provide a more sensitive measure.  </li>
            <li> seller shipped it quickly and cheaply</li>
            <li> I used the caliper to check my BF pretty regularly and it is a accurate as the measurements I&#x27;ve had done at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the tape measure to self-measure for a custom wetsuit and it worked great.</li>
            <li> These calipers work just fine and the myotape is extremely useful.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special about this product.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing special per se about this body caliper, it does do the job.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an inexpensive weight measuring tool that works for the right price, this is it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously this isn&#x27;t as accurate as the more scientific tests that require a lab, but for the price, it&#x27;s a decent approximation.</li>
            <li> Its just to get a decent gauge of your fat (although i don&#x27;t know why I felt there would be more data available with these).  </li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed when i got this little thing.</li>
            <li> Pretty straightforward and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, and the measuring tape makes it so much easier to take your own measurements.  </li>
            <li> The tape is more accurate and easier to use than normal measuring tape.</li>
            <li> Good product, more accurate than many more expensive options.</li>
            <li> It took about three seconds to master the use of these sweet products, and now I can confirm the fact that I&#x27;m slim and athletic any time I need to.</li>
            <li> They give you basic instructions on use and its a good way to keep track of your size and fat %.  </li>
            <li> The tape is so cool.</li>
            <li> I actually use the tape in conjunction with a decent scale to get great and easy results.</li>
            <li> So this is a good buy and definitely recommend purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> Good enough for now!</li>
            <li> and I think i will really like it more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+Calipers provide a nice audible click when measurement is complete.</li>
            <li> For me it is much easier and better to use the scale that I purchased as well.</li>
            <li> To keep it short, I don&#x27;t think putting the scale in increments of 10 for mm is a good idea.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to get more careful with what I eat and both of these are excellent tools for tracking your progress.</li>
            <li> I use this for 7 and 9 point bodyfat tests, and nothing beats the tried and true caliper method.  </li>
            <li> a true 5 stars product and</li>
            <li> this thing is cool.</li>
            <li> the myotape is cool too.</li>
            <li> i did not want to invest much and works ok for my needs.</li>
            <li> tape works fantastically well, only good things to say about that.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of doing skin fold measurements, but this low cost caliper is up to the task and the MyoTape measuring tape makes the job of taking girth measurements a good bit easier.</li>
            <li> especially I got it for a good price.</li>
            <li> Love the tape; it makes keeping metrics on my body that much easier.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the low cost.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a cool tape measure that also can be used solo</li>
            <li> Probably not the gold standard but a good way to track progress.</li>
            <li> not bad.</li>
            <li> this Accumeasure bundle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.  </li>
            <li> this Accumeasure bundle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.  </li>
            <li> &quot; rather quickly when you press the button and is kind of loud.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to track my progess and this is easy to use and nice to see inches go down instead of just looking at a scale.</li>
            <li> Cheap construction , clicker doesnt click right.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but the price was right.</li>
            <li> If you do it right, it&#x27;s accurate to within 1%.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and is consistent in its measurements.</li>
            <li> but it is easy to use and seems to work consistently.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and great for keeping track of body fat when you&#x27;re trying to lose a few pounds.</li>
            <li> Obviously, if you want to get the most accurate reading, you need to go to a facility with the proper machines to measure you, but this works great for measuring week-to-week progress during body recomp.</li>
            <li> It provides an accurate body fat measurement, which is more useful when trying to get in shape than your actual weight many times.</li>
            <li> The caliper is just fine for a cheap caliper, but it&#x27;s the tape that is really the star here.  </li>
            <li> These tools were super easy and very helpful in allowing me to track my weight loss-would recommend them to anybody looking to get into shape!</li>
            <li> If I do body measurements and plug them into the online body fat calculators (the kind the US Navy uses) they have on the internet, I&#x27;ve only got 24% body fat which is more logical.</li>
            <li> Overall  - Good complimentary combination of products - Get your measurements with the tape, assess your body fat percentage with the caliper.</li>
            <li> It makes measure quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best quality caliper, but it definitely works well enough to track your weight loss progress.</li>
            <li> I could subtract the extra inches from what I measure, but it would have been nice if it was accurate.</li>
            <li> I have been on a weight loss mission for about a month now and wanted to get more measurements than just my weight, because I am someone who is more motivated when I can see change in various ways.</li>
            <li> This is a far more accurate, dependable, and affordable method of measuring fat than any electromagnetic scale I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I already own a digital scale with body fat reading and wanted to see how accurate those readings were.  </li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly and was packaged without any issues.  </li>
            <li> Overall though, a nice cheap way to measure body fat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received quickly from seller</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything super fancy.</li>
            <li> Spend five or 10 more bucks to get a decent one.</li>
            <li> I like the tape measure much better than a regular one because it locks in and cinches up for a more consistent accurate measure.  </li>
            <li> Seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Plenty of videos on YouTube demonstrating accurate use with this exact product.</li>
            <li> Takes pretty accurate readings.</li>
            <li> but I believe it to be pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> However, I did not use the directions or fat % charts that came with the calipers, as they are NOT going to give you accurate or consistent results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for personal use more than for professional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get positioning down, but this was a great product for the price and does the job</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, accurate, and makes me very conscious of where my shortcomings are.</li>
            <li> maybe for some this is ok, but i was trained on the larger caliper and found that it was much easier to use and more accurate.</li>
            <li> MyoTape is my new go to &amp; when I lose more body fat, I&#x27;ll use the AccuMeasure.</li>
            <li> The tape is a great improvement over a normal dressmaking cloth tape, especially when I get to limb measurements where I used to struggle to keep the tape level and in place.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, exactly what it is expected to do&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> The tape measure works very well and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Measurements are easy to ready for both the calipers and the measuring tape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and comes with very helpful directions.</li>
            <li> The body fat test kit is straight forward and easy to read.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Incidentally, the MyoTape seems good based on my limited use.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty close!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s consistent!</li>
            <li> Overall, the calipers were easy to use (with a little help) and a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Easy to use - not as accurate as the more expensive models, but measurements are repeatable so a good way to measure progress for fat loss</li>
            <li> Great little kit for anyone needing to monitor body fat.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get an accurate reading without great effort.</li>
            <li> This product is very high quality, very professionally designed &amp; very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> So many articles online reiterate the difficulty in precision needed with multiple readings to get an accurate number.  </li>
            <li> i do wonder how accurate it really is.. just a thought..</li>
            <li> The instruction was really simple, which if you wanted more of a accurate reading, there are thousands of internet method on how to measure.</li>
            <li> Until digital BIA gets more accurate with , calipers are the way to go.</li>
            <li> Using the tape measure is a breeze and it takes accurate and fast measurements.</li>
            <li> otherwise it would have been really useful.</li>
            <li> the tape thing is pretty cool -</li>
            <li> It was certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> If you just want to see for fun then $4 is a no-brainer</li>
            <li> That makes this worth it.  </li>
            <li> I took a more detailed reading using another website and the difference was only 0.40.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase just for that</li>
            <li> This combo of tape measure and body fat gauge is well worth it for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is lost cost and well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Included are calipers and tape, which was nice since I could not only track body fat but also muscle gain too!  </li>
            <li> It is worth buying.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> you can use this to get a set of averages that are fairly useful.</li>
            <li> Myotape alone is worth this purchase.</li>
            <li> I found out my measurements are 32.5&amp;#34; bust, 26.5&amp;#34; waist, &amp; 32&amp;#34; hips; it&#x27;s useful for helping me keep track of my progress.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tape is actually pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> Seeing results using this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I only wanted to Myo Tape, but the Body Fat tester was a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> it will not make you lose weight if you do not change your eating and do not exercise, but it&#x27;s nice to see improvement daily when you do the right thing.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, yet very useful devices to track your fitness progress.</li>
            <li> Having made a New Year&#x27;s decision to start the Primal Blueprint diet, I needed a fast, easy, accurate way to measure body fat.  </li>
            <li> The Personal body fat tester is super easy to use and appears to be accurate.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> The caliper is way more accurate, especially if you are consistent in where you take measurements and the amount of body mass you use for the reading.  </li>
            <li> but I usually prefer to just disregard their instructions and follow instructions online which provide more points of reference and a more accurate calculation.</li>
            <li> The price seemed a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li> I did receive the AccuMeasure and it does the job right, but I didn&#x27;t receive the Myotape.</li>
            <li> The MyoTape&#x27;s measurement starts right before two inch mark throwing off all my measurements.</li>
            <li> May have to do a couple of times to get right</li>
            <li> like the caliper because of the clicking mechanism, then you know it&#x27;s at the right spot.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and the price was right.</li>
            <li> Price is right as well.</li>
            <li> so it has to suck right?</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> The price was right, though.</li>
            <li> They get the job done decently but are not as accurate as I&#x27;d prefer.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use and looks simple.</li>
            <li> The body fat tester is easy to use, instructions very clear.  </li>
            <li> which is why I did not give fewer starts, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t think they are quite good enough to really use - which is why I did not get more</li>
            <li> easy to use, it seems to work well, although the system with one point measurment could be replaced with a multiple point testing, available on internet anyway.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy and cheap.</li>
            <li> The reason the chart varies with age is that older people supposedly carry more fat around their internal organs where it can&#x27;t be easily measured.  </li>
            <li> I used this to keep proper track of all muscle growth, size and body fat % all very durable and compact to able to take with you wherever you may be!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I docked a star for the amount of practice required to get a good reading and I regularly take multiple readings and use the average, but the calipers are the most effective way to track progress in fat percentage</li>
            <li> This product is great for people who are starting get back in shape.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is great for beginners and does its job ONLY if you know how to do your calculations and skinfolds correctly.</li>
            <li> As a personal trainer and aspiring physique competitor, it&#x27;s important to me that I have an accurate way to track my body fat percentage and those of my clients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea for personal trainers to get something like this for extensive testing and measurements of clients.</li>
            <li> Came super fast through UPS (Amazon Prime) and does the job</li>
            <li> The calipers are nice, but the act of measuring body fat via calipers is limited in accuracy.</li>
            <li> So far it seems pretty easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Caliper is very cheap and can feel flimsy in the hand when using with larger bodies.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Even though I originally purchased this set primarily for the calipers, the MyoTape is the only part I still use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> The caliper is fine but the tape started at the nearly 2 inche mark.</li>
            <li> - I can finally get accurate measurements!</li>
            <li> Then you can remove the tape from your arm and take a closer look at what your measurement is exactly.</li>
            <li> With this item that you can have an idea of the body fat, but not the exact percent.</li>
            <li> The casing accounts for around the first one and three quarter inches</li>
            <li> They say inch above hip bone, but my hip bone is in more than one point.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Much more consistent measurements over standard tape measures.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> so you can undo the pin and see your exact results.  </li>
            <li> I actually have more fat using this gadget than when I check using height and weight.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly like I needed it to.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> The calipers with this set has not failed but I have no means of evaluating the accuracy.</li>
            <li> I like these calipers because there is an indicator for when you should stop squeezing, so you don&#x27;t squeeze too much!  </li>
            <li> It makes it possible to tape yourself in most places.</li>
            <li> If you are consistent with the measuring they should let you know whether or not you are losing fat, which is why I bought them.  </li>
            <li> But you will definitely have to go online to download a better chart and instructions on how to use this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use the skin caliper, first slide the &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Remember that with any type of skin calipers, you will get an approximation, not the exact amount of body fat.</li>
            <li> Then again it is only from the one spot it tells you to test when most of my issue is just my gut.</li>
            <li> I was 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and about 180 pounds when I first tried this</li>
            <li> Gives me a consistent reading when I use it.</li>
            <li> so she could get consistent readings.  </li>
            <li> but it read my fat levels about 7% higher than what they were.</li>
            <li> This is very affordable and practical!</li>
            <li> Plus the shipping and price got my real satisfactions!</li>
            <li> stays safely on the counter next to my creatine and vitamins.  </li>
            <li> First set of calipers.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who is interested or a beginner in fitness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, durable and gives consistent results when performed correctly.</li>
            <li> and really I am not sure how much more sophisticated they would need to be.  </li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Could never quite figure out how to get the body fat tester to stay consistent</li>
            <li> and I also have a regular tape measure but wanted to make sure that I was measuring consistently.  </li>
            <li> These tools do exactly what I need them to do.  </li>
            <li> It seemed to work ok at first but gave wildly different test results.</li>
            <li> However, I rated the product 4 stars because I really like the measuring tape!</li>
            <li> These items have performed exactly as I needed them to.</li>
            <li> The calipers work, but feel pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I thought, \\&quot;How is this going to do what I need it to do\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Consistent is accuracy, and you want a consistent result all the time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This has done exactly what I need it to and has held up.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a button to automatically tighten the tape for a consistent reading --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this because my weight fluctuates daily, but with this I can see that the fat levels don&#x27;t, and I can focus on muscle status.  </li>
            <li> But, after 2 or 3 attempts I was able to properly use the body fat caliper.  </li>
            <li> First time using products like this and don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> In that, I wasn&#x27;t entirely pleased because the instructions have you ONLY measure your waist.  </li>
            <li> These simple, effective, and accurate tools are all you need to translate what your scale says into what your weight actually means.  </li>
            <li> They work very well!</li>
            <li> I think a simple sewing type tape measure works much better.</li>
            <li> Caliper is a tad flimsy, but seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> This scale has a slider that stops at the exact measurement and it clicks to tell you it is there.</li>
            <li> As humbling as it is to have my wife take my body fat readings, I compared them to the ones that my trainer took and they were pretty close.  </li>
            <li> I read the directions and did exactly what I was supposed to do, however, the item did not work correctly.  </li>
            <li> A regular tape measure will give you much more consistent measurements.</li>
            <li> I might even like this product more when I can actual see changes over time from exercising.</li>
            <li> And this whole set is affordable!</li>
            <li> You get exactly what is advertised here, and it was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Actually use the tape more often.</li>
            <li> Using the Fat Calculator might be a bit of a challenge at first, but you can do it.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it the click that tells you the measurement had been achieved stopped working.</li>
            <li> simple, economical and easy operable.</li>
            <li> as you use it more the plastic begins to wear and becomes less accurate.</li>
            <li> It comes with a chart for a reading from a single location, but there are great websites out there that allow you to enter readings from multiple locations and extrapolate calculations.</li>
            <li> I had a more thorough bodyfat measurement done at the gym and the results were quite a bit different than from my AccuMeasure calipers, however, I chalk this up to user error on my part, and for a general idea of where you&#x27;re at, these calipers work just fine.     </li>
            <li> Unbeatable for the price, I wish the instructions on measuring where a little more detailed for the calipers</li>
            <li> Nice adjunct to all of my other fitness toys.</li>
            <li> If you really want to measure yourself with this MyoTape, be sure to hold the plastic at exactly the same place to reduce variability.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure is great and is the same style i have been using in the military for years for body fat measurements.</li>
            <li> I would have liked more than one way to approximate your bodyfat.</li>
            <li> The quality seems good enough to last.</li>
            <li> Overall a good low cost combo for home use</li>
            <li> Just be sure to use them properly, and don&#x27;t use too much force as you may accidentally break something.</li>
            <li> you really want to use these tools to properly assess your body fat, I will add information for you in the comments to help you get the most out of the tool.  </li>
            <li> Thank god I didn’t spend much for this product, wasn’t useful and looked very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The caliper works great and the tape is very useful in keeping track of waist size or whatever, but the chart used to measure body fat % is useless.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use especially if you know what you are doing ;)   </li>
            <li> You have to read the directions and measure yourself the same way in the same place each time in order to get the most accurate results.</li>
            <li> You can get a more accurate value by taking multiple measurements in different places on the body and using a chart online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I trust the friction in the plastic to provide the appropriate force consistently for accurate measurements.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll get a more accurate final number for total body-fat percentage that way rather than just measuring one site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> To measure fat with calipers you need to know exactly where and how much skin to grab</li>
            <li> oh well it was the tape I really wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li> Myotape is so convenient, fast and Consistent in result.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure is definitely higher quality than the fat caliper, but both work very well.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I am not fat and consider myself to be in a good shape, however, the measurements I was getting were giving me bodybuilder type fat percentages and I have a small belly, so there is no way my body fat is below 10%.  </li>
            <li> Third time&#x27;s a charm, I&#x27;ll give this outfit one more try as Myotapes have a decent reputation.</li>
            <li> Always compare to your own measurements too, not other peoples as all bodies are different.</li>
            <li> The only minor quibble is that the peg that holds the tape in the slot easily pops out of place, but I have become used to keeping a finger over it to avoid the problem for the most part.</li>
            <li> My only criticism would be that the end of the tape falls out of the slot too easily, which is why I gave it a 4 star instead of five.</li>
            <li> Simple tool that easy to use and even easier with the given directions.</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you actually read the directions and practice with it.  </li>
            <li> Easy enough to use.  </li>
            <li> i totally recommend this, it is easy to use even for a beginner and is execcelent to keep track of your measssures and body fat</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a bit flimsy and would slip out easily when trying to measure different body parts.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy too use and measures spot on every time.</li>
            <li> only gripe with the tape is that the end of the tape easily slips out of the notch for it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and within ten minutes I had everything calculated out.</li>
            <li> First couple of tries yield varying numbers but it gets better with practice.</li>
            <li> Simple product makes it easy to get readings to help me get to my fitness goals.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure is easy to use, especially when measuring circumferences (waist, leg, arm, neck).</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with very simple and clear instructions and is super easy to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fat caliper itself is really simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The calipers will probably hold up okay, since they are basically a single injection molded piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a smart phone, they also have a web site.</li>
            <li> For the calipers, the readings indicate I&#x27;m at a certain bodyfat percentage, but I don&#x27;t trust it.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me and I will certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> this way, you can account for errors in process or errors in the certain location that you used.</li>
            <li> I needed a simple, fast, and easy way to take measurements.</li>
            <li> recommend these skin calipers, it should hold up just fine for personal use.</li>
            <li> However, I am a beginner and after trying to follow the enclosed instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and then searching the web for even more detailed instructions, I cannot manage to get the same reading every time, because I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the exact placement for the caliper and even when i think I am in the same spot, my readings come out completely</li>
            <li> Just need to make measurements occasionally, and these work fine for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty clever the way the calipers click at the point of body fat measurement.</li>
            <li> This is an essential tool and has helped me tremendously, because, scales lie!</li>
            <li> The body fat measure is a little on the flimsy-feeling side, but overall this is a great value.</li>
            <li> The caliper is clearly not made to a high standard of quality, but it is good anyways.</li>
            <li> So simple to use, yet accurate.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t accurate enough.</li>
            <li> A DEXA scan might be the only way to accurately do this.</li>
            <li> This really is the only thing you need for accurate measurement.  </li>
            <li> The attached sheet for body-fat percentages may not be that accurate in that it only takes into account one measure (the fat around your waist).</li>
            <li> While it isn&#x27;t 100% accurate, after learning how to use it, it&#x27;s within 1% of the bodyfat reading on the medical scale at my mothers</li>
            <li> Dont really use it alot at the moment</li>
            <li> This really helps when I try to measure myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tape measure is very is to use.</li>
            <li> If you are weight lifting and building muscle it can be very disheartening to look at the scale at the end of the week and not see any loss there.  </li>
            <li> it is much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> They both work better than I expected.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt; to track what I eat, how much exercise and my measures.</li>
            <li> so one cannot expect too much -</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Thanks .</li>
            <li> The MyoTape makes it so much easier to do measurements by yourself.</li>
            <li> Wish I had spent more money on something of quality.</li>
            <li> The price was very affordable</li>
            <li> The tape is very handy,too.</li>
            <li> And I really like the automated measuring tape that it comes with.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s the whole matha part</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to describe here.</li>
            <li> Plus, all those electric instruments don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> So THIS is what you really want so to measure your body fat.</li>
            <li> This is a very simple to use and cheap tool that anyone can use to measure the body fat.</li>
            <li> I started the Insanity workout and wanted to know how much progress I was making</li>
            <li> I would recommend them to anyone who truly wants to know their fitness levels instead of stepping on a scale.</li>
            <li> Much easier to track my losses and gains.</li>
            <li> I am very inaccurate with the calipers, I probably wont use them (we have a scale that tracks fat%).  </li>
            <li> This is a very incorrect way to estimate how much body fat percentage you have.</li>
            <li> With this caliper he was found to have a body fat percentage of22% (Really close).</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really know what I needed.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the calipers as much as the measuring tape.</li>
            <li> Very helpful tools in meeting my fitness and body shaping goals.&lt;br /&gt;Owning</li>
            <li> The tape was just an added bonus, really .</li>
            <li> I now know how fat I am, thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> the tape works really well</li>
            <li> Very versatile measuring tool.</li>
            <li> much easier to check measurements with that tape.</li>
            <li> labeled to be the real thing but</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real mccoy.</li>
            <li> These have been very helpful in measuring my body fat and inches.  </li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use than a tailor&#x27;s tape.</li>
            <li> The MyoTape alone is worth the price of the complete set.</li>
            <li> If you want your body fat tested, get a real kit.  </li>
            <li> The body fat tester doesn&#x27;t stay clicked, so you can&#x27;t really read the results by yourself.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast and arrived intact.</li>
            <li> Very well done.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants to keep track of their body fat.</li>
            <li> The reading, because it was taken from the thinnest part of my body gave a reading that was MUCH too lean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really like the MyoTape.  </li>
            <li> If you are someone who is concentrating on fat loss, or muscle growth, you really need this because otherwise you really can&#x27;t tell what is going on with your body.  </li>
            <li> and I am really getting into excersing and weight lifting.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is not much to tell but I am sure this is wut</li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much in this department.  </li>
            <li> I was very please with this item.  </li>
            <li> and I do not store much fat there.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure is also very convenient when trying to measure yourself.</li>
            <li> I am very unsatisfied and now I have to look for another to buy.</li>
            <li> As Americans, we rely too much on scale weight as THE measure of health.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really well!&lt;br</li>
            <li> are a bit high!  </li>
            <li> I really think these tools will help people in their weight loss goals.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get what i paid for.</li>
            <li> I read the directions over and over and still don&#x27;t think i really understand how to use this.</li>
            <li> The caliber is made of such a cheap plastic that the lock doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The caliper,  is measuring so much lower than the electric hand held.  </li>
            <li> It came with a caliper for testing body fat, but isn&#x27;t very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took the multi-point measurements, plugged it into a simple website calculator, and got a precise answer of \\&quot;18.3%\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Only using one point isn&#x27;t enough because some people carry more fat in the legs than their stomach, or some people carry more fat in their upper body than lower body, etc.</li>
            <li> Very affordable and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Then then fat caliper helps some much to show you improvement.</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting higher quality metal calipers or taking many measurements with these to find an average.</li>
            <li> The directions for how to use the calipers to take a proper body fat % reading could be more clear.</li>
            <li> Using an average will make it more consistent.</li>
            <li> ( I mean a really good one.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> So 1 star due to build quality on the tape, 5 stars for the accu-measure, figure 3 is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and big enough for my 250 pound girth.</li>
            <li> Especially for all those that want to watch their New Years resolutions come true!</li>
            <li> You have to pinch the skin super tight, it hurts, which would be fine if the thing worked.  </li>
            <li> This allows you to apply consistent force on the calipers and usually not cause any pain to the person being measured.  </li>
            <li> The Body Fat Tester is a little more difficult to figure out, however once you understand it, I feel like it is much more accurate than the digital kind.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to track my progress in other ways.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t spend more money on the other skinfold calipers as these can also be used for other skinfold tests requiring measurements from other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> While seeing the digital readings is very cool (sometimes disappointing, but cool...), I&#x27;m not convinced they are the most accurate.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the instructions correctly or got confused after reading too many reviews on too many different related products on Amazon, or both :)  </li>
            <li> I am not a body builder or athlete, this kit is good enough for me to track down my body fat.</li>
            <li> Took less than a few minutes to do and the results were consistent with what the gym was able to do with their supposedly better equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> The caliper works well as long as you take accurate measurements and use a tool online to determine your percentage.  </li>
            <li> Well, that isn&#x27;t true, there were instructions on how to use the actual product, but not how to figure out any results from it.  </li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive simple way to measure your body fat percentage without resorting to the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this was true, especially because I started out at almost 30% body fat</li>
            <li> I really like the measuring tape, but the fat tester doesn&#x27;t come with enough instructions about where to you should take the different measurements to get a better idea of your body fat percentage.</li>
            <li> Not complicated, although difficult to keep an accurate measure through time, still is a good reference to use at a low price tag...</li>
            <li> I compared my AccuMeasure reading to a popular digital hand-held fat analyzer, and the two numbers came out to be almost exactly the same (within like .2%).</li>
            <li> I guess in hind sight, I would have used google to look for \\&quot;body fat calculator\\&quot;, but, being new to this whole fitness thing</li>
            <li> Seller was fast, everything was in new condition, no hiccups.</li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure and Myotape were just as I expected them to be-accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Both products were shipped quickly and came together in the same box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quick, simple solution if you&#x27;re wanting to get a handle (no pun intended) on your fat percentage.</li>
            <li> and you can get a decent approximation of your body fat</li>
            <li> Decent price.</li>
            <li> To be sure I was getting accuracy, I measured the same site 3 different times.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> Quality is decent and a must have.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still a decent deal for the tape, but I would have given 5 stars if they dropped the price and removed the body fat analysis caliper.</li>
            <li> The calipers are not very good imo, kinda flimsy and just not something I use, so its kind of a throw away gift I think.</li>
            <li> It only measures one area of your body fat, but its basic design is pretty clever and it seems to be accurate.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how accurate this is since I haven&#x27;t been able to cross check it,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> its highly recommended in a lot of fitness websites etc etc.</li>
            <li> highly recommend you purchase this if you&#x27;ve done your research and know what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s probably because of the high fat percentage on me.</li>
            <li> just have to lose a little more weight</li>
            <li> Just make sure your body isn&#x27;t retaining a ton of water, or those calipers will be of little use on your stomach.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s durable and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will break as easily as some of the other ones I tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these several times and as long as I&#x27;m using them properly, they work just fine, I just don&#x27;t enjoy what it tells me.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend got his professionally done and the calipers in this set were very close to what the professionals said.</li>
            <li> Simple straight forward and accurate especially for it cost.</li>
            <li> I like it has inch and cm, and the system to block in position is great for the difficult measurements</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not overweight, I&#x27;m just not in the shape I used to be, so buy these if you&#x27;re trying to become a professional bodybuilder and the results won&#x27;t sting as much.</li>
            <li> Tester is on point and the myotape is much easier then the old school tailor type ruler I used to use.</li>
            <li> I have read about cheap copies of this product that don&#x27;t snap very well and provide inaccurate results but we compared this to a professional one and it was pretty much dead on.</li>
            <li> If you want heavy duty calipers, you&#x27;ll have to pay more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not going to break with normal use.</li>
            <li> I rely more on calipers.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I did use it a few times after a night of drinking (which the instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t);</li>
            <li> The physical quality of these products is good, not amazing, but for this price point they&#x27;re very well constructed.    </li>
            <li> Once I had an accurate triceps measurement and had a chance to practice my other measurements, I realized I was actually getting consistent readings!  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t super excited by the result, meaning I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it was considering the measurements from other systems.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This was inline with some handheld units and other scales I have used, so I think they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this if you&#x27;re prone to low self-esteem, otherwise go right ahead.</li>
            <li> This makes taking some self measurements very hard to do, it would be nice if the whole thing just stayed put.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words - I was doing it correctly and getting accurate results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;v used Body Fat calipers before so nothing really new there</li>
            <li> The tape is the BEST every for measuring and acurracy; however, the &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; calibrater is confusing and hard to use.</li>
            <li> For the average person at home, this works just fine.</li>
            <li> Again, use the same skin calipers at the same time each day before exercise and you&#x27;ll get an accurate measurement over time.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t vouch for the overall accuracy of this caliper since I haven&#x27;t been weighed in water yet, but it&#x27;s reassuring to know that it&#x27;s accurate according to another independent source.  </li>
            <li> I brought this mainly for the waist measurement, as the caliper is too early for me to get.</li>
            <li> On advanced, more expensive calipers there is no guessing on what the measurement is.</li>
            <li> : the tape -- clever idea to have the loop and it works fine, but the retractor is glitchy and I suspect it may not last too long.</li>
            <li> This product is a basic too but very relaiable, I would really reccomend it&lt;br</li>
            <li> Measuring Tape: The tape retracts with a push of a button ensuring a nice tight fit, that won&#x27;t droop down your back (if you were measuring yours stomach).  </li>
            <li> The measurement you get is very sensitive to the exact way you grab the skin fold and apply the calipers relative to the skin fold.  </li>
            <li> The caliper will take you a couple to trys to get an average / accurate measurement.</li>
            <li> As many times as you may use these, which is not many, this is it.</li>
            <li> Using a fat caliper and getting consistent results requires some practice, and this caliper is no different.</li>
            <li> This is why it is important for us as registered dietitians to get the average of 3 skin fold</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described and what I needed to further my fitness goals</li>
            <li> It starts at 2\\&quot;, which I can understand can be compensated by the looping function of the product, but I am consistently getting larger measurements.</li>
            <li> Had to have a friend help me on this one, had never used them before and the directions were pretty simple</li>
            <li> I just wanted a simple caliper and that is exactly what I got.</li>
            <li> The caliper is of low quality, but it measure consistently too.</li>
            <li> I think it is better to go online, search for \\&quot;body fat calculator\\&quot; which will calculate your body-fat by taking into account measurements from other parts of your body (arm, thigh, back, etc).</li>
            <li> Love the tape measure I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using the calipers</li>
            <li> I was using another brand that required (4) measurements in different areas of the body and it required another person to get the readings as it did not have the scale slider that stops at the exact measurement.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple years ago, but have only used it a handful of times when i first bought it 2 years ago and both items are no longer functional.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing a higher quality one when I start actually working with clients.</li>
            <li> The Personal body fat need a little bit to get use to it, but after you know what you are doing, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use.</li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to figure out how it worked, but it&#x27;s really easy once you figure it out.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and comes with a little guide on where you should be...</li>
            <li> Easy instructions and be a little tricky to use by yourself.  </li>
            <li> The claims about the tester was less than accurate.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use but still not accurate.</li>
            <li> FYI - female users need to take a triceps measurement, which requires the help of a second person (this is NOT a problem with the AM-3000 calipers, it&#x27;s true of ALL calipers).  </li>
            <li> It is going down daily. :)</li>
            <li> (Incidentally, the included MyoTape is very nice for taking bodily measurements, or even other round objects.)</li>
            <li> Before starting a new workout regimen I purchased this set to do semi-accurate measurements all-around.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with much instructions for the questions you&#x27;ll have and not very accurate you have to be extra precise.</li>
            <li> Get a regular tape measure at half the price and wiht greater versatility.</li>
            <li> I was able to get measurements within less than 1mm, every time, over several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3-6-12:</li>
            <li> However, it pulls tight and then snaps, but does not take an accurate measurement.  </li>
            <li> It is very hard to get a consistent, accurate reading, not because the product is defective or anything, it is just combersome to use and get the exact same pressure and the exact same place every time.</li>
            <li> Its been a few months and its been working fine...</li>
            <li> &quot; things that are right next to the numbers all the way to the RIGHT, then press down lightly on the calipers to measure the fat, when you hear a slight click, let go and read the numbers.</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> The fat caliper feels a little flimsy, and takes a somewhat sensitive touch to properly use it (i.e. detect/judge when the rounded plastic tip has snapped into the eye socket fitting, which dictates when you stop pinching the skin fold and check the thickness of the skin fold to determine your body fat).  </li>
            <li> they seem cheap and difficult to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> It came with clear instructions on how to take measurements.  </li>
            <li> It does not measure the same as a regular tape measure and broke real fast.</li>
            <li> Get the Body fat Calculator app by Linear software to complete the package.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve not had any problems.</li>
            <li> The body fat measurer comes with complete instructions and a lookup table to map the mm fat you pinch with body fat % for your age and gender.</li>
            <li> I was told I would get the product early November</li>
            <li> the measuring tape my kit came with started at nearly 2\\&quot; --</li>
            <li> Now, if only my body fat weren&#x27;t so high!</li>
            <li> Well, at least now I know. :-)</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve went from 25% to 15% body fat in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> My only issue is that they don&#x27;t really tell you how to use the caliper, but I already knew how to use and which part you are supposed to measure.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the locks, or clicks between measurement increments are a bit too far apart.</li>
            <li> The sheet included offers instructions instructions that are clear and a chart on what your body fat percentage is based on your readings.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the Body Fat Tester; just never seemed to work properly for me.</li>
            <li> I have it since 09/2010 and used frequently to check on my progress as I age.</li>
            <li> Tape measure so much easier than regular sewing tape measure.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is much easier to use than a regular tape because you can hold the mark.</li>
            <li> Tape measure spring holding up so far.</li>
            <li> my body fat percentage was lower than the chart that came with this and my old unreliable scale.  </li>
            <li> Body far calipers</li>
            <li> Also, since the bolt does not lock in place I frequently had difficulties taking measures of my arms.</li>
            <li> But they are not for anyone doing this professionally.</li>
            <li> It marked me as 22%.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rely on calculations based on height and bodily measurements as they are VERY inaccurate if you have any appreciable amount of muscle mass.  </li>
            <li> This is the only caliper that I really trust.</li>
            <li> so a measurement of 6-7mm for a 40 year old man is 10.5% and 8-9mm is 12.7%.</li>
            <li> So, I used the directions on a couple of different fitness websites: Pinch up as much skin/fat as you can, without pinching the muscle or getting muscle into the measurement.  </li>
            <li> My only thing is that you can&#x27;t really tell if you&#x27;re squeezing 12 or 11 centimeters on the caliper, but that&#x27;s how the chart is organized.  </li>
            <li> The real problem is I was using it to track progress for several weeks before I realized it.</li>
            <li> If I squeeze the caliper completely shut it gauges to about 6 mm.</li>
            <li> Was off by 6% compared to professional fat loss test....</li>
            <li> This chart tells you to pinch one area of your body, above the hip bone, when in reality you need to pinch a few others to get better results.</li>
            <li> Not too complicated to learn how to use, intuitive but good manual and network offer.</li>
            <li> Tape is good, calipers are useless until you&#x27;re sub 15% bf</li>
            <li> The product is a good buy for casual users.</li>
            <li> and it is still a plain tape and not some magical digital device, but it still feels somewhat inaccurate at times.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a little off, it won&#x27;t make a significant difference.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure, on the other hand, worked as expected, appears and feels to be a decent quality product, and was easy to use to measure the circumference of my thighs, arms, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> Cool, but my tape measure came with the tape half ripped out of the plastic end....</li>
            <li> instructions come on a single, two-sided card and are pretty straight-forward.</li>
            <li> Plus I am not sure how accurate it is to begin with as it came back as a much lower body fat percentage than I would have guessed.</li>
            <li> You definitely need practice to begin getting accurate, or at least consistent measurements.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have listed websites that are useful for getting accurage measurements.  </li>
            <li> The Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester is very accurate and gives me the same results ( plus or minus .5% )as my digital scale when it measures my body fat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a personal trainer and Fitness Technician, I&#x27;ve used all sorts of gadgets and some of them get pretty fancy and some of them are basic.  </li>
            <li> By the way, down 2% body fat since I started getting back in shape and keeping accurate measurements with this.</li>
            <li> caliper is a little weak but is a great product</li>
            <li> Not sure how accurate the skin pincher is</li>
            <li> I thought it would be easy for a single person to use, given the way it the loose end loops around the body and clips back into the rest of the tape measure.</li>
            <li> The one chart that comes with this set is a little too basic to give you an accurate percentage.</li>
            <li> My husband and I recentely started a new fitness journey and wanted a simple at-home way to check our progress and results.</li>
            <li> I use to be really skinny (95 lb, 5.02 tall, small frame) but put a lot of weight after I got married (175 lb)</li>
            <li> Also, the tape has a handle retrieval and locking mechanism, which while very simple, makes measurements much easier (especially by yourself).</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what else to say except that I wish the guide for the Personal Fat Tester was in larger print.</li>
            <li> - it makes it so much easier to measure yourself, especially in places like the thighs and upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while and messed around with them at first to get the hang of them, but they are extremely helpful with keeping track of fitness progress.</li>
            <li> The major issue is the part that is supposed to click.  </li>
            <li> calipers are easy to use, but difficult to get consistent results with.  </li>
            <li> This was kind of confusing to figure out, the instructions are clear but it is harder to do, which the instructions actually state.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, there is nothing to keep the tape connected to the handle except gravity so unless you&#x27;re holding the tape right side up, it&#x27;s pretty much useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to give accurate results.</li>
            <li> The body fat pincher is a bit cheaply made but at this price I hardly hold it against it.</li>
            <li> Tape measure is cheap, its hard to use because the tape will slip and you cant measure with it.</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived on time,  and good conditions, the accu measure  its difficult to use, probably if you are very fat woks, but for people with just a little bit over weight not.</li>
            <li> If you are a high performance athlete I could see where more costly tools might be called for, but for the vast majority there is no good reason to buy anything more expensive than these.</li>
            <li> I was at first skeptical that the AccuMeasure would be so accurate with just one skinfold measurement.</li>
            <li> I have nothing to compare the results but at least it is cheap and</li>
            <li> These work as described and give my a general idea of my bodyfat trends.  </li>
            <li> Definitely is a plus if you&#x27;re embarrassed to ask others or dont have friends comfortable with pinching you body fat (it does sound a bit awkward).  </li>
            <li> But in general, i like this product and recommend this.</li>
            <li> They are a cheap and affordable way to help you in your weight/fitness goals, and, since you can measure yourself, nobody else has to know how big or small</li>
            <li> The calipers indicate proper pressure for measurement intuitively, but the instructions for the location aren&#x27;t clear to me.</li>
            <li> I get different readings when I use an old fashioned measuring tape.</li>
            <li> I only give 4 stars because the MyoTape has already become warped near the chuck at the end of the tape.  </li>
            <li> caliper feels like it could break at any second, thus far it hasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It is kind of difficult to use these on yourself.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I had always used digital and they would always break, including my body fat scale which is totally unreliable for accurate measurements.</li>
            <li> the body fat caliper is very small and cheap.</li>
            <li> the plastic handle off the tape measure tore off the other day as i gently pulled it out</li>
            <li> I think i&#x27;ll be buying something a little more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and confirmed without a doubt that I am a fat ass that needs to lose some serious weight.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but after a few tries, it&#x27;s pretty easy to confirm how fat you are with relative precision.</li>
            <li> I went into a store the other day and saw this EXACT same caliper for $15.00... and that was only for the caliper alone!</li>
            <li> It may take a little practice to get consistent.  </li>
            <li> I was first concerned that if I didn&#x27;t purchase a digital (more expensive!)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to measure exactly the same spot twice or even to know that you&#x27;re exactly at the halfway point.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not an issue specific to this product; it just seems to come with the territory of calipers in general.</li>
            <li> Both function well, but are generally somewhat flimsy and low tech.  </li>
            <li> Simple process of making a loop, putting desired body part through (I guess anything goes O.O), hitting the retract button, then taking the measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, the caliper is worth the small price I paid - and the tape measure can be seen as a bonus.</li>
            <li> I found this particular body fat measurer difficult to use and I am unsure how accurate it is.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not getting consistent readings, you may need to practice a little more (you may be measuring in slightly different spots or at the wrong point on the skin fold).  </li>
            <li> We ended up just measuring each other, which is what we would do with a normal tape measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tool itself was easy to use (although a little painful as most calipers are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this item is very accurate.</li>
            <li> Makes it kinda tough to get a grip on an accurate measurement.</li>
            <li> too bad, the design could be good.</li>
            <li> Tape is good, caliper is quite bad.</li>
            <li> I find it hard when I&#x27;m measuring my arms and legs to get the exact same spot as before.</li>
            <li> I am health conscious and have an active, athletic life.</li>
            <li> Needless to say - it was easy to use and I received the same measurement after 5 different measurements.  </li>
            <li> It takes a couple tries to get using the caliper down, but I&#x27;ve been getting reliable, reasonable results.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is easier than a normal tape, and the caliper is a little flimsy</li>
            <li> It does take a little time to get it down right.  </li>
            <li> I measured different parts of my body and the results were exactly the same, which is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t like the slider but its needed if your measuring an area that makes it hard to read the scale.  </li>
            <li> it may not last that long.</li>
            <li> I can say you might want to laminate the card for long lasting durabilty...</li>
            <li> Personal Body Fat Tester Kit is really a long way of saying, \\&quot;pinch-test calipers, easy-to-use measuring tape, and a sheet of instructions.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I loved my measured tape on my weight loss process and two weeks after purchase it broke :((</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old school reliable and doesn&#x27;t break down.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s such a broad average.  </li>
            <li> Nothing complicated and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can&#x27;t get reproducible results in a single day how could these possibly track your fat loss progress over time?</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t realized that do-it-yourself calipers take a measurement from a single location (above the pelvic bone.)  </li>
            <li> Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept records of my digital readings and when I took my measurements at the same time as the others with the Accu-Measure manual calipers I found that the manual reading was 2% less than the digital ones.  </li>
            <li> Got just over 2 years active usage of the tape which only showed these signs very recently.</li>
            <li> Then I went to use this little &amp;#34;Manual&amp;#34; measureing kit, by following the instrcutions, the index on the back of instructions showed the same % I got from the pricy scale.</li>
            <li> Compared to calipers we use at school, it is sometimes difficult to get a hold on the pinch and get accurate measurements and you lose your spot.</li>
            <li> Noticed two days ago that the tape had partially detached from the white cylinder.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected as the chart that comes with it is for only one pinch point.</li>
            <li> -- I&#x27;m embarrassed how long it took me to notice that.  </li>
            <li> but they get the job done and as long as you don&#x27;t throw them around, seem quite durable.</li>
            <li> Who cares if they are plastic as long as they work, and they do.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t use it and the calipers were smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> Measuring tape was missing first few notches because of the way it was manufactured...</li>
            <li> My first impression: The fat measurer is a cheap and inaccurate piece of crap.</li>
            <li> wonder if I can use the calipers to measure bodyfat on areas other than my abdomen, and use different fat calculations with the readings.</li>
            <li> We were having problems with weighing ourselves cause our weight kept fluncating back and forth due to increasing muscle mass.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m familiar with expensive skin caliper products.</li>
            <li> only reason I deducted one star was due to the quality of the calipers.  </li>
            <li> I had to practice a few times before finally getting the same measurement</li>
            <li> I use it more for measuring random things like my neck size or round objects when DIY projects are underway.</li>
            <li> : Caliper is fragile, manual shows only 1 way to measure body fat % (not really accurate)</li>
            <li> The paper included was a little to general for my liking.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;re limited.</li>
            <li> I recommend allowing a partner to measure and read the tape and body fat kit - it can be done single handedly, but is a bit cumbersome (for me, anyway).</li>
            <li> I always felt like I fumbled over the usual measuring tapes and was never sure I was getting it right.  </li>
            <li> The second tape, which failed within the 30 day return period has multiple issues, the white plastic tag at the beginning of the tape has begun to tear away from the tape and will shortly detach completely the same way the first unit did, making the tape useless.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I thought the build was slightly tacky, I&#x27;m worried about how long it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> I made a copy because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last with regular use.</li>
            <li> I was confused at how to do it at first</li>
            <li> Also with a loose tape, I find sometimes I&#x27;ll suck in my gut or push it out in order to help hold the tape in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are a person who is wanting to loose weight and record your progress thenget this item.</li>
            <li> so when you wrap the tape around your bicep for example, you can loosely put the tape around your bicep and then once it is set in the spot you want you can hit the retract button and it will contract</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve measured all sorts of things around my house with this and a regular measuring tape, and this always says less than it should be.  </li>
            <li> Albeit, I&#x27;m really careful with them, but overall, you won&#x27;t beat this quality for anything much less than this price.</li>
            <li> It does move back a little bit when you take it off, so it does seem that could skew your readings.  </li>
            <li> when I measured myself after a month of hard workouts, I nearly panicked b/c</li>
            <li> so you see how far you pinched the calipers since it&#x27;s hard to read the numbers while you are pinching.</li>
            <li> a little harder to use than i expected, took a few tries to get 2 equal readings in a row even when following the illustrated directions</li>
            <li> Both are made of plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how long the caliper will last.</li>
            <li> The tape and calipers function as expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to review here</li>
            <li> I recommend watching a few YouTube videos on how to take proper measurements.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not a whole lot to say about this product.  </li>
            <li> It has a mark which moves when the caliber is closed, when the \\&quot;Done switch\\&quot; pops and you release the caliber the marker stays in position.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tape measure has a few issues, while it is easier than trying to use a regular tape</li>
            <li> so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> Did not function as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected.</li>
            <li> But I expected it.</li>
            <li> About what i expected.  </li>
            <li> Just as expected.</li>
            <li> that* careful</li>
            <li> Not much here.</li>
            <li> Body fat tester works as expected.</li>
            <li> The reading was similar to what I expected based on internet calculators, but now I have a firm point to start from.  </li>
            <li> If you go slow enough, you won&#x27;t squeeze the calipers any further after the click.  </li>
            <li> The measuring tape was of very poor quality; it broke on second (gentle) use, when the tape separated from the plastic dongle on the end of the tape.</li>
            <li> Never an accurate reading and very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Read some other reviews which suggested that the tape was inaccurate because the measurement starts close to the 2 inch mark.</li>
            <li> Mostly due to the method of measuring the skin.</li>
            <li> The other two:</li>
            <li> And the caliper is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the accuracy of the caliper, as you only measure one spot on your body.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before purchasing the skin calipers and tape measure.</li>
            <li> ; on the measurements (curved) part to the other side.</li>
            <li> If you measure after exercising you may see an increase due to water shifting.</li>
            <li> To address some of the concerns that some other reviewers have brought up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 1) slide the plastic bit at the end of the tape into the slot on the other side and then 2) press the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; button on the handle--it will retract the tape</li>
            <li> The body fat tester is pretty useless - the instructions aren&#x27;t that helpful</li>
            <li> so not sure how well it will last</li>
            <li> Based on the illustration, it was difficult to determine where to measure exactly.</li>
            <li> It measures 1.5 inches off from other measuring tapes I have used.  </li>
            <li> Due to the tape measurer being so off, who knows about the other device.</li>
            <li> Plastic caliper not consistent.  </li>
            <li> Only problems with this is that the plastic part that is designed to create the &#x27;click&#x27; is too small.  </li>
            <li> Now I have more money to spend on my yummy :( vegetable juice.</li>
            <li> I use this product to assess my clients, and I have absolutely no complaints!</li>
            <li> and I was extremely nervous to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the description of this device told you it was only for waist measurements, so maybe my expectations were incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If u take measurements every other week</li>
            <li> So if it were, I would have devised some other measuring system...maybe a colored system so that you don&#x27;t have to guess the centimeters.</li>
            <li> I think the length of the start is set incorrectly due to the way it loops around.  </li>
            <li> But the size of the plastic holder introduces a lot of error in measurement, especially if you&#x27;re fairly small.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that I am not sure when the ball clicks into place when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing other comments about how it doesn&#x27;t zero.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never too tight or too loose.  </li>
            <li> It did not click easily, therefore making it in a way painful to use.  </li>
            <li> As a beginner, I chose the least expensive body fat measurer available.</li>
            <li> and if you are over a certain size it&#x27;s actually useless.</li>
            <li> The advantage is this one pinches fat for about 5 bucks less than the other models that I looked at.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that these don&#x27;t come with is a partner to measure those hard to reach places!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a normal tape measure for awhile, but found it clumsy and hard to work at times</li>
            <li> Sorry for yelling, but this product makes taking measurements so much easier.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to add this manual one to see if perhaps digital, at least in this case, is not the way to go.  </li>
            <li> Not worth anything.  </li>
            <li> These two sites recommend taking measurements from three locations on the body and then average the numbers, calculating a percentage.  </li>
            <li> Unless you go online and find the 7 point measuring locations and get an average</li>
            <li> The instructions suggest the opposite and this is confusing.  </li>
            <li> It took a few tries, but once I got used to it</li>
            <li> The directions in the package said to measure a skin fold halfway between where you pinched the base of the skin fold and the top of the skin fold.  </li>
            <li> The problem I had with it is that my measuring tape started at a little less than 2\\&quot;, not at \\&quot;0\\&quot; like I expected.</li>
            <li> I stepped on for couple of times, wrote down the average body fat %.</li>
            <li> I learned to look down and take the reading before removing the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone looking to observe their body fat and or measurements as they either slim down or bulk up.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the end of the measuring tape has a little plastic piece that fits into a hole to make a loop for measuring circumference.  </li>
            <li> The measuring tape on the other hand is not accurate AT ALL.</li>
            <li> for much less than that</li>
            <li> I put it side by side with a typical tape measurer, and I also measured it against a ruler.</li>
            <li> In less then a month the tape is tearing at the beginning.</li>
            <li> If you can pinch an inch, these can pinch alot or alot less than you were hoping.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m guessing its because the tape gets weaker as it ages) and the fat calipers are slightly warped which no longer clicks correctly and also makes it unusable.</li>
            <li> Well half the time it doesnt \\&quot;click\\&quot; to tell you when to stop squeezing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had it since summer and used it less thn 3 times.</li>
            <li> The fat caliper is hard to figure out and the directions are not clear.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not true.</li>
            <li> This measurer will mess with people.</li>
            <li> The tape measuring tool is a little odd</li>
            <li> Yo have to press the buttom to tight around the area you are measuring.</li>
            <li> measuring tape has a small lock system in which one end of the tape fits into the other end of the tape.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that the caliper would be flimsy, but I have no problem using it on myself with one hand.  </li>
            <li> The little tab that holds out the tape from rolling inside popped off and I never got to measure with it.</li>
            <li> You get the caliper and a little sheet of paper telling you how to use it.</li>
            <li> The ratchet mechanism used to hold the tape at a position so a measurement can be read has also failed on the second unit, again making the device pretty useless.</li>
            <li> The body fat thing seems like it will eventually wear out and affect the little snap that tells you when to stop pushing.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a little easier to use the tape</li>
            <li> It is a little flimsy</li>
            <li> : no complaints with the device itself so far--it just takes a little practice to do the fat caliper test correctly.</li>
            <li> Works well, a little bit of skill / training is required to figure out where to pinch.</li>
            <li> Even has a little maker thing on it</li>
            <li> This little gadget does the job.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the little clicker would get stuck and not click in when it should have.  </li>
            <li> The calipers take a little practice, but I think I have the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> Wish it came with a little case but nbd.</li>
            <li> The caliper worked well, but the chart was a little off.</li>
            <li> The one with the tape is that the measure starts at almost 2 inches, so you just have to minus 2 inches from your end result, which is honestly no problem whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The instructions are far too complicated.  </li>
            <li> When the button is released and the tape removed, the tape retracts a few inches and the measurement is lost.</li>
            <li> cause you don&#x27;t need help you can do it yourself, but the body fat tester is a waste.</li>
            <li> I also have trouble getting the calipers to \\&quot;click\\&quot; --</li>
            <li> Myotape was missing altogether.</li>
            <li> and you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> There is a slider they use to measure and you don&#x27;t use it correctly it can throw the measurements off by a few mm.  </li>
            <li> For anyone who actually knows how calipers work for measuring fat, these are rather poor.  </li>
            <li> The tape measure, as others have said, is NOT accurate.  </li>
            <li> but the myotape IS NOT accurate.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is not accurate, it&#x27;s off by two inches.</li>
            <li> I like this method best--especially since it says that my BF is half of what the chart says!    </li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that on the tape it is a little hard to read sometimes and feels a little inaccurate as it &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; every 1/4 inch or so into a locked position.  </li>
            <li> Plus, because it&#x27;s plastic, you never know how hard to clamp down before it \\&quot;clicks\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love it, but I hate it!  </li>
            <li> There is no added value over an ordinary cloth measuring tape.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the complaints stating it&#x27;s a flimsy plastic</li>
            <li> have no more to say about it thank you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m holding it wrong or applying pressure incorrectly, but I was systematically doing it the same every time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if that makes a difference in how the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The MyoTape retraction mechanism failed after several uses.</li>
            <li> You might be trying to bulk up your muscle, but really only gaining fat--that&#x27;s no good!!    </li>
            <li> However, I think it is about .25 or .5 too short -- but maybe I am just doing it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I happen to have a small waist compared to the rest of my body</li>
            <li> After looking at several expensive, high-tech options, I chose the AccuMeasure MyoTape and body fat tester kit.  </li>
            <li> Little flimsy but gets the job done if you&#x27;re not too serious about it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t squeeze to hard though.</li>
            <li> and I thought it was going to be hard.</li>
            <li> I find hard to use.</li>
            <li> The caliper is sometimes hard to set up</li>
            <li> complaint is that the instructions it comes with are hard to follow.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It can get tough to measure while it stays in the groove that&#x27;s about the only thing wrong with it, but if it stays in then it does what its meant to do</li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch, but I would stick with the soft tape from your home improvement store.</li>
            <li> however, the AM-3000 Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester Kit has been disappointing.  </li>
            <li> It is a tape after all, no not much can go wrong -</li>
            <li> I squeezed a metal plate that was 6.3mm thick, and the calipers reported it as 5mm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> Apply the calipers to the spot where you have separated the loose fat from the muscle (at the base of the skin fold) and squeeze very slowly until the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; feature just barely makes the clicking noise.  </li>
            <li> does this mean?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not top of the line but does the job with no problems!  </li>
            <li> I was off their little chart that came with it (heh), but after a few weeks of crazy working out</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re serious about finding your body fat percentage.</li>
            <li> These set of calipers are a must have for anyone out there serious about bettering their health.</li>
            <li> If you see me, you&#x27;d know that&#x27;s ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The Calipers take a little getting used to but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The caliper can be a LITTLE difficult to read.</li>
            <li> There is a small learning curve with the caliper, but I didn&#x27;t find it too difficult.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I followed the instruction literally, I found that the device is very hard to use and not accurate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very hard to use.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the &#x27;click&#x27; doesn&#x27;t hold the measurement--it&#x27;s just an indicator that you&#x27;ve pressed hard enough--you want to read the calipers before attempting to pull them away.  </li>
            <li> Unsure on the accuracy, though it is probably not great.  </li>
            <li> Came with everything needed and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> nothings broken.</li>
            <li> This really not great way to measure body fat.  </li>
            <li> Seems poorly made</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> For me, doing measurments can be frustrating.</li>
            <li> but  I don&#x27;t like artificial bogus or otherwise unnecessary word requirements falsely imposed by anyone for a review</li>
            <li> A little disappointed with Body Fat tester, dint expect it to be made of plastic, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This item was difficult to use because the plastic is so flimsy.</li>
            <li> Take your measurements without fail and log them in your book.  </li>
            <li> Both units have failed.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s 100% useless.  </li>
            <li> You Can&#x27;t Go Wrong.</li>
            <li> For me this was quite difficult.</li>
            <li> but I was totally wrong.</li>
            <li> The myotape was useless.</li>
            <li> For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Again, for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> On a 7 site test of 21 takes, it failed to &#x27;click&#x27; about 6 times.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally wrong</li>
            <li> Sadly, it wasn&#x27;t what i expected.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made me sad.</li>
            <li> The tape measure numbers were numbered wrong from the beginning</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s beyond useless.  </li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t do the measurements yourself -- they&#x27;ll be wrong.  </li>
            <li> The product is flimsy and the tape is useless.</li>
            <li> The calipers are completely useless.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know which to be skeptical of.  </li>
            <li> The Myo Tape can be very frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> Not too hard, unless you are a moron.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how depressing using one of these could be.  </li>
            <li> It is also awkward to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on bioelectrical impedance testing machines because they can be horribly inaccurate.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s expensive, and annoying.  </li>
            <li> but the gage isn&#x27;t too bad either.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t knock it too bad.</li>
            <li> that I had a bad experiance with this item I am thinking of purchasing a scale that sends an electrical signal through the body.</li>
            <li> Bad sale...</li>
            <li> I do not think it is supposed to be painful.  </li>
            <li> I use the body fat calculators at:  [...] and</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> - just don&#x27;t twist it or do something stupid with it.  </li>
            <li> I have found that flipping the calipers (holding them with the numbers facing away from me) fixes the problem, but it is annoying</li>
            <li> Lets them know that yes, they still look fat and disgusting.</li>

            <li> The Caliper works great. It does take a little time to get it down right.  There are plenty of videos on youtube on how and where to take the measurements. Get the Body fat Calculator app by Linear software to complete the package. The app will help you take the fat % measurements then it will compute your readings and store them by date for you so you can keep track. It also keeps track of muscle measurements (using the myotape) and keeps track of those also. If you don&#x27;t have a smart phone, they also have a web site.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t trust the caliper measurement.  Does not at all coincide with hand-held body fat instruments.  The MyoTape is great for taking all measurements.</li>
            <li> Caliper is very cheap and can feel flimsy in the hand when using with larger bodies. Measuring tape was missing first few notches because of the way it was manufactured... otherwise it would have been really useful.</li>
            <li> Great little kit for anyone needing to monitor body fat.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described</li>
            <li> not bad. not so good either; I doubt the accuracy of these - feels so plastic-y</li>
            <li> This item was difficult to use because the plastic is so flimsy. It was hard to get an accurate reading without great effort. The good thing was it was so inexpensive that I had no guilt over tossing it into the garbage can. Save time and frustration by getting a more durable instrument.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping up with inches lost on weight loss journey.</li>
            <li> how else can you measure them?  good for calipering of problem areas.  Dont really use it alot at the moment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get positioning down, but this was a great product for the price and does the job</li>
            <li> Love both products! They are a cheap and affordable way to help you in your weight/fitness goals, and, since you can measure yourself, nobody else has to know how big or small your measurements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many fitness professionals use the caliper for measuring clients. The only problem comes in user error. You have to read the directions and measure yourself the same way in the same place each time in order to get the most accurate results. I had to practice a few times before finally getting the same measurement consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The measuring tape has a small lock system in which one end of the tape fits into the other end of the tape. After placing the tape around, say, you&#x27;re arm, to take a measurement, you use the lock to keep the measurement in place. Then you can remove the tape from your arm and take a closer look at what your measurement is exactly. This really helps when I try to measure myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, both are great products.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap caliper so you cant expect the best for that price. With this item that you can have an idea of the body fat, but not the exact percent.</li>
            <li> The tape measure is very is to use. The caliper will take you a couple to trys to get an average / accurate measurement. Both are made of plastic, so I&#x27;m not sure how long the caliper will last. I don&#x27;t think it will matter with the tape measure. So far, I&#x27;ve not had any problems.</li>
            <li> It took about three seconds to master the use of these sweet products, and now I can confirm the fact that I&#x27;m slim and athletic any time I need to.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be 100% sure on the accuracy but it seems accurate.  My boyfriend got his professionally done and the calipers in this set were very close to what the professionals said. They give you basic instructions on use and its a good way to keep track of your size and fat %.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> The body fat measurer comes with complete instructions and a lookup table to map the mm fat you pinch with body fat % for your age and gender. It takes a couple tries to get using the caliper down, but I&#x27;ve been getting reliable, reasonable results. The tape measurer is cool too -- now I can track my measurements over time a bit more accurately.</li>
            <li> The caliper is just fine for a cheap caliper, but it&#x27;s the tape that is really the star here.  It is very easy to use and, most importantly, is easy to use ACCURATELY.  The caliper takes some skill to use accurately, but the tape is very easy indeed.  This is a very good way to measure fat loss.  If you are weight lifting and building muscle it can be very disheartening to look at the scale at the end of the week and not see any loss there.  You may have lost fat and gained muscle (meaning you made progress!) but they scale can&#x27;t tell you that.  That&#x27;s where the tape comes in.  You can take your measurements with the tape and know that you lost 1/4 inch off your waist (fat!) even if the scale says you weight the same.  I can&#x27;t recommend enough that you keep a log book of your results every week.  Take your measurements without fail and log them in your book.  This is an excellent way to stay motivated because you can see your progress!</li>
            <li> Update Feb. 29 2016  Reordered this set to replace the Myo Tape. Noticed two days ago that the tape had partially detached from the white cylinder. Today it fully detached. Got just over 2 years active usage of the tape which only showed these signs very recently. Happy to spend on this again.    Dec 22 2014:  The AM-3000 body fat tester is simple to use. I have owned the fitbit aria scale for over 2 years and wanted to compare its body fat percentage estimate to the body fat percentage estimated using the caliper method.    While reviewing youtube to see the correct technique for using the AM-3000 I came across a video which also showed how to take the measurements for the thighs,abs and triceps in addition to the Suprailiac as recommended by the product manual. The same video had a link to a body fat calculator (...) which I used to enter my weight , age and the results of those 4 measurements (in the column labeled Jackson/Pollock 4 Caliper Method). Starting using this on Sunday Dec 21 so as time goes on I will have some trends for comparison.    Love the Mayo Tape. Read some other reviews which suggested that the tape was inaccurate because the measurement starts close to the 2 inch mark. This makes sense as the casing for the tape will be part of your measurement when you connect the tape to it to make the circle. The casing accounts for around the first one and three quarter inches therefore the tape continues from that point.    Overall  - Good complimentary combination of products - Get your measurements with the tape, assess your body fat percentage with the caliper. Good way to track the quality of your progress (quality meaning whether the changes you observed in your measurements resulted from a loss or gain of fat</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised. I have read about cheap copies of this product that don&#x27;t snap very well and provide inaccurate results but we compared this to a professional one and it was pretty much dead on. The best part is the myotape that comes with it. The two combined make a nice fitness toolkit to help measure your progress.</li>
            <li> The product is easy to use, but I feel like the measurements might be innaccurate. For the calipers, the readings indicate I&#x27;m at a certain bodyfat percentage, but I don&#x27;t trust it. For example, it could say im at 10% but I honestly believe I&#x27;m more like 14%. Atleast I can use the measurement itself, in mm, to record my fat loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the myotape, it&#x27;s easy to use, but again I don&#x27;t know if i can trust the measurements. I get different readings when I use an old fashioned measuring tape. But if i just stick to the myotape, it will work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if I can use the calipers to measure bodyfat on areas other than my abdomen, and use different fat calculations with the readings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very simple tool to use, and it provides anyone looking to either maintain or become healthier a valuable metric to understanding your body fat.  While the most accurate measurements I have seen come of the multi-site pinch test (like 5 or so pinches on arms, legs, chest, etc...), this is a great at-home DIY tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the tape thing is pretty cool - I use it more for measuring random things like my neck size or round objects when DIY projects are underway.</li>
            <li> I purchased the body fat tester as it was recommended on a fitness site I use.  I was pleasantly surprised to find the two products together for a great deal as I needed a measuring tape too.  This one works great, because it is a loop it is much easier to use.  Each product is well designed and convenient to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use by yourself. I especially like the body measurement. It has a release on it so when you put it on a body part, you just push the button and it closes to the proper measurement. This way your not fumbeling around with a cloth measure tape.</li>
            <li> The caliper is very accurate and easy to use. The tape measure is perfect for self-measuring; it&#x27;s got a spring that winds up the tape measure or draws it tight.  I highly recommend both.</li>
            <li> Its cheap, but gets the job done for personel use.  You don&#x27;t need anything more expensive than this.  Don&#x27;t let the more expensive stuff catch your eye.  As many times as you may use these, which is not many, this is it.</li>
            <li> Great product and great company to buy from. I was told I would get the product early November but I recieved it 5 days earlier and with free shipping!!! Great company to buy from and wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> Easy, cheap, and accurate!</li>
            <li> It may not be the one caliper you&#x27;d find at NASA but it does the job just fine.  The tape measuring tool is a little odd but once you figure it out it is very easy to use and very handy for measuring certain areas where you&#x27;d normally need another person to do it for you, thanks to the quick snap end.  The caliper is way more accurate, especially if you are consistent in where you take measurements and the amount of body mass you use for the reading.  It was certainly worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great items! They both work better than I expected. I&#x27;ve recommended them both to my friends (and even measured a couple). I&#x27;m glad I bought them together.</li>
            <li> Product is good as described. Very easy to use and looks simple. I have nothing to compare the results but at least it is cheap and I can start benchmarking. The myotape is great compared to using a regular tape. No need to get help anymore holding the tape.</li>
            <li> Cheap construction , clicker doesnt click right.</li>
            <li> got this device after hearing about it in a book. the instructions are somewhat helpful but i havent fully understood how to use it yet. good idea and price though</li>
            <li> I love the myotape. An easy way to measure your own inches. Easier for me than a regular measuring tape. Good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The calipers are probably also great--they feel like good quality--but I don&#x27;t want to try to use them. So many articles online reiterate the difficulty in precision needed with multiple readings to get an accurate number.  That&#x27;s not an issue specific to this product; it just seems to come with the territory of calipers in general.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of these calipers. they seem cheap and difficult to get an accurate reading. I would suggest getting higher quality metal calipers or taking many measurements with these to find an average. They will work, they are just a bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> The tape and calipers function as expected. There&#x27;s a table included for skinfold measurement to body fat percentage, that for me is 2% lower than electric measurement. The calipers indicate proper pressure for measurement intuitively, but the instructions for the location aren&#x27;t clear to me. They say inch above hip bone, but my hip bone is in more than one point.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described. Much more consistent measurements over standard tape measures.</li>
            <li> Unbeatable for the price, I wish the instructions on measuring where a little more detailed for the calipers but you can find good info online. Tape is excellent.</li>
            <li> I use to be really skinny (95 lb, 5.02 tall, small frame) but put a lot of weight after I got married (175 lb) My husband likes chubby girls, but I start to have problems with my joints, pain in my legs all the time, and blood presure. I bought both the Accumeasure and the body fat tester. They help you to see where you stand day to day. it will not make you lose weight if you do not change your eating and do not exercise, but it&#x27;s nice to see improvement daily when you do the right thing. I use them with [...]&lt;br /&gt; to track what I eat, how much exercise and my measures. The tape is so cool. Yo have to press the buttom to tight around the area you are measuring. The Personal body fat need a little bit to get use to it, but after you know what you are doing, it&#x27;s pretty easy to use. just pinch your skin, hold the device and press it until you feel the click. It is going down daily. :)</li>
            <li> The material is cheap, but I knew that from he beginning. It gets the job done. Don&#x27;t expect anything fancy.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product. I was a little concerned that the caliper would be flimsy, but I have no problem using it on myself with one hand.  The tape measure is an excellent addition especially if you have to measure tricky areas like your arms.  My only criticism would be that the end of the tape falls out of the slot too easily, which is why I gave it a 4 star instead of five.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Exactly what I was looking for.  I needed more than just measuring my weight since I am trying to build muscle and having the caliper lets me do that,  It is easy to use and is consistent in its measurements.</li>
            <li> Easy way to get accurate measurements.  The pin holder on the tape measure makes it very easy.  I was using a dressmaker flexible tape, but always got a different measurement.  The Myo Tape locks it in place for you so you can undo the pin and see your exact results.  Simply hold the button to rewind.  The fat checker as I call it, is easy to use and is more accurate than figuring your BMI by just height and weight.  I actually have more fat using this gadget than when I check using height and weight.  But that&#x27;s ok.  I&#x27;m working on getting rid of it.</li>
            <li> The caliper is clearly not made to a high standard of quality, but it is good anyways. Combined with the MyoTape, it does the job quite well.  I actually use the tape in conjunction with a decent scale to get great and easy results.</li>
            <li> 0.2 my digital scale shows the same. I ordered some mass and hope to get for fat on me. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Not much to review here so I&#x27;ll make it short and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fat Caliper:&lt;br /&gt;Works great! Simple tool that easy to use and even easier with the given directions. Not to mention the fact that it also comes with a chart to make sense of your recorded measurements!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AccuMeasure MyoTape:&lt;br /&gt;SIMPLY AWESOME FOR TAKING BODY MEASUREMENTS. Sorry for yelling, but this product makes taking measurements so much easier. Goes up to 60 inches so it will be able to fit around MOST peoples waists/chests. Simple process of making a loop, putting desired body part through (I guess anything goes O.O), hitting the retract button, then taking the measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I went into a store the other day and saw this EXACT same caliper for $15.00... and that was only for the caliper alone! So this is a good buy and definitely recommend purchasing this product! Especially for all those that want to watch their New Years resolutions come true!</li>
            <li> Item is very good. Came with basic instructions for 1 measurement site. There&#x27;s much better measuring protocols online for free.</li>
            <li> These work great. So simple to use, yet accurate. I compared my AccuMeasure reading to a popular digital hand-held fat analyzer, and the two numbers came out to be almost exactly the same (within like .2%). Great way to keep track of your progress when the scale isn&#x27;t changing much!</li>
            <li> This caliper works great for measurements but the reference chart they give you is very inaccurate, mostly because they only have you measure from your abdominals.  I use a Linear Software website, which calculates your BMI based off of caliper measurements of your Chest, Midaxillary, Bicep, Abdominals, Suprailiac, Thigh, Calf, Subscapular, Tricep, and Lower Back.  This site has six different methods to calculate BMI, using a mixture of caliper measurements from these areas.  This caliper is great for use with external BMI calculators.</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I needed it to. Great price for this bundle and has helped me with tracking my weight loss progress.</li>
            <li> I love it, but I hate it!  It measures pretty accurately and they will never lie to you!  Great quality and price.</li>
            <li> Received in on time &amp; the MyoTape is on point!! I did a comparison with a manual measuring tape &amp; it was way off from the MyoTape. MyoTape is my new go to &amp; when I lose more body fat, I&#x27;ll use the AccuMeasure. Too many folds now. Lol</li>
            <li> I recommend getting either a more professional caliper with better instructions or a scale that measures fat (check reviews for the most accurate one). To measure fat with calipers you need to know exactly where and how much skin to grab so your results are always uniform. The one good thing about this item is the measuring tape. I use it to measure my waist and it does a pretty good job on that.</li>
            <li> I did receive the AccuMeasure and it does the job right, but I didn&#x27;t receive the Myotape. I don&#x27;t like buying something and not getting what I paid for.</li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure measure tabs are not as accurate as I would like them to be. Mostly due to the method of measuring the skin. I can measure 3 times and get 3 different readings all relatively close to each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape measure it comes with broke day one. The little tab that holds out the tape from rolling inside popped off and I never got to measure with it. It&#x27;s all cheep, but does the job with variablies.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I used this to keep proper track of all muscle growth, size and body fat % all very durable and compact to able to take with you wherever you may be!</li>
            <li> I squeezed a gram scale with the calipers - got about 470 grams until they clicked, and then divided by the square mm of the head - about 42.7 square mm. I came up with 11 grams per square mm. It is supposed to be 10, but it seems like they made an effort to get it close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I squeezed a metal plate that was 6.3mm thick, and the calipers reported it as 5mm. So there is that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking it reports about 20% off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If so, then I am more like 11.5% fat instead of the 9.6% I came up with using a 3 an 7 site test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One could use it to track progress of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That snapping mechanism is going to wear over time though, so I would be concerned the device would be the thing that is changing, not just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give them 3 stars. Basically they are $6 so one cannot expect too much - which is why I did not give fewer starts, but at the same time, I don&#x27;t think they are quite good enough to really use - which is why I did not get more stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not saying don&#x27;t buy these - there is nothing else in this price range - and it is worth getting them with the tape measure, but it did make me hungry to buy a better pair.</li>
            <li> Fitness 3000 Body Fat Tester (Caliper) - This is the sole reason I bought this product. I needed a simple, fast, and easy way to take measurements. You get the caliper and a little sheet of paper telling you how to use it. Read it once and you&#x27;re set. You get exactly what you pay for, nothing more and nothing less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AccuMeasure MyoTape - It&#x27;s a great idea in theory. This is a very simple way to measure the size of your biceps, forearms, calves, and tree trunks. The problem I had with it is that my measuring tape started at a little less than 2\\&quot;, not at \\&quot;0\\&quot; like I expected. If this had been set correctly I would have kept it around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this was just for the caliper it would get 5/5 no question about it. Since my MyoTape wasn&#x27;t correct I have to deduct a star overall. Still a great buy for the price and I&#x27;m sure every MyoTape isn&#x27;t like mine.</li>
            <li> The tape measure started at 2 inches. The caliper works great!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent personal body fat tester kit for the price you pay for it.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and the materials are of excellent quality.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great products.The Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester is very accurate and gives me the same results ( plus or minus .5% )as my digital scale when it measures my body fat.Thanks .</li>
            <li> Lost one set...re-ordered...as aid to physical goals...</li>
            <li> I got into health and working out as a way to change my life around and its been a great journey. I wanted to monitor my body fat and my diameters as time went on. The calipers are not very good imo, kinda flimsy and just not something I use, so its kind of a throw away gift I think. But the tape works perfect and I enjoy seeing and knowing my muscles are growing where I want them, and other parts are shrinking where I want them to.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised, great product for the price.</li>
            <li> It is very nice and  useful, for me it is my correct choice, and in addtion it is original (made in USA), just read instruction and take all measurment and it will be correct.  My advice for you just take it :).</li>
            <li> Its just to get a decent gauge of your fat (although i don&#x27;t know why I felt there would be more data available with these).  The tape i just as good.</li>
            <li> The Myotape and Accu-Measure are both easy to use. The MyoTape makes it so much easier to do measurements by yourself. They came well packed and arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how depressing using one of these could be.  Not for the feint of heart.  Use with caution and a beer on standby.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time i purchased a measure, and i&#x27;m really happy i did. the two in one combo with the body fat percentage is perfect. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of those electronic ones they have, so to get that with the MyoTape was a huge added bonus. The one with the tape is that the measure starts at almost 2 inches, so you just have to minus 2 inches from your end result, which is honestly no problem whatsoever. Great purchase, so i can finally keep track of my &amp;#34;cuts&amp;#34; and my &amp;#34;bulks&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good price, good qualify... and I love the tape measure - I can finally get accurate measurements! I like the chart that comes with the kit, and the fat tester is easy to read.</li>
            <li> The tape measure works very well and is easy to use.  You can get slightly different readings (by about 1\\&quot;) depending on how the tape lies against your back.  The tape measure clicks into place keeping from retracting once pulled out until the button on the side is pressed.  The clicks are separated by 1 inch increments, so you won&#x27;t get any more accuracy than 1 inch increments (25mm).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The calipers are easy to use, but difficult to get consistent results with.  The measurement you get is very sensitive to the exact way you grab the skin fold and apply the calipers relative to the skin fold.  With practice, reading accuracy is around +- 1-2mm which corresponds to about +- 0.8-1.6% which is still pretty good.  It is easy to tell when you have applied the appropriate amount of pressure in measuring because it clicks into place.  The calipers are all plastic, so there is probably some change with time, but there are good for keeping track of progress which is what really matters anyway.  The calipers are better at detecting body changes than the tape measure as they provide a more sensitive measure.  The calipers also provide a more stable reading than my Tanita conductivity based scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I docked a star for the amount of practice required to get a good reading and I regularly take multiple readings and use the average, but the calipers are the most effective way to track progress in fat percentage I&#x27;ve seen and they are very cheap.</li>
            <li> Well made, bonus tape measure makes self measurements very easy.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure is fine. I liked that part, but the body fat tester is a piece of junk. Go for just purchasing the Accumeasure</li>
            <li> It is kind of difficult to use these on yourself.  The instructions are far too complicated.  Just go to the gym and ask to use the digital body fat tester.</li>
            <li> Works great! Exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use!</li>
            <li> The body fat measure is a little on the flimsy-feeling side, but overall this is a great value. The tape measure is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Cheap feeling, but works</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd body fat testing device I have purchased.  The other two: [[ASIN:B000FJQ48I Omron HBF-400 Body Fat Monitor and Scale]] and [[ASIN:B002JSKZIS FatTrack Gold Digital Body Fat Caliper - 1 pc,(AccuFitness)]] have been used for some time and I wanted to add this manual one to see if perhaps digital, at least in this case, is not the way to go.  I&#x27;ve kept records of my digital readings and when I took my measurements at the same time as the others with the Accu-Measure manual calipers I found that the manual reading was 2% less than the digital ones.  I retook all the measurements 3x&#x27;s and came up with the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this mean?  For me it means I&#x27;m going to go with this one.  While seeing the digital readings is very cool (sometimes disappointing, but cool...), I&#x27;m not convinced they are the most accurate.  Then again, if I&#x27;m losing another 2% when I use the manual calipers... why wouldn&#x27;t I want to use this one?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this package you get the calipers and a MyoTape tape measure which allows you to lock the tape measure in place for more accurate readings.  Very easy to use and read.  You also get a 5x7 card with two body fat % measurement charts (one for men and one for women), measurement tips and an explanation of how to use the calipers with step-by-step directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: it is recommended by the makers of this product that if you are obese, you should not take skinfold measurements.  They suggest using the tape measure instead. The one included in this package goes up to 60\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a good buy.  Easy to use, accurate, inexpensive and a device that I will use for years to come.</li>
            <li> The myo tape does not measure accurately as it the tape measure itself begins at 2 inches and 3 centimeters, which in turn requires me to do the math to determine the correct measurement. Takes away from the simplicity of measuring. Not a product well inspected before shipment.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I was confused at how to do it at first but I eventually learned. This is actually great and from what I heard, this is very accurate. This was actually recommended by Michael Matthews so I had a great feeling this would be perfect. Even comes with a measuring tape, makes it all better. Totally worth the price :)</li>
            <li> The MyoTape&#x27;s measurement starts right before two inch mark throwing off all my measurements. I had to pull out a tape measurer to compare. Such a hassle. And the caliper is pretty much useless. Wish I had spent more money on something of quality.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two Myotapes from Amazon. Both units have failed. The second tape, which failed within the 30 day return period has multiple issues, the white plastic tag at the beginning of the tape has begun to tear away from the tape and will shortly detach completely the same way the first unit did, making the tape useless. The ratchet mechanism used to hold the tape at a position so a measurement can be read has also failed on the second unit, again making the device pretty useless. These types of tapes are designed to be placed around a user&#x27;s waist for example, the ratchet release pressed, and released and the tape removed and the measurement read. When the button is released and the tape removed, the tape retracts a few inches and the measurement is lost. There is no added value over an ordinary cloth measuring tape. The QA/QC contractor wherever these units are being produced is not earning their fees. The calipers with this set has not failed but I have no means of evaluating the accuracy. I am about to return both pieces as they were sold as a set. Third time&#x27;s a charm, I&#x27;ll give this outfit one more try as Myotapes have a decent reputation.</li>
            <li> easy to use, it seems to work well, although the system with one point measurment could be replaced with a multiple point testing, available on internet anyway.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose, to measure body fat.  May have to do a couple of times to get right</li>
            <li> Great items, the caliper is sturdy and great quality. Don&#x27;t squeeze to hard though. Also the tape is great! Just wrap it around and release and you get the measurement! That&#x27;s cool.</li>
            <li> I purchased the items for accurate measurements for a nutrition program. The tape is awesome. Not sure how accurate the skin pincher is but I did use it successfully.&lt;br /&gt;Helpful pieces of equipment to have when working out or losing weight.</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> These calipers work just fine and the myotape is extremely useful. I had a more thorough bodyfat measurement done at the gym and the results were quite a bit different than from my AccuMeasure calipers, however, I chalk this up to user error on my part, and for a general idea of where you&#x27;re at, these calipers work just fine.     The physical quality of these products is good, not amazing, but for this price point they&#x27;re very well constructed.    For the price I definitely recommend these and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The price was very affordable but I think I liked the measuring tape more than the fat tester. It&#x27;s not as easy as it looks. Plus, because it&#x27;s plastic, you never know how hard to clamp down before it \\&quot;clicks\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve had readings that have a +/- of 3 mm which is actually a lot if you look on their charts. If you just want to see for fun then $4 is a no-brainer but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re serious about finding your body fat percentage. I&#x27;m 135 lbs. at 5&#x27;-6\\&quot; but the tester says I&#x27;m 35% body fat. If I do body measurements and plug them into the online body fat calculators (the kind the US Navy uses) they have on the internet, I&#x27;ve only got 24% body fat which is more logical.</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice, but after a few tries, it&#x27;s pretty easy to confirm how fat you are with relative precision. I recommend watching a few YouTube videos on how to take proper measurements.</li>
            <li> This is a good tool to measure body fat. i do wonder how accurate it really is.. just a thought..</li>
            <li> The Myo Tape is great it makes measuring yourself easier.  The fat caliper is hard to figure out and the directions are not clear. I think you need someone to help you use it.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it. Great price for 2 items</li>
            <li> I received the product quickly and in excellent condition.  It came with clear instructions on how to take measurements.  Design and quality were just as pictured.  I would purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected as the chart that comes with it is for only one pinch point. BUT...I googled a 6-point and 9-point chart online. The tape is very handy,too.</li>
            <li> Fat measuring tool does not lock</li>
            <li> I loved my measured tape on my weight loss process and two weeks after purchase it broke :((</li>
            <li> Poor instructions and cheap quality greeted me when I opened the box.  The arm tape \\&quot;retracts\\&quot; rather quickly when you press the button and is kind of loud.  They get the job done decently but are not as accurate as I&#x27;d prefer.  You get what you pay for in this case.</li>
            <li> It only measures one area of your body fat, but its basic design is pretty clever and it seems to be accurate. Good enough for now! And I really like the automated measuring tape that it comes with. Big improvement over the antiquated tape measures.</li>
            <li> This was just what I ordered.  Easy to use once you actually read the directions and practice with it.  Love the tape measure, make it easy to do the measurements for yourself.</li>
            <li> Measuring Tape: The tape retracts with a push of a button ensuring a nice tight fit, that won&#x27;t droop down your back (if you were measuring yours stomach).  Calipers - I like these calipers because there is an indicator for when you should stop squeezing, so you don&#x27;t squeeze too much!  Remeber: if you use calipers, use the same ones for every measurement every time. All calipers are made slightly different which could yield different results. Always compare to your own measurements too, not other peoples as all bodies are different.</li>
            <li> The tape measure, as others have said, is NOT accurate.  The calipers do their job, but are somewhat flimsy.  I would recommend looking into a better set of calipers.</li>
            <li> Both of these items work great.  If you are into body building, you are going to love these.  It&#x27;s so much easier to measure with the metope since it is designed to stay in a circle, which is very nice for forearm, chest, calves, well everything.  It makes measure quick and efficient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the caliper because of the clicking mechanism, then you know it&#x27;s at the right spot.  In the past, I had always used digital and they would always break, including my body fat scale which is totally unreliable for accurate measurements.</li>
            <li> I have yet to figure out how to use the body fat calculator, I&#x27;ll keep working at it, I think it&#x27;s the whole matha part, I&#x27;m good at percentages, just not this form of percentages. Confuses me to no end.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great there is something inexpensive to aid in measuring body fat via calipers but the measuring tape my kit came with started at nearly 2\\&quot; -- not zero so it&#x27;s 100% useless.  when I measured myself after a month of hard workouts, I nearly panicked b/c I was bigger then realized this measuring tape was way off.  So for that, I have to give this a 3 star rating.  The calipers are fine.</li>
            <li> The Fat Measure Is Ok But The Tape Is Great &amp; For The Price You Can&#x27;t Go Wrong. You&#x27;re Getting The 2 Items For The Price Of One.</li>
            <li> This has everything it says it does. Not sure about the accuracy of the caliper, as you only measure one spot on your body. The tape measure is great and is the same style i have been using in the military for years for body fat measurements. It makes it possible to tape yourself in most places.</li>
            <li> The body fat thing seems like it will eventually wear out and affect the little snap that tells you when to stop pushing. Obviously this will throw off results over time.    But the tape is AWESOME!  This is the only way to measure yourself!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to describe here. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to, and the quality is good. It would be better if the measuring tape stopped every cm.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an accurate measuring tool for body fat and muscle size. I bought this before doing P90X to do the before and after measurements. I didn&#x27;t like the calipers as much as I liked the tape measure. It was really easy to accurately measure muscles size.</li>
            <li> I ordered and had the items shipped for free. They came in a timely manner and in perfect working condition. I was able to use the fat tester right away with brilliant results. My favorite item is the MyoTape. It has a notch for the end of the tape to hold - so if you&#x27;re measuring by yourself, you can do it easily and accurately! I love it!</li>
            <li> Easy enough to use.  Unsure on the accuracy, though it is probably not great.  They are made of plastic after all.  If you are consistent with the measuring they should let you know whether or not you are losing fat, which is why I bought them.  The measuring tape is great.  For the price it is a good deal.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I love the results of this caliper, but that&#x27;s not the caliper&#x27;s fault!  It works pretty well, and the measuring tape makes it so much easier to take your own measurements.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Shipping was great and all, but i didn&#x27;t like that the tape measurer started off almost at 2 inches.. Idk if mine came out defective or if the rest are like that as well... So really the tape is not that great...</li>
            <li> Works and i&#x27;m happy with the quality for the price.  just have to lose a little more weight and I think i will really like it more.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not a whole lot to say about this product.  You pinch fat with it.  The advantage is this one pinches fat for about 5 bucks less than the other models that I looked at.  And the fact that it comes with the MyoTape was a bonus! So far it seems pretty easy to use.  The product comes with a guide on how to convert the pinch measurements to body fat %, but honestly, I cannot evaluate the ease of making the conversion, I use an online calculator and just plug the values in.</li>
            <li> This set of instruments for measuring girth and skin folds are excellent.  The only thing that these don&#x27;t come with is a partner to measure those hard to reach places!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic parts seem durable enough, and I like the torque wrench like thumb button on the AccuMeasure calipers.  This allows you to apply consistent force on the calipers and usually not cause any pain to the person being measured.  I only give 4 stars because the MyoTape has already become warped near the chuck at the end of the tape.  It still works, but I&#x27;m now concerned about the longevity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize, it&#x27;s what I needed for a great price, and I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone needing a set of easy to use skinfold calipers and girth measuring tools.</li>
            <li> this tape *should* be a really great, inexpensive way to self-measure; but the retractor broke immediately. I don&#x27;t want to spend the postage returning it. I think i&#x27;ll be buying something a little more heavy duty. too bad, the design could be good.</li>
            <li> The product is a good buy for casual users. These would not be a good fit for those planning to use it twice a day for an year.. it may not last that long. A little disappointed with Body Fat tester, dint expect it to be made of plastic, but you get what you pay for. The MyoTape is a good build though.</li>
            <li> This set is a great way to get started monitoring your percentage of body fat. It&#x27;s not the best quality caliper, but it definitely works well enough to track your weight loss progress. The Myo Tape however is great! It&#x27;s easy to use, and works well. If you buy this set, be sure to go online and download better body fat charts and tips on measuring. The one chart that comes with this set is a little too basic to give you an accurate percentage.</li>
            <li> Very basic product. Does what you need it to. Comes with a paper that provides basic instructions for calculating fat percent but I usually prefer to just disregard their instructions and follow instructions online which provide more points of reference and a more accurate calculation.</li>
            <li> It comes with a chart for a reading from a single location, but there are great websites out there that allow you to enter readings from multiple locations and extrapolate calculations. Nice adjunct to all of my other fitness toys.</li>
            <li> Having made a New Year&#x27;s decision to start the Primal Blueprint diet, I needed a fast, easy, accurate way to measure body fat.  This fits the bill, and for the price it cannot be beat.  Took less than a few minutes to do and the results were consistent with what the gym was able to do with their supposedly better equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save the trip to the gym and pick one of these up.  The quality seems good enough to last.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed when i got this little thing. It has a mark which moves when the caliber is closed, when the \\&quot;Done switch\\&quot; pops and you release the caliber the marker stays in position. This makes it a lot easier to use it by yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just perfect for those of us trying to do everything by ourselves. Since I&#x27;ve bought this, I take my measurements every day!  Great value for the buck</li>
            <li> This product is great for people who are starting get back in shape. We were having problems with weighing ourselves cause our weight kept fluncating back and forth due to increasing muscle mass. This helped us measure our bodies more consistently with our BMI. The instruction was really simple, which if you wanted more of a accurate reading, there are thousands of internet method on how to measure. We kept it simple by just seeing if our bodies were toning.</li>
            <li> Using a fat caliper and getting consistent results requires some practice, and this caliper is no different. It is however a bit easier to use than some and I have found some that are even easier than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape measure has a few issues, while it is easier than trying to use a regular tape the retractor does not have enough stops so unlatching it will shorten up the measure by 3/4 - 1 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all you cant beat these items for their price.</li>
            <li> Does the job and the price was right.</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived on time,  and good conditions, the accu measure  its difficult to use, probably if you are very fat woks, but for people with just a little bit over weight not.</li>
            <li> i totally recommend this, it is easy to use even for a beginner and is execcelent to keep track of your measssures and body fat</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty clever the way the calipers click at the point of body fat measurement. Now, if only my body fat weren&#x27;t so high! Well, at least now I know. :-)</li>
            <li> I know that calipers/impedance measuring devices are not the most accurate, but if you get consistent readings over a period of time it is easy to see the % change when dieting/bulking. Obviously, if you want to get the most accurate reading, you need to go to a facility with the proper machines to measure you, but this works great for measuring week-to-week progress during body recomp. The tape measure is nice too because I can take my own measurements without having to have someone help me with a measuring tape now.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price for this combo. But you will definitely have to go online to download a better chart and instructions on how to use this. It&#x27;s a great instrument for you to keep track of your body fat lose. Plus, all those electric instruments don&#x27;t really work. So THIS is what you really want so to measure your body fat.</li>
            <li> These two items are great for keeping an eye on the amount of fat lost, rather than going by the bathroom scale alone and having fluctuating results. There is a small learning curve with the caliper, but I didn&#x27;t find it too difficult. The tape is a great improvement over a normal dressmaking cloth tape, especially when I get to limb measurements where I used to struggle to keep the tape level and in place. The only minor quibble is that the peg that holds the tape in the slot easily pops out of place, but I have become used to keeping a finger over it to avoid the problem for the most part. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase overall.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, yet very useful devices to track your fitness progress. Face it, when you see proof of progress, the motivation follows. Just get it.</li>
            <li> works great does exactly what its suppose to do. I use it to monitor my muscle gains and to keep an eye on my body fat percent</li>
            <li> This is a very simple to use and cheap tool that anyone can use to measure the body fat. Recommended for people losing weight as well as athletes tracking their progress while leaning out or putting muscle mass.</li>
            <li> They both work great and it&#x27;s a little easier to use the tape but the gage isn&#x27;t too bad either. I would recommend it to anyone watching they total body content on fat.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape was of very poor quality; it broke on second (gentle) use, when the tape separated from the plastic dongle on the end of the tape. The calipers will probably hold up okay, since they are basically a single injection molded piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> Pros:1 it helps you track your progress more efficiently and accurately than the body fat scale. Rulers and mirrors will never cheat on you&lt;br /&gt; 2 it&#x27;s relatively cheaper compared with body fat scale( I mean a really good one.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I did not find one yet.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a really good one.</li>
            <li> simple, economical and easy operable. I brought this mainly for the waist measurement, as the caliper is too early for me to get. But, the cost and quality are good for the price.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Measurements are easy to ready for both the calipers and the measuring tape.&lt;br /&gt;+Calipers provide a nice audible click when measurement is complete. (When it works!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Calipers don&#x27;t always make the audible noise that they are supposed to make when a measurement is taken. I have found that flipping the calipers (holding them with the numbers facing away from me) fixes the problem, but it is annoying nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;-Most times when taking measurements with the tape the end of the tape will fall out of the circular insert on the handle, so it must be held at all times. This makes taking some self measurements very hard to do, it would be nice if the whole thing just stayed put.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: These tools do what I need them to but they don&#x27;t come without their flaws.</li>
            <li> Very accurate tape and the best thing is you can use it on your own to get easy and accurate measurements.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a couple of weeks, then the tape stopped retracting. Measurements are within 1/2 to 1&amp;#34;, I still use it, just not as intended, now it is used for measuring anywhere i need a flexible tape. the accu-measure still works fine though and I use it weekly. So 1 star due to build quality on the tape, 5 stars for the accu-measure, figure 3 is a good middle ground.</li>
            <li> These are excellents tools to keep on tracking yours measures and making fitness goals and for some people who as i see don´t get how the myotape works, it starts at 2 inches cause it has that same distance in the contact border so stop complaining.</li>
            <li> Well I like the tape measure cause you don&#x27;t need help you can do it yourself, but the body fat tester is a waste.</li>
            <li> This works great.  It may take a little practice to get consistent.  If it you are concerned about accuracy you can still have an account of the trend.  See if you&#x27;re gaining or losing.  That makes this worth it.  It is a little flimsy so be careful with it.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews before purchasing the skin calipers and tape measure. I have a BS degree in Exercise Physiology and I&#x27;m familiar with expensive skin caliper products. For the average person at home, this works just fine. I bought this for myself and it does the job just fine. The plastic is more sturdy then I thought it would be. Tape measure works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use the skin caliper, first slide the &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; on the measurements (curved) part to the other side. Then grab and pinch your skin and put the caliper on it and then squeeze the caliper until you hear a click. Let go and look at the caliper and you&#x27;ll see where the &amp;#34;slide&amp;#34; is and that is what your fat measurement is. There are directions accompanying the caliper. Tape measurement works great and holds up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these skin calipers, it should hold up just fine for personal use. You need to use the skin calipers at the same time each day and before exercising. If you measure after exercising you may see an increase due to water shifting. Follow the directions and it&#x27;ll work fine. Remember that with any type of skin calipers, you will get an approximation, not the exact amount of body fat. Again, use the same skin calipers at the same time each day before exercise and you&#x27;ll get an accurate measurement over time.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this item is very accurate. Having both tools, you can double check your numbers using 2 different methods. It&#x27;s a great way to know fat loos vs muscle gain.</li>
            <li> I started the Insanity workout and wanted to know how much progress I was making so I purchased this set. I was familiar with this set because I had them before but lost them. Both sets have worked fine for me. I would recommend them to anyone who truly wants to know their fitness levels instead of stepping on a scale.</li>
            <li> The tape measure I think works great and I like it. Was able to get all of the measurements that I need. From waist, chest, biceps, thighs, and calves with relative ease. Quite accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the calipers I struggled getting a good accurate reading with. Now it could just be me, but I don&#x27;t find it to be all that easy. It relies on you pinching the same spot and the same amount of skin and fat every-time you measure. For me this was quite difficult. Plus I am not sure how accurate it is to begin with as it came back as a much lower body fat percentage than I would have guessed. Then again it is only from the one spot it tells you to test when most of my issue is just my gut. I was 5&#x27;10\\&quot; and about 180 pounds when I first tried this and if i remember correctly it said I was only like 8% body fat. Now I know I am not grossly overweight or anything but I know I was closer to 15% to 20%. If I tested the same day I could get a different reading up to 3% off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again it could just be my issue with them but it did not work for me. For me it is much easier and better to use the scale that I purchased as well. Gives me a consistent reading when I use it. Much easier to track my losses and gains.</li>
            <li> I bought this to track my progress in my weightloss venture in getting back into the shape I was when I was 25 and stopped exercising.  I&#x27;m 44 now and I wanted to make sure that I was losing fat and not muscle.  I don&#x27;t use the card that came with it to calculate body fat %.  Instead I use another website that tests 5 points on the body and it calculates your overall body fat percentage.  I had my wife test each spot 5 times so she could get consistent readings.  So far, I&#x27;ve went from 25% to 15% body fat in 3 months.  I have 5% more to go!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me and I could&#x27;t figure it out but it read my fat levels about 7% higher than what they were. Skip it and hit the bod pod in your city.</li>
            <li> Good: simple and easy to use. To address some of the concerns that some other reviewers have brought up:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Yes, the tape starts at 2 inches--this is because it accounts for the 2 inches of space that the curved part of the handle takes up. So, the measurement is indeed accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Yes, the tape locks at 1 inch increments--BUT all you have to do to make it more accurate is 1) slide the plastic bit at the end of the tape into the slot on the other side and then 2) press the &amp;#34;tightening&amp;#34; button on the handle--it will retract the tape so it tightens around your waist/arm/what have you. You can get a measurement to a 1/16 of an inch if you want (there are both inches and cm on both devices).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions come on a single, two-sided card and are pretty straight-forward. They also have a chart for interpreting the results of your fat caliper test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: no complaints with the device itself so far--it just takes a little practice to do the fat caliper test correctly.</li>
            <li> I am very inaccurate with the calipers, I probably wont use them (we have a scale that tracks fat%).  However the tape measure alone is worth the cost of this product, so if you want to try calipers i would suggest this for sure. Price is right as well.</li>
            <li> My husband and I recentely started a new fitness journey and wanted a simple at-home way to check our progress and results. I was first concerned that if I didn&#x27;t purchase a digital (more expensive!) one that the results wouldn&#x27;t be accurate- but I was totally wrong. When comparing the AccuMeasure body fat tester with a friend&#x27;s digital one, they numbers were always the same, time and time again. This is very affordable and practical!</li>
            <li> My husband has been wanting to check his body fat at home for months, so I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for him. The caliper is easy to use and he could tell me his body fat percentage within 5 minutes of taking it out of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape measure wasn&#x27;t as easy. I thought it would be easy for a single person to use, given the way it the loose end loops around the body and clips back into the rest of the tape measure. However, it&#x27;s a bit flimsy and would slip out easily when trying to measure different body parts. We ended up just measuring each other, which is what we would do with a normal tape measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the caliper is worth the small price I paid - and the tape measure can be seen as a bonus.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Better instructions for use can be found online.</li>
            <li> Cool, but my tape measure came with the tape half ripped out of the plastic end....&lt;br /&gt;Well it ripped fully eventually....</li>
            <li> My firend has a $50 body fat scale. I stepped on for couple of times, wrote down the average body fat %. Then I went to use this little &amp;#34;Manual&amp;#34; measureing kit, by following the instrcutions, the index on the back of instructions showed the same % I got from the pricy scale. I am not a body builder or athlete, this kit is good enough for me to track down my body fat. Plus the shipping and price got my real satisfactions!</li>
            <li> There are no surprises here.  It works just as intended.  It&#x27;s all cheap plastic, but no need for any special expense here.  Also, the tape has a handle retrieval and locking mechanism, which while very simple, makes measurements much easier (especially by yourself).</li>
            <li> works great... is simple to use and requires no fuss..hardest part is making sure that you measure accurately and correctly each time.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and confirmed without a doubt that I am a fat ass that needs to lose some serious weight.</li>
            <li> Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It is actually easy to do and I thought it was going to be hard. A great tool to keep track of your progress in fitness</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the chart that comes with the calipers. You can get a more accurate value by taking multiple measurements in different places on the body and using a chart online. The tape is more accurate and easier to use than normal measuring tape. You pull it out and it locks every 1/2 inch, and then push the button and the tape retracts to conform to your body.</li>
            <li> As a student going to school to become a registered dietitian, doing skin fold tests to estimate body fat percentage to provide a nutrition and exercise prescription is one of our duties. What I like about this tool is that it keeps track of your measurement with that indicator so you don&#x27;t lose it&#x27;s place. Compared to calipers we use at school, it is sometimes difficult to get a hold on the pinch and get accurate measurements and you lose your spot. This is why it is important for us as registered dietitians to get the average of 3 skin fold pinching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like about this caliper is that the scale may not be accurate. Am I measuring 39mm, 38mm, or 37mm? On advanced, more expensive calipers there is no guessing on what the measurement is. To keep it short, I don&#x27;t think putting the scale in increments of 10 for mm is a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions inform you to calculate your body fat percentage, to pinch your belly. This is a very incorrect way to estimate how much body fat percentage you have. The reason why is that you&#x27;re only basing your results from one measurement. The body fat distribution is different throughout the areas of your body. In order to get a more accurate body fat percentage, the person must be doing a triceps skinfold AND subscapular skinfold. Belly skinfolds and thigh skinfolds are not necessary. After getting the skinfolds of the triceps and subscapular area, the following formula must be used to calculate body fat percentage...&lt;br /&gt;Females:  % body fat &#x3D; 0.55(TSF) + 0.31(SSSF) + 6.13&lt;br /&gt;Males:  % body fat &#x3D; 0.43(TSF) + 0.58(SSSF) + 1.47&lt;br /&gt;Skinfolds are in mm. Subscapular skinfold (SSSF). Triceps Skinfold(TSF).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tested this caliper on my brother using these methods I learned from school. With the measurements of the more advanced caliper when I brought him into our campus clinic, it was found he has a body fat percentage of 21%. With this caliper he was found to have a body fat percentage of22% (Really close). However, if I choose to just do the belly skinfold like the instructions says, it states he has a body fat percentage of 17.5%. This is why I feel everyone needs to learn how to correctly take skinfolds and this product gets a 4 out of 5 stars. Overall, this is great for beginners and does its job ONLY if you know how to do your calculations and skinfolds correctly.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for a set of body measurements. Great price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product. Being able to grasp the suprailiac skinfold for bodyfat measurements takes some practice, but the quality of the product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that they don&#x27;t really tell you how to use the caliper, but I already knew how to use and which part you are supposed to measure. It is pretty awesome though, including the measuring tape, that is also awesome. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for the MyoTape.  But, there were no instructions for it.  Well, that isn&#x27;t true, there were instructions on how to use the actual product, but not how to figure out any results from it.  I looked online, but it wasn&#x27;t as easy as I thought it would be, there weren&#x27;t any additional instructions on the manufacturers web site.    I found this site:  [...]    I guess in hind sight, I would have used google to look for \\&quot;body fat calculator\\&quot;, but, being new to this whole fitness thing, I didn&#x27;t really know what I needed.    I haven&#x27;t used the personal body fat tester, it isn&#x27;t recommended for obese people.  While I am not obese, I am overweight (according to the BMI calculator, also on the above website!), &amp; it sort of looked like it would hurt.  The tape is just easier once you know what measurements need to be taken.  I learned my BF% was \\&quot;acceptable\\&quot;....aiming for the \\&quot;fitness\\&quot; category...I guess it&#x27;s time to go exercise!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does the job.  Note that the increments go by twos (2, 4, 6, etc.) -- I&#x27;m embarrassed how long it took me to notice that.  Lightly built from plastic,  so don&#x27;t just toss it in your gym bag - mine stays safely on the counter next to my creatine and vitamins.  The reason the chart varies with age is that older people supposedly carry more fat around their internal organs where it can&#x27;t be easily measured.  Be advised that a PERFECT bodyfat reading is very tricky even with advanced equipment, but you don&#x27;t need perfect -- I take 5 readings every Sunday, average them, and use that to help figure my calorie intake for the next week.  If it&#x27;s a little off, it won&#x27;t make a significant difference.  If you&#x27;re not a competitive bodybuilder in contest shape, a one-percent imprecision is nothing to worry about, and this will do the job you need done.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use the calipers as much as the measuring tape. The measuring tape is a great tool especially when you want to see where you are losing those inches.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Both products were shipped quickly and came together in the same box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am starting to get more careful with what I eat and both of these are excellent tools for tracking your progress. The tape is amazing and really simplifies the process of taking body measurements. As others have said, the &#x27;tongs&#x27; are a bit flimsy but they suit their purpose 100%. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> the measuring tape is good if you are measuring yourself. What I don&#x27;t like about it is that the locks, or clicks between measurement increments are a bit too far apart. It would have been better if there a bit closer.</li>
            <li> This is a good inexpensive simple way to measure your body fat percentage without resorting to the more expensive products.</li>
            <li> Cheap, easy to use, no need more than that to check your body fat!&lt;br /&gt;+ it comes with a myotape to measure chest, biceps, legs, etc&lt;br /&gt;Go for it!</li>
            <li> The body fat tester is pretty useless - the instructions aren&#x27;t that helpful and it isn&#x27;t accurate enough. The measuring tape works well though.</li>
            <li> These tools were super easy and very helpful in allowing me to track my weight loss-would recommend them to anybody looking to get into shape!</li>
            <li> Liked it for a cheap solution to measuring your body fat.. I did google more places to measure on you body then in the instructions and feel like it is a better number than what is give from the instructions.</li>
            <li> First set of calipers. Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re any good but they get the job done and as long as you don&#x27;t throw them around, seem quite durable. The measuring tape on the other hand is not accurate AT ALL. Tried to measure my biceps with it and it was an inch off. Measured my hips and it was two inches off. Great calipers but the myotape IS NOT accurate.</li>
            <li> Not as accurate as I hoped, but good for the price</li>
            <li> Exactly what was described and what I needed to further my fitness goals</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I use this for 7 and 9 point bodyfat tests, and nothing beats the tried and true caliper method.  Until digital BIA gets more accurate with , calipers are the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to use if you are measuring body fat, very easy to use and instructions are clear.</li>
            <li> Very helpful tools in meeting my fitness and body shaping goals.&lt;br /&gt;Owning the body fat calipers and the tape measure enables me to have an accurate understanding of my progress.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Just make sure your body isn&#x27;t retaining a ton of water, or those calipers will be of little use on your stomach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these items for a couple of months and, while I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m using the calipers correctly, I have to say that the Myo Tape is absolutely awesome.  I love being able to get an accurate measurement because I can wrap the tape around my body parts without needing help from someone else to make sure I&#x27;m doing it right.  It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> The accumeasure worked okay for measuring fat. It has a clip, so when you squeeze the caliper together, once the clip trips you stop applying pressure and take your reading. It works fairly well, but I also ordered the Slim Guide caliper and liked that a little better.</li>
            <li> simple product but  I don&#x27;t like artificial bogus or otherwise unnecessary word requirements falsely imposed by anyone for a review</li>
            <li> Great product! Came with everything needed and nothing was broken. The sheet included offers instructions instructions that are clear and a chart on what your body fat percentage is based on your readings. For measuring one spot on the body it is fairly accurate. I took a more detailed reading using another website and the difference was only 0.40. The measuring tape also worked perfectly. Would recommend to anyone who is interested or a beginner in fitness</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the Body Fat Tester; just never seemed to work properly for me. I however, could not do without the tape measure. It is easy to use, accurate, and makes me very conscious of where my shortcomings are. I have used it successfully now for almost two years, and have targeted and rid myself of problem areas by doing so. As for the Body Fat Tester; hmmmm, what ever happened to that thing?</li>
            <li> Works well, a little bit of skill / training is required to figure out where to pinch. I imagine you would have the same difficulties regardless of what type of calipers you buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered your two products: AccuMeasure MyoTape MT05 and AM-3000 Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester Kit from Amazon in December.  I have been very pleased with the AccuMeasure MyoTape MT05 however, the AM-3000 Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester Kit has been disappointing.  The device worked for about a month, but was not durable enough for repeat usages.  The device no longer clicks reliably and now gives inaccurate read outs.  I have tried to manipulate the plastic back into place so it will click like before, but nothing has helped.</li>
            <li> Great tools to help me and my wife keep track of our body fat percentage in our fitness journey.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with both of these products.  I love that I can use the MyoTape to measure myself and I don&#x27;t have to have anyone do the measuring for me, since I don&#x27;t want anyone else to see the results!  It is very easy to use and accurate, too.  The Body Fat Tester is a little more difficult to figure out, however once you understand it, I feel like it is much more accurate than the digital kind.  Great products for a good price!</li>
            <li> I have it since 09/2010 and used frequently to check on my progress as I age. I am health conscious and have an active, athletic life. Not too complicated to learn how to use, intuitive but good manual and network offer.</li>
            <li> These set of calipers are a must have for anyone out there serious about bettering their health. They are very easy to use and easy to read. Much more accurate than the electronic ones.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Even has a little maker thing on it so you see how far you pinched the calipers since it&#x27;s hard to read the numbers while you are pinching. the pricing is great!</li>
            <li> Got here in great time and is exactly what i needed for the Navy BCAs. Wish i had more ...</li>
            <li> Fairly accurate for a plastic caliper.  The measurement tape is definitely handy</li>
            <li> Works great! Started the summer at 25% body fat ( scale rdg) then in August caliper showed I was at 20 after following mikes muscle for life plan!</li>
            <li> The body fat tester is easy to use, instructions very clear.  Tape measure so much easier than regular sewing tape measure. Very happy with purchase!</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy...good product. Its been a few months and its been working fine...nothings broken. And they are precise.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the tape, only the measuring device.</li>
            <li> As a personal trainer and aspiring physique competitor, it&#x27;s important to me that I have an accurate way to track my body fat percentage and those of my clients. After reading up on calipers vs bioelectric body fat measurements, I decided to try both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accuracy: I&#x27;ve read several articles that all seem to suggest that manual readings underestimate body fat, while electric readings over AND under estimate your body fat, depending on your level of hydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consistency: Accuracy aside, calipers give me the most consistent reading. I&#x27;ve measured myself with digital/electric-based body fat measurements 2-3 times in the same day and gotten completely different readings each time!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durability: I purchased these calipers 5 years ago and I still have them and they work fine. So does the tape. Albeit, I&#x27;m really careful with them, but overall, you won&#x27;t beat this quality for anything much less than this price. If you want heavy duty calipers, you&#x27;ll have to pay more.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Recommended by my Doctor.</li>
            <li> this is kind of light weight and flimsy so not sure how well it will last but it is easy to use and seems to work consistently.</li>
            <li> Item works pretty good, I would recommend this to anyone who trying to keep an eye on their body fat measurements.</li>
            <li> Price was right and it works great for me and my clients. The tape was just an added bonus, really .</li>
            <li> Seems pretty accurate. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This tool is the best bang for your buck. Works perfect and am very glad for the purchase! If you are looking for an inexpensive weight measuring tool that works for the right price, this is it!</li>
            <li> Not too many ways to measure fat percentage at home. This little gadget does the job. Super easy to use and great for keeping track of body fat when you&#x27;re trying to lose a few pounds. The measuring tape is much easier to use than a regular tape because you can hold the mark. Takes a bit of practice to get it right, but very happy with the overall performance of both these items.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is not accurate, it&#x27;s off by two inches. I could subtract the extra inches from what I measure, but it would have been nice if it was accurate.</li>
            <li> a true 5 stars product and i had to buy it because they dont sell this in Taiwan and i am glad for the internet.</li>
            <li> Quick, simple solution if you&#x27;re wanting to get a handle (no pun intended) on your fat percentage. The calipers are simple plastic with a spring. Just follow the instructions and you can get a decent approximation of your body fat percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously this isn&#x27;t as accurate as the more scientific tests that require a lab, but for the price, it&#x27;s a decent approximation.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Gets rid of a the guess work!  Plus it helps to determine where you are and where you need to go.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the complaints stating it&#x27;s a flimsy plastic that&#x27;s hard to give accurate results. Absolutely not true. It&#x27;s sturdy, durable and gives consistent results when performed correctly. Both items met my needs and expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chart that comes with it isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;m not going to deduct a star for that since you can find a better chart on line for free. This chart tells you to pinch one area of your body, above the hip bone, when in reality you need to pinch a few others to get better results. Research it. I think another review had a link when you clicked her comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good value.</li>
            <li> I now know how fat I am, thanks to this product. It works and functions. Learn to use it and take accurate measurements, so you know your body/fat proportions in relation to your weight. Not too hard, unless you are a moron.</li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure and Myotape were just as I expected them to be-accurate and easy to use. I was at first skeptical that the AccuMeasure would be so accurate with just one skinfold measurement. It&#x27;s pretty close! For the amount of money it costs, this is the only product to buy. I&#x27;m happy I didn&#x27;t spend more money on the other skinfold calipers as these can also be used for other skinfold tests requiring measurements from other parts of the body.</li>
            <li> I have used a normal tape measure for awhile, but found it clumsy and hard to work at times so I looked for a tape that could be used one handed.  I went and purchased the calipers because these two items came as a package and I figured it might be useful some day when I wanted more accurate readings.  Both function well, but are generally somewhat flimsy and low tech.  They work well enough though and really I am not sure how much more sophisticated they would need to be.  My only real complaint is that on the tape it is a little hard to read sometimes and feels a little inaccurate as it &amp;#34;clicks&amp;#34; every 1/4 inch or so into a locked position.  Not fatal and it is still a plain tape and not some magical digital device, but it still feels somewhat inaccurate at times.</li>
            <li> Product exactly as advertised.  It looks cheap but works very good.  Has marker tab which makes using without help extremely easy.  Plenty of videos on YouTube demonstrating accurate use with this exact product.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the price!    The caliper is all plastic and should be treated with care, but if used properly is very accurate and easy to use.     The myotape is awesome! I was not planning on buying the myotape, it just came with the calipers, but when i got it and used it, it was amazingly simple and brilliant. I can measure arms, forearms, calves, thighs, waist and chest in about 60 seconds, as where before it would take 10 minutes to take all those measurements.     At just under $10 this combo is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I got this to get an accurate measure of my body fat. A DEXA scan might be the only way to accurately do this. I wasn&#x27;t super excited by the result, meaning I&#x27;m not sure how accurate it was considering the measurements from other systems.&lt;br /&gt;This might be the most accurate of all, I don&#x27;t know. But I doubt it</li>
            <li> Love the myotape measurer. Simple and easy too use and measures spot on every time. Could never quite figure out how to get the body fat tester to stay consistent but oh well it was the tape I really wanted in the first place.</li>
            <li> The myotape gave a differentt measure than a regular tape measure. No instructions came with its use.  The % body fat measure came with less than perfect instructions. Based on the illustration, it was difficult to determine where to measure exactly. The claims about the tester was less than accurate.  Once you made the measurement, you have to move the indicator to get the measurement, the tester does not do it on its own as claimed. The 2 stars are for the % body fat tester.  The myotape was useless. Get a regular tape measure at half the price and wiht greater versatility.</li>
            <li> maybe for some this is ok, but i was trained on the larger caliper and found that it was much easier to use and more accurate. the tape works really well though so i can&#x27;t knock it too bad.</li>
            <li> Works great. Tape measure spring holding up so far.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but still not accurate.</li>
            <li> This item worked as described.</li>
            <li> This was inexpensive and has been a great tool in shaping my body. I am too big for the caliper, but I started lifting and the tape measure is helpful in keeping me motivated.</li>
            <li> I am taking measurements weekly.  So it is very useful.  My only complaint is the end of the measuring tape has a little plastic piece that fits into a hole to make a loop for measuring circumference.  However it pops out easily while trying to make the measurement.  But the instrument does what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape contained in this product bundle is inaccurate.  It measures 1.5 inches off from other measuring tapes I have used.  It starts at 2\\&quot;, which I can understand can be compensated by the looping function of the product, but I am consistently getting larger measurements.</li>
            <li> The tape measure starts at almost 2&amp;#34;.  It is also awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I was off their little chart that came with it (heh), but after a few weeks of crazy working out I was able to accurately gauge my body fat. Works well for those trying to save some cash.</li>
            <li> Little flimsy but gets the job done if you&#x27;re not too serious about it</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose. Decent price. Feels cheap and could break. Get this if you need a cheap caliper for school.</li>
            <li> great product, great value, works great... an all around great purchase! very excited to see these numbers drop!!! :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase for the money and I have not used it yet .I have no more to say about it thank you.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to but I need to measure multiple times since the measure doesn&#x27;t click when it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> Very versatile measuring tool. I had no problem taking measurements without assistance.</li>
            <li> For the money you can&#x27;t go wrong. We purchased this along with the skin fold measurement device. Again, for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Nothing really special about this product. It&#x27;s durable and doesn&#x27;t seem like it will break as easily as some of the other ones I tried. Of course I can only judge this after a month or so of regular use.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I have been exercising for a while and have not seem the scale move.  I wanted to be able to track my progress in other ways.  I have a scale that shows body fat percentage but wasn&#x27;t sure that it was accurate and I also have a regular tape measure but wanted to make sure that I was measuring consistently.  These tools do exactly what I need them to do.  I would say though that for the caliper you should google search how to do a 7-site or 3-site method.  The instructions that come with this don&#x27;t seem to be all that accurate or reliable.  When I tested using the 3-site method and also double checked with the U.S. navy method....my body fat percentage was lower than the chart that came with this and my old unreliable scale.  Other reviews have listed websites that are useful for getting accurage measurements.  The two that I used are:  www dot exrx dot net and also www dot bmi-calculator dot net.</li>
            <li> Great tool for fitness tracking. The spring loaded mechanism makes it very easy to use one handed.</li>
            <li> While there is nothing special per se about this body caliper, it does do the job.  It is easy to use especially if you know what you are doing ;)   The tape measure add-on was the reason I purchased this set over another (it&#x27;s great for measuring bicep, chest, leg girth without having to fight with a tailors tape measure).  It&#x27;s a great idea for personal trainers to get something like this for extensive testing and measurements of clients.</li>
            <li> Great Product Excellent Seller.</li>
            <li> This body fat tester doesn&#x27;t even work.  It seemed to work ok at first but gave wildly different test results. After three or four uses it won&#x27;t even register a measurement.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but the price was right.</li>
            <li> hey its made of plastic and its really simple so it has to suck right? nope. this thing is cool. very great tool for the at home fat loss tracker like me. it won&#x27;t help you lose the fat but it sure as hell will keep you honest about it. its highly recommended in a lot of fitness websites etc etc. i learned about it it from a book. the myotape is cool too. much easier to check measurements with that tape. everything works perfectly and the price is amazingly cheap considering in a store the Accumeasure itself is already $20 before tax. for much less than that i got the tape too. highly recommend you purchase this if you&#x27;ve done your research and know what you&#x27;re getting. seller shipped it quickly and cheaply and it arrived faster than whistling dixie. much appreciative of the quickness and ease of buying. and there are Accumeasure knockoffs out there too. labeled to be the real thing but its not. i checked it out and this is legit. it&#x27;s the real mccoy. i was even happier with that news.</li>
            <li> Not complicated, although difficult to keep an accurate measure through time, still is a good reference to use at a low price tag...</li>
            <li> Measured myself, checked the chart, and it says I&#x27;m sexy.  Looked in the mirror and confirmed said sexiness. Good product, more accurate than many more expensive options.</li>
            <li> An inch is an inch.  I measured myself with this, and it was off by two inches. I put it side by side with a typical tape measurer, and I also measured it against a ruler. An inch is an inch. This measurer will mess with people. Two inches on someone&#x27;s waist is a huge difference. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I would stick with the soft tape from your home improvement store. Due to the tape measurer being so off, who knows about the other device. I&#x27;ll stick to my scale for measurements. Ughhh!</li>
            <li> Caliper doesnt work that good...</li>
            <li> The tape is the BEST every for measuring and acurracy; however, the &amp;#34;fat&amp;#34; calibrater is confusing and hard to use.</li>
            <li> Very useful caliper and tape measure. I use the tape most often. Like all devices of this nature, consistency is key. You need to measure at the same location in the same way each time to get measurements you can use. I find it hard when I&#x27;m measuring my arms and legs to get the exact same spot as before.</li>
            <li> Did not function as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not much to say. The measuring tape is easier than a normal tape, and the caliper is a little flimsy but it&#x27;s consistent!</li>
            <li> These have been very helpful in measuring my body fat and inches.  Great for the prices as well.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I already had the tape measure and had purchased without the calipers.  However, my partner wanted to accurately measure her body fat as well so I purchased this set.  Another set of the tape wouldn&#x27;t hurt.  We use a lot of online sources for additional test sites to gauge accurate body fat.  This really is the only thing you need for accurate measurement.  No need to purchase any fancy machines or gadgets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I deducted one star was due to the quality of the calipers.  Sometimes the little clicker would get stuck and not click in when it should have.  To be sure I was getting accuracy, I measured the same site 3 different times.  On a 7 site test of 21 takes, it failed to &#x27;click&#x27; about 6 times.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m holding it wrong or applying pressure incorrectly, but I was systematically doing it the same every time.  For a piece of plastic, I&#x27;m not complaining.  I can still get it to work, but fair warning for those that have it happen on the first try.  Just relax, let go and give it another go.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and seems pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what I expected. Cheap, plastic, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Tape rocks but broke in 2 weeks.  Plastic caliper not consistent.  This really not great way to measure body fat.  I think just doing a tape measure is the way to go but it broke</li>
            <li> 1st things 1st this caliper is set up to take one measurement(from ur hip) and tell you ur fat % from that and it&#x27;s totally wrong u need multiple measurements from different body parts such as your chest thigh arm stomach hips and then it should be plugged into a formula...don&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> I purchased the AccuMeasure MyoTape and Body Fat tester recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;v used Body Fat calipers before so nothing really new there but the MyoTape is extremely easy to use. It&#x27;s unique shape contours to the body and the locking mechanism means you get very accurate measurements every time. This is so much easier to use than a tailor&#x27;s tape. The MyoTape alone is worth the price of the complete set. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Good price, but measuring tape is a hassle to do if your by yourself (end keeps sliding out of slot when measuring - must hold)...</li>
            <li> The caliper on this is good but the tape is not.  It does not measure the same as a regular tape measure and broke real fast.</li>
            <li> As a beginner, I chose the least expensive body fat measurer available. I found this particular body fat measurer difficult to use and I am unsure how accurate it is. However, I rated the product 4 stars because I really like the measuring tape! Think of the adjustable, circular tape measures used to measure infants&#x27; head circumference--only bigger. Using the tape measure is a breeze and it takes accurate and fast measurements.</li>
            <li> Used this while doing P90X and this gets the job done. It works the way it supposed to and has an easy to read chart that comes along with it and instructions of how to accurately use it.</li>
            <li> These items have performed exactly as I needed them to. I really don&#x27;t know what else to say except that I wish the guide for the Personal Fat Tester was in larger print. Otherwise, no concerns, no complaints!</li>
            <li> This measuring tape is easy to use and functions as it described. I have not used the caliper as much.&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with the tape is that the end of the tape easily slips out of the notch for it.</li>
            <li> Have been measuring once weekly for 3 weeks, works great!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very accurate.</li>
            <li> A good product for the prize. The slot in the measuring device allows for self measuring without anyone else&#x27;s help. Body far calipers I find hard to use. But that&#x27;s probably because of the high fat percentage on me. Makes it kinda tough to get a grip on an accurate measurement. But I expected it.</li>
            <li> Great for measuring fat people at work, fat people love to know how fat they are. This tool reminds them that the 5 pounds they lost was only the poop and urine in their body. Lets them know that yes, they still look fat and disgusting.</li>
            <li> If you want your body fat tested, get a real kit.  This tells you to do 1 location, and then gives you a chart.  Not worth anything.  Do like the myotape though.</li>
            <li> The tool itself was easy to use (although a little painful as most calipers are).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The measuring tape was a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chart was nice but I wish it was more durable - either heavier stock paper or laminated. I made a copy because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last with regular use.</li>
            <li> This works great! I love being able to measure my arms with out having someone help me. The Personal body fat tester is super easy to use and appears to be accurate. Good quality.</li>
            <li> I choose a 5 star because I got what I paid for. They arrived on time. They arrived as pictured and they work like they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> The tape works great but the calipers (the reason I ordered the product) are totally inconsistent. I stood there for 20 minutes taking and retaking readings and I got measurements varying from 24 to 40. There is just no consistency whatsoever. If you can&#x27;t get reproducible results in a single day how could these possibly track your fat loss progress over time?</li>
            <li> Sadly, it wasn&#x27;t what i expected.&lt;br /&gt;Although I followed the instruction literally, I found that the device is very hard to use and not accurate.&lt;br /&gt;It gives me totally different results each time.</li>
            <li> The myo tape works great.  The body fat tester doesn&#x27;t stay clicked, so you can&#x27;t really read the results by yourself.  I have not asked for a refund or replacement, but I will.</li>
            <li> Decent quality for the price.  The Myotape is great for taking measurements when you don&#x27;t have a partner to assist - it makes it very easy.  Overall thumbs up. I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> a little harder to use than i expected, took a few tries to get 2 equal readings in a row even when following the illustrated directions</li>
            <li> They work as advertised.  A great combination in trying to manage and monitor body composition</li>
            <li> gave as a gift and it was enjoyed</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for.  The calipers work, but feel pretty flimsy.  The instructions say to \\&quot;press until you hear a click\\&quot;, and then \\&quot;release the jaws and read your measurement\\&quot;.  Only problems with this is that the plastic part that is designed to create the &#x27;click&#x27; is too small.  Not sure if that makes a difference in how the product works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, the MyoTape seems good based on my limited use.  Makes it very easy to take measurements without assistance.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I thought, \\&quot;How is this going to do what I need it to do\\&quot;.  But it works great, I don&#x27;t have to fight to keep a regular measuring tape in place and I can do the measuring all by myself, I don&#x27;t need anyone to help me.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to keep track of their measurements on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Re: the caliper -- If you know what you are doing, I am sure this is a perfectly good tool, based on everything that I have read. However, I am a beginner and after trying to follow the enclosed instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and then searching the web for even more detailed instructions, I cannot manage to get the same reading every time, because I can&#x27;t seem to figure out the exact placement for the caliper and even when i think I am in the same spot, my readings come out completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Re: the tape -- clever idea to have the loop and it works fine, but the retractor is glitchy and I suspect it may not last too long.</li>
            <li> Pretty inexpensive and ok for the price.  About what i expected.  i did not want to invest much and works ok for my needs.</li>
            <li> These work as described and give my a general idea of my bodyfat trends.  I have to question the accuracy of the measurements on the calipers though because I&#x27;m coming up lower than I know I am,  I&#x27;m not sure I trust the friction in the plastic to provide the appropriate force consistently for accurate measurements.  However, it passes the mirror test on trends and helps me quantify my bodyfat to satisfy my OCD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape works fantastically well, only good things to say about that.</li>
            <li> Works great. good reminder that im still fat. LOL</li>
            <li> Satisfied. Simple straight forward and accurate especially for it cost.</li>
            <li> and buy one of these NOW....  Myotape is so convenient, fast and Consistent in result.  Consistent is accuracy, and you want a consistent result all the time.  Also with a loose tape, I find sometimes I&#x27;ll suck in my gut or push it out in order to help hold the tape in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 words:  Just buy it.</li>
            <li> The tape measure works great but feels as if it will break if not used gently.  The caliper works well as long as you take accurate measurements and use a tool online to determine your percentage.  The paper included was a little to general for my liking.</li>
            <li> I like using this, as accurate as it can be! I will be using this on my future clients and myself as well. GOOD HEALTH!</li>
            <li> Tape is good, calipers are useless until you&#x27;re sub 15% bf</li>
            <li> I love this measuring tape.  Worth the purchase just for that</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and arrived intact. This tester and tape are great. For under $10 this is a great deal. Who cares if they are plastic as long as they work, and they do. Now I have more money to spend on my yummy :( vegetable juice.</li>
            <li> Easy to use - not as accurate as the more expensive models, but measurements are repeatable so a good way to measure progress for fat loss</li>
            <li> The MyoTape retraction mechanism failed after several uses. Also, since the bolt does not lock in place I frequently had difficulties taking measures of my arms.</li>
            <li> The caliper works great and the tape is very useful in keeping track of waist size or whatever, but the chart used to measure body fat % is useless.</li>
            <li> It does a great job, exactly what it is expected to do&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the instructions it comes with are hard to follow.&lt;br /&gt;I had to look up instructions on Youtube to figure out how to measure and operate this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once we figured it out, it made a lot more sense.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and of good quality. I would recommend to those who want a reliable way to keep track of their measurements.</li>
            <li> I like the product. It&#x27;s perfect for my use. It was recommended to me and I will certainly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> caliper feels like it could break at any second, thus far it hasn&#x27;t. tape feels sturdy enough. Next time ill go with something more quality.</li>
            <li> These are very cheap and simple to use. But they are not for anyone doing this professionally. I thought they would have stayed when you pinch for the 2 seconds like properly made ones would. Fine for a one time, or home use type scenario.But not for a personal trainer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come with much instructions for the questions you&#x27;ll have and not very accurate you have to be extra precise. Should only buy if you know what your doing</li>
            <li> This product is very high quality, very professionally designed &amp; very easy to use.  I rest better at night knowing my information is protected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Keeper Team!!</li>
            <li> Just as expected. Very well done.</li>
            <li> Great shipping, great product it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> With the price I paid, I am very impressed with what I got. The calipers are very simple to use and although they might not be the best of the best, they get the job done. I have been on a weight loss mission for about a month now and wanted to get more measurements than just my weight, because I am someone who is more motivated when I can see change in various ways. The calipers gave me a measurement of 21.7% body fat. This was inline with some handheld units and other scales I have used, so I think they work just fine. The measuring tape is very simple to use, no it isn&#x27;t perfect, but again it gets the job done. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat this combo. If you want to start keeping more detailed measurements of your body, this is a great place to start.</li>
            <li> Made the order, and got the product shipped to my house without any delay! I use this product to assess my clients, and I have absolutely no complaints! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who wants to keep track of their body fat. Easy to use and comes with very helpful directions.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of doing skin fold measurements, but this low cost caliper is up to the task and the MyoTape measuring tape makes the job of taking girth measurements a good bit easier. If you are a high performance athlete I could see where more costly tools might be called for, but for the vast majority there is no good reason to buy anything more expensive than these.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. lets you know where you are at.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I ordered this, but was just beginning to look at monitoring my body fat percentage and wanted something inexpensive.  This has done exactly what I need it to and has held up.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this set because I wanted a better method of measuring my body fat than the percentage listed on my scale.  I had heard that calipers were the way to go.  In my case, it was a huge mistake.  I hadn&#x27;t realized that do-it-yourself calipers take a measurement from a single location (above the pelvic bone.)  While it may be helpful for people who have an apple shape, it was not helpful for me.  The reading, because it was taken from the thinnest part of my body gave a reading that was MUCH too lean.  I also have trouble getting the calipers to \\&quot;click\\&quot; -- sometimes they do and sometimes they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m really like the MyoTape.  It makes it very easy to do self-measurements.  If the knob on one end of the tape pops out of its hole, you don&#x27;t have the tape level.  There&#x27;s a button to automatically tighten the tape for a consistent reading -- it&#x27;s never too tight or too loose.  Sometimes, however, it drew it about an inch or so, instead of locking, when I removed the one end.  I learned to look down and take the reading before removing the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to do it again, I&#x27;d buy the MyoTape separately.  Even though I originally purchased this set primarily for the calipers, the MyoTape is the only part I still use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> Great measurement and accuracy</li>
            <li> This combo of tape measure and body fat gauge is well worth it for the price I paid. Came very quickly in the mail.</li>
            <li> Before starting a new workout regimen I purchased this set to do semi-accurate measurements all-around. Easy to use and within ten minutes I had everything calculated out. The body fat pincher is a bit cheaply made but at this price I hardly hold it against it. I went with this set based on a recommendation from Tim Ferriss. I&#x27;d suggest doing a google search for &amp;#34;AccuMeasure&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;calculate body fat&amp;#34;. There&#x27;s a great spreadsheet out there you can use, along with these tools, to get fairly accurate measurements. In two months comes back and measure again to see actual change.</li>
            <li> 5 star quality stuff but the card only gives you directions for measuring skin fold at your belly. There is no instruction for multiple skin fold locations so you&#x27;re limited. The tape measure is a must have when taping any body part and the skin fold calipers are your standard quality item you&#x27;ll expect.</li>
            <li> It does what it is meant to do and is very cheap. Nice to have around for measuring progress. Seems fairly accurate but regardless can be used to see if you are losing fat or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought this because my weight fluctuates daily, but with this I can see that the fat levels don&#x27;t, and I can focus on muscle status.  One thing I can&#x27;t stand is the piece of paper that comes with the device that says everything between 4mm-5mm means 8.1% fat... Well, if I listened to this chart, I would never notice any change, it&#x27;s such a broad average.  I use the body fat calculators at:  [...] and [...]    These two sites recommend taking measurements from three locations on the body and then average the numbers, calculating a percentage.  I like this method best--especially since it says that my BF is half of what the chart says!    Anyway, this product is lost cost and well worth it.  If you are someone who is concentrating on fat loss, or muscle growth, you really need this because otherwise you really can&#x27;t tell what is going on with your body.  You might be trying to bulk up your muscle, but really only gaining fat--that&#x27;s no good!!    Get this, and then you&#x27;ll know all you need to know.</li>
            <li> I am constantly measuring myself and checking body fat percentage. My son broke my tape measure, so I bought this and it fit the bill perfectly!</li>
            <li> Simple tools and for the price, awesome! Gets the job done. The tape locks in place so you can get accurate measurements. The calipers are okay, nothing great, but again, for the price I paid, it&#x27;s sufficient.</li>
            <li> Pretty straightforward and easy to use. The directions for how to use the calipers to take a proper body fat % reading could be more clear.</li>
            <li> The tape measure is definitely higher quality than the fat caliper, but both work very well.  The fat caliper feels a little flimsy, and takes a somewhat sensitive touch to properly use it (i.e. detect/judge when the rounded plastic tip has snapped into the eye socket fitting, which dictates when you stop pinching the skin fold and check the thickness of the skin fold to determine your body fat).  But, after 2 or 3 attempts I was able to properly use the body fat caliper.  The tape measure, on the other hand, worked as expected, appears and feels to be a decent quality product, and was easy to use to measure the circumference of my thighs, arms, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to have while in the process of losing weight or maintaining. The tape measurer I value the most, definitely better than a sewing measurer.</li>
            <li> Feels somewhat flimsy/hard to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I have lost a lot of weight recently and I am really getting into excersing and weight lifting.  Whenever I entered my weight and height into a &amp;#34;body fat calculator&amp;#34; - it told me I had 27% body fat.  I didn&#x27;t believe this was true, especially because I started out at almost 30% body fat and I had lost over 20 pounds (from 147lbs to 125lbs) and almost 15 inches off my body.  I received this in the mail and I was extremely nervous to use it.  Needless to say - it was easy to use and I received the same measurement after 5 different measurements.  It marked me as 22%.  Not too shabby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the myotape -- it is a great tool and the fact that it comes with the caliber is great.  However, I think it is about .25 or .5 too short -- but maybe I am just doing it wrong.  I prefer the regular measuring tape.  I will still use this one when I travel because it is convenient and is retractable.</li>
            <li> Had to have a friend help me on this one, had never used them before and the directions were pretty simple but you need someone else to measure you!</li>
            <li> Great product, Work Great</li>
            <li> I wish I had this from the beginning of my journey from 300 lbs to 178 lbs today. This is a far more accurate, dependable, and affordable method of measuring fat than any electromagnetic scale I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I like and these two items come in handy for taking your own measurements as well as others in my group.</li>
            <li> works great. First time using products like this and don&#x27;t have any complaints. the body caliper has helpful, easy to follow instructions and the measuring tape is easy to use by myself. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with it especially I got it for a good price. It&#x27;s easy to use, the instruc card explains everything</li>
            <li> Seems accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for testing your body fat percentage. If you do it right, it&#x27;s accurate to within 1%.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on bioelectrical impedance testing machines because they can be horribly inaccurate.  Don&#x27;t rely on calculations based on height and bodily measurements as they are VERY inaccurate if you have any appreciable amount of muscle mass.  Forget the BMI method for the same reason.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers have commented on the \\&quot;cheap plastic\\&quot; this caliper is made of. Yes, it&#x27;s cheap plastic - but it&#x27;s not going to break with normal use. You don&#x27;t even have to be *that* careful - just don&#x27;t twist it or do something stupid with it.  It&#x27;s plenty sturdy for what it&#x27;s meant to do, with strength to spare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fairly easy to get consistent results with this, which is what counts most when you&#x27;re trying to lose fat. It took a few tries, but once I got used to it I was able to get measurements within less than 1mm, every time, over several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 3-6-12: My initial review expressed doubt as to the accuracy of this product. However, since then, I have found an online body fat percentage calculator that uses several measurements (waist, hips, forearm and wrist).  The online calculator and this caliper have matched within 0.5% every time I&#x27;ve compared them, so my confidence in the accuracy of this product has gone up significantly. I still can&#x27;t vouch for the overall accuracy of this caliper since I haven&#x27;t been weighed in water yet, but it&#x27;s reassuring to know that it&#x27;s accurate according to another independent source.  (Incidentally, the included MyoTape is very nice for taking bodily measurements, or even other round objects.)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent tool for your health arsenal. Easy to use and helpful. If you are considering something like this- don&#x27;t bother with electronic- KISS</li>
            <li> This product is a basic too but very relaiable, I would really reccomend it&lt;br /&gt;There is not much to tell but I am sure this is wut u need if u r into basic measurement tools</li>
            <li> I already own a digital scale with body fat reading and wanted to see how accurate those readings were.  After doing some research, i decided calipers would be the most accurate at home method i could use.  The item arrived quickly and was packaged without any issues.  Included are calipers and tape, which was nice since I could not only track body fat but also muscle gain too!  Build on the calipers were a bit flimsy (it is plastic after all) but still works perfectly fine.  For the price I didn&#x27;t expect much in this department.  As for the actual measuring: The biggest challenge was to perfect the measuring technique.  First couple of tries yield varying numbers but it gets better with practice. A chart is included to translate measurement into body fat percentage.  For a more accurate result, i suggest searching online for a multi-point measurement instead of the one location measurement the chart says.  Another advantage to this product is you can use it in private!  Definitely is a plus if you&#x27;re embarrassed to ask others or dont have friends comfortable with pinching you body fat (it does sound a bit awkward).  Overall though, a nice cheap way to measure body fat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price&lt;br /&gt;- Accurate results&lt;br /&gt;- Privacy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Learning curve&lt;br /&gt;- build quality&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those not wanting to spend a fortune testing body fat, I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Simple product makes it easy to get readings to help me get to my fitness goals.  The measuring tape makes self-measuring easy, since it just locks into place, and can retract with the push of a button.  The calipers take a little practice, but I think I have the hang of it.  The reading was similar to what I expected based on internet calculators, but now I have a firm point to start from.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> This item is 1-inexpensive 2-accurate if you use it correctly 3-Is all you need to do the job You can just buy the Caliper itself without the measuring tape, hwever the tape is handy and locks in place. The handy pocket size guide to easy to read and understand....I can say you might want to laminate the card for long lasting durabilty...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for a while and messed around with them at first to get the hang of them, but they are extremely helpful with keeping track of fitness progress. If you do not have anything like this already, get this!</li>
            <li> Not much here. Easy to use. The measuring tape is very easy as well. Have used it in a classroom setting at the university and students loved how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> I received it earlier then the date. I was very please with this item.  It is worth buying. I&#x27;m just teaching myself how to use it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased one of these for the body fat tester.  In that, I wasn&#x27;t entirely pleased because the instructions have you ONLY measure your waist.  I happen to have a small waist compared to the rest of my body and I do not store much fat there.  The bodyfat measurement is telling me I have 16-18% bodyfat, which is very low for a woman.  If you see me, you&#x27;d know that&#x27;s ridiculous.  Meanwhile, one of the &amp;#34;impedance&amp;#34; style ones will tell me 45% if it&#x27;s from my feet, or 24% if it&#x27;s from my arms.  I wish this measurer had directions for taking the body fat measurements from different parts of your body, and I know there is a formula to do this, but I don&#x27;t know if it will work with these calipers.  I&#x27;m not sure if the description of this device told you it was only for waist measurements, so maybe my expectations were incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had the myotape measurer for a while and this is my second one. I do love that - it makes it so much easier to measure yourself, especially in places like the thighs and upper arms.  You get a very accurate measurement.</li>
            <li> Must have tools for those looking to track their weight loss. Going by total body weight alone is not enough!</li>
            <li> The calipers are nice, but the act of measuring body fat via calipers is limited in accuracy. Perhaps very good users of this can get value out of it, but I think it just gives a very rough idea.</li>
            <li> If you are starting any exercise program (in my case P90X) this is a must.  its easy to use and works great.  If u take measurements every other week its amazing the difference you see even if you don&#x27;t lose any pounds on the scale.  Quality is decent and a must have.  received quickly from seller</li>
            <li> I just wanted a simple caliper and that is exactly what I got. As some people have said, use an online chart instead of the one that comes with it. The tape measure is also very convenient when trying to measure yourself. I love it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described.</li>
            <li> Love the tape; it makes keeping metrics on my body that much easier. The caliper is of low quality, but it measure consistently too. Overall a good low cost combo for home use</li>
            <li> Great for a very low price.  Nice just to throw in the gym bag and log your results.</li>
            <li> The tape measure is easy to use, especially when measuring circumferences (waist, leg, arm, neck). There is a button on the tape measure that will automatically tighten the tape so there won&#x27;t be any slack when measuring. I find this tape makes measuring body parts a lot easier than a traditional tape measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body fat caliper is slightly more intricate/complicated to use. Basically, make sure to read the included instructions before measuring. You need to move the line \\&quot;pointing\\&quot; things that are right next to the numbers all the way to the RIGHT, then press down lightly on the calipers to measure the fat, when you hear a slight click, let go and read the numbers. The attached sheet for body-fat percentages may not be that accurate in that it only takes into account one measure (the fat around your waist). I think it is better to go online, search for \\&quot;body fat calculator\\&quot; which will calculate your body-fat by taking into account measurements from other parts of your body (arm, thigh, back, etc). I think you&#x27;ll get a more accurate final number for total body-fat percentage that way rather than just measuring one site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this set also because the price is good. I don&#x27;t need anything super fancy. Just need to make measurements occasionally, and these work fine for me. Just be sure to use them properly, and don&#x27;t use too much force as you may accidentally break something.</li>
            <li> i like this fat tester, but i bought the omron fat loss monitor too. wit both i get a better reading</li>
            <li> This is the only caliper that I really trust. That *click* it gives you when you reach the correct pressure is reassuring. It also has a slide rule that records the reading for you, so you can use these by yourself if need be. Not oversized, I can use this one handed. I love it.</li>
            <li> Gave it five stars because it does what&#x27;s supposed to do and works great. I can measure body fat easily. Good Price too.</li>
            <li> I use these all the time.  I used the caliper to check my BF pretty regularly and it is a accurate as the measurements I&#x27;ve had done at the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the tape measure to self-measure for a custom wetsuit and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Seems poorly made but it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it hasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> I really like the measuring tape, but the fat tester doesn&#x27;t come with enough instructions about where to you should take the different measurements to get a better idea of your body fat percentage.</li>
            <li> Both items function as advertised.  The slider on the caliper makes it perfectly easy to read your own results while using these products alone, and the auto retract feature on the tape is a quick and efficient way to make sure you&#x27;re getting accurate readings.</li>
            <li> In less then a month the tape is tearing at the beginning. I am very unsatisfied and now I have to look for another to buy. Not happy at all</li>
            <li> Love the tape measure I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m using the calipers right but they are good for the price</li>
            <li> Perfect body fat package</li>
            <li> Easy to use! Takes pretty accurate readings. Worth the purchase. Has help me keep track of my bf percentage. A good buy.</li>
            <li> As Americans, we rely too much on scale weight as THE measure of health.  Percentage of body fat is MUCH more important.  These simple, effective, and accurate tools are all you need to translate what your scale says into what your weight actually means.  Highly recommend! (If you have difficulty using them, there are almost 100 instructional videos on YouTube.)</li>
            <li> Tape Measure is wonderful, durable, the calipers is pretty flimsy and doesn&#x27;t look like its going to hold up very long.</li>
            <li> This has worked great!  It&#x27;s not top of the line but does the job with no problems!  I would encourage anyone to buy!</li>
            <li> this is my second caliper set like this, and theres not a ton of accuracy with the locking lug audible click type thingamajig..&lt;br /&gt;but you can use this to get a set of averages that are fairly useful.</li>
            <li> It is a tape after all, no not much can go wrong - I like it has inch and cm, and the system to block in position is great for the difficult measurements</li>
            <li> I like the tape measure much better than a regular one because it locks in and cinches up for a more consistent accurate measure.  The Calipers take a little getting used to but for the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> caliper is a little weak but is a great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Unless you go online and find the 7 point measuring locations and get an average this is a ball park accuracy! good deal though.</li>
            <li> If you can pinch an inch, these can pinch alot or alot less than you were hoping.  They work very well!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this in the mail! It took me a little bit to figure out how it worked, but it&#x27;s really easy once you figure it out. Great tool and super useful!</li>
            <li> caliper and measuring tape worked good and gave an accurate measurement when used with 3 point body fat testing</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this. Looked cheap, didn&#x27;t think the caliper would be very accurate. While it isn&#x27;t 100% accurate, after learning how to use it, it&#x27;s within 1% of the bodyfat reading on the medical scale at my mothers house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Myotape alone is worth this purchase. I&#x27;ve been using a sewing tape for measurements, this is a vast improvement. Seller was fast, everything was in new condition, no hiccups. I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am still learning how to get really smooth but it&#x27;s works really well!&lt;br /&gt;It always matches up with my Omron fat loss monitor.</li>
            <li> Myotape was missing altogether.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Wish it came with a little case but nbd.</li>
            <li> My first impression: The fat measurer is a cheap and inaccurate piece of crap. I used it 5 times on the same spot as suggested and I got 5 different results. Anywhere for 12 to 20 % fat. On the bright side, the tape measure seems decent and you can use it with one hand, like for measuring biceps.</li>
            <li> the body fat caliper is very small and cheap. as you use it more the plastic begins to wear and becomes less accurate. the measuring tape is nice however and makes it worth buying.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how accurate this is since I haven&#x27;t been able to cross check it, but I believe it to be pretty accurate.</li>
            <li> Does what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with very simple and clear instructions and is super easy to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made me sad.</li>
            <li> The Myo Tape can be very frustrating to use. This would be a great product to use to measure your biceps by yourself. unfortunately, there is nothing to keep the tape connected to the handle except gravity so unless you&#x27;re holding the tape right side up, it&#x27;s pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Body fat tester works as expected. You definitely need practice to begin getting accurate, or at least consistent measurements. The measurement chart could be more precise. the body fat percentage can jump by 2% or more per line on the graph, and the graph is in 2mm segments. so a measurement of 6-7mm for a 40 year old man is 10.5% and 8-9mm is 12.7%.</li>
            <li> Readings are a bit inconsistent. I rely more on calipers.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I did use it a few times after a night of drinking (which the instructions say you shouldn&#x27;t); so I&#x27;m not going to rush to judge.</li>
            <li> The fat tester is great and it gives accurate measurement of body fat. I used it regularly to determine the body fat.</li>
            <li> This product comes as you see. I love the measuring tape and the ease of the use. the diagram helps you read you measurement readings. Great tool to help you keep on track with your fitness</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> I wanted the caliper, but thought that this combo was a good value.  The caliper works fine once you get the hang of it.  The myotape works, but is unwieldy and is now in a drawer somewhere - I think a simple sewing type tape measure works much better.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received my order, I tried to use the calipers on myself.  FYI - female users need to take a triceps measurement, which requires the help of a second person (this is NOT a problem with the AM-3000 calipers, it&#x27;s true of ALL calipers).  Once I had an accurate triceps measurement and had a chance to practice my other measurements, I realized I was actually getting consistent readings!  In other words - I was doing it correctly and getting accurate results.  If you&#x27;re not getting consistent readings, you may need to practice a little more (you may be measuring in slightly different spots or at the wrong point on the skin fold).  However, I did not use the directions or fat % charts that came with the calipers, as they are NOT going to give you accurate or consistent results.  The directions in the package said to measure a skin fold halfway between where you pinched the base of the skin fold and the top of the skin fold.  It&#x27;s very hard to measure exactly the same spot twice or even to know that you&#x27;re exactly at the halfway point.  So, I used the directions on a couple of different fitness websites: Pinch up as much skin/fat as you can, without pinching the muscle or getting muscle into the measurement.  Apply the calipers to the spot where you have separated the loose fat from the muscle (at the base of the skin fold) and squeeze very slowly until the &amp;#34;click&amp;#34; feature just barely makes the clicking noise.  If you go slow enough, you won&#x27;t squeeze the calipers any further after the click.  I also used fat % charts from some reputable fitness websites - the charts that came with the calipers are a bit high!  Overall, the calipers were easy to use (with a little help) and a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Very good quality for the price.  Easy to use.  Comes with chart that allows user to evaluate the percentage of body fat of both men and women.  Good tool for tracking weight loss and general health</li>
            <li> If you are a person who is wanting to loose weight and record your progress thenget this item. I really think these tools will help people in their weight loss goals.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to get what i paid for. The tape measure numbers were numbered wrong from the beginning so I couldn&#x27;t use it and the calipers were smaller than I expected. I ended up ordering again from someone else.</li>
            <li> It does help to self measure.</li>
            <li> The tape measure works just fine and is handy for getting your body dimensions by yourself. The caliper however is a bit of a pain to use unless you know what you are doing. I suggest Youtube for more information on how to use it rather than the index card sized instructions they provide.</li>
            <li> I love this tape measure because you can measure yourself.  I owned one before but the plastic end came off.  At this price, I don&#x27;t mind getting another one.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this if you&#x27;re prone to low self-esteem, otherwise go right ahead. I&#x27;m not all that skilled with calipers but I decided to give it a try since hydrostatic weighing isn&#x27;t available in my area, it&#x27;s expensive, and annoying.  I&#x27;ve used these several times and as long as I&#x27;m using them properly, they work just fine, I just don&#x27;t enjoy what it tells me.  I&#x27;m not overweight, I&#x27;m just not in the shape I used to be, so buy these if you&#x27;re trying to become a professional bodybuilder and the results won&#x27;t sting as much.</li>
            <li> This was kind of confusing to figure out, the instructions are clear but it is harder to do, which the instructions actually state.</li>
            <li> Caliper is a tad flimsy, but seems to work pretty well.  Good deal for the low cost.  Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can now easily figure out my body fat percentage! I have never used one of these before, it is helpful even if you haven&#x27;t use one before. I found out my measurements are 32.5&amp;#34; bust, 26.5&amp;#34; waist, &amp; 32&amp;#34; hips; it&#x27;s useful for helping me keep track of my progress.</li>
            <li> I got this scale as it was recommended by Mike Mathews of Bigger, Leaner, stronger. I was using another brand that required (4) measurements in different areas of the body and it required another person to get the readings as it did not have the scale slider that stops at the exact measurement. This scale has a slider that stops at the exact measurement and it clicks to tell you it is there. It comes with a chart that only requires the one measurement in millimeters and you can take the measurement yourself with no help needed. It also comes with a cool tape measure that also can be used solo and it&#x27;s accurate cause it has a button that you can push that retracts the tape after you secure the end in a holder so when you wrap the tape around your bicep for example, you can loosely put the tape around your bicep and then once it is set in the spot you want you can hit the retract button and it will contract and then you can get your reading.</li>
            <li> Awesome tool for measuring on your own.  Very easy to use and calculate.  Probably not the gold standard but a good way to track progress.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really simple to use.  When you hear or feel the click, stop sqeezing.  My only thing is that you can&#x27;t really tell if you&#x27;re squeezing 12 or 11 centimeters on the caliper, but that&#x27;s how the chart is organized.  So if it were, I would have devised some other measuring system...maybe a colored system so that you don&#x27;t have to guess the centimeters.</li>
            <li> I read the directions over and over and still don&#x27;t think i really understand how to use this. gave to my boyfriend to see if he could figure out. he couldn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> You pay for what you get. The caliber is made of such a cheap plastic that the lock doesn&#x27;t work. Flimsy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a couple years ago, but have only used it a handful of times when i first bought it 2 years ago and both items are no longer functional. the plastic handle off the tape measure tore off the other day as i gently pulled it out (I&#x27;m guessing its because the tape gets weaker as it ages) and the fat calipers are slightly warped which no longer clicks correctly and also makes it unusable.</li>
            <li> The caliper is fine but the tape started at the nearly 2 inche mark. The real problem is I was using it to track progress for several weeks before I realized it. Pretty ridiculous if you ask me.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to get a consistent, accurate reading, not because the product is defective or anything, it is just combersome to use and get the exact same pressure and the exact same place every time.</li>
            <li> great for tracking progress</li>
            <li> The body tester gives you different measures every time. It doesn&#x27;t work. But the tape is very good, and works great. I recommend to buy only the tape.</li>
            <li> The Accu tape doesn&#x27;t work correctly!  I&#x27;ve measured all sorts of things around my house with this and a regular measuring tape, and this always says less than it should be.  I think the length of the start is set incorrectly due to the way it loops around.  It was very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Came super fast through UPS (Amazon Prime) and does the job well. Once you hear the click your good. The tape is a nice addition since it can lock in place.</li>
            <li> Incredibly cheap and innacurate device. Don&#x27;t want your money. I&#x27;m a personal trainer and Fitness Technician, I&#x27;ve used all sorts of gadgets and some of them get pretty fancy and some of them are basic.  I assumed this product was obviously basic but it&#x27;s beyond useless.  I tried to use it and immediately noticed that you could not caliper under 10 mm,  which is a huge problem.  If I squeeze the caliper completely shut it gauges to about 6 mm. I can&#x27;t believe this product has such great reviews.  It&#x27;s garbage and you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money. Spend five or 10 more bucks to get a decent one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been improving my health and wanted to track my body measurements.  After looking at several expensive, high-tech options, I chose the AccuMeasure MyoTape and body fat tester kit.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!  The wrap-around tape measure fits nicely into a slot to hold it into place while you read the measurement.  The body fat test kit is straight forward and easy to read.  I recommend allowing a partner to measure and read the tape and body fat kit - it can be done single handedly, but is a bit cumbersome (for me, anyway). It&#x27;s old school reliable and doesn&#x27;t break down.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something quick and easy to determine my body fat.  Important things to remember, you can&#x27;t do the measurements yourself -- they&#x27;ll be wrong.  As humbling as it is to have my wife take my body fat readings, I compared them to the ones that my trainer took and they were pretty close.  I&#x27;d prefer to have my wife take my readings than my trainer currently.  I would definitely recommend buying.</li>
            <li> I bought this to measure my body fat % and i was hoping for a better measure than this. The product is flimsy and the tape is useless. Try getting a better one</li>
            <li> I am a person who loves to work out and currently do my best to watch what I eat.  I purchased this product to measure my body fat percentage.  I read the directions and did exactly what I was supposed to do, however, the item did not work correctly.  The major issue is the part that is supposed to click.  It did not click easily, therefore making it in a way painful to use.  I do not think it is supposed to be painful.  I also watched a video on YouTube and the clicking part is supposed to retract by itslef but I had to actually retract it physically.  Also the measurements seemed to be the same for everyone in my family when we are all different shapes and sizes.  Another reason why I think that this product is defective is that my measurements whould come out way too low.  Yes, I am not fat and consider myself to be in a good shape, however, the measurements I was getting were giving me bodybuilder type fat percentages and I have a small belly, so there is no way my body fat is below 10%.  Just does not seem possible.  Yes, perhaps the one I received was defective but this is the experiance I had with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape is actually pretty cool.  Nothing complicated and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I had a bad experiance with this item I am thinking of purchasing a scale that sends an electrical signal through the body.</li>
            <li> Works great, could include some more literature but I suppose anyone in the market for these should already know what they&#x27;re doing. The caliper can be a LITTLE difficult to read.</li>
            <li> This $9.10 (free shipping) purchase is one of the best investments that I&#x27;ve made along my fat loss journey. This is an essential tool and has helped me tremendously, because, scales lie! It&#x27;s easy to use, and comes with the instructions, and was recommended by the author of \\&quot;Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle\\&quot;, Tom Venuto. The tape measure makes it easy to take and read your measurements, and the quality it adequate for its intended purpose. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is keeping track of their body fat.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the calipers, I only got them because they came together with the tape measure.  I think the tape measure is a great idea, and you can measure by yourself (though it&#x27;s not that easy).  But the size of the plastic holder introduces a lot of error in measurement, especially if you&#x27;re fairly small.  If you really want to measure yourself with this MyoTape, be sure to hold the plastic at exactly the same place to reduce variability.  A regular tape measure will give you much more consistent measurements.</li>
            <li> There appear to be reviews for the tape measure and the calipers.  The tape measure works great, love it.  The calipers are completely useless.  You have to pinch the skin super tight, it hurts, which would be fine if the thing worked.  However, it pulls tight and then snaps, but does not take an accurate measurement.  I measured different parts of my body and the results were exactly the same, which is ridiculous.  Junk.  Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money.  I got the combo with the calipers and the tape measure, I would recommend the tape measure, but definitely NOT the calipers.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> The body fat tester is supposed to \\&quot;click\\&quot; when you have squeezed/applied sufficient pressure. The click holds it in place, then you can remove the tester from where it is pinching/measuring your fat, and you can view the measurement. Well half the time it doesnt \\&quot;click\\&quot; to tell you when to stop squeezing.&lt;br /&gt;great idea for self testing. Not so great in practice.</li>
            <li> Love the MyoTape.  FINALLY I can do it myself.  The caliper,  is measuring so much lower than the electric hand held.  Don&#x27;t know which to be skeptical of.  BUT - this is so easy to use!  If it is actually accurate - this is the BEST.</li>
            <li> Gave me my body fat percentage within seconds. Love the tape measure.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! I might even like this product more when I can actual see changes over time from exercising.</li>
            <li> Get what ya pay for I suppose.  Was off by 6% compared to professional fat loss test....</li>
            <li> This set is compact and light, so I can bring it during travel. It gives good measurement.</li>
            <li> The myotape was the reason I bought this. It came with a caliper for testing body fat, but isn&#x27;t very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still a decent deal for the tape, but I would have given 5 stars if they dropped the price and removed the body fat analysis caliper.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very good especially the meter tape. But it need experience to read correctly! I recommend it</li>
            <li> I only received 1/2 of the order, the myo tape never made it. The price seemed a little too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The calipers are easy to use and the measurement of them is ballpark accurate! The tape measure is great also because it stays tight to your skin and reads accurately! And this whole set is affordable!</li>
            <li> The Myotape is very cheap, but it&#x27;s ok for someone looking for a first-time kit, for the price. The calipers are ok though.</li>
            <li> For some reason I was under the impression that the caliper &#x27;locked&#x27; into a reading after the pinch has been made.  Perhaps I didn&#x27;t read the instructions correctly or got confused after reading too many reviews on too many different related products on Amazon, or both :)  In any case, seems to slide smoothly enough and with the aid of a mirror or some anticipatory positioning (?) should still serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> These are great and accurate tools that everyone into fitness and/or a healthy lifestyle should have.  They are cheap and work amazingly well for the price!</li>
            <li> It does the job, but I thought the build was slightly tacky, I&#x27;m worried about how long it&#x27;ll last. Everything works as advertised and it&#x27;s probably the best one can get at this price.</li>
            <li> Tape measure is cheap, its hard to use because the tape will slip and you cant measure with it. It can get tough to measure while it stays in the groove that&#x27;s about the only thing wrong with it, but if it stays in then it does what its meant to do</li>
            <li> This was a good product for the price I paid for it.  It is not as accurate as I hoped but it is easy to use and compact so I can take it with me when I travel to monitor my body fat.</li>
            <li> Pros: Inexpensive, accurate and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Caliper is fragile, manual shows only 1 way to measure body fat % (not really accurate)</li>
            <li> Is exactly as described at a great price.</li>
            <li> I use them every day and like the quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Works great. And the price could not be beat. Would recommend to a friend or family member.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to track my progess and this is easy to use and nice to see inches go down instead of just looking at a scale.</li>
            <li> convenient and easy to use</li>
            <li> i love this product.....  it is easy to use and comes with a little guide on where you should be...</li>
            <li> You get exactly what is advertised here, and it was just what I wanted. Tester is on point and the myotape is much easier then the old school tailor type ruler I used to use. By the way, down 2% body fat since I started getting back in shape and keeping accurate measurements with this. Seeing results using this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The MyoTape works well, but these are the lousiest, most flimsy calipers ever.  Never an accurate reading and very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is just an easy to use and accurate set of body measurement tools. It provides an accurate body fat measurement, which is more useful when trying to get in shape than your actual weight many times. Sometimes you will gain weight, but lose body fat and your weight gain can be misleading.</li>
            <li> Measuring Tape ripped 5 seconds after opening it. I barley got to use it on myself before the Myotape end ripped off!</li>
            <li> Tape is good, caliper is quite bad.</li>
            <li> The AccuMeasure MyoTape MT05 and AM-3000 Fitness 3000 Personal Body Fat Tester Kit is really a long way of saying, \\&quot;pinch-test calipers, easy-to-use measuring tape, and a sheet of instructions.\\&quot;  The advantage to the tool is that it easily and accurately performs the fat pinch test.  The MyoTape makes it really easy to measure your body without help:  wrap the tape around your waist, arm or leg, click it into the socket on the handle, and when you press the button it will retract to where you can take a good accurate measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The calipers are for the &#x27;pinch&#x27; part:  instructions explain how to use one hand to pull fat away from your abdomen and hold it while you &#x27;click&#x27; the calipers.  Unfortunately, the &#x27;click&#x27; doesn&#x27;t hold the measurement--it&#x27;s just an indicator that you&#x27;ve pressed hard enough--you want to read the calipers before attempting to pull them away.  The instructions suggest the opposite and this is confusing.  Your measurement needs to be a two-handed job:  lift the skin/fat away from the body with one hand and put the calipers on the pinched area with another.  With your thumb on the lever that you see in the picture, the &#x27;click&#x27; noise means you&#x27;ve pinched correctly and should read the measurement at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disadvantage to the tool is that the enclosed card focuses solely on the waistline pinch test:  it tells you to take the measure just above the hip bone on the right-hand side (this is called \\&quot;the Subprailiac pinch\\&quot;).  The enclosed chart gives you a body-fat measurement based on your age and this one measurement alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to use these tools to properly assess your body fat, I will add information for you in the comments to help you get the most out of the tool.  I took the multi-point measurements, plugged it into a simple website calculator, and got a precise answer of \\&quot;18.3%\\&quot;.  This worked much better for me than the ballpark number I get from the enclosed card and one measurement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For this Accumeasure bundle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.  The price is really cheap for what you get, and that makes this a good deal.  I still suggest using multi-point measurements and a website to run the numbers in order to have a more accurate assessment of your body fat.  I&#x27;ll include details for you in the comments below.&lt;br /&gt;For this Accumeasure bundle, it&#x27;s not a bad choice.

            <li> Super fast delivery! The caliper worked well, but the chart was a little off. I ended up looking it up online to see a better explanation of the chart based off of the series of measurements rather than just 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good, affordable caliper and measurement tape.</li>
            <li> Good Quality, Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use, however, the chart for correlating the measurements to body fat levels might be off... But in general, i like this product and recommend this.</li>
            <li> I gave this only three stars because I think the calipers are junk but I do love the tape measure that it comes with. For me, doing measurments can be frustrating. With a traditional measuring tape I always wonder if Im doing it correctly. This tape measures takes the guess work out for you.</li>
            <li> Simple, easy and cheap. As accurate as it can be.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should. No complaints here.</li>
            <li> The fat caliper itself is really simple and easy to use. The only problem I have with it is that I am not sure when the ball clicks into place when I use it. Also, it looks like a really fragile piece of plastic. The package itself comes with a how-to pamphlet with listings of body fat percentages corresponding to the measurement value for men and women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a 7 site skinfold measurement calculator to calculate my estimated body fat percentage. I feel that the more points you use, the better because you get more accuracy. Only using one point isn&#x27;t enough because some people carry more fat in the legs than their stomach, or some people carry more fat in their upper body than lower body, etc. People have differences, and using more skinfold sites can account for these differences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MyoTape is easy to use also. You just lengthen it, clip it in, put it around whatever you want to measure, and press the button until the excess tape is gone. I mostly just bought it for the skinfold caliper, so I do not plan on using the tape often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend taking three different measures of the same point, and averaging that out, and then using that number in a calculator or formula. this way, you can account for errors in process or errors in the certain location that you used. Using an average will make it more consistent.</li>
            <li> The caliper is sometimes hard to set up but the tape is great. Actually use the tape more often. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how accurate it is but it is definitly a good start for anybody who wants to track their progress.</li>
            <li> The calipers seem good and the tape measure is easy to use, but the instructions weren&#x27;t all that helpful for measuring body fat. The price was right, though. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The measuring tool was great, but the calipers we&#x27;re spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used the measuring tool, and someone else&#x27;s calipers to get our group&#x27;s BF</li>
            <li> Its no mcds but im loving it!..great product!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and does everything its supposed to do</li>
            <li> Cheap little plastic tool that works just perfectly! I don&#x27;t need a CNC machined medical device. I just keep it in the drawer and use it once in a while. It&#x27;s very easy to use. This site shows how a trainer would do it;  [...]</li>
            <li> Easy instructions and be a little tricky to use by yourself.  Understand that this is a tool for seeing how your body changes over time.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if all you need is to measure your % body fat. It&#x27;s good for personal use more than for professional. It&#x27;s a grat product for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Very affordable and gets the job done. Would definitely recommend anyone to buy this product. Shipping was fast, and items were perfectly packed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m getting started in personal training and I needed a product that I could use to practice taking body measurements with.  The calipers work, but the directions say that you need to squeeze them just until you hear it click.  The problem is it doesn&#x27;t always click, and you don&#x27;t always feel it click either.  Sometimes it does, but sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, so you have to pay close attention to make sure you know when it closes together.  The tape works ok too.  It does move back a little bit when you take it off, so it does seem that could skew your readings.  But altogether, for the price, this set works.  If you need something extremely accurate, I would suggest looking elsewhere.  For practice for me, these work.  I will be purchasing a higher quality one when I start actually working with clients.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with these calipers and make sure that you read the directions how to use them.  I have been seeing other comments about how it doesn&#x27;t zero.  There is a slider they use to measure and you don&#x27;t use it correctly it can throw the measurements off by a few mm.  At first I didn&#x27;t like the slider but its needed if your measuring an area that makes it hard to read the scale.  I used it against one of the digital fat calipers that you hold in your hands and they were within 0.5% of each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The measure tape was a big plus!  Makes it easy the measure waist, arms and whatever else easily by yourself.  It was a big surprise.</li>
            <li> Thank god I didn’t spend much for this product, wasn’t useful and looked very inexpensive. I have had it since summer and used it less thn 3 times.</li>
            <li> i like the product although i&#x27;m worried that the calipers will break. I would have liked more than one way to approximate your bodyfat. Good products for the price.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use for measuring yourself. Those time when you need someone else to hold it for you are gone. Then then fat caliper helps some much to show you improvement.</li>
            <li> a good buy, gotta master the pinch but worth it</li>
            <li> For anyone who actually knows how calipers work for measuring fat, these are rather poor.  The myotape, however, it excellent for measuring circumferences and is easy to use.  I&#x27;ve not had any problem with it.  I would buy this set for the myotape alone, unless you have some use for crappy calipers.</li>
            <li> Piece of trash broke after one use save your money avoid buying this</li>
            <li> great package, great product, timely delivery</li>
            <li> Works as described.  Using the Fat Calculator might be a bit of a challenge at first, but you can do it.</li>
            <li> I would spend the extra dough and get a sturdy version. The first day I used it the click that tells you the measurement had been achieved stopped working. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool if used with the proper instructions and calculations.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone that&#x27;s into sports, fit life, and body building.</li>
            <li> I use this every weekend to track my body fat %. The caliper is great, easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You can lookup online charts to calculate your body fat percent - this is the one&lt;br /&gt;I use:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple, yet essential tool for anyone trying to pack on muscle or loose&lt;br /&gt;fat. So many times I looked at the weight &amp; it just didn&#x27;t change compared to two&lt;br /&gt;weeks ago... but the fat caliper tells the story: was it muscle gain &amp; fat loss?</li>
            <li> This was advertised as &amp;quot;MyoTape AND Accu-Measure Fitness 3000&amp;quot;... There was no MyoTape tape included... ONLY the Accu-Meaures 3000 was included. I need the MyoTape also.  Bad sale... BUMMER!</li>
            <li> I always felt like I fumbled over the usual measuring tapes and was never sure I was getting it right.  This takes out the guess work.  I only wanted to Myo Tape, but the Body Fat tester was a nice bonus.  I have a lot of weight to lose and have just started exercising again.  I seem to be gaining more muscle, so am not seeing any downward movement on the scale.  With this I can see some progress.  Super easy to use and big enough for my 250 pound girth.</li>
            <li> Value for money. Will not regret the purchase at all. Keep in mind that it is plastic. Mayweather out in time.</li>
            <li> Works Great price and fast shipment. Instructions are easy to follow having the tape measure was great as well. Would tell anyone to order this product.</li>
            <li> Both the MyoTape and body fat tester work perfectly out of the box and have given me accurate measurements.  I would recommend these to anyone looking to observe their body fat and or measurements as they either slim down or bulk up.</li>
            <li> The measuring tape is great.  To use the Fat tester you have to follow the direction and if you are over a certain size it&#x27;s actually useless.</li>
            <li> On the retractable band, it constantly slips out and closes. It takes a lot of practice to get used to. Good product for the price though.</li>
