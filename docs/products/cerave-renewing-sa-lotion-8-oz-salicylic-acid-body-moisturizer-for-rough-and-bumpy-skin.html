            <li>the price was great</li>
            <li>In generaly they have a great product line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year and the results are great.</li>
            <li>I have been extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>, so i  tried it on my hands and calves, and it was great.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working great for that as well</li>
            <li>Really great lotion.  </li>
            <li>It feels great, esp in winter.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Great Price.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li>and I am really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Works great on skin where it has buffed by the micro - pedi callus remover.</li>
            <li>The cleanser is a great product too.</li>
            <li>I am seeing great improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>Great lotion.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great to heal the hands but it also appears to be thinning out and normalizing the skin.</li>
            <li>It has a great smell, doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume, not stickly or oily.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t just moisturize (although it did a great job at that too...); my arms were smoother within a couple of days.  </li>
            <li>My DERM recommended this lotion and I tried it and it works great.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great, I use it every night</li>
            <li>This lotion works great</li>
            <li>Love all Cerave products!!</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this and its very nice.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very nice and silky now</li>
            <li>This is very effective and smoothing.</li>
            <li>The packaging is also very nice.</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This cleared my body acne from working out, amazing!</li>
            <li>one of the best, better then pricey brands</li>
            <li>Love it best sink cream i have ever used</li>
            <li>I have noticed a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li>But using it once a day has made a visible and remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>, so I&#x27;m sure the results are not the best they could be.</li>
            <li>This is a great line of products that I plan to continue using for many years!</li>
            <li>I already knew I loved this lotion</li>
            <li>It has good consistency, and has no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li>My skin is serverely sun damaged after 40+ years but for the time CeraV is doing a really good job.</li>
            <li>once i used this i loved it..</li>
            <li>Good price -- god product</li>
            <li>The  price is good</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light moisturizer that make you skin look and feel awesome...</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>One review docked it a star for not \\&quot;curing\\&quot; a chronic skin condition, which I don&#x27;t think is fair.</li>
            <li>Good product, as advertised.</li>
            <li>This is a good moisturizing lotion, but it has not smoothed out any of the bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>and this is supposedly a good treatment for the condition.</li>
            <li>but it is good.</li>
            <li>It does feel good when rubbed in.</li>
            <li>I bought it for stucco keratoses, but I can&#x27;t tell that it got rid of them, but it is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have rosacea, a mild case thankfully, and this lotion (along with the hydrating cleanser) makes my skin look beautiful!  </li>
            <li>Light but very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Nothing great but an okay product.</li>
            <li>SA lotion also shares these nice attributes, good feel, no smell.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this lotion!</li>
            <li>but she let me know that she did in fact see results and was very happy with her smoothing skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I first tried this product I could not wait to review it.</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Cerave products!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED SOO MANY PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS LOTION!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Just sharing the love!</li>
            <li>amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>CeraVe SA Renewing Skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>They are amazing products and have done wonders for both my husband and I.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find out it worked.</li>
            <li>Anyway,  I also use 5% BP on my face as a spot treatment, but I thought it would be nice to use something that is supposed to help before spots show up.  </li>
            <li>While it does not irritate my skin or burn, it also doesn ªt seem effective.</li>
            <li>This SA (Salicylic Acid) lotion is nice to rotate in to my routine to keep the skin cells turning over.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li>This product is the absolute best had lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It keeps working 3 days into the application and leaves your skin really nice.</li>
            <li>I do see one reviewer with her own website describing the feeling as being WAXED.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m just amazed at how great this lotion is and how significant the results are.</li>
            <li>Best purchase, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Great moisture replacement and helped smooth out most of my skin bumps and irritated areas.</li>
            <li>ive gotten so many compliments on my face that it is smooth and hydrated.. great lotion</li>
            <li>I was also glad to see that unlike the moisturizing cream this also absorbs better into the skin to allow me to wear it under liquid foundation!</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and best part is it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle and have to say, my skin is soft and happy!</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing lotion.  </li>
            <li>The results have been near perfect skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>We tried all three, but Cerave was the most effective.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I am now using the face lotion and body wash as well - both of which are great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t real sure I liked this when I first used it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great and works really well!</li>
            <li>It goes away quickly so that is good &amp; is not anything that will take away from the positives on it.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love the way this lotion absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this lotion again and honestly I am very happy I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>My daughter&#x27;s skin is finally smooth after 6 years!</li>
            <li>Renewing Lotion does all it promises and more.  </li>
            <li>Love this cream as keeps my skin from itching now that I&#x27;m going through menopause.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and the effect</li>
            <li>I also had a prescription steroid cream, but feel like the Cerave SA Lotion worked better for me in reducing the itchiness than the steroid lotion did.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased &amp; gratful.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>My arms look much better.</li>
            <li>MY skin is even toned now and Healthy.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Better price.</li>
            <li>For anyone frugal, or looking to heal more severe skin problems, I would say pass.</li>
            <li>Great hydration for the whole body.</li>
            <li>that still moisturize my skin as too many of the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; options don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I listened.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks better than it has in years</li>
            <li>I use CeraVe AM Lotion already and was needing to order some more</li>
            <li>All  Cerave products are awesome especially for problem skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worked like magic.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>After a week or two, my skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li>A year later, my skin is now the best it has ever been.  </li>
            <li>My hands look sooo much better and feel smoother.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but not as exfoliating as the LA in Amlactin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will keep getting better with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much better.</li>
            <li>and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The more you use it the better it works.  </li>
            <li>I returned that product, but love all the others.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but as I say, the experts love it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>its not a cure all, but it sure helps more than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this lotion and it works.&lt;br /&gt;The car looks and feels must better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with this lotion for getting rid of the red bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>He said &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe we haven&#x27;t seen a commercial on this product.&amp;#34; Maybe they put all the money towards having an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I have also purchased the facial cleanser (awesome) and will continue purchasing all CeraVe products.</li>
            <li>, I think the lotion did more for clearing up my bumpy skin than that of the body wash.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>after day of use, my skin is better and lovelier and I&#x27;m sticking my legs out at people.  </li>
            <li>The more soap the more skin pain</li>
            <li>The more soap the more skin pain</li>
            <li>I use it 3-6 times a week and really love the results.</li>
            <li>Having tried a lot of hand creams, I figured this was just one more</li>
            <li>One of my most favorite body lotions</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>The cream is better than the lottion.  </li>
            <li>I also use the eye cream and moisturizers on my face, which are excellent and rival products that cost several times what they do.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>In looking for a more affordable alternative I found</li>
            <li>After using this and their hydrating cleanser for one week the difference I see in my skin in phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I sound like an infomercial, but this is just an amazing result from one use.</li>
            <li>and I love the hydration benefits.</li>
            <li>This product does a MUCH better job and is A LOT CHEAPER.</li>
            <li>but this is better.</li>
            <li>This one is for whole body, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great</li>
            <li>, there are a lot better creams for body.</li>
            <li>I do like that it does not have a smell to it, much better than those urea creams I was trying before..</li>
            <li>I truly love the CeraVe</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>This helps my KP better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li>Great price but really high shipping.  </li>
            <li>It took a couple weeks, but everything cleared up, my skin is super soft, not irritated, and looking very happy.  </li>
            <li>This lotion keeps my feet looking pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lotion I have tried and used in as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin and is very light for the moisturizing it delivers.</li>
            <li>better than aveeno for kids with very dry skin, but aquaphore is still the best</li>
            <li>But if you are anything like me, it is definitely worth a shot!!</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry feet.</li>
            <li>This is the best product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for my dry skin</li>
            <li>This is the best product for money; amazing change in my skin, smoother texture, less fine lines &amp; skin tone is evening out.  </li>
            <li>Great lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff soft skin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer lotion for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Skin looks healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>right after I get out of the shower, but have not been 100% effective at doing that</li>
            <li>This is truly an exceptional product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>They absorb easily and leave the skin moisturised.</li>
            <li>Easy spreading.  </li>
            <li>so I thought it would be easy to fix.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how the lotion comes off easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cerave is recommended by dermatologists, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li>This lotion is creamy, absorbs well, and does not have any strong odor.</li>
            <li>kind and use it on my body, not face, and like it very much.  </li>
            <li>also tried using it as a full body lotion but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am able to full use my hands again at work without worrying about them bleeding or cracking while I work.</li>
            <li>Best I have tried for my dark circles and particuly puffy bags.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I use it on myself too!</li>
            <li>Very good product for over dry skin areas.</li>
            <li>This works great - nice &amp; thick but absorbs great &amp; helps make my skin look so much healthier.  </li>
            <li>Also, there is barely any scent, which is nice if you want to add your own.</li>
            <li>but then it was fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great body lotion but also light enough for a hand lotion also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Cerave SA for about 3 weeks now, and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The rest of my body responds best to heavy moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Some people find the scent disagreeable, but I find it light and not offensive.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with the fast service.  </li>
            <li>This soaks in almost immediately and leaves my skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>They now feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>works great for keratosis pilaris of the skin, use it twice daily on the affected skin, it does work wonders</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>: it makes my skin smooth and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how well this worked and how cheap it is.</li>
            <li>i like fragrance- free stuff</li>
            <li>and I am still itch free this year because I&#x27;m using the Cerve Sa after every shower.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would re-do the formula to make it paraben free.</li>
            <li>Feels fabulous.</li>
            <li>My skin is so smooth and hydrated like never before.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy/icky.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get Amlactin on subscribe and save, but this product is available.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin smooth and bump free</li>
            <li>My husband loves it for his feet, as do I., I use it on my face before makeup and find it aids the smooth application of addition makeup.</li>
            <li>I took him to a dermatologist and the doctor recommended this lotion in addition to two others (and gave us free samples).  </li>
            <li>lotion is fabulous.</li>
            <li>Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li>did not get a free sample from somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell my hands feel pulled and my cuticles aren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell my hands feel pulled and my cuticles aren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like a nice creamy lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell like Amlactin, and really works.</li>
            <li>But being a Amazon prime member, its shipped free and I get it in two days and save myself a couple dollars to boot...</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended it to smooth skin, which it does within reason.  </li>
            <li>My legs have never been this smooth.</li>
            <li>lotion offers good coverage without being too oily, and is readily-absorbed.</li>
            <li>Let me add that I am not talking about young skin that looks good anyway, 55 years.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a good lotion, but I don&#x27;t notice anything about it that really justifies its higher price tag.</li>
            <li>I eventually was able to add a very gentle makeup (alimapure, for anyone wondering).  </li>
            <li>Totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Even though, it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Apply at night, and in the morning, my skin is significantly smoother and the appearance of bumps are lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was originally told that they were incomplete hair follicles.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, I will be buying again!</li>
            <li>Non greasy but rich and softening.  </li>
            <li>Also this is so much more affordable then buying it in stores where they charge twice as much !</li>
            <li>But so much better than it was, it isn&#x27;t even funny.  </li>
            <li>Its on the spendy side but its worth every cent!</li>
            <li>My doctor said it could take about 2 months to see any significant results.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this item for myself, after being diagnosed with keratosis pilaris by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>However, I have noticed a significant change in the texture and appearance of my arms.</li>
            <li>CeraVe please answer our prayers and make this in a bigger bottle (12oz would be ideal like your Hydrating Cleanser) because now I use it on my body and as an every day facial moisturizer because it is that amazing.</li>
            <li>CeraVe SA did not cause any noticeable reduction in my KP at all; however, it significantly moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li>I have really dry skin - this stuff works great</li>
            <li>Leaves skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>This SA lotion is light, absorbs quickly and does not leave a shiny residue like others, and does not have any distracting scent.</li>
            <li>It works really well and is great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Did a great job clearing up a winter rash on my leg as well as helping with dry skin on my face without casing acne.  </li>
            <li>Great Lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It penetrates quickly and leaves the skin extremely smooth with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing cream would be perfect for someone with somewhat dry normal skin.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, is easy to apply, and soaks right in, besides having ceramides which dermatologists recommend.</li>
            <li>I special ordered &amp;#34;super-sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Have had bargain basement lanolin, glycerine, wax, petroleum, pure shark oil, cocoa butter to $500 sheik store gator oil, emu, copper, meadow foam, sea biologicals, niacin complexes in stunning jars to custom doctor urea lactic acid concoctions, you name it.  </li>
            <li>It has been reliable for me ever since and it still rings true.</li>
            <li>and it still rings true.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want any PARABENS, this is full of them&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and it makes them nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It is very effective at moisturizing my very dry legs, heels and elbows.</li>
            <li>I would say this is best for someone with an ample wallet and not too sensitive skin, who just wants to turn their normal/dry skin super soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>Great product for my very dry skin!</li>
            <li>Great---I use mainly on lower arms &amp; back of hands, but love using on my face---which my dermatologist said wd be good.</li>
            <li>This has most likely  helped in speeding up the healing of my skin; however, I can also tell a great difference between the effects of this lotion and the other lotions I have used over the many years that I have been into makeup and skincare.</li>
            <li>I quickly researched for moisturizers and was debating between Cetaphil and Cerave.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Cerave has made a tremendous difference</li>
            <li>I saw it on sale at target and quickly snagged it.</li>
            <li>no burning like glytone and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has no smell, absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does work, although not as well as Avon&#x27;s Skin Bump Minimizer, which unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li>and this stuff beats that line hands down for a fraction of the price, plus many more ounces!</li>
            <li>I HAD NEW SKIN that is lovely.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user and feel that it is well than worth the price.</li>
            <li>It has no smell and is absorbed really quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Its really good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>great just what i wanted it really helps with the dry skin that i have thank you for responding so quickly</li>
            <li>It did take a good month or so of daily application to see a consistent difference</li>
            <li>Works exactly as described; delivered promptly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;For the first time in my life, the bumps are gone!</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it available and so quickly</li>
            <li>Excellent for extra dry bumpy skin recommend for my child by our dermatologist in combination  with  aqualant.</li>
            <li>It works great, but it is messy.</li>
            <li>Really soaks in and leaves her skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s a great lotion, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait till it soaks in.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Be advised, you may want to apply sunblock after this has been absorbed before spending some time outdoors, or wear a hat.</li>
            <li>Worth the money as it has worked well.</li>
            <li>This lotion is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not only do they look better, but they also feel smooth like the skin on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how clear and smooth my face is!</li>
            <li>and it honestly is making a big difference for me.</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but oh, so worth it.</li>
            <li>a sudden my family doctor consults his own dermatologist and says something like a product called chervey or something contains Salicylic Acid and works for people like me.  </li>
            <li>I will buy this lotion again and again, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I liked this enough to post this to my friends and family on facebook:  </li>
            <li>and it was worth it.</li>
            <li>However, this one is a success.  </li>
            <li>I have been way more conscious about applying the lotion to my arms and legs right after I shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Esthetician and this is easily one of my favorite dry skin lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li>It was also highly rated by SweetHome.com, which is my starting point for finding good stuff for the home.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The GR treatment worked far better than the best steroids (decade of them too) but leaves skin aged, darkened and so dry I have no words.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and you can see the skin rejuvenate right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a hint of a lotion smell unless you put your nose right on it.&lt;br /&gt;Not a hint of shiny on your legs when it dries&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes me rinse it right off</li>
            <li>Makes me rinse it right off</li>
            <li>I saw noticeable results right away.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for that,  but will keep searching for the right products for my face.</li>
            <li>It worked great, but I have trouble finding the exact one at the store (Sa), and its pricey.</li>
            <li>Great body lotion for very dry sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Cosmetically &amp; medicinally, salicylic acid acts as a keratolytic, comedolytic, and bacteriostatic agent, causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again by constricting pore diameter, and allowing room for new cell growth.  </li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of special lotions and creams that my dermatologist recommended, but none of them ever made much of a difference.</li>
            <li>An excellent product that achieves what no other had in the past.  </li>
            <li>We tried this Cerave lotion before looking into the more expensive types and we&#x27;ve been very pleased!</li>
            <li>I use it right after a hot shower</li>
            <li>Amazing product for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Amazing for dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li>When I put on make up, you can see them even more which makes me very self conscious.</li>
            <li>Bought this lotion to help with dry skin and to make my arms look nice for my wedding.</li>
            <li>: very sensitive skin (can&#x27;t even use popular mineral foundation blushes without rashy reactions); have had mild to moderate acne for over 10 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>My skin doctor prescribed this lotion; This price is much better than any of the local stores.</li>
            <li>and I still see big results :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying this lotion</li>
            <li>a key ingredient for healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>Noticed improved first use.  </li>
            <li>And it did from the first use.</li>
            <li>It has mineral oil, just to be aware</li>
            <li>I first tried Cerave Sa when my dermatologist recommended it</li>
            <li>Make sure you use sunscreen at all times especially with a product with Sacylic Acid</li>
            <li>both have the exact ingredients except nivea does not have</li>
            <li>This is my first time using it</li>
            <li>I had doubts at first that this would work.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>you need to make sure you get the Cerave SA not the regular Cerave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keeps my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now my hands are MUCH improved since Day One of use!</li>
            <li>my bumps are pretty much gone!</li>
            <li>my skin was luxuriously soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion daily and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li>My skin feels incredibly soft, smooth and silky after applying Cerave SA.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I really love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li>AND IT IS THE FIRST LOTION THAT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the eczema any more than the regular Cerave Lotion.</li>
            <li>Turns out this is the real deal - non-greasy, easily absorbed, and it works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so ready for sandals now!</li>
            <li>This works - if you are consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li>It is very good for rough dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Its expensive, but its great to have normal skin, for the most part, again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most people with normal skin would consider these heavy.  </li>
            <li>As recommended by my dermatologist, this is a GREAT moisturizer, especially for the feet and elbows or anywhere with rough skin.</li>
            <li>I liked its softening effects enough that I was using it as a body lotion after the shower, but you have to use a LOT of it to \\&quot;liberally\\&quot; cover the skin, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; across the skin</li>
            <li>Be very cautious at first</li>
            <li>I began to cry the next day because I was so happy and didn&#x27;t have to apply it 10 times a day like the other</li>
            <li>The bumps were not as big and her skin is finally becoming smoother every day.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing, and I plan to buy another one as soon as I finished this, my first, bottle.</li>
            <li>Before I used it, I would have cracks that bled throughout the dry months of winter, but not any more.</li>
            <li>makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I love all of the Cerave products for my severely dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;CeraVe seems more formulated for rosacea, dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>i have always had dry skin and NOTHING has helped my skin more than this product.</li>
            <li>Now, to be fair, I purchased this lotion, applied for several days (as I would with the normal lotion) and after going back and reading some reviews about skin smoothing/bumps disappearing</li>
            <li>I am a new fan of the CeraVe line, but I purchased this in hopes that like with many others, it would help the KP problem on my upper arms.</li>
            <li>When applied liberally it really does soften the skin and make it super soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly let my dermatologist know how much I like it.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and absorbs easily like other daily moisturizers but is more hydrating.</li>
            <li>My elbows and knuckles are like those of a newly born child and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the utter smoothness and incredibly vibrant, healthy look of areas of my body</li>
            <li>Getting a recommendation from a dermatologist was a real vote of confidence for the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>One thing I do not care for is it is very greasy.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>This really softens skin.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it moisterizes my face and body and stays on the whole day..</li>
            <li>My dermatologist told me to try it for my aging teflon fingers (I can&#x27;t shuffle paper) &amp; it seems to really help.</li>
            <li>It has really made a measurable difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and really softens the skin.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very stubborn eczema</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery</li>
            <li>and we both really like it.  </li>
            <li>I finally feel comfortable going out, I don&#x27;t feel like everyone is staring at</li>
            <li>No matter how much lotion I would put on nothing would work.</li>
            <li>but it does REALLY WORK.</li>
            <li>Plus, the added benefit of absolutely no fragrance makes this a winning choice for me.</li>
            <li>Someone even commented to me that I really needed to get in the sun.  </li>
            <li>Since I have very itchy/dry skin in the winter, I have probably tried every lotion there is out there.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t a cure, but is very helpful in keeping my skin softer.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say anything regarding that, but I have tried their lotion without the SA (salicylic acid) on my face and it works really well.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>Did not feel or react like the real product.</li>
            <li>Expected more from this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this.  </li>
            <li>very dissapointed about it, i didnt saw any change on my skin by</li>
            <li>AND THIS IS REALLY HELPING.</li>
            <li>I have really noticed difference all over...</li>
            <li>No I&#x27;m not doing the whole loofah routine, just plopping it on and rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>and like I said that it does readily.  </li>
            <li>and like I said that it does readily.  </li>
            <li>Really made my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For once, a product that really works.....</li>
            <li>For once a product that claims to be a moisturizer really performs as the product claims.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is not offensive or very noticeable which is a plus for me.  </li>
            <li>I usually notice an improvement after using a new product but then that goes away fairly soon.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>With most other lotions, you&#x27;d probably have to apply the lotion every day just to get close to the effect that this lotion provides.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried the &amp;#34;skin renewing&amp;#34; lotion, and let me just say  WOW!</li>
            <li>With those properties plus Cerave&#x27;s moisturizing properties, it allowed my skin to clear up very fast and better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth continuing to spend more money on it.</li>
            <li>As a disclaimer, I will say that since I first began using the Cerave brand, I stopped wearing my daily full-face makeup mainly due to my reaction to the other lotion, and have been mostly foundation and powder free since the summer of 2013, except for my wedding and special events.</li>
            <li>With dry winter months upon me I wanted something that would work without feeling heavy and greasy, and this stuff if great.</li>
            <li>absorbs quickly and really makes a difference when applied daily after shower.</li>
            <li>for the first time in my adult life where i did not have issues with my skin.</li>
            <li>The other thing I like about it is that it absorbed quickly and does not make your hands sticky.</li>
            <li>Really like the new packaging</li>
            <li>Great for my tired, old skin and not too oily.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this lotion in particular.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I would get red bumps, that look like my skin is super irritated.</li>
            <li>No greasy feel, absorbs quickly, and, with regular use, improved my hands&#x27; look and feel.</li>
            <li>After only using for two days my arms and legs have not been so soft and smooth since I have been a teenager.</li>
            <li>no longer feels tight or peeling :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for targeted treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Since high school, I always had problem skin on my face.  </li>
            <li>I prefer scented lotions - but this came highly recommended by my dermatologist, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with rosacea or a butterfly rash on the face.</li>
            <li>The 2nd week my skin was becoming smooth again &amp; after 30 days, no more scales or crustys.</li>
            <li>this works great and unlike all the others i have tried doesn&#x27;t smell like cat pee or isn&#x27;t outrageously expensive</li>
            <li>A patient told me a few months ago about a great lotion her dermatologist had recommended, and I finally tried it last night.</li>
            <li>For me it simply works and therefore is worth the money</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>I rarely get pimples anymore and only treat my skin with the SA Renewing Lotion and Alba Botanical Acne-Dote</li>
            <li>After a few days, I continued to see more improvement.</li>
            <li>The lotion does have some salicylic acid in it, which I&#x27;ve normally seen in products for clearing up acne.  </li>
            <li>but if you have skin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;, as I do on the back of my arms, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - this has all the perks of the normal lotion with the additional benefits of skin smoothing (also going to try this on my face)</li>
            <li>it is thick but smoothes on face nicely..</li>
            <li>While it is a fine lotion, I do not see the benefit of this one in paticular over their other lotions.</li>
            <li>All of this brand&#x27;s products have time release ceramides and sll sorts of other good stuff you would find in something much more expensive.</li>
            <li>I am in such disbelief, but when I look in the mirror the proof is right there.</li>
            <li>but luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t linger around too long after you apply it.</li>
            <li>(have always had little bumps ever since I can remember) - and THE BUMPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GONE!</li>
            <li>An I have gotten a rash from using a new medicine and once I started using the lotion after a couple of days.</li>
            <li>And every day I check for new zits</li>
            <li>so I went on Amazon and saw this new Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I looked on the CeraVe website to ask for a new pump but the site was unavailable.  </li>
            <li>(Tried a variety of natural, homemade, high-priced, and drug-store brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CeraVe absorbs fast, leaves no greasy or sticky residue, and hands stay soft even after washing them.</li>
            <li>I use it on my legs, on my arms, on my face, even my rough elbows end up smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of this visible pore issue, but my arms are much softer and nowhere near as bumpy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered with super dry skin for decades.  </li>
            <li>enough I find what he meant and its Cerave (there is a different company with a shhh sound that does make a SA Steroid prescription product so not them).  </li>
            <li>However, know it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; very far.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky residue so you can dress right away.  </li>
            <li>The appearance of my KP is reduced and my skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li>This is everything for my adult acne skin!</li>
            <li>and I only wish I had been made aware of it decades ago.</li>
            <li>I have used many products and I can say this no is no better then any others except non greasy</li>
            <li>Recently I went to a dermatologist for the first time and she recommended this lotion.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I have tried COUNTLESS lotions and potions to try &amp; get rid of the KP bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>I got this to see if it would be better than the other leading brand of a similar product</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion I have bought that actually does what the front of the bottle says it will do.</li>
            <li>the was more bumble :/</li>
            <li>After literally 20 years of trying different lotions, vaseline with socks on my hands at night, steroid creams and ointments, this is the ONLY thing that has ever made a significant difference on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I first learned about CeraVe from my dermatologist who suggested I use their AM/PM facial lotions after suffering with acne and dryness.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t believe it because typically diatribes like this sound like a 2AM</li>
            <li>The first day I applied as frequently and as much as possible.</li>
            <li>My 4-year old daughter has keratosis pilaris (white/red bumps) on the back of her arms that is pretty severe.  </li>
            <li>A little dab goes a long way, so the value is much better than products that much be lathered on to have any effect.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff helps with the little fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>After a few days of using this, I have already seen a significant difference, particularly on her cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a rare exception in that my acne prone skin is sensitive and gets so dry</li>
            <li>I woke up with extremely dry, flaky skin around my eyes and my right eye was swollen</li>
            <li>Works well.put it on at night, in the morning and right after shower before dry to  lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, after a week of using the product each night, the bumps still reappear - a nature of the chronic skin condition, no doubt - so just be mindful that regular use and a large dose of patience is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smooth skin is worth the slight burn and it only lasts a short minute.</li>
            <li>We live in hot, dry low desert area, and this lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m elated to say I still see clear skin.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t 100% clear of bumps</li>
            <li>Works like a charm to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>But I had really hoped this product would completely rid me of KP all together with regular use, as KP Duty did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying everything to clear it up,  </li>
            <li>I went to two different podiatrists about it and neither one had any real suggestions.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still there so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and has dramatically improved my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Both hands and feet feel so soft now.  </li>
            <li>i swear it has improved my 66 yr old skin..</li>
            <li>i was surprised..</li>
            <li>But, my 5-year-old daughter has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>but my hands felt soft but not sticky.</li>
            <li>Upon application, the healing action could be clearly sensed and after a week the renewal could be verified.  </li>
            <li>I am a 38 year old man.</li>
            <li>I am  25 years old and have had continuous acne  </li>
            <li>It makes our skin feel soft and hydrated</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li>it really works ...not tomorrow, not next week, NOW.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It keeps hands soft all during the day despite using hand soaps and hand sanitizers</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old and have never had acne or skin issues.</li>
            <li>This lotion will reduce your skin bumps in two days and nearly eliminate them in one week.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy cream,  yet moisturizes like one.  </li>
            <li>Have used all the natural oils and fruits chemicals out there.  </li>
            <li>My Dermatologist recommended Cerave SA and WOW.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t fall asleep because i&#x27;m so busy scratching them.</li>
            <li>and I only use it for the bumps, not for moisturizing my whole body.  </li>
            <li>but some people might be sensitive to that</li>
            <li>(although I have sensitive skin, and had no issues).</li>
            <li>Goes on soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my arms definitely looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>Keeps the skin soft as long as it is used consistently</li>
            <li>I heard the effect is good, but I bought it by the wrong season.</li>
            <li>This lotion is the ONLY ONE to clear up her skin!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking with non greasy, plain young and smooth both to the touch and to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After three days my skin was back to normal!</li>
            <li>Since i&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are less noticeable, and my skin looks better overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my son&#x27;s body eczema, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this is better than the regular Cerave Lotion.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different moisturizers including super expensive ones.</li>
            <li>lotion feels totally different than regular Cerave, it&#x27;s a gross feeling on my face, very heavy, but after one day my skin looked better, so I switched to applying it at night after the first time.  </li>
            <li>He first gave me a sample for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li>This personally worked for me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>No other lotions or creams have seemed to help except for this one!  </li>
            <li>- it says it has Invisible Zinc that dries clear, but it most definitely left me looking pale and white.  </li>
            <li>I have no financial interest in this product, but simply wanted to share the info to anyone who experiences significant dry skin, eczema, cracking hands in the winter, etc.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the reaction it caused stopped after discontinuing the lotion and though it&#x27;s taken time to heal, there have been no more breakouts</li>
            <li>Part of my ritual to keep anything that canirritate my hands off my hands and that includes the frequent soap you have to use if you handle food with your bare hands.  </li>
            <li>that includes the frequent soap you have to use if you handle food with your bare hands.  </li>
            <li>I was even using prescription gel and ointment on the Karatosis Pilaris on my upper arms and it wasn&#x27;t until I stopped them both and started using this, that I saw significant improvement and relief from a particularly rough and itchy patch!!</li>
            <li>The very next say I saw improvements from my new appearing acne.</li>
            <li>I guess it really does exfoliate dry skin as it promises on the label.  </li>
            <li>It helped a bit with my Keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms, but the back of my legs not so much.</li>
            <li>and then it fails the very part of my body in the most agony.  </li>
            <li>and then it fails the very part of my body in the most agony.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product with high expectations since I have really bumpy rough skin on my upper arms.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin sort in general!</li>
            <li>They both have salicylic acid, so I  guess that&#x27;s one of the major factors in making them work.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li>I am normally the type to go for organic / natural type products that smell fruity, but a dermatologist recommended CeraVe products to me when I went in with overly dry skin.  </li>
            <li>this little 8oz bottle of cerave is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li>Two more days of this - on chest, back and arms and, by now, 4 days on the face - and I was seriously breaking out like I don&#x27;t ever remember, everywhere I had put the lotion.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, my thighs are clear of the red, bumpy, &amp;</li>
            <li>I expected her to tell me that it didn&#x27;t really work for her</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and oily skin overall</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 days and developed a red bumpy itchy rash all overy arms that lasted for a week.</li>
            <li>i have spent way to much trying to manage and get rid of KP.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m talking in recent years I&#x27;ve developed Elephant-ringed-hide looking ankles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks and my skin is noticeably smoother, softer, and barely any bumps at all</li>
            <li>If you use too much you can end up with that wet feeling.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price for the only thing that takes care of the rough and bumpy skin I get on the side of my legs and back of thighs.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the Cerave Products - I used the cream, normal lotion, and face lotion - for my dry, eczema prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough for my face and didn&#x27;t cause a single blemish.</li>
            <li>I just wish it smelled a little better, but I just wear a little perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li>There is no fragrance that I can detect and my hands are very soft and stay so for a long time.  </li>
            <li>However, after continued use, my skin is so much softer with this than with the other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tons of &amp;#34;extra-dry skin&amp;#34; lotions including (but not limited to)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it...great for eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been only a week now and my face has not been this clear since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>I used only those 2 products for several months, and my skin stayed clear.  </li>
            <li>I will rarely get a dry patch, but my husband suffers with it much more.  </li>
            <li>Its not dry</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and sometimes breakout if my face is too dry.</li>
            <li>and I definitely see major improvements.</li>
            <li>then again, I rated this 5 star precicely because no other commercial lotions in the market can perform as well as this one (in my experience).</li>
            <li>Considering that it pretty much solved my other issue of severe dryness, I will continue to use this up as I don&#x27;t feel I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>I mean, super duper sensitive and red.  </li>
            <li>I saw and felt clear and amazing results in a little less than 1 week with everyday use.</li>
            <li>I had a patch of dry skin on my face and used this for 2 days and it went away completely!</li>
            <li>I went to a dermatologist, first time ever, because of my rough, bumpy, dry skin on my arms.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for something that offers a little more than your basic lotions or cremes to get down deep within dry skin, this should do the trick based on my experience.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and the wrinkles are dark spots on my arms diminished.  </li>
            <li>It compares very favorable to other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li>A little more expensive than some lotions but worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li>I was trying this for my very sensitive,  very dry acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>This lotion lighten the dark marks on my skin making it look clear and feeling unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li>I sure hope this stuff works on me for a very long time, I am tired of searching and broke from the process.irritate</li>
            <li>I sure hope this stuff works on me for a very long time, I am tired of searching and broke from the process.</li>
            <li>I must be the only girl in the world, to have acne with oily skin on face and extremely dry cracked, 80 year old skin on my legs.</li>
            <li>My face was always incredibly sensitive, red, and dry (with flaky patches).  </li>
            <li>yr old daughter very conscious of the those little bumps on the upper side of her arms.  </li>
            <li>the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using very natural/gentle products and a few vitamin supplements with moderate success, but a trusted family member recommend Cerave lotion to me.  </li>
            <li>Using body clearing washes didn&#x27;t help, and would inevitably make my skin dry (which was starting to give me that old lady</li>

            <li>if you touch your face once you apply it will feel a little sticky, but really isn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li>Since I had such satisfying results on my feet, I have used it intermittently on the backs of my arms (I get little dry bumps on the back that hardly ever go away, forgot the medical term) and occasionally on my hands when they are so dry they start to feel rough, and this stuff really makes a difference!  </li>
            <li>It did,  however, clear it up completely on my neck,  chest, back and shoulders, including the little bumps.  </li>
            <li>In less than a few days, there was a significant difference in his arms.  </li>

            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and its very nice.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very nice and silky now</li>
            <li> This is very effective and smoothing.</li>
            <li> The packaging is also very nice.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This cleared my body acne from working out, amazing!</li>
            <li> one of the best, better then pricey brands</li>
            <li> Love it best sink cream i have ever used</li>
            <li> I have noticed a remarkable difference.</li>
            <li> But using it once a day has made a visible and remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m sure the results are not the best they could be.</li>
            <li> This is a great line of products that I plan to continue using for many years!</li>
            <li> I already knew I loved this lotion</li>
            <li> It has good consistency, and has no fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> My skin is serverely sun damaged after 40+ years but for the time CeraV is doing a really good job.</li>
            <li> once i used this i loved it..</li>
            <li> Good price -- god product</li>
            <li> The  price is good</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light moisturizer that make you skin look and feel awesome...</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> One review docked it a star for not \\&quot;curing\\&quot; a chronic skin condition, which I don&#x27;t think is fair.</li>
            <li> Good product, as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing lotion, but it has not smoothed out any of the bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> and this is supposedly a good treatment for the condition.</li>
            <li> but it is good.</li>
            <li> It does feel good when rubbed in.</li>
            <li> I bought it for stucco keratoses, but I can&#x27;t tell that it got rid of them, but it is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, a mild case thankfully, and this lotion (along with the hydrating cleanser) makes my skin look beautiful!  </li>
            <li> Light but very good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Nothing great but an okay product.</li>
            <li> SA lotion also shares these nice attributes, good feel, no smell.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> but she let me know that she did in fact see results and was very happy with her smoothing skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I first tried this product I could not wait to review it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Cerave products!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED SOO MANY PRODUCTS!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Just sharing the love!</li>
            <li> amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> CeraVe SA Renewing Skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> They are amazing products and have done wonders for both my husband and I.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find out it worked.</li>
            <li> Anyway,  I also use 5% BP on my face as a spot treatment, but I thought it would be nice to use something that is supposed to help before spots show up.  </li>
            <li> While it does not irritate my skin or burn, it also doesn ªt seem effective.</li>
            <li> This SA (Salicylic Acid) lotion is nice to rotate in to my routine to keep the skin cells turning over.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond thrilled.</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best had lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It keeps working 3 days into the application and leaves your skin really nice.</li>
            <li> I do see one reviewer with her own website describing the feeling as being WAXED.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just amazed at how great this lotion is and how significant the results are.</li>
            <li> Best purchase, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great moisture replacement and helped smooth out most of my skin bumps and irritated areas.</li>
            <li> ive gotten so many compliments on my face that it is smooth and hydrated.. great lotion</li>
            <li> I was also glad to see that unlike the moisturizing cream this also absorbs better into the skin to allow me to wear it under liquid foundation!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and best part is it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle and have to say, my skin is soft and happy!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing lotion.  </li>
            <li> The results have been near perfect skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> We tried all three, but Cerave was the most effective.  </li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I am now using the face lotion and body wash as well - both of which are great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t real sure I liked this when I first used it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and works really well!</li>
            <li> It goes away quickly so that is good &amp; is not anything that will take away from the positives on it.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this lotion again and honestly I am very happy I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s skin is finally smooth after 6 years!</li>
            <li> Renewing Lotion does all it promises and more.  </li>
            <li> Love this cream as keeps my skin from itching now that I&#x27;m going through menopause.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the effect</li>
            <li> I also had a prescription steroid cream, but feel like the Cerave SA Lotion worked better for me in reducing the itchiness than the steroid lotion did.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased &amp; gratful.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> My arms look much better.</li>
            <li> MY skin is even toned now and Healthy.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Better price.</li>
            <li> For anyone frugal, or looking to heal more severe skin problems, I would say pass.</li>
            <li> Great hydration for the whole body.</li>
            <li> that still moisturize my skin as too many of the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; options don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I listened.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks better than it has in years</li>
            <li> I use CeraVe AM Lotion already and was needing to order some more</li>
            <li> All  Cerave products are awesome especially for problem skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worked like magic.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> After a week or two, my skin was noticeably better.</li>
            <li> A year later, my skin is now the best it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> My hands look sooo much better and feel smoother.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but not as exfoliating as the LA in Amlactin.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will keep getting better with continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much better.</li>
            <li> and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The more you use it the better it works.  </li>
            <li> I returned that product, but love all the others.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey, but as I say, the experts love it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> its not a cure all, but it sure helps more than anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion and it works.&lt;br /&gt;The car looks and feels must better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this lotion for getting rid of the red bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> He said &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe we haven&#x27;t seen a commercial on this product.&amp;#34; Maybe they put all the money towards having an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I have also purchased the facial cleanser (awesome) and will continue purchasing all CeraVe products.</li>
            <li> , I think the lotion did more for clearing up my bumpy skin than that of the body wash.  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> after day of use, my skin is better and lovelier and I&#x27;m sticking my legs out at people.  </li>
            <li> The more soap the more skin pain</li>
            <li> The more soap the more skin pain</li>
            <li> I use it 3-6 times a week and really love the results.</li>
            <li> Having tried a lot of hand creams, I figured this was just one more</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite body lotions</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> The cream is better than the lottion.  </li>
            <li> I also use the eye cream and moisturizers on my face, which are excellent and rival products that cost several times what they do.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> In looking for a more affordable alternative I found</li>
            <li> After using this and their hydrating cleanser for one week the difference I see in my skin in phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I sound like an infomercial, but this is just an amazing result from one use.</li>
            <li> and I love the hydration benefits.</li>
            <li> This product does a MUCH better job and is A LOT CHEAPER.</li>
            <li> but this is better.</li>
            <li> This one is for whole body, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great</li>
            <li> , there are a lot better creams for body.</li>
            <li> I do like that it does not have a smell to it, much better than those urea creams I was trying before..</li>
            <li> I truly love the CeraVe</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This helps my KP better than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> Great price but really high shipping.  </li>
            <li> It took a couple weeks, but everything cleared up, my skin is super soft, not irritated, and looking very happy.  </li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my feet looking pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have tried and used in as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin and is very light for the moisturizing it delivers.</li>
            <li> better than aveeno for kids with very dry skin, but aquaphore is still the best</li>
            <li> But if you are anything like me, it is definitely worth a shot!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry feet.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for my dry skin</li>
            <li> This is the best product for money; amazing change in my skin, smoother texture, less fine lines &amp; skin tone is evening out.  </li>
            <li> Great lotion for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff soft skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer lotion for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Skin looks healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> right after I get out of the shower, but have not been 100% effective at doing that</li>
            <li> This is truly an exceptional product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> They absorb easily and leave the skin moisturised.</li>
            <li> Easy spreading.  </li>
            <li> so I thought it would be easy to fix.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how the lotion comes off easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cerave is recommended by dermatologists, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li> This lotion is creamy, absorbs well, and does not have any strong odor.</li>
            <li> kind and use it on my body, not face, and like it very much.  </li>
            <li> also tried using it as a full body lotion but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am able to full use my hands again at work without worrying about them bleeding or cracking while I work.</li>
            <li> Best I have tried for my dark circles and particuly puffy bags.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I use it on myself too!</li>
            <li> Very good product for over dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> This works great - nice &amp; thick but absorbs great &amp; helps make my skin look so much healthier.  </li>
            <li> Also, there is barely any scent, which is nice if you want to add your own.</li>
            <li> but then it was fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great body lotion but also light enough for a hand lotion also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cerave SA for about 3 weeks now, and have noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The rest of my body responds best to heavy moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Some people find the scent disagreeable, but I find it light and not offensive.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with the fast service.  </li>
            <li> This soaks in almost immediately and leaves my skin incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> They now feel smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> works great for keratosis pilaris of the skin, use it twice daily on the affected skin, it does work wonders</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> : it makes my skin smooth and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how well this worked and how cheap it is.</li>
            <li> i like fragrance- free stuff</li>
            <li> and I am still itch free this year because I&#x27;m using the Cerve Sa after every shower.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would re-do the formula to make it paraben free.</li>
            <li> Feels fabulous.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and hydrated like never before.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy/icky.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get Amlactin on subscribe and save, but this product is available.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin smooth and bump free</li>
            <li> My husband loves it for his feet, as do I., I use it on my face before makeup and find it aids the smooth application of addition makeup.</li>
            <li> I took him to a dermatologist and the doctor recommended this lotion in addition to two others (and gave us free samples).  </li>
            <li> lotion is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  </li>
            <li> did not get a free sample from somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell my hands feel pulled and my cuticles aren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell my hands feel pulled and my cuticles aren&#x27;t comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It goes on like a nice creamy lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell like Amlactin, and really works.</li>
            <li> But being a Amazon prime member, its shipped free and I get it in two days and save myself a couple dollars to boot...</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended it to smooth skin, which it does within reason.  </li>
            <li> My legs have never been this smooth.</li>
            <li> lotion offers good coverage without being too oily, and is readily-absorbed.</li>
            <li> Let me add that I am not talking about young skin that looks good anyway, 55 years.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, but I don&#x27;t notice anything about it that really justifies its higher price tag.</li>
            <li> I eventually was able to add a very gentle makeup (alimapure, for anyone wondering).  </li>
            <li> Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Even though, it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Apply at night, and in the morning, my skin is significantly smoother and the appearance of bumps are lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was originally told that they were incomplete hair follicles.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Non greasy but rich and softening.  </li>
            <li> Also this is so much more affordable then buying it in stores where they charge twice as much !</li>
            <li> But so much better than it was, it isn&#x27;t even funny.  </li>
            <li> Its on the spendy side but its worth every cent!</li>
            <li> My doctor said it could take about 2 months to see any significant results.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item for myself, after being diagnosed with keratosis pilaris by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed a significant change in the texture and appearance of my arms.</li>
            <li> CeraVe please answer our prayers and make this in a bigger bottle (12oz would be ideal like your Hydrating Cleanser) because now I use it on my body and as an every day facial moisturizer because it is that amazing.</li>
            <li> CeraVe SA did not cause any noticeable reduction in my KP at all; however, it significantly moisturized my skin.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin - this stuff works great</li>
            <li> Leaves skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> This SA lotion is light, absorbs quickly and does not leave a shiny residue like others, and does not have any distracting scent.</li>
            <li> It works really well and is great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Did a great job clearing up a winter rash on my leg as well as helping with dry skin on my face without casing acne.  </li>
            <li> Great Lotion for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It penetrates quickly and leaves the skin extremely smooth with no greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream would be perfect for someone with somewhat dry normal skin.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy, is easy to apply, and soaks right in, besides having ceramides which dermatologists recommend.</li>
            <li> I special ordered &amp;#34;super-sensitive&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Have had bargain basement lanolin, glycerine, wax, petroleum, pure shark oil, cocoa butter to $500 sheik store gator oil, emu, copper, meadow foam, sea biologicals, niacin complexes in stunning jars to custom doctor urea lactic acid concoctions, you name it.  </li>
            <li> It has been reliable for me ever since and it still rings true.</li>
            <li> and it still rings true.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want any PARABENS, this is full of them&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and it makes them nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It is very effective at moisturizing my very dry legs, heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> I would say this is best for someone with an ample wallet and not too sensitive skin, who just wants to turn their normal/dry skin super soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> Great product for my very dry skin!</li>
            <li> Great---I use mainly on lower arms &amp; back of hands, but love using on my face---which my dermatologist said wd be good.</li>
            <li> This has most likely  helped in speeding up the healing of my skin; however, I can also tell a great difference between the effects of this lotion and the other lotions I have used over the many years that I have been into makeup and skincare.</li>
            <li> I quickly researched for moisturizers and was debating between Cetaphil and Cerave.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Cerave has made a tremendous difference</li>
            <li> I saw it on sale at target and quickly snagged it.</li>
            <li> no burning like glytone and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has no smell, absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does work, although not as well as Avon&#x27;s Skin Bump Minimizer, which unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li> and this stuff beats that line hands down for a fraction of the price, plus many more ounces!</li>
            <li> I HAD NEW SKIN that is lovely.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user and feel that it is well than worth the price.</li>
            <li> It has no smell and is absorbed really quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> Its really good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> great just what i wanted it really helps with the dry skin that i have thank you for responding so quickly</li>
            <li> It did take a good month or so of daily application to see a consistent difference</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described; delivered promptly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;For the first time in my life, the bumps are gone!</li>
            <li> Thanks for having it available and so quickly</li>
            <li> Excellent for extra dry bumpy skin recommend for my child by our dermatologist in combination  with  aqualant.</li>
            <li> It works great, but it is messy.</li>
            <li> Really soaks in and leaves her skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s a great lotion, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the wait till it soaks in.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> Be advised, you may want to apply sunblock after this has been absorbed before spending some time outdoors, or wear a hat.</li>
            <li> Worth the money as it has worked well.</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not only do they look better, but they also feel smooth like the skin on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how clear and smooth my face is!</li>
            <li> and it honestly is making a big difference for me.</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but oh, so worth it.</li>
            <li> a sudden my family doctor consults his own dermatologist and says something like a product called chervey or something contains Salicylic Acid and works for people like me.  </li>
            <li> I will buy this lotion again and again, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I liked this enough to post this to my friends and family on facebook:  </li>
            <li> and it was worth it.</li>
            <li> However, this one is a success.  </li>
            <li> I have been way more conscious about applying the lotion to my arms and legs right after I shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician and this is easily one of my favorite dry skin lotions on the market.  </li>
            <li> It was also highly rated by SweetHome.com, which is my starting point for finding good stuff for the home.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The GR treatment worked far better than the best steroids (decade of them too) but leaves skin aged, darkened and so dry I have no words.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can see the skin rejuvenate right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a hint of a lotion smell unless you put your nose right on it.&lt;br /&gt;Not a hint of shiny on your legs when it dries&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes me rinse it right off</li>
            <li> Makes me rinse it right off</li>
            <li> I saw noticeable results right away.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for that,  but will keep searching for the right products for my face.</li>
            <li> It worked great, but I have trouble finding the exact one at the store (Sa), and its pricey.</li>
            <li> Great body lotion for very dry sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Cosmetically &amp; medicinally, salicylic acid acts as a keratolytic, comedolytic, and bacteriostatic agent, causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again by constricting pore diameter, and allowing room for new cell growth.  </li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of special lotions and creams that my dermatologist recommended, but none of them ever made much of a difference.</li>
            <li> An excellent product that achieves what no other had in the past.  </li>
            <li> We tried this Cerave lotion before looking into the more expensive types and we&#x27;ve been very pleased!</li>
            <li> I use it right after a hot shower</li>
            <li> Amazing product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> When I put on make up, you can see them even more which makes me very self conscious.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion to help with dry skin and to make my arms look nice for my wedding.</li>
            <li> : very sensitive skin (can&#x27;t even use popular mineral foundation blushes without rashy reactions); have had mild to moderate acne for over 10 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> My skin doctor prescribed this lotion; This price is much better than any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> and I still see big results :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying this lotion</li>
            <li> a key ingredient for healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> Noticed improved first use.  </li>
            <li> And it did from the first use.</li>
            <li> It has mineral oil, just to be aware</li>
            <li> I first tried Cerave Sa when my dermatologist recommended it</li>
            <li> Make sure you use sunscreen at all times especially with a product with Sacylic Acid</li>
            <li> both have the exact ingredients except nivea does not have</li>
            <li> This is my first time using it</li>
            <li> I had doubts at first that this would work.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> you need to make sure you get the Cerave SA not the regular Cerave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeps my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Now my hands are MUCH improved since Day One of use!</li>
            <li> my bumps are pretty much gone!</li>
            <li> my skin was luxuriously soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion daily and have never found anything better.</li>
            <li> My skin feels incredibly soft, smooth and silky after applying Cerave SA.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I really love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li> AND IT IS THE FIRST LOTION THAT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the eczema any more than the regular Cerave Lotion.</li>
            <li> Turns out this is the real deal - non-greasy, easily absorbed, and it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so ready for sandals now!</li>
            <li> This works - if you are consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li> It is very good for rough dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Its expensive, but its great to have normal skin, for the most part, again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most people with normal skin would consider these heavy.  </li>
            <li> As recommended by my dermatologist, this is a GREAT moisturizer, especially for the feet and elbows or anywhere with rough skin.</li>
            <li> I liked its softening effects enough that I was using it as a body lotion after the shower, but you have to use a LOT of it to \\&quot;liberally\\&quot; cover the skin, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; across the skin</li>
            <li> Be very cautious at first</li>
            <li> I began to cry the next day because I was so happy and didn&#x27;t have to apply it 10 times a day like the other</li>
            <li> The bumps were not as big and her skin is finally becoming smoother every day.  </li>
            <li> It is very soothing, and I plan to buy another one as soon as I finished this, my first, bottle.</li>
            <li> Before I used it, I would have cracks that bled throughout the dry months of winter, but not any more.</li>
            <li> makes my skin super soft.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I love all of the Cerave products for my severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CeraVe seems more formulated for rosacea, dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> i have always had dry skin and NOTHING has helped my skin more than this product.</li>
            <li> Now, to be fair, I purchased this lotion, applied for several days (as I would with the normal lotion) and after going back and reading some reviews about skin smoothing/bumps disappearing</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of the CeraVe line, but I purchased this in hopes that like with many others, it would help the KP problem on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> When applied liberally it really does soften the skin and make it super soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly let my dermatologist know how much I like it.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and absorbs easily like other daily moisturizers but is more hydrating.</li>
            <li> My elbows and knuckles are like those of a newly born child and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the utter smoothness and incredibly vibrant, healthy look of areas of my body</li>
            <li> Getting a recommendation from a dermatologist was a real vote of confidence for the product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> One thing I do not care for is it is very greasy.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This really softens skin.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it moisterizes my face and body and stays on the whole day..</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to try it for my aging teflon fingers (I can&#x27;t shuffle paper) &amp; it seems to really help.</li>
            <li> It has really made a measurable difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and really softens the skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very stubborn eczema</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> and we both really like it.  </li>
            <li> I finally feel comfortable going out, I don&#x27;t feel like everyone is staring at</li>
            <li> No matter how much lotion I would put on nothing would work.</li>
            <li> but it does REALLY WORK.</li>
            <li> Plus, the added benefit of absolutely no fragrance makes this a winning choice for me.</li>
            <li> Someone even commented to me that I really needed to get in the sun.  </li>
            <li> Since I have very itchy/dry skin in the winter, I have probably tried every lotion there is out there.  </li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t a cure, but is very helpful in keeping my skin softer.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say anything regarding that, but I have tried their lotion without the SA (salicylic acid) on my face and it works really well.</li>
            <li> Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Did not feel or react like the real product.</li>
            <li> Expected more from this product based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this.  </li>
            <li> very dissapointed about it, i didnt saw any change on my skin by</li>
            <li> AND THIS IS REALLY HELPING.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed difference all over...</li>
            <li> No I&#x27;m not doing the whole loofah routine, just plopping it on and rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> and like I said that it does readily.  </li>
            <li> and like I said that it does readily.  </li>
            <li> Really made my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For once, a product that really works.....</li>
            <li> For once a product that claims to be a moisturizer really performs as the product claims.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is not offensive or very noticeable which is a plus for me.  </li>
            <li> I usually notice an improvement after using a new product but then that goes away fairly soon.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> With most other lotions, you&#x27;d probably have to apply the lotion every day just to get close to the effect that this lotion provides.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried the &amp;#34;skin renewing&amp;#34; lotion, and let me just say  WOW!</li>
            <li> With those properties plus Cerave&#x27;s moisturizing properties, it allowed my skin to clear up very fast and better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth continuing to spend more money on it.</li>
            <li> As a disclaimer, I will say that since I first began using the Cerave brand, I stopped wearing my daily full-face makeup mainly due to my reaction to the other lotion, and have been mostly foundation and powder free since the summer of 2013, except for my wedding and special events.</li>
            <li> With dry winter months upon me I wanted something that would work without feeling heavy and greasy, and this stuff if great.</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and really makes a difference when applied daily after shower.</li>
            <li> for the first time in my adult life where i did not have issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> The other thing I like about it is that it absorbed quickly and does not make your hands sticky.</li>
            <li> Really like the new packaging</li>
            <li> Great for my tired, old skin and not too oily.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion in particular.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I would get red bumps, that look like my skin is super irritated.</li>
            <li> No greasy feel, absorbs quickly, and, with regular use, improved my hands&#x27; look and feel.</li>
            <li> After only using for two days my arms and legs have not been so soft and smooth since I have been a teenager.</li>
            <li> no longer feels tight or peeling :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for targeted treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Since high school, I always had problem skin on my face.  </li>
            <li> I prefer scented lotions - but this came highly recommended by my dermatologist, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with rosacea or a butterfly rash on the face.</li>
            <li> The 2nd week my skin was becoming smooth again &amp; after 30 days, no more scales or crustys.</li>
            <li> this works great and unlike all the others i have tried doesn&#x27;t smell like cat pee or isn&#x27;t outrageously expensive</li>
            <li> A patient told me a few months ago about a great lotion her dermatologist had recommended, and I finally tried it last night.</li>
            <li> For me it simply works and therefore is worth the money</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I rarely get pimples anymore and only treat my skin with the SA Renewing Lotion and Alba Botanical Acne-Dote</li>
            <li> After a few days, I continued to see more improvement.</li>
            <li> The lotion does have some salicylic acid in it, which I&#x27;ve normally seen in products for clearing up acne.  </li>
            <li> but if you have skin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;, as I do on the back of my arms, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - this has all the perks of the normal lotion with the additional benefits of skin smoothing (also going to try this on my face)</li>
            <li> it is thick but smoothes on face nicely..</li>
            <li> While it is a fine lotion, I do not see the benefit of this one in paticular over their other lotions.</li>
            <li> All of this brand&#x27;s products have time release ceramides and sll sorts of other good stuff you would find in something much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am in such disbelief, but when I look in the mirror the proof is right there.</li>
            <li> but luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t linger around too long after you apply it.</li>
            <li> (have always had little bumps ever since I can remember) - and THE BUMPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GONE!</li>
            <li> An I have gotten a rash from using a new medicine and once I started using the lotion after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> And every day I check for new zits</li>
            <li> so I went on Amazon and saw this new Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I looked on the CeraVe website to ask for a new pump but the site was unavailable.  </li>
            <li> (Tried a variety of natural, homemade, high-priced, and drug-store brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CeraVe absorbs fast, leaves no greasy or sticky residue, and hands stay soft even after washing them.</li>
            <li> I use it on my legs, on my arms, on my face, even my rough elbows end up smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of this visible pore issue, but my arms are much softer and nowhere near as bumpy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with super dry skin for decades.  </li>
            <li> enough I find what he meant and its Cerave (there is a different company with a shhh sound that does make a SA Steroid prescription product so not them).  </li>
            <li> However, know it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; very far.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky residue so you can dress right away.  </li>
            <li> The appearance of my KP is reduced and my skin is baby soft!</li>
            <li> This is everything for my adult acne skin!</li>
            <li> and I only wish I had been made aware of it decades ago.</li>
            <li> I have used many products and I can say this no is no better then any others except non greasy</li>
            <li> Recently I went to a dermatologist for the first time and she recommended this lotion.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I have tried COUNTLESS lotions and potions to try &amp; get rid of the KP bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> I got this to see if it would be better than the other leading brand of a similar product</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have bought that actually does what the front of the bottle says it will do.</li>
            <li> the was more bumble :/</li>
            <li> After literally 20 years of trying different lotions, vaseline with socks on my hands at night, steroid creams and ointments, this is the ONLY thing that has ever made a significant difference on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I first learned about CeraVe from my dermatologist who suggested I use their AM/PM facial lotions after suffering with acne and dryness.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t believe it because typically diatribes like this sound like a 2AM</li>
            <li> The first day I applied as frequently and as much as possible.</li>
            <li> My 4-year old daughter has keratosis pilaris (white/red bumps) on the back of her arms that is pretty severe.  </li>
            <li> A little dab goes a long way, so the value is much better than products that much be lathered on to have any effect.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff helps with the little fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this, I have already seen a significant difference, particularly on her cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rare exception in that my acne prone skin is sensitive and gets so dry</li>
            <li> I woke up with extremely dry, flaky skin around my eyes and my right eye was swollen</li>
            <li> Works well.put it on at night, in the morning and right after shower before dry to  lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, after a week of using the product each night, the bumps still reappear - a nature of the chronic skin condition, no doubt - so just be mindful that regular use and a large dose of patience is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smooth skin is worth the slight burn and it only lasts a short minute.</li>
            <li> We live in hot, dry low desert area, and this lotion is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m elated to say I still see clear skin.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t 100% clear of bumps</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to keep my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> But I had really hoped this product would completely rid me of KP all together with regular use, as KP Duty did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying everything to clear it up,  </li>
            <li> I went to two different podiatrists about it and neither one had any real suggestions.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still there so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and has dramatically improved my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Both hands and feet feel so soft now.  </li>
            <li> i swear it has improved my 66 yr old skin..</li>
            <li> i was surprised..</li>
            <li> But, my 5-year-old daughter has really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but my hands felt soft but not sticky.</li>
            <li> Upon application, the healing action could be clearly sensed and after a week the renewal could be verified.  </li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old man.</li>
            <li> I am  25 years old and have had continuous acne  </li>
            <li> It makes our skin feel soft and hydrated</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> it really works ...not tomorrow, not next week, NOW.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It keeps hands soft all during the day despite using hand soaps and hand sanitizers</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and have never had acne or skin issues.</li>
            <li> This lotion will reduce your skin bumps in two days and nearly eliminate them in one week.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy cream,  yet moisturizes like one.  </li>
            <li> Have used all the natural oils and fruits chemicals out there.  </li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended Cerave SA and WOW.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t fall asleep because i&#x27;m so busy scratching them.</li>
            <li> and I only use it for the bumps, not for moisturizing my whole body.  </li>
            <li> but some people might be sensitive to that</li>
            <li> (although I have sensitive skin, and had no issues).</li>
            <li> Goes on soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my arms definitely looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> Keeps the skin soft as long as it is used consistently</li>
            <li> I heard the effect is good, but I bought it by the wrong season.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the ONLY ONE to clear up her skin!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking with non greasy, plain young and smooth both to the touch and to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After three days my skin was back to normal!</li>
            <li> Since i&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are less noticeable, and my skin looks better overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my son&#x27;s body eczema, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this is better than the regular Cerave Lotion.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different moisturizers including super expensive ones.</li>
            <li> lotion feels totally different than regular Cerave, it&#x27;s a gross feeling on my face, very heavy, but after one day my skin looked better, so I switched to applying it at night after the first time.  </li>
            <li> He first gave me a sample for my very dry skin.</li>
            <li> This personally worked for me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> No other lotions or creams have seemed to help except for this one!  </li>
            <li> - it says it has Invisible Zinc that dries clear, but it most definitely left me looking pale and white.  </li>
            <li> I have no financial interest in this product, but simply wanted to share the info to anyone who experiences significant dry skin, eczema, cracking hands in the winter, etc.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the reaction it caused stopped after discontinuing the lotion and though it&#x27;s taken time to heal, there have been no more breakouts</li>
            <li> Part of my ritual to keep anything that canirritate my hands off my hands and that includes the frequent soap you have to use if you handle food with your bare hands.  </li>
            <li> that includes the frequent soap you have to use if you handle food with your bare hands.  </li>
            <li> I was even using prescription gel and ointment on the Karatosis Pilaris on my upper arms and it wasn&#x27;t until I stopped them both and started using this, that I saw significant improvement and relief from a particularly rough and itchy patch!!</li>
            <li> The very next say I saw improvements from my new appearing acne.</li>
            <li> I guess it really does exfoliate dry skin as it promises on the label.  </li>
            <li> It helped a bit with my Keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms, but the back of my legs not so much.</li>
            <li> and then it fails the very part of my body in the most agony.  </li>
            <li> and then it fails the very part of my body in the most agony.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with high expectations since I have really bumpy rough skin on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin sort in general!</li>
            <li> They both have salicylic acid, so I  guess that&#x27;s one of the major factors in making them work.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am normally the type to go for organic / natural type products that smell fruity, but a dermatologist recommended CeraVe products to me when I went in with overly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> this little 8oz bottle of cerave is worth its weight in gold.</li>
            <li> Two more days of this - on chest, back and arms and, by now, 4 days on the face - and I was seriously breaking out like I don&#x27;t ever remember, everywhere I had put the lotion.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, my thighs are clear of the red, bumpy, &amp;</li>
            <li> I expected her to tell me that it didn&#x27;t really work for her</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and oily skin overall</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 days and developed a red bumpy itchy rash all overy arms that lasted for a week.</li>
            <li> i have spent way to much trying to manage and get rid of KP.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m talking in recent years I&#x27;ve developed Elephant-ringed-hide looking ankles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks and my skin is noticeably smoother, softer, and barely any bumps at all</li>
            <li> If you use too much you can end up with that wet feeling.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price for the only thing that takes care of the rough and bumpy skin I get on the side of my legs and back of thighs.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Cerave Products - I used the cream, normal lotion, and face lotion - for my dry, eczema prone, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its gentle enough for my face and didn&#x27;t cause a single blemish.</li>
            <li> I just wish it smelled a little better, but I just wear a little perfume to cover it up.</li>
            <li> There is no fragrance that I can detect and my hands are very soft and stay so for a long time.  </li>
            <li> However, after continued use, my skin is so much softer with this than with the other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tons of &amp;#34;extra-dry skin&amp;#34; lotions including (but not limited to)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it...great for eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been only a week now and my face has not been this clear since I was a teen.</li>
            <li> I used only those 2 products for several months, and my skin stayed clear.  </li>
            <li> I will rarely get a dry patch, but my husband suffers with it much more.  </li>
            <li> Its not dry</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and sometimes breakout if my face is too dry.</li>
            <li> and I definitely see major improvements.</li>
            <li> then again, I rated this 5 star precicely because no other commercial lotions in the market can perform as well as this one (in my experience).</li>
            <li> Considering that it pretty much solved my other issue of severe dryness, I will continue to use this up as I don&#x27;t feel I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I mean, super duper sensitive and red.  </li>
            <li> I saw and felt clear and amazing results in a little less than 1 week with everyday use.</li>
            <li> I had a patch of dry skin on my face and used this for 2 days and it went away completely!</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist, first time ever, because of my rough, bumpy, dry skin on my arms.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for something that offers a little more than your basic lotions or cremes to get down deep within dry skin, this should do the trick based on my experience.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and the wrinkles are dark spots on my arms diminished.  </li>
            <li> It compares very favorable to other similar products I have used.  </li>
            <li> A little more expensive than some lotions but worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> I was trying this for my very sensitive,  very dry acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li> This lotion lighten the dark marks on my skin making it look clear and feeling unbelievably soft.</li>
            <li> I sure hope this stuff works on me for a very long time, I am tired of searching and broke from the process.irritate</li>

            <li> the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using very natural/gentle products and a few vitamin supplements with moderate success, but a trusted family member recommend Cerave lotion to me.  </li>
            <li> Using body clearing washes didn&#x27;t help, and would inevitably make my skin dry (which was starting to give me that old lady</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s doctor recommended this when she was about a month old since she had very dry skin.</li>
            <li> if you touch your face once you apply it will feel a little sticky, but really isn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> Since I had such satisfying results on my feet, I have used it intermittently on the backs of my arms (I get little dry bumps on the back that hardly ever go away, forgot the medical term) and occasionally on my hands when they are so dry they start to feel rough, and this stuff really makes a difference!  </li>
            <li> It did,  however, clear it up completely on my neck,  chest, back and shoulders, including the little bumps.  </li>
            <li> In less than a few days, there was a significant difference in his arms.  </li>
            <li> My 5 year old has keratosis pilaris and while he has the typical arm bumps, the major issue for him has been bumps on his cheeks/chin.</li>
            <li> after the initial application to the red bumps on the back of my upper arms, they were already disappearing and after the first few days, bumps were gone!!</li>
            <li> I now have no bumps on my forehead, my skin is not overly dry or oily in any one area, and the color of the spots has decreased significantly to where they&#x27;re barely noticeable.</li>

            <li> I went from somewhat oily skin with occasional breakouts to very dry flaky skin with constant breakouts along my jawline, my hair line, my chin and even my shoulders, chest and back.</li>
            <li> Living in cold 7 months of the year our family has found Cerave Sa Renewing Skin Lotion to be effective in eliminating dry skin.</li>
            <li> 8 ounces does not last long in our house.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t last long, either.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, as with other reviewers, it felt kinda heavy.</li>
            <li> Have been dealing with very dry facial skin for several months.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I had was you have to let it dry</li>

            <li> Within the first few hours the skin on my face began to finally look better after a week of dealing with peeling like crazy!</li>
            <li> I have KP that seems to have steadily increased the past year or two and so went off in search of a inexpensive (cheaper than RX) fix.  </li>
            <li> With a little CeraVe, my hands stay soft and keep from getting chapped.</li>
            <li> I have little bumps on my upper arms which are apparently &#x27;keratosis pilaris&#x27;.</li>

            <li> my arms seem to stay &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; all day long until I shower it off.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like you spent money only to put a watery product on, it works and makes a difference !</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not getting too oily in my t-zone, I&#x27;m not dry in other areas, no flakes, no new pimples.</li>
            <li> Lately I started getting the same bumps on my arms and my new dermatologist recommended this lotion.</li>
            <li> The only draw back for me is that it is a little irritating on freshly shaven or epilated skin, but what do you expect form a lotion that has acid in it.</li>
            <li> As long as it exists I will keep buying faithfully!</li>

            <li> I have extremely dry skin with bumps and scales and</li>
            <li> and I towel dry</li>
            <li> once winter arrives the skin on my legs get so dry</li>

            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product because of my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Cleared up his dry bumpy skin in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This product even works on dry feet.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist to treat my dry skin and keratosis.</li>
            <li> I am an RN having to wash my hands countless times in a work day so my skin gets rough and dry and &amp;#34;kinda prickly&amp;#34; as rough skin around my fingernails hangs on linens and gowns and gauze, etc.  </li>
            <li> wish it came in a bigger bottle and was a not quite so expensive (still well worth the cost, you get what you pay for)</li>
            <li> Facial moisturizers always end up being a waste of time and money for me as they are never enough moisture.</li>
            <li> and it‚Äôs so nice to a have lotion that actually works and it‚Äôs not a steroid base one like the ones I have been using from my doctor.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and a minor case of eczema.</li>
            <li> I do have to use it every single day though.</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pilaris--dry, rough, bumpy skin--on my arms for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I can not even begin to tell you the difference CeraVe has made on my skin, no more dead dry pealing skin on my face, its completely healed the dry patches, improved the evenness of my skin tone, completely toned down the redness.  </li>
            <li> The KP is still present, just not as noticeable as redness has gone down.  </li>
            <li> Suddenly a month ago my face started to become DRY, dry as in my face felt so tight it would hurt to move it.</li>
            <li> After using this for 2 days they dry, flaky skin was gone!</li>
            <li> Dermatologist suggested CeraVe for psoriasis patients and the Sa if you have very dry knotty skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin wipe it on</li>
            <li> My mother had a doctor recommend Cerave with salicylic acid for her very dry skin and keratosis, so I figured I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> There were a few times that I ran out and went a few weeks before I could buy a new one</li>
            <li> Its little bit different with the one I bought it from supermarket.</li>
            <li> I just wish it were a little cheaper, because an 8 ounce bottle only lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> I suffered from some minor adult acne and some serious redness where they would show up.</li>
            <li> (small bumps white or red under skin often referred to as chicken skin) significantly within two to three days of using twice a day.</li>
            <li> Cerave was recommended by my doctor for extremely, ghastly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on the rest of my body as I have chronic dry skin due to diabetes</li>
            <li> If you have dry, aging skin on you hands or heels (worked on my rough heels, too), forget the other stuff and buy this.</li>
            <li> well, i did not read the information very carefully since i intended to buy lotion for my face and i have combination skin type instead of extrmely dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only thing that helps smooth my arms and lessen the ugly &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> He is very picky about the lotion he uses, especially on his hands (too greasy, smells weird, etc.).  </li>
            <li> I spent a lot of time trying to loofah or scrub them away to no avail.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve tried everything from prescription ointments to Crisco on the rough scaly patches she gets on her legs.</li>
            <li> The Sa version helps slough off dead skin -- according to the dermatologist, and I can&#x27;t can&#x27;t find it in the local drugstore -- bravo for Amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly expensive, but defintely worth the price.</li>
            <li> DSAP know how we battle rough skin.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my doctor for rough, bumpy skin.  </li>
            <li> Her arms still have the bumps, but it&#x27;s not as rough either.  </li>
            <li> Only issue is it is not available in any store or drugstore in my town of Henderson, Nevada.</li>
            <li> (though I hear that animal is not at all as rough as he appears, I am however).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a product for people with rough skin.</li>
            <li> After using this following the cleanser,  it did sting for a few minutes,  </li>
            <li> everything as expected.</li>
            <li> I was eyeing this product for a few weeks and finally took the plunge</li>
            <li> It was noticeable after 1&#x27;st application.it is slow to absorb so apply early before dressing.highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this lotion for my keratosis pilaris but it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it, just mad it a little less visible then before.</li>
            <li> I scrub regularly with a plain washcloth and clean-rinsing bar soap and follow up with thise lotion and my skin couldn&#x27;t be smoother.</li>
            <li> The daily mitt scrub and plain body lotion did nothing.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I can say is it has a bit of a strange smell to it.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and you do not want a tacky feel to your skin, do you?</li>
            <li> A little of the product goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little of the CerVe goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but acne treatments are usually over drying and make it worse whIle moisturizers strong enough to help the dryness clog pores and make the break outs worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty skeptical when it comes to claims I read about products, but this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about every other day</li>
            <li> and I had just run out of the other moisturizer I had used on my face</li>
            <li> and my hands were extremely itchy and had blisters.  </li>
            <li> It is ‚Öî the size of their other lotions, so the value diminishes too.</li>
            <li> I presumed dead long ago.  </li>
            <li> I have small bumps on my upper arms for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my keratosis pilaris (little bumps my upper arms) since I was a little kid.</li>
            <li> However, using both items daily just for a mild condition that I didn&#x27;t think was serious became somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> Even a small blemish on my chin seemed to not be as red and noticeable.</li>
            <li> I tried moisturizing with other products, and I would find temporary relief.  </li>
            <li> But if other reviewers are looking for relief from KP</li>
            <li> Goodbye dry skin, it has even cleared some areas a little bit.  </li>
            <li> You need to give it a little time, a week or so, worked also on dry and itching areas.</li>
            <li> helps get rid of dry skin on arms and the little bumpy spots on arms too over time</li>
            <li> I have face and body acne and hoped it might help clear it, or at least soften the little under the skin bumps/roughness.</li>
            <li> I also use on my neck and my chin where I have a few little white bumps.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this on my face being that I&#x27;m skeptical about using certain products on my face.</li>
            <li> I also had a patch of very dry, cracking skin on one if my elbows, which created up in a few days using this product.</li>
            <li> Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub&amp;#34; your chicken skin will reduce.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have ever used that clears it at least 95%.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the price -</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it has cancer causing parabens in it...</li>
            <li> but my face gets get dry/flaky patches, bumps especially on the forehead, and I had discolored spots all over my face from years of acne through my late 20s.</li>
            <li> And with it I have super-sensitive skin that can&#x27;t tolerate the average body wash and soap without severe itching.  </li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the effects last at least a day for me without having to reapply.</li>
            <li> why I took it down a star-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still prefer my other lotion for my face but the value for the quality of CeraVe can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> no more dry patches or bumps</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause trouble on my face, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as other products I have</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy feeling like the other.</li>
            <li> Not super moisturizing</li>
            <li> Softest my skin has ever been and Amazon price is $5.00 less than sale at discount store, $8.00 less than dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> $10 or less</li>
            <li> I had previous reviewed this product as being quite MEH.</li>
            <li> It is still not flawless - it is still red, and I get the occasional bump/pimple.</li>
            <li> less than a week using Cerave SA</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the KP Duty products that cost anywhere from $65 to $80 a tube for a lot less oz..</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle as it removed some serious problem areas..  </li>
            <li> This feels like a typical lotion</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s been a slight improvement in the skin texture but not the appearance.</li>
            <li> My skin has become slightly smoother but the bumps are still there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using both, over months, my skin cleared up and became less bumpy.</li>
            <li> I typically notice severe drying with when using anything with salicylic acid, not with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> but found the cream was not ideal for my extra dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a good regular lotion applicator.</li>
            <li> It will take away all of those annoying bumps on the back of my upper arms as well as keeping my elbows and heels soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I thought I found a magic bullet with this combo, but unfortunately the lotion is just too thick for my face and made the breakouts worse on my chin and cheeks.</li>
            <li> It has the SA (Salicylic Acid) which helps penetrate the hard, dry areas.</li>
            <li> One star off because it has to be re applied every single time you wash your hands, which sucks of you wash often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with little bumps on my face for years...</li>
            <li> or it will be a little sticky on your skin.</li>
            <li> , you need to pull your skin a little.</li>
            <li> It seems a little medicinal, but it works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over 2 weeks</li>
            <li> It does take a little time to absorb into skin, but I just do my hair and everything else while waiting for the lotion to sink in.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has had keratosis pilaris since she was a little girl.  </li>
            <li> Stuff is a little pricey</li>
            <li> but I leave my skin a little moist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my forearms where I had some brown spots and some weird red dry bumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went at it with more gusto than I ever have with a skin product, I decided to Dry Loofah my worst, those ankles!  </li>
            <li> I tried a little bit of everything -- heavy moisturizing creams, exfoliating gloves, scrubs, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help with my bumpy \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my upper arms for years...and finally found something that works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months now, and I swear my skin looks healthier with fewer brown spots from the sun.  </li>
            <li> But this stuff still works like nothing else to eradicate dead skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days now</li>
            <li> I just kept using it almost every few hours.</li>
            <li> I can get dressed within 1 minute and don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on my clothes or having trouble putting on jewelry.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizers without the heavy greasy feel.</li>
            <li> The SA keeps my pores unblocked and normalizes my skin, reduced the redness within a few days and keeps it moisturized during the winter.</li>
            <li> i was looking for something to fade a few brown spots and this seems to be doing it also..</li>
            <li> but it takes a few days and sometimes tell me it is not in stock.  </li>
            <li> I got this lotion for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> A few weeks in,</li>
            <li> I have used it everyday for over a month now</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few THINGS I DON&#x27;T LIKE and</li>
            <li> but recently it seemed to have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> I like the Cerave products but this lotion is somewhat heavy for what I am trying to achieve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the cerave sa cleanser from this line that seems a bit harsh and really dried my skin out.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t consider either to be a heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li> Bought it a few weeks ago to help with keratosis piliras..</li>
            <li> My husband has said that the little bumps he usually gets on his hands from the eczema are gone.  </li>
            <li> so I have a hard time finding lotions that don&#x27;t have all the extra acne irritating ingredients but</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with deep cracks on my heels that split deep and are raw and painful to walk on.  </li>
            <li> I have used jergens and vaseline intense and all that other crap.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the product because it came unsealed and I would not use it.</li>
            <li> Although expensive, it is the only lotion that had ever worked for me!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this lotion on my face and it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I had read all the reviews, and I was anxious to try it on my Keratosis Pilaris.</li>
            <li> I have been using it morning and night for the past two months.</li>
            <li> Stop by the dermatologist office and see what they sell over the counter, if it&#x27;s too expensive there, get the name and go to a local pharmacy or this site to buy and save.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve gone to different dermatologists and all they give here are expensive steroid-based creams that did not do squat on her skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually use it at night.</li>
            <li> I will use up the product but would not repurchase this one due to the poor value of this one and no added benefit.</li>
            <li> In the past I had a thick prescription creme.</li>
            <li> Use every morning at least and your dry skin will be no more!!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s small and expensive compared with other lotions, so I just use it in selected places.  </li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores and also cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> irritating little hair and acne bumps sometimes develop too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> tried everything for those nasty little red upper arm pollka dots.  </li>
            <li> I discovered this product a couple years ago when I had had chronic dryness on my face from acne medications and my regular moisturizers just weren&#x27;t cutting it.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets UNBEARABLY itchy every winter as soon as it gets cold outside.  </li>
            <li> This winter is twice as cold as last winter</li>
            <li> If I had one complaint, it would be the cost.</li>
            <li> I picked the Cerave formula with the least amount of stuff</li>
            <li> Literally after one night of use I can tell a dramatic difference with less roughness, peeling, cracking.</li>
            <li> This lotion is neither too thick nor is it too watery.</li>
            <li> No more signs of keratosis pilaris!</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because the bottle is small, I finished this in about 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> Unlike the rest of the Cerave Products, it had a weird almost tacky feel to it after you put it on, instead of soaking into your skin like the other products do.</li>
            <li> they are expensive when compared to other name brand moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I was buying a very expensive product to do the same thing --</li>
            <li> Can you touch base with CeraVe and ask for a new pump for the 8oz bottle be sent to me??  </li>
            <li> which is a relief from the cold and dry weather but no visible improvements yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the name brands, and it seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> A little expensive</li>
            <li> At that point, my skin was so bad I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup or anything else, so these were the ONLY 2 products I was using.  </li>
            <li> Not quite moisturizing enough for the really bad winters.</li>
            <li> I usually use DermaDoctor&#x27;s KP Duty, which works for my skin, however, it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had a ugly, dry, scaly scar from surgery.  </li>
            <li> Moving to the north east from Florida, I had developed eczema and rosacea, in the brutal winter I would flare up till my skin was unbearable..been to a dermatologist and he would prescribe me all these steroid creams, pro topic that is toxic (but they do work).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a God-send in the winter when my condition is the worse.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dramatically decreased.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face to moisturize after Aztec Secret clay.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with annoying (and embarrassing) dry, flaky elbows.</li>
            <li> I HAVE A VERY SERIOUS DISEASE THAT MAKES</li>
            <li> I developed a terrible reaction to latex gloves that I used for gardening</li>
            <li> I think any one who want their legs or bum would just stupid to use any other product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive and doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> I am considering that if I bought the fake  one or not?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price compared to all the designer creams...not all creams have to be expensive to work.</li>
            <li> example that not cream have to be expensive, google  Nivea cream ( made in Germany )</li>
            <li> but it just never went away, even with a clairisonic and expensive acne systems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unable to use scented products.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> weird smell,</li>
            <li> Also somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, though it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> The itchiness is worst at night and it has been one of the main reasons I HATE WINTER!  </li>
            <li> And also, I find the smell unpleasant</li>
            <li> I tried literally dozens of products, everything from grocery store to drugstore, to very expensive cosmetic/department store brands.  </li>
            <li> and it burned so bad..</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and the bumps are smoother and the redness isn&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I needed to get it treated, after all, I&#x27;ve been living with it for all my life.</li>
            <li> She has it bad on her arms and her cheeks.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers or anything.</li>
            <li> As an eczema sufferer, I&#x27;m always frustrated by my skin&#x27;s sensitivities.</li>
            <li> Alas not the part that was looking the worst.  </li>
            <li> Alas not the part that was looking the worst.  </li>
            <li> i have Keratosis Pilaris, hereditary, no cure and annoying.</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my arms, so I was looking for something to rid the annoying bumps that  are an annoyance.</li>
            <li> It is horrifyingly embarrassing.</li>
            <li> My grandchildren no longer are repulsed and my friends no longer repelled by my horrific skin problem</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not sure about the product because it came unsealed and I would not use it.</li>
            <li> great for aging skin. Helps a lot</li>
            <li> I got severe keratosis pilaris after a course of isotretinoin for acne...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My KP was accompanied with blackheads and inflammation on my upper arm. It is horrifyingly embarrassing. I have used Amlactin, Regular Cerave (though it helped control the spreading) and prescription Retin-A. Nothing had helped my condition until I started this lotion a week ago! My inflammation is already reduced and no more new blackheads! The appearance of my KP is reduced and my skin is baby soft! Love love love it! Although expensive, it is the only lotion that had ever worked for me! Totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be like all the lotions recommended for dry skin. It was noticeable after 1&#x27;st application.it is slow to absorb so apply early before dressing.highly recommend.</li>
            <li> made me sweat; did not help my KP; if anything, made my skin on my legs break out. Not super moisturizing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of CeraVe products after my dermatologist recommended them.  Although I&#x27;ve been using alpha hydroxy and beta hydroxy products on my face for years, I&#x27;d never used one on my body.  I&#x27;ve been using this one for a few months now, and I swear my skin looks healthier with fewer brown spots from the sun.  I&#x27;m pretty skeptical when it comes to claims I read about products, but this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> I bought this on amazon. I use it on my face.bcos my face is really dry and flaky.U can see the visible difference by using this product. Amazing product for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product a couple years ago when I had had chronic dryness on my face from acne medications and my regular moisturizers just weren&#x27;t cutting it.  I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since and use it each morning and night. It is lightweight and absorbs easily like other daily moisturizers but is more hydrating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with annoying (and embarrassing) dry, flaky elbows. I tried a little bit of everything -- heavy moisturizing creams, exfoliating gloves, scrubs, etc. Finally, I asked my dermatologist about it and she recommended that I try Cerave SA. She was very specific about trying the SA version. I was thrilled to find out it worked. It took about 1 week to completely eradicate the flakiness on one elbow and about a week and a half on the other elbow. It&#x27;s a God-send in the winter when my condition is the worse. Highly recommended for targeted treatments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using it as a full body lotion but wasn&#x27;t as satisfied. The rest of my body responds best to heavy moisturizers. But this stuff still works like nothing else to eradicate dead skin.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work my my kp.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly as promised. My skin doctor prescribed this lotion; This price is much better than any of the local stores.</li>
            <li> CeraVe moisturizing Cream and the CeraVe Sa Renewing Skin Lotion were both recommended by my dermatologist after I had a severe allergic reaction to the lanolin in an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; product. It has been a life saver! It helped my hands heal from the chemical burn fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hands often because of my work. With a little CeraVe, my hands stay soft and keep from getting chapped. Before I used it, I would have cracks that bled throughout the dry months of winter, but not any more. Before trying CeraVe, nothing performed as well. (Tried a variety of natural, homemade, high-priced, and drug-store brands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CeraVe absorbs fast, leaves no greasy or sticky residue, and hands stay soft even after washing them. Some people find the scent disagreeable, but I find it light and not offensive. Getting a recommendation from a dermatologist was a real vote of confidence for the product. I&#x27;m a loyal user and feel that it is well than worth the price. A little dab goes a long way, so the value is much better than products that much be lathered on to have any effect.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin - this stuff works great</li>
            <li> This is everything for my adult acne skin!</li>
            <li> I learned about the Cereve line from my dermatologist and I think it&#x27;s a great lotion, especially for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s recommended for both adults and children.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and will buy it again. I have not finished one bottle and can feel a difference in my skin texture. Tip: no need to OVER apply. A little goes a long way and you do not want a tacky feel to your skin, do you?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of this! Loveeee it! Goodbye dry skin, it has even cleared some areas a little bit.  Wish I could use it all over my body but it&#x27;s small and expensive compared with other lotions, so I just use it in selected places.  Even though, it is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Immediate improvement (especially on the back of my arms). Used it once a day after showering for 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t used it in a few days now and I still see big results :)</li>
            <li> one of the best, better then pricey brands</li>
            <li> This lotion saved my skin! I woke up with extremely dry, flaky skin around my eyes and my right eye was swollen shut. I freaked out and looked online and found out I have eczema. I quickly researched for moisturizers and was debating between Cetaphil and Cerave. I&#x27;ve decided on Cerave after reviewing customer reviews. I read that Cetaphil makes your skin greasy. Cerave contains parabens which made me hesitate on purchasing this product. ANYWAYS...&lt;br /&gt;When I applied the lotion as soon as I purchased it and it burned so bad.. to the point I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t suppose to use it on my skin. I just kept using it almost every few hours. The first day I applied as frequently and as much as possible. After three days my skin was back to normal! This personally worked for me and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry itchy skin. Also removed scaly patches that I have had for years</li>
            <li> I love the way this lotion absorbs into the skin.  I use it on my arms and hands.  I can get dressed within 1 minute and don&#x27;t have to worry about it getting on my clothes or having trouble putting on jewelry.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t get all over your purse handles, which is a pet peeve of mine concerning greasy lotions.</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying this lotion and I have psoriasis on my hands and no the soles of feet. An I have gotten a rash from using a new medicine and once I started using the lotion after a couple of days. I am able to full use my hands again at work without worrying about them bleeding or cracking while I work. I work with my hands and I use them a lot and it‚Äôs so nice to a have lotion that actually works and it‚Äôs not a steroid base one like the ones I have been using from my doctor. I will definitely be buying this lotion again and honestly I am very happy I decided to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my pediatrician for my daughter&#x27;s eczema and it truly works!! My daughter&#x27;s skin is finally smooth after 6 years!</li>
            <li> I already knew I loved this lotion but I had never ordered it through Amazon.  I ordered it on Saturday and received it on Wednesday.  Thrilled with the fast service.  CeraVa Renewing Lotion does all it promises and more.  It will take away all of those annoying bumps on the back of my upper arms as well as keeping my elbows and heels soft and supple.  It is NOT greasy and absorbs well into the skin.  I think the salicylic acid is the key.</li>
            <li> Love this cream as keeps my skin from itching now that I&#x27;m going through menopause.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry fingertips and toes.  Nothing helps for very long.  I usually notice an improvement after using a new product but then that goes away fairly soon.  This is the best hand and foot cream I have ever tried.  I have been having a problem with deep cracks on my heels that split deep and are raw and painful to walk on.  I went to two different podiatrists about it and neither one had any real suggestions.  I have been using two different sanding devises on my heels to help prevent these cracks.  Since I started using the SA Renewing Lotion I practically don&#x27;t need the sanding devices.  Wow, what a difference.  My skin around my toes was so dry my toenails were growing in deformed.  I am well on the way to recovery with one bottle of this cream. I am no longer embarrassed for someone to see my fingers.  Thanks Cerave SA, I am on subscribe and save for this one.</li>
            <li> Cerave Sa lotion works great. It moisturizers without the heavy greasy feel. I have eczema and sometimes get dry patches with flaky skin but I haven&#x27;t had any since I started using this product daily.</li>
            <li> My 4-year old daughter has keratosis pilaris (white/red bumps) on the back of her arms that is pretty severe.  No other lotions or creams have seemed to help except for this one!  Every night after bath, I rub this on her arms and it&#x27;s dramatically decreased.  Wish the bottle was bigger!</li>
            <li> I am using this to get rid of &amp;#34;chicken scratch&amp;#34;. I have been using this for about a month. I&#x27;ve been using it about every other day and I try to use it at morning and night. I have noticed my arms are softer but it&#x27;s still there so far. One thing I do not care for is it is very greasy. Whether I wear sleeves or a sleeveless shirt my arms seem to stay &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; all day long until I shower it off.</li>
            <li> Cerave lotion has hyaluronic acid...a key ingredient for healthy looking skin. Best part about this lotion is the drug store cost!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Keeps KP in check.</li>
            <li> This soaks in almost immediately and leaves my skin incredibly smooth. I have never used a body lotion that soaked in so that after a shower I could get dressed and not feel sticky.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, but I don&#x27;t notice anything about it that really justifies its higher price tag. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth continuing to spend more money on it.</li>
            <li> Best I have tried for my dark circles and particuly puffy bags.  Noticed improved first use.  Will buy again. I am in my 70&#x27;s so need lots of help.</li>
            <li> amazing stuff. makes my skin super soft. no more dry patches or bumps</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, as with other reviewers, it felt kinda heavy. I use it on my face to moisturize after Aztec Secret clay. It makes my skin feel soft and has dramatically improved my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff helps with the little fine lines on my face. And it doesn&#x27;t bother my acne prone skin either. I haven&#x27;t  found a cereve product I didn&#x27;t  like!</li>
            <li> Used this continuosly for 2 month but see no improvement on my KP. My KP bumps seem to increase instead. Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry feet. Husband has had excellent result using product 2x&#x27;s a day.</li>
            <li> It is very good for rough dry itchy skin.  I use it on the bottom of my feet.  Don&#x27;t take it to the airport though.  They will confiscate it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too expensive and doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> So it should go without saying that nothing works for everyone....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me: very sensitive skin (can&#x27;t even use popular mineral foundation blushes without rashy reactions); have had mild to moderate acne for over 10 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been using very natural/gentle products and a few vitamin supplements with moderate success, but a trusted family member recommend Cerave lotion to me.  I have the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; kind and use it on my body, not face, and like it very much.  It doesn&#x27;t cause trouble on my face, but I don&#x27;t like it as much as other products I have so I&#x27;ve continue to use it up as a body lotion.  Anyway,  I also use 5% BP on my face as a spot treatment, but I thought it would be nice to use something that is supposed to help before spots show up.  I read up about SA and decided to try this because I like Cerave lotion and I had just run out of the other moisturizer I had used on my face the last two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion feels totally different than regular Cerave, it&#x27;s a gross feeling on my face, very heavy, but after one day my skin looked better, so I switched to applying it at night after the first time.  Things went well day 2, so I decided to use on my chest and upper back and arms (where I can&#x27;t use benzoyl peroxide because it bleaches fabric).  Two more days of this - on chest, back and arms and, by now, 4 days on the face - and I was seriously breaking out like I don&#x27;t ever remember, everywhere I had put the lotion.  Almost a month later I still have scars that have yet to fade from those breakouts, they were that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 4 days I never touched the stuff again.  Fortunately the reaction it caused stopped after discontinuing the lotion and though it&#x27;s taken time to heal, there have been no more breakouts like I saw 4 days after using this product.  Be very cautious at first should you decide to try this for yourself.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and the effect</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this and its very nice.  It&#x27;s great body lotion but also light enough for a hand lotion also.  Gets a teeny bit greasy on hands but it&#x27;s worth the wait till it soaks in.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested this product. Couldn&#x27;t find it at a local pharmacy, so I ordered it online. It is very effective at moisturizing my very dry legs, heels and elbows. They now feel smooth and silky. It absorbs quickly into the skin. I am also rubbing it into my neck to see if it smooths out some of those lines. Seems to be working...not a miracle, but helpful.</li>
            <li> works great for keratosis pilaris of the skin, use it twice daily on the affected skin, it does work wonders</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician and this is easily one of my favorite dry skin lotions on the market.  It goes on easily, absorbs fast and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a sticky residue so you can dress right away.  Also, there is barely any scent, which is nice if you want to add your own.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and the wrinkles are dark spots on my arms diminished.  My dermatologist recommended this product to get rid of dry scaley skin.</li>
            <li> This really softens skin. It is not greasy, is easy to apply, and soaks right in, besides having ceramides which dermatologists recommend.</li>
            <li> I have feet issues (from DVT, not diabetes). I could not discern that this lotion did anything whatsoever to alleviate this.</li>
            <li> Great multipurpose lotion that&#x27;s softens and exfoliates</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled with little bumps on my face for years...they are embarrassing and I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of them. When I put on make up, you can see them even more which makes me very self conscious. Lately I started getting the same bumps on my arms and my new dermatologist recommended this lotion. I tried it on my arms and within days it cleared them up. I decided to try this lotion on my face and it was unbelievable. It&#x27;s been only a week now and my face has not been this clear since I was a teen. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> I have little bumps on my upper arms which are apparently &#x27;keratosis pilaris&#x27;. I read about this product in a magazine and decided to give it a shot, since the salicylic acid is supposed to help. And it did from the first use. Apply at night, and in the morning, my skin is significantly smoother and the appearance of bumps are lessened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, after a week of using the product each night, the bumps still reappear - a nature of the chronic skin condition, no doubt - so just be mindful that regular use and a large dose of patience is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion offers good coverage without being too oily, and is readily-absorbed. It has good consistency, and has no fragrance at all. I will continue to use CeraVe SA and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for sensitive skin. My skin feels soft and best part is it doesn&#x27;t leave oily residue. Cannot imagine switching to another lotion.</li>
            <li> I developed a terrible reaction to latex gloves that I used for gardening and my hands were extremely itchy and had blisters.  My dermatologist suggested Cerave lotion and said it was the best lotion on the market.  It is pricey, but definitely worth it.  I can feel a noticeable and immediate different in my hands -- both the texture of the skin and the decrease in itchiness.  I also had a prescription steroid cream, but feel like the Cerave SA Lotion worked better for me in reducing the itchiness than the steroid lotion did.  This is truly an exceptional product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and works really well!</li>
            <li> CeraVe SA Renewing Skin is amazing. At 70 yrs., my Dermatologist recommend this for ultra dry flaky skin with scaly crusty bumps. The 2nd week my skin was becoming smooth again &amp; after 30 days, no more scales or crustys. I thought &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;, &amp; started using on my face too. OMG!  The lines &amp; wrinkles are disappearing.  I am looking 35yrs younger.. I am so pleased &amp; gratful. This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> It has mineral oil, just to be aware</li>
            <li> Great for my tired, old skin and not too oily. Leaves your skin feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my Dermatologist for my long time sun exposed skin. Great moisture replacement and helped smooth out most of my skin bumps and irritated areas. You need to give it a little time, a week or so, worked also on dry and itching areas. Love all Cerave products!!</li>
            <li> Non-greasy. odorless lotion. Leaves skin super smooth.</li>
            <li> the price was great i bought a 2 pack, this is the only lotion i use i would not change it for anything else&lt;br /&gt;it moisterizes my face and body and stays on the whole day.. ive gotten so many compliments on my face that it is smooth and hydrated.. great lotion</li>
            <li> I do like every CeraVe product. In generaly they have a great product line. They are not scented, but also don ªt smell clinical like Cetaphil does. They absorb easily and leave the skin moisturised. I ecspecially like the moisturizing wash 12 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This SA lotion also shares these nice attributes, good feel, no smell.  But the SA lotion does not seem to do anything for my bumps, either the Keratosis Pillaris or the acne.  While it does not irritate my skin or burn, it also doesn ªt seem effective. It is ‚Öî the size of their other lotions, so the value diminishes too. While it is a fine lotion, I do not see the benefit of this one in paticular over their other lotions. I will use up the product but would not repurchase this one due to the poor value of this one and no added benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about a year and the results are great. My skin is serverely sun damaged after 40+ years but for the time CeraV is doing a really good job. I only wish I had stead out of the sun or found CeraV years ago.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like you spent money only to put a watery product on, it works and makes a difference !</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise!!! My dermatologist told me to try it for my aging teflon fingers (I can&#x27;t shuffle paper) &amp; it seems to really help. Otherwise, it&#x27;s the best ever as a skin lotion. Love it.</li>
            <li> I first tried Cerave Sa when my dermatologist recommended it and I really love it.  I use this on my arms and legs every time I get out of the shower. It has really made a measurable difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition and was recomended this lotion. I have been extremely happy with it. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it! The product is so good! I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> God lord, my skin was so dry. I must be the only girl in the world, to have acne with oily skin on face and extremely dry cracked, 80 year old skin on my legs. ands and arms were headed dry too.Tried everything - NOTHING worked. Aveeno, Nivea, Vaseline, Dove, Eucerin - name it and i had tried it with no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended this and whew, this worked. Its expensive, but its great to have normal skin, for the most part, again.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this for my dry, bumpy skin.  It contains salcylic acid and I noticed a difference immediately.  I&#x27;ve been using this and the moisturizer with spf daily and they are wonderful products.  Try them, you will be pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;ve used Cerave sa all summer and my skin is completely different.  Smoother, softer, and bumps and age spots have definitely reduced.  I just wish they would make it in a larger size.</li>
            <li> I suffered from some minor adult acne and some serious redness where they would show up. This SA lotion is light, absorbs quickly and does not leave a shiny residue like others, and does not have any distracting scent. The SA keeps my pores unblocked and normalizes my skin, reduced the redness within a few days and keeps it moisturized during the winter. I use it in conjunction with the Cerave daily facial cleanser. Also, I apply this in the morning and at night before bed. Be advised, you may want to apply sunblock after this has been absorbed before spending some time outdoors, or wear a hat.</li>
            <li> I am sold on all these CeraVe products, they are better than all the oh so expensive products out there that they are in a class above them all.  I can not even begin to tell you the difference CeraVe has made on my skin, no more dead dry pealing skin on my face, its completely healed the dry patches, improved the evenness of my skin tone, completely toned down the redness.  I am a lifetime follower.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product for dry skin.  It works.  My dermatologist recommended it to me.  Don&#x27;t worry about the price.  Help your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion because it is exfoliating as well as moisturizing.  I am using it for my feet and back of my hands and put it on before I go to sleep for about 1 month now.  Both hands and feet feel so soft now.  My dermatologist recommended this lotion in particular.  Worth the money as it has worked well.</li>
            <li> For me it simply works and therefore is worth the money</li>
            <li> Pro: it makes my skin smooth and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigger Pro: if used with &amp;#34;St. Ives Fresh Skin Invigorating Apricot Scrub&amp;#34; your chicken skin will reduce.</li>
            <li> once i used this i loved it..it is thick but smoothes on face nicely..i also use on my neck, chest and hands..i swear it has improved my 66 yr old skin..i was looking for something to fade a few brown spots and this seems to be doing it also..i was surprised..if you touch your face once you apply it will feel a little sticky, but really isn&#x27;t..just the way it is..i put my makeup over it too and sleep with it every night..would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Love it best sink cream i have ever used</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s doctor recommended this when she was about a month old since she had very dry skin. I liked it so much I use it on myself too! It works really well and is great on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I had read all the reviews, and I was anxious to try it on my Keratosis Pilaris. I have been using it morning and night for the past two months. Nothing. Oh well. But, my 5-year-old daughter has really sensitive skin. She has a tendency of getting severe dry patches. It does wonders for that. It softens them after one application versus the multiple ones with Aveeno Eczema cream.</li>
            <li> I was even using prescription gel and ointment on the Karatosis Pilaris on my upper arms and it wasn&#x27;t until I stopped them both and started using this, that I saw significant improvement and relief from a particularly rough and itchy patch!!</li>
            <li> Have been dealing with very dry facial skin for several months.  I have tried multiple products from drugstores and spas, nothing worked. After using this for 2 days they dry, flaky skin was gone! Can&#x27;t believe how well this worked and how cheap it is. Amazed!</li>
            <li> It is perfect for a moisturizer. My dermatologist recomened this for me.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in stores and also cheaper on Amazon. This product recommended by my dermatologist and it&#x27;s the only thing that gets my skin through the winter!!!  Use every morning at least and your dry skin will be no more!!!!</li>
            <li> well, i did not read the information very carefully since i intended to buy lotion for my face and i have combination skin type instead of extrmely dry. i like fragrance- free stuff, so i  tried it on my hands and calves, and it was great. i don&#x27;t like mineral oil in the ingredients but my hands felt soft but not sticky. hand lotion it is.</li>
            <li> Its little bit different with the one I bought it from supermarket. Not only package, but also the lotion  is different from my former one. I am considering that if I bought the fake  one or not?</li>
            <li> I tried this for my psoriasis, and it worked! A couple of hours after application I noticed a softening of the affected areas. I gave it only 4 stars because it tends to get a bit sticky after a while ( 5 - 6 hours).</li>
            <li> Works exactly as described; delivered promptly!</li>
            <li> Cerave was recommended by my doctor for extremely, ghastly dry skin.  Upon application, the healing action could be clearly sensed and after a week the renewal could be verified.  An excellent product that achieves what no other had in the past.  My elbows and knuckles are like those of a newly born child and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the utter smoothness and incredibly vibrant, healthy look of areas of my body I presumed dead long ago.  My grandchildren no longer are repulsed and my friends no longer repelled by my horrific skin problem and I can once again face strangers without the fear of them stepping as if sickened by what they saw.  Cerave has made a tremendous difference and I only wish I had been made aware of it decades ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had KP on upper arms and sides of upper thighs for as long as I can remember.  This is the only lotion I have ever used that clears it at least 95%.  Excellent for rest of body. Smoothed the crepe appearance on calves. Moisturizes all day even after 2 hours at the gym. Softest my skin has ever been and Amazon price is $5.00 less than sale at discount store, $8.00 less than dermatologist.  Let me add that I am not talking about young skin that looks good anyway, 55 years.  Make sure you use sunscreen at all times especially with a product with Sacylic Acid</li>
            <li> Good price -- god product -- it has reduced the bumps on my arms....I was buying a very expensive product to do the same thing -- it but this product works almost as well!!</li>
            <li> I have small bumps on my upper arms for years. Was originally told that they were incomplete hair follicles. I spent a lot of time trying to loofah or scrub them away to no avail. My derm gave me a sample of this and told me to use it daily after showering. My arms look much better.</li>
            <li> As an eczema sufferer, I&#x27;m always frustrated by my skin&#x27;s sensitivities. A friend of mine works for a dermatologist and suggested cerave. I found it on Amazon at a lower price than my local pharmacy, and decided to give it a go. I&#x27;m almost done with the bottle and have to say, my skin is soft and happy! No bumps, no itchiness, no irritation! Worth the money, I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I am a 38 year old man. Moving to the north east from Florida, I had developed eczema and rosacea, in the brutal winter I would flare up till my skin was unbearable..been to a dermatologist and he would prescribe me all these steroid creams, pro topic that is toxic (but they do work). I have spent thousands on different creams and cosmetic to remedy my red face, a colleague who was aware of my problem,  gave a small sample to try and I could see the difference the next day. MY skin is even toned now and Healthy. Can&#x27;t beat the price compared to all the designer creams...not all creams have to be expensive to work. Stop by the dermatologist office and see what they sell over the counter, if it&#x27;s too expensive there, get the name and go to a local pharmacy or this site to buy and save.&lt;br /&gt;Good example that not cream have to be expensive, google  Nivea cream ( made in Germany ) vs. creme de mer&lt;br /&gt;Creme de la mer $150-2,000 per jar&lt;br /&gt;Nivea cream ( must be made in Germany) $10 or less&lt;br /&gt;They both have the exact ingredients except nivea does not have seaweed.&lt;br /&gt;Nivea outperformed creme de la mer. Do the research and see for yourself. Btw... I don&#x27;t get paid for this</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing lotion.  It can be used anywhere on your body, including your face and neck.  Did a great job clearing up a winter rash on my leg as well as helping with dry skin on my face without casing acne.  Love this.</li>
            <li> I have Keratosis Pilaris and was recommended by my dermatologist to use this&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for two days and my bumps are already a lot smaller and the purple/reddish tint in the area is a lot lighter&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been using it on the rest of my body as I have chronic dry skin due to diabetes and it&#x27;s working great for that as well</li>
            <li> Works well.put it on at night, in the morning and right after shower before dry to  lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and really softens the skin. Have used this product for several years.  Really like the new packaging</li>
            <li> This is the best product for dry skin.  The only problem I had was you have to let it dry or it will be a little sticky on your skin.</li>
            <li> My skin gets UNBEARABLY itchy every winter as soon as it gets cold outside.  I&#x27;ve tried tons of &amp;#34;extra-dry skin&amp;#34; lotions including (but not limited to) Gold Bond, Nivea, Burts Bees, Kiss My Face, Vaseline, Nutrogena, and Jergens.  Nothing has helped.  The itchiness is worst at night and it has been one of the main reasons I HATE WINTER!  Then I found Cerave Sa (the regular Cerave wash was recommended by my dermatologist and that led me to Cerave Sa) and my winter itchy skin is gone!  This winter is twice as cold as last winter and I am still itch free this year because I&#x27;m using the Cerve Sa after every shower.  As a bonus, my thighs are clear of the red, bumpy, &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; they so often develop in the winter.  I love this lotion!</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion at the recommendation of my doctor.  It&#x27;s not worth the price - I get better results from less expensive, typical drugstore products such as Jergens or Vaseline Intensive Care lotion.</li>
            <li> As advertized, great product!</li>
            <li> This lotion is worth the price. I bought it to use as a pre and post epilatory lotion because it has salicylic acid in it which exfoliates the skin and so helps to prevent ingrown hairs. I also found that it works a miracle on eczema! My daughter has very stubborn eczema and we&#x27;ve tried everything from prescription ointments to Crisco on the rough scaly patches she gets on her legs. Nothing helped but this lotion cleared it up with two applications! The only draw back for me is that it is a little irritating on freshly shaven or epilated skin, but what do you expect form a lotion that has acid in it. The smooth skin is worth the slight burn and it only lasts a short minute. (It doesn&#x27;t seem to bother my daughter at all).</li>
            <li> My doctor told me to purchase this lotion and I found it on line. Better price. Very good product for over dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> I had previous reviewed this product as being quite MEH. It helped a bit with my Keratosis pilaris on the back of my arms, but the back of my legs not so much. However, I realized I needed to apply the stuff religiously and keep at it long-term. I have been way more conscious about applying the lotion to my arms and legs right after I shower. I use a generous amount, work it into my skin, and then let it sit before getting dressed so it doesn&#x27;t get rubbed off. The results have been near perfect skin on my arms and legs. Not only do they look better, but they also feel smooth like the skin on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR - This product will fix your skin issues if you use it daily and keep at it for weeks/months.</li>
            <li> Really great lotion.  Used to use Cerave cream which came in a pot.  Our dermatologist recommended SA last year so we switched to this formulation.  It feels great, esp in winter.  Non greasy but rich and softening.  Amazon has the best prices I have found for this lotion.  Our Costco does not stock it.  They can order it but it takes a few days and sometimes tell me it is not in stock.  Wish there was a larger size. 8 ounces does not last long in our house.  We buy 3 at a time.</li>
            <li> Great Lotion for dry skin.Great Product. Great Price. Fast Delivery</li>
            <li> I got this lotion for a few reasons. I have dry patches on my knees and ankles. I have face and body acne and hoped it might help clear it, or at least soften the little under the skin bumps/roughness. It didn&#x27;t help with the acne/skin roughness at all. It did, however, help with the dry patches. I also used it on my feet at night. When applied liberally it really does soften the skin and make it super soft and supple. However, know it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;stretch\\&quot; very far. I liked its softening effects enough that I was using it as a body lotion after the shower, but you have to use a LOT of it to \\&quot;liberally\\&quot; cover the skin, and it&#x27;s kind of hard to \\&quot;pull\\&quot; across the skin, you need to pull your skin a little. It won&#x27;t last long, either. I would say this is best for someone with an ample wallet and not too sensitive skin, who just wants to turn their normal/dry skin super soft and touchable. For anyone frugal, or looking to heal more severe skin problems, I would say pass. (If you&#x27;re using it as a hand n foot lotion only, then it would be affordable.)</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever. Will change the texture of your skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a sample of this lotion to try for my extremely dry skin.  I was hooked.  This works great - nice &amp; thick but absorbs great &amp; helps make my skin look so much healthier.  The only negative thing I can say is it has a bit of a strange smell to it.  It goes away quickly so that is good &amp; is not anything that will take away from the positives on it.</li>
            <li> I got this cream because my doctor recommended it.  It seems to work well.  It improved the looks of my skin on my arms.  Works on my heels, too.</li>
            <li> I have used many products and I can say this no is no better then any others except non greasy so you can use it and not stick to anything unlike some products that you feel as if you are a big piece of Velcro.  The  price is good so that&#x27;s a plus but overall no difference.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion for my keratosis. It helps the problem a lot! My only complaint is that it has cancer causing parabens in it... so I avoid using it too often. I wish they would re-do the formula to make it paraben free.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our dermatologist.  Works.</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  Best cream ever!</li>
            <li> Did not work for my keratosis pilaris as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great hydration for the whole body.</li>
            <li> I am in such disbelief, but when I look in the mirror the proof is right there. I am  25 years old and have had continuous acne  ALL my life! I&#x27;m a rare exception in that my acne prone skin is sensitive and gets so dry so I have a hard time finding lotions that don&#x27;t have all the extra acne irritating ingredients but that still moisturize my skin as too many of the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; options don&#x27;t. I took a chance on this lotion because I saw it contained salicylic acid in it and don&#x27;t have anything to lose. I always had acne. Yes, had. Not severe acne but it just never went away, even with a clairisonic and expensive acne systems. I&#x27;ve kept the rest of my regimen the same, only changing the lotion for this one and I can&#x27;t believe how clear and smooth my face is! I&#x27;m blown away! And every day I check for new zits but I&#x27;m elated to say I still see clear skin. This lotion changed my life and as long as it keeps delivering, this will be my holy grail. My make up looks flawless afterwards. I&#x27;m not getting too oily in my t-zone, I&#x27;m not dry in other areas, no flakes, no new pimples. I could cry! Also this is so much more affordable then buying it in stores where they charge twice as much !&lt;br /&gt;****** UPDATE March 11 2015&lt;br /&gt;I am STILL loving this product and still seeing results!!! There were a few times that I ran out and went a few weeks before I could buy a new one and I started seeing acne pop up again as well as enlarged pores and texture issues. I saw it on sale at target and quickly snagged it. The very next say I saw improvements from my new appearing acne. A woman I used to work with asked me what I did for my skin and I recommended this lotion to her . I hadn&#x27;t heard from her about it so I asked her about two weeks later. I expected her to tell me that it didn&#x27;t really work for her but she let me know that she did in fact see results and was very happy with her smoothing skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Since I first tried this product I could not wait to review it. It has been reliable for me ever since and it still rings true. As long as it exists I will keep buying faithfully!ever since and it still rings true. As long as it exists I will keep buying faithfully!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. It&#x27;s well worth the price for the only thing that takes care of the rough and bumpy skin I get on the side of my legs and back of thighs. It&#x27;s my go to.</li>
            <li> Easy spreading.  Feels fabulous. Recommended by my dermatologist and I&#x27;m glad I listened.  A little more expensive than some lotions but worth the extra cost. e</li>
            <li> Living in cold 7 months of the year our family has found Cerave Sa Renewing Skin Lotion to be effective in eliminating dry skin.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist suggested CeraVe for psoriasis patients and the Sa if you have very dry knotty skin. My skin looks better than it has in years</li>
            <li> I have rosacea, a mild case thankfully, and this lotion (along with the hydrating cleanser) makes my skin look beautiful!  I use both on my face and body.</li>
            <li> I use CeraVe AM Lotion already and was needing to order some more so I went on Amazon and saw this new Lotion.  I did a lot of reading about the product on several sites and thought I would give it a try.  I wound up ordering 2 instead on 1 so I had my Mom try it too and we both really like it.  It makes our skin feel soft and hydrated but it&#x27;s not heavy or greasy.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a light moisturizer that make you skin look and feel awesome...</li>
            <li> All  Cerave products are awesome especially for problem skin. I have sever sun damage with Actinic Keratosis (pre-cancer scaly  lesions) and these product are the best.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I&#x27;m just amazed at how great this lotion is and how significant the results are. I have very dry skin and a minor case of eczema. I started using this plus the renewing cream and it&#x27;s worked like magic. My skin is so smooth and hydrated like never before. I love that it&#x27;s easily absorbed and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy/icky.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my feet looking pretty good.  I guess it really does exfoliate dry skin as it promises on the label.  I buy it repeatedly and use it all the time on feet, nails, arms, legs.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  It gives what it promises.</li>
            <li> I started using the Cerave Day and Night Moisturizing Lotions in conjunction with Aczone as recommended by my dermatologist in April 2013 after having a reaction to the tea tree oil in a moisturizer from an organic line. After I no longer needed the Aczone, I decided to try the SA Renewing Lotion in November 2014 and it has made a wonderful difference in my skin. I have sensitive and oily skin overall but my face gets get dry/flaky patches, bumps especially on the forehead, and I had discolored spots all over my face from years of acne through my late 20s. I now have no bumps on my forehead, my skin is not overly dry or oily in any one area, and the color of the spots has decreased significantly to where they&#x27;re barely noticeable. I rarely get pimples anymore and only treat my skin with the SA Renewing Lotion and Alba Botanical Acne-Dote face wash in the morning, and coconut oil at night to remove dirt. As a disclaimer, I will say that since I first began using the Cerave brand, I stopped wearing my daily full-face makeup mainly due to my reaction to the other lotion, and have been mostly foundation and powder free since the summer of 2013, except for my wedding and special events. This has most likely  helped in speeding up the healing of my skin; however, I can also tell a great difference between the effects of this lotion and the other lotions I have used over the many years that I have been into makeup and skincare. it is not sticky, oily, or runny, and can be used perfectly under makeup and primer. This is a great line of products that I plan to continue using for many years!</li>
            <li> I love all of the Cerave products for my severely dry skin. This SA (Salicylic Acid) lotion is nice to rotate in to my routine to keep the skin cells turning over.  Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so you will have to determine how often to use it with your skin type.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  Recommended by my doctor for really dry skin and it does the job!</li>
            <li> absorbs quickly and really makes a difference when applied daily after shower. My skin is very nice and silky now</li>
            <li> Since high school, I always had problem skin on my face.  Sometimes I would get red bumps, that look like my skin is super irritated. Sometimes I would get acne. My face was always incredibly sensitive, red, and dry (with flaky patches).  I mean, super duper sensitive and red.  Sometimes I would have eczema.  I tried literally dozens of products, everything from grocery store to drugstore, to very expensive cosmetic/department store brands.  I special ordered &amp;#34;super-sensitive&amp;#34; skin products. Sometimes things would work for a couple of weeks, but never any longer.  Frustrating to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over a year ago, I found this product, and what the heck, might as well try it.  I also bought the Cerave hydrating cleanser. At that point, my skin was so bad I couldn&#x27;t wear makeup or anything else, so these were the ONLY 2 products I was using.  After a week or two, my skin was noticeably better. A few weeks in, and my skin was the best I&#x27;ve had in over a decade. A decade, imagine that!!  I used only those 2 products for several months, and my skin stayed clear.  I eventually was able to add a very gentle makeup (alimapure, for anyone wondering).  A year later, my skin is now the best it has ever been.  It is still not flawless - it is still red, and I get the occasional bump/pimple. But so much better than it was, it isn&#x27;t even funny.  I finally feel comfortable going out, I don&#x27;t feel like everyone is staring at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, so this may not work for you. But if you are anything like me, it is definitely worth a shot!! Good luck</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hands from always washing them. No matter how much lotion I would put on nothing would work. So I saw this product on tv and thought I&#x27;d give a it a try. I only been using it for two days now and I ALREADY see a big difference. My hands look sooo much better and feel smoother. I would recommend this product if you have extremely dry skin, it is a bit pricey but it does REALLY WORK.</li>
            <li> I use this religiously after every shower, head to toe.  This, and it&#x27;s twin Amlactin with ceramides, have forever banished the itchy dry skin I had every winter living in the desert.</li>
            <li> I heard the effect is good, but I bought it by the wrong season.</li>
            <li> I have had keratosis pilaris--dry, rough, bumpy skin--on my arms for as long as I can remember. Recently I went to a dermatologist for the first time and she recommended this lotion. I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical. I&#x27;ve tried dozens and dozens of lotions. Nothing has ever made the bumps go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In less than a week using Cerave SA I have noticed a remarkable difference. No more signs of keratosis pilaris! Amazing! I&#x27;m blown away. This stuff is awesome. It has no smell and is absorbed really quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy. One review docked it a star for not \\&quot;curing\\&quot; a chronic skin condition, which I don&#x27;t think is fair. Obviously if I stopped using this lotion the dry skin would return. But using it once a day has made a visible and remarkable difference in my skin. I&#x27;m beyond thrilled. Everyone should have this stuff in their cabinet.</li>
            <li> No greasy feel, absorbs quickly, and, with regular use, improved my hands&#x27; look and feel. Also got rid of the bumps on my upper arm. Good product, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get Amlactin on subscribe and save, but this product is available. It works ok, but not as exfoliating as the LA in Amlactin.  Will stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Works well on my dry skin and helps keep winter itchiness at bay.  I prefer scented lotions - but this came highly recommended by my dermatologist, so I decided to give it a try.  It seems a little medicinal, but it works.  The Sa version helps slough off dead skin -- according to the dermatologist, and I can&#x27;t can&#x27;t find it in the local drugstore -- bravo for Amazon!</li>
            <li> It works.  11 yr old daughter very conscious of the those little bumps on the upper side of her arms.  Dermatologist recommended.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, dermatologist recommended. Great price but really high shipping.  Still the best price</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Keeps my skin smooth and bump free</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. Love it. Its on the spendy side but its worth every cent! I use it on my legs, on my arms, on my face, even my rough elbows end up smooth and soft. Its gentle enough for my face and didn&#x27;t cause a single blemish. With dry winter months upon me I wanted something that would work without feeling heavy and greasy, and this stuff if great. I&#x27;m a big fan and won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> Great product for my very dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is a good moisturizing lotion, but it has not smoothed out any of the bumps on my arms. I have what I think is keratosis pilaris and this is supposedly a good treatment for the condition. I have used this for two weeks, my skin definitely feels moisturized which is a relief from the cold and dry weather but no visible improvements yet. I don&#x27;t have a lot of bumps to begin with, maybe 5-10 bumps on each arm so I thought it would be easy to fix. I will try using this twice a day for another two weeks and see if it helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff works....it really works ...not tomorrow, not next week, NOW. My husband has very dry skin wipe it on and you can see the skin rejuvenate right before your eyes. Came recommend from his Dr. ....but it works anyhow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now, and the &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34; on my arms definitely looks and feels better.  My skin is also softer.  I had a patch of dry skin on my face and used this for 2 days and it went away completely!</li>
            <li> I am a new fan of the CeraVe line, but I purchased this in hopes that like with many others, it would help the KP problem on my upper arms. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over 2 weeks and I definitely see major improvements. It doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of this visible pore issue, but my arms are much softer and nowhere near as bumpy. Hopefully it will keep getting better with continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried the KP Duty products that cost anywhere from $65 to $80 a tube for a lot less oz.. and this stuff beats that line hands down for a fraction of the price, plus many more ounces! Will keep purchasing!</li>
            <li> Oh boy, is this skin lotion good! This is my first time using it and it&#x27;s going to be a staple with my grooming products. It penetrates quickly and leaves the skin extremely smooth with no greasy residue. Plus, the added benefit of absolutely no fragrance makes this a winning choice for me.</li>
            <li> I have these tiny little bumps that start at my elbow and go up about ten inches. I&#x27;ve had them since I can remember and they won&#x27;t go away!!! This did not get rid of the bumps however, it did moisturize my skin. So 4 stars for that, but I can&#x27;t help feel it lacks in exfoliating properties.</li>
            <li> My child had KP and thing to we have tried everything to get him to stop itching.  This cream if regularly applied will help with itching and help drying it up. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and I am really happy with it. This lotion is neither too thick nor is it too watery. It does an excellent job moisturizing my hands for extended periods. The other thing I like about it is that it absorbed quickly and does not make your hands sticky.</li>
            <li> didnt work for me. could not get rid of acne. I think this actually caused it. i ended up using the acne.org lotion. so much better.</li>
            <li> I love all of the Cerave products! This lotion is a must-have for anyone with keratosis pilaris. I&#x27;ve tried everything and this is the only thing that helps smooth my arms and lessen the ugly &amp;#34;chicken skin&amp;#34;.  My dermatologist recommended this and I&#x27;m so grateful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this lotion! I originally ordered this lotion for my keratosis pilaris but it didn&#x27;t completely get rid of it, just mad it a little less visible then before. This lotion lighten the dark marks on my skin making it look clear and feeling unbelievably soft. I haven&#x27;t tried this on my face being that I&#x27;m skeptical about using certain products on my face. I gave this 4 stars because the bottle is small, I finished this in about 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of my keratosis pilaris (little bumps my upper arms) since I was a little kid. I tried all kinds of special lotions and creams that my dermatologist recommended, but none of them ever made much of a difference. My mother had a doctor recommend Cerave with salicylic acid for her very dry skin and keratosis, so I figured I would give it a try. It absorbed quickly and wasn&#x27;t greasy. I noticed almost immediate results in my skin. The bumps, while still there, were flatter and smoother than before. After a few days, I continued to see more improvement. I&#x27;m really impressed with Cerave SA and I would recommend it to anyone who has keratosis pilaris or dry skin.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this for my feet. It works great, but it is messy. It does not completely soak into the skin and lease an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I am normally the type to go for organic / natural type products that smell fruity, but a dermatologist recommended CeraVe products to me when I went in with overly dry skin.  I bought this lotion and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the salicylic acid for exfoliation and hyaluronic acid for moisture, it leaves my skin feeling softer and smoother than it&#x27;s ever been.  The more you use it the better it works.  It&#x27;s not at all greasy or shiny.  It absorbs beautifully and works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much I am now using the face lotion and body wash as well - both of which are great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a warning against the sunscreen product though - it says it has Invisible Zinc that dries clear, but it most definitely left me looking pale and white.  Someone even commented to me that I really needed to get in the sun.  I returned that product, but love all the others.</li>
            <li> Works great on skin where it has buffed by the micro - pedi callus remover. Keeps the skin soft as long as it is used consistently</li>
            <li> Since I have very itchy/dry skin in the winter, I have probably tried every lotion there is out there.  I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m unable to use scented products.  This lotion is the best for me.  It&#x27;s slightly expensive, but defintely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion to help with dry skin and to make my arms look nice for my wedding. I used it for 2 days and developed a red bumpy itchy rash all overy arms that lasted for a week. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist for my eczema, and it works.  I use it every time after showering.  It does take a little time to absorb into skin, but I just do my hair and everything else while waiting for the lotion to sink in.  I still have to use my steroid spray every once in a while to combat the eczema, but combined with this lotion, it works.  If I had one complaint, it would be the cost.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical. Like many other reviewers, I have tried COUNTLESS lotions and potions to try &amp; get rid of the KP bumps on my arms. My dermatologist recommended this so I tried it for about 2 weeks before posting this review and it honestly is making a big difference for me. It is helping exfoliate and rid my arms of bumps so I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li> This product is the absolute best had lotion I have ever used. It keeps hands soft all during the day despite using hand soaps and hand sanitizers</li>
            <li> I have DSAP and those of us that have DSAP know how we battle rough skin. This is very effective and smoothing. Isn&#x27;t a cure, but is very helpful in keeping my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for the women in my life and they rave about it.  It was also highly rated by SweetHome.com, which is my starting point for finding good stuff for the home.  A bit pricey, but as I say, the experts love it.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle as it removed some serious problem areas..  Recommended by my doctor for rough, bumpy skin.  He said to apply in one direction only to prevent follicle irritation.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t real sure I liked this when I first used it. Unlike the rest of the Cerave Products, it had a weird almost tacky feel to it after you put it on, instead of soaking into your skin like the other products do. However, after continued use, my skin is so much softer with this than with the other products. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! I am 24 years old and have never had acne or skin issues. Suddenly a month ago my face started to become DRY, dry as in my face felt so tight it would hurt to move it. The skin under my eyes began to peel, and soon that peeling spread to the rest of my face. I tried so many different moisturizers including super expensive ones. I finally decided to go to my dermatologist and he recommended this product. Within the first few hours the skin on my face began to finally look better after a week of dealing with peeling like crazy! IT IS THE BEST I began to cry the next day because I was so happy and didn&#x27;t have to apply it 10 times a day like the other moisturizers.&lt;br /&gt;Skin no longer feels tight or peeling :)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it...great for eczema and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Wish I had discovered this product long ago.  I heard of it when a Dermatologist recommended it to a relative.</li>
            <li> I have problems with hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin) on the soles of my feet till cracks appear. This works like a charm! I had doubts at first that this would work. In the past I had a thick prescription creme. This feels like a typical lotion so I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well. To my surprise it does! They both have salicylic acid, so I  guess that&#x27;s one of the major factors in making them work.  My feet look and feel younger without a prescription!  Since I had such satisfying results on my feet, I have used it intermittently on the backs of my arms (I get little dry bumps on the back that hardly ever go away, forgot the medical term) and occasionally on my hands when they are so dry they start to feel rough, and this stuff really makes a difference!  So if you are looking for something that offers a little more than your basic lotions or cremes to get down deep within dry skin, this should do the trick based on my experience. I saw a study online about this with dry skin so I thought I would give it a chance and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I have never put this on my face so I can&#x27;t say anything regarding that, but I have tried their lotion without the SA (salicylic acid) on my face and it works really well. All of this brand&#x27;s products have time release ceramides and sll sorts of other good stuff you would find in something much more expensive. I still prefer my other lotion for my face but the value for the quality of CeraVe can&#x27;t be beat! The cleanser is a great product too. It&#x27;s a moisturizing sort of cleanser (so you won&#x27;t like it if you want foamy)  that takes makeup off well too.</li>
            <li> I got this to see if it would be better than the other leading brand of a similar product and it was. It isn&#x27;t greasy or heavy feeling like the other. It does exactly what it says it will. Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li> i have Keratosis Pilaris, hereditary, no cure and annoying. Its on my upper arms and this works to rid me of it! its not a cure all, but it sure helps more than anything else I have tried. I HAVE TRIED SOO MANY PRODUCTS! i have spent way to much trying to manage and get rid of KP.&lt;br /&gt;I know my diet and staying hydrated helps but this also does its job too. I am an exfoliator addict, and then using this cream helps.&lt;br /&gt;no weird smell, no burning like glytone and absorbs quickly. *** you need to make sure you get the Cerave SA not the regular Cerave. The SA is key to smoother skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  It&#x27;s keeps my skin incredibly soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its really good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Did not feel or react like the real product.</li>
            <li> This lotion will reduce your skin bumps in two days and nearly eliminate them in one week. This formula penetrates the skin and actually locks in moisture. Your skin will feel hydrated all day long. Best purchase, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion was doctor recommended to address my extremely dry &amp; sometimes scaley skin. Not only does it hydrate, the additivies help to exfoliate the rough skin. I am seeing great improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high expectations since I have really bumpy rough skin on my upper arms. I have used it everyday for over a month now and there&#x27;s been a slight improvement in the skin texture but not the appearance. My skin has become slightly smoother but the bumps are still there. And also, I find the smell unpleasant but luckily the smell doesn&#x27;t linger around too long after you apply it. Expected more from this product based on the reviews. Not sure if it&#x27;s worth the price!</li>
            <li> I am an RN having to wash my hands countless times in a work day so my skin gets rough and dry and &amp;#34;kinda prickly&amp;#34; as rough skin around my fingernails hangs on linens and gowns and gauze, etc.  Now my hands are MUCH improved since Day One of use!</li>
            <li> This is the best product for money; amazing change in my skin, smoother texture, less fine lines &amp; skin tone is evening out.  FYI  I use 30 sunscreen daily rain or shine.</li>
            <li> I had a ugly, dry, scaly scar from surgery.  My dermatologist recommended this lotion and it works.&lt;br /&gt;The car looks and feels must better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this lotion for getting rid of the red bumps on my arms. I used Amlactin for several months with minimal results. After a couple of weeks of using this lotion my bumps are pretty much gone!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product to me for the bumps on the back of my arms. This is known as keratosis pilaris (KP) and it can&#x27;t be cured. It either fades with treatment or age. Since I don&#x27;t want to wait until I&#x27;m 35 to see these unsightly bumps go away, I opted for cera ve sa lotion. I have been using it for about a month and the bumps are smoother and the redness isn&#x27;t as bad. My doctor said it could take about 2 months to see any significant results. After that we will look into more expensive options.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion I have bought that actually does what the front of the bottle says it will do. After the 1st. application I was in heaven...my skin was luxuriously soft and smooth. I will never be without CeraVe renewing skin lotion. Please make in larger bottles, my husband discovered my cream and has been using it daily for his hands. He said &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t believe we haven&#x27;t seen a commercial on this product.&amp;#34; Maybe they put all the money towards having an excellent product. I have also purchased the facial cleanser (awesome) and will continue purchasing all CeraVe products.</li>
            <li> Great lotion.  Recommended by the doctor for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this item for myself, after being diagnosed with keratosis pilaris by my dermatologist. It wasn&#x27;t so bad that I needed to get it treated, after all, I&#x27;ve been living with it for all my life. However after asking my dermatologist about it, she recommended that I try the [[ASIN:B003UF0RB4 Cetaphil Restoraderm, Skin Restoring Body Wash, Formulated For Eczema, 10 Ounce]] in conjunction with this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using both, over months, my skin cleared up and became less bumpy. However, using both items daily just for a mild condition that I didn&#x27;t think was serious became somewhat expensive. So I stopped using them both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my personal opinion, I think the lotion did more for clearing up my bumpy skin than that of the body wash.  The lotion does have some salicylic acid in it, which I&#x27;ve normally seen in products for clearing up acne.  Cosmetically &amp; medicinally, salicylic acid acts as a keratolytic, comedolytic, and bacteriostatic agent, causing the cells of the epidermis to shed more readily, opening clogged pores and neutralizing bacteria within, preventing pores from clogging up again by constricting pore diameter, and allowing room for new cell growth.  With those properties plus Cerave&#x27;s moisturizing properties, it allowed my skin to clear up very fast and better than any other product I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite hating lotion (because I&#x27;ve never seen any results), I will admit that this lotion by Cerave actually did something for me.  I just wish it were a little cheaper, because an 8 ounce bottle only lasts me a month.</li>
            <li> My daughter has had keratosis pilaris since she was a little girl.  We&#x27;ve gone to different dermatologists and all they give here are expensive steroid-based creams that did not do squat on her skin.  She has it bad on her arms and her cheeks.  After a few days of using this, I have already seen a significant difference, particularly on her cheeks.  The bumps were not as big and her skin is finally becoming smoother every day.  Her arms still have the bumps, but it&#x27;s not as rough either.  None of the prescription products we&#x27;ve used has given results as this product.</li>
            <li> My doctors daughter recommended this lotion. It keeps working 3 days into the application and leaves your skin really nice. I work allot with my hands as an artist, and find I am washing brushes allot. I use this lotion daily and have never found anything better. My husband loves it for his feet, as do I., I use it on my face before makeup and find it aids the smooth application of addition makeup.This is a must have for our family.</li>
            <li> great just what i wanted it really helps with the dry skin that i have thank you for responding so quickly</li>
            <li> better than aveeno for kids with very dry skin, but aquaphore is still the best</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my forearms where I had some brown spots and some weird red dry bumps. The brown spots are disappearing and the bumps I think are too.  I also use on my neck and my chin where I have a few little white bumps.</li>
            <li> My son was diagnosed with  keratosis pilaris which caused rough, tiny bumps on the outer sides of his arm.  I took him to a dermatologist and the doctor recommended this lotion in addition to two others (and gave us free samples).  We tried all three, but Cerave was the most effective.  In less than a few days, there was a significant difference in his arms.  After a week, there were no bumps or roughness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is fabulous. It has no smell, absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky and leaves no residue.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it for myself.  I am completely satisfied with the results.  My skin feels incredibly soft, smooth and silky after applying Cerave SA.  I now purchase this lotion for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came in a bigger bottle and was a not quite so expensive (still well worth the cost, you get what you pay for)</li>
            <li> This is the best lotion I have tried and used in as long as I can remember.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this.  My skin feels great and a little bit goes a long way.  It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than the name brands, and it seems to work just as well.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  Not a heavy cream,  yet moisturizes like one.  Bans &amp;#34;ashy&amp;#34; sin in winter for all day relief.  One star off because it has to be re applied every single time you wash your hands, which sucks of you wash often.  Also somewhat expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with my hands for 10 years and have built up a lot of scar tissue on the palms.  This stuff works great to heal the hands but it also appears to be thinning out and normalizing the skin.</li>
            <li> very dissapointed about it, i didnt saw any change on my skin by the was more bumble :/</li>
            <li> I have keratosis pilaris on my arms, so I was looking for something to rid the annoying bumps that  are an annoyance. I try to put this on right after I get out of the shower, but have not been 100% effective at doing that, so I&#x27;m sure the results are not the best they could be. However, I have noticed a significant change in the texture and appearance of my arms. This lotion is creamy, absorbs well, and does not have any strong odor. The packaging is also very nice. Overall, I really love this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> After only using for two days my arms and legs have not been so soft and smooth since I have been a teenager.</li>
            <li> its a bit sticky but otherwise alright</li>
            <li> Great stuff soft skin.</li>
            <li> Only thing OTC that will work for my ichthyosis. This stuff is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION! IT ISN&#x27;T GREASY AND IT IS THE FIRST LOTION THAT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN. I HAVE A VERY SERIOUS DISEASE THAT MAKES MY SKIN REALLY DRY AND THIS IS REALLY HELPING.</li>
            <li> This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist.  I have extremely dry skin with bumps and scales and this lotion just cured it.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer lotion for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wotks well on my hands, feet, knees and elbows</li>
            <li> This is one of my go to lotions.  I try to wear this one at night so that the acids can work while I&#x27;m sleeping.  Stuff is a little pricey but it is good.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist recommended this product for our daughter she has dry bumpy acne \\&quot;keratosis pilaris\\&quot; on the back of her arms. This lotion is the ONLY ONE to clear up her skin!!! We live in hot, dry low desert area, and this lotion is very moisturizing. It has a great smell, doesn&#x27;t interfere with perfume, not stickly or oily. Really soaks in and leaves her skin silky smooth. I started to use it too. I have really noticed difference all over...no bumps after shaving legs anymore. Excellent product. Only issue is it is not available in any store or drugstore in my town of Henderson, Nevada. I can only purchase online. I have asked my locale Target to carry it, so who knows. It is pricey, but oh, so worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to help with my bumpy \\&quot;chicken skin\\&quot; on my upper arms for years...and finally found something that works!  It didn&#x27;t just moisturize (although it did a great job at that too...); my arms were smoother within a couple of days.  There was no fragrance, and my skin stayed moisturized all day long without feeling greasy or sticking to my clothes.  I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> This cleared my body acne from working out, amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered with super dry skin for decades.  The exception, my face.  Its not dry and I don&#x27;t use this product there.  Body only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of my dryness is just me, some derives from oooold Grenz Ray radiologic treatment for ultra severe eczema.  The type so severe your skin splits bleeds and makes parts of your body untouchable unusable, a nightmare to behold.  That level of eczema struck my hands.  I could not open or close my palm or fingers without the skin tearing open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GR treatment worked far better than the best steroids (decade of them too) but leaves skin aged, darkened and so dry I have no words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pay anything for creams and lotions.  Have used all the natural oils and fruits chemicals out there.  Have had bargain basement lanolin, glycerine, wax, petroleum, pure shark oil, cocoa butter to $500 sheik store gator oil, emu, copper, meadow foam, sea biologicals, niacin complexes in stunning jars to custom doctor urea lactic acid concoctions, you name it.  Nothing has worked fully for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of a sudden my family doctor consults his own dermatologist and says something like a product called chervey or something contains Salicylic Acid and works for people like me.  Not only are my paws in agony because its winter now but I&#x27;m talking in recent years I&#x27;ve developed Elephant-ringed-hide looking ankles (though I hear that animal is not at all as rough as he appears, I am however).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say Aspirin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure enough I find what he meant and its Cerave (there is a different company with a shhh sound that does make a SA Steroid prescription product so not them).  I picked the Cerave formula with the least amount of stuff I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;urea&lt;br /&gt;lanolin&lt;br /&gt;silicones&lt;br /&gt;fruit acids&lt;br /&gt;coconut&lt;br /&gt;olive&lt;br /&gt;wheat&lt;br /&gt;soy&lt;br /&gt;Coal Tar&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed Oil&lt;br /&gt;Geraniol&lt;br /&gt;Citrus Acid&lt;br /&gt;Caprylic/Capric Acids&lt;br /&gt;petroleum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its this SA (3%, I believe) lotion that doesn&#x27;t have those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a hint of a lotion smell unless you put your nose right on it.&lt;br /&gt;Not a hint of shiny on your legs when it dries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went at it with more gusto than I ever have with a skin product, I decided to Dry Loofah my worst, those ankles!  Did not draw blood but made myself a tad uncomfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed and rinsed still with that loofah and THEN applied the Cerve WITH yes the loofah, now soft and wet, so no discomfort at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NEXT MORNING I HAD NEW SKIN that is lovely.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  I do see one reviewer with her own website describing the feeling as being WAXED.  That should be the ceramides doing their thing but I wouldn&#x27;t quite say waxy feeling.  To me that sounds like something I&#x27;d want to wash off.  I&#x27;m sticking with non greasy, plain young and smooth both to the touch and to the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe it because typically diatribes like this sound like a 2AM bogus infomercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m telling you the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one paid me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get a free sample from somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day after day of use, my skin is better and lovelier and I&#x27;m sticking my legs out at people.  No I&#x27;m not doing the whole loofah routine, just plopping it on and rubbing it in.  I might redo the loofah shenanigans every couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now why I took it down a star-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few THINGS I DON&#x27;T LIKE and here is what they are:&lt;br /&gt;*  I don&#x27;t want any Lactic Acid, stings a bit, but did stop in 3 days&lt;br /&gt;*  I don&#x27;t want any PARABENS, this is full of them&lt;br /&gt;*  The vit D in it is D3 derived from sheep&#x27;s wool.  I am leery.&lt;br /&gt;*  Contains dimethicone&lt;br /&gt;*  I don&#x27;t like how the lotion comes off easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What that means is use a glove if you have to wash food or the lotion will be all over your food or wash your food then apply the lotion!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use vinyl gloves to handle all foods anyway.  Part of my ritual to keep anything that canirritate my hands off my hands and that includes the frequent soap you have to use if you handle food with your bare hands.  The more soap the more skin pain I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And with that it DOES NOT WORK ON MY HANDS.  Yep said all that and then it fails the very part of my body in the most agony.  Alas not the part that was looking the worst.  You can&#x27;t tell my hands feel pulled and my cuticles aren&#x27;t comfortable.  Only I know that and this lotion isn&#x27;t a bit of help with this circumstance.  My palms are where the lotion is waxy feeling.  Makes me rinse it right off and like I said that it does readily.  My search for the Five Star continues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my review.  I sure hope this stuff works on me for a very long time, I am tired of searching and broke from the process.irritate my hands off my hands and that includes the frequent soap you have to use if you handle food with your bare hands.

            <li> Exactly as described!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my son&#x27;s body eczema, and I&#x27;m not sure whether this is better than the regular Cerave Lotion. I&#x27;m almost finished with the bottle and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping the eczema any more than the regular Cerave Lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything to get rid of my dry, red, arm bumps. My Dermatologist recommended Cerave SA and WOW. What a difference. It goes on like a nice creamy lotion, doesn&#x27;t smell like Amlactin, and really works. My skin isn&#x27;t 100% clear of bumps but I&#x27;m not a good regular lotion applicator. I use it 3-6 times a week and really love the results. Even the redness has calmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend trying this lotion!!</li>
            <li> This is a product for people with rough skin. My DERM recommended this lotion and I tried it and it works great. I use it right after a hot shower and I towel dry but I leave my skin a little moist. Please try this product it works for about 15 hours on keeping the skin moist.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this product. He first gave me a sample for my very dry skin. It worked great, but I have trouble finding the exact one at the store (Sa), and its pricey. But being a Amazon prime member, its shipped free and I get it in two days and save myself a couple dollars to boot...</li>
            <li> this product showed up open and spilled inside of the box. Unusable.</li>
            <li> I have used jergens and vaseline intense and all that other crap. they are expensive when compared to other name brand moisturizers. this little 8oz bottle of cerave is worth its weight in gold. once winter arrives the skin on my legs get so dry I can&#x27;t fall asleep because i&#x27;m so busy scratching them. irritating little hair and acne bumps sometimes develop too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I saw and felt clear and amazing results in a little less than 1 week with everyday use. will never use anything BUT creave products from now on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Cerave SA for about 3 weeks now, and have noticed a huge difference. Since i&#x27;ve been using it as a facial moisturizer, I&#x27;ve noticed my pores are less noticeable, and my skin looks better overall. Skin looks healthy and smooth. Love!</li>
            <li> I saw this product advertised in a magazine and could not find it in my local drug stores so I ordered it online.  A little expensive but if you have skin \\&quot;bumps\\&quot;, as I do on the back of my arms, it is worth it.  A little of the product goes a long way and I only use it for the bumps, not for moisturizing my whole body.  It does work, although not as well as Avon&#x27;s Skin Bump Minimizer, which unfortunately is no longer available.</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist, first time ever, because of my rough, bumpy, dry skin on my arms. I&#x27;ve had this condition for years! but recently it seemed to have gotten worse. My dermatologist suggested I try CeraVe SA Renewing Skin lotion. He even gave me samples. I was skeptical but I&#x27;m now a believer! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 weeks and my skin is noticeably smoother, softer, and barely any bumps at all and it feels and looks great! I highly recommend. If it can help me, it can help anyone! Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Having tried a lot of hand creams, I figured this was just one more I&#x27;d try and toss out.  Turns out this is the real deal - non-greasy, easily absorbed, and it works.  It now takes the place of all those others I tried that didn&#x27;t help my dry hands or made my hands so greasy I couldn&#x27;t pick up anything after application.  If you have dry, aging skin on you hands or heels (worked on my rough heels, too), forget the other stuff and buy this.</li>
            <li> Excellent lotion. One of my most favorite body lotions and I&#x27;ve tried tons. I scrub regularly with a plain washcloth and clean-rinsing bar soap and follow up with thise lotion and my skin couldn&#x27;t be smoother. Not quite moisturizing enough for the really bad winters. But the ret of the year it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Great body lotion for very dry sensitive skin! The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because it only comes in an 8 oz bottle! CeraVe please answer our prayers and make this in a bigger bottle (12oz would be ideal like your Hydrating Cleanser) because now I use it on my body and as an every day facial moisturizer because it is that amazing. I started off using [[ASIN:B000YJ2SKM CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, 12 Ounce]] with this Moisturizing Cream but found the cream was not ideal for my extra dry skin. Keep in mind my face is the type that has to use regular made for body lotion on it and not facial moisturizers. Facial moisturizers always end up being a waste of time and money for me as they are never enough moisture. This moisturizing cream would be perfect for someone with somewhat dry normal skin. I had already been using their [[ASIN:B0071XPQQ2 Cerave Sa Renewing Skin Lotion, 8 Ounce]] on my body and decided to give it a try on my face. Glad I did. I saw noticeable results right away. Patches on my face that had been flakey were gone. Even a small blemish on my chin seemed to not be as red and noticeable. I was also glad to see that unlike the moisturizing cream this also absorbs better into the skin to allow me to wear it under liquid foundation! All and all it&#x27;s a god sent. Now we just need to get CeraVe to make it in a larger bottle for us.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my sea wart problem on my heels.  That is what I purchased it for.  It does feel good when rubbed in.</li>
            <li> by my daughter&#x27;s pediatrician for skin that has extra keratin (little red bumps). Thanks for having it available and so quickly</li>
            <li> The cream is better than the lottion.  I will not be buying this product again, it takes longer to work.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old has keratosis pilaris and while he has the typical arm bumps, the major issue for him has been bumps on his cheeks/chin. We tried this Cerave lotion before looking into the more expensive types and we&#x27;ve been very pleased! It has definitely reduced his bumps. It did take a good month or so of daily application to see a consistent difference so I recommend sticking with it if you don&#x27;t see immediate results.</li>
            <li> I like the Cerave products but this lotion is somewhat heavy for what I am trying to achieve. I use it on stubborn areas of dryness.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommends this for psoriasis. The salicylic acid softens the skin to enhance absorption of topical steroid crfeams. It makes my skin sort in general! Wish it weren&#x27;t so expensive, though it lasts a while. I save it for affected areas.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I was having some break puts on my chest as well as dry skin at the same time.  I tried moisturizing with other products, and I would find temporary relief.  Using body clearing washes didn&#x27;t help, and would inevitably make my skin dry (which was starting to give me that old lady wrinkled chest way way way before my time).  I thought I&#x27;d try this lotion thinking the salicylic acid might help solve both of my skin issues.  It took a couple weeks, but everything cleared up, my skin is super soft, not irritated, and looking very happy.  I also had a patch of very dry, cracking skin on one if my elbows, which created up in a few days using this product. I will buy this lotion again and again, it&#x27;s worth every penny.  I also use the eye cream and moisturizers on my face, which are excellent and rival products that cost several times what they do.  Cerave is recommended by dermatologists, and it&#x27;s easy to see why.</li>
            <li> Great---I use mainly on lower arms &amp; back of hands, but love using on my face---which my dermatologist said wd be good.</li>
            <li> helps get rid of dry skin on arms and the little bumpy spots on arms too over time</li>
            <li> Suggested by our physician.  Read the reviews and they were mixed.  Love it.  Works like a charm to keep my skin clear.  I typically notice severe drying with when using anything with salicylic acid, not with this lotion.  No dryness noticed to-date.  Will be a staple in my house.</li>
            <li> One of the best hand lotions I have ever used. Really made my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that you have to use it every 2-3 days in order to keep the effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then again, I rated this 5 star precicely because no other commercial lotions in the market can perform as well as this one (in my experience). With most other lotions, you&#x27;d probably have to apply the lotion every day just to get close to the effect that this lotion provides.</li>
            <li> As recommended by my dermatologist, this is a GREAT moisturizer, especially for the feet and elbows or anywhere with rough skin. It has the SA (Salicylic Acid) which helps penetrate the hard, dry areas. I use the Cerave WITHOUT the SA for hands, arms, face, etc.</li>
            <li> For once, a product that really works.....after the initial application to the red bumps on the back of my upper arms, they were already disappearing and after the first few days, bumps were gone!!</li>
            <li> I have suffered with KP (Keratosis Pilaris/Chicken Skin) all my life.  And with it I have super-sensitive skin that can&#x27;t tolerate the average body wash and soap without severe itching.  I usually use DermaDoctor&#x27;s KP Duty, which works for my skin, however, it&#x27;s expensive.  In looking for a more affordable alternative I found CeraVe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it once daily, sometime twice if I remember to put it on before bed.  The only thing I feel like CeraVe has solved is the itchy, ashy dryness that also plagued me.  The KP is still present, just not as noticeable as redness has gone down.  But I had really hoped this product would completely rid me of KP all together with regular use, as KP Duty did.  Considering that it pretty much solved my other issue of severe dryness, I will continue to use this up as I don&#x27;t feel I wasted my money.  But if other reviewers are looking for relief from KP I would definitely recommend DermaDoctor&#x27;s KP Duty over this despite the expense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CeraVe seems more formulated for rosacea, dry skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> I bought it for stucco keratoses, but I can&#x27;t tell that it got rid of them, but it is a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product because of my dry skin. It is very soothing, and I plan to buy another one as soon as I finished this, my first, bottle. I&#x27;ll certainly let my dermatologist know how much I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited awhile to review this because I wanted to see how my skin would adjust.  I&#x27;ve been using the cerave sa cleanser from this line that seems a bit harsh and really dried my skin out.  After using this following the cleanser,  it did sting for a few minutes,  but then it was fine. I was trying this for my very sensitive,  very dry acne prone skin.  I&#x27;m 30 and after having 3 kids my skin has decided it hates me.  I went from somewhat oily skin with occasional breakouts to very dry flaky skin with constant breakouts along my jawline, my hair line, my chin and even my shoulders, chest and back. On my shoulders and chest it&#x27;s accompanied by little bumps that kind of resemble chicken skin. I&#x27;ve been trying everything to clear it up,  but acne treatments are usually over drying and make it worse whIle moisturizers strong enough to help the dryness clog pores and make the break outs worse. I thought I found a magic bullet with this combo, but unfortunately the lotion is just too thick for my face and made the breakouts worse on my chin and cheeks. It did,  however, clear it up completely on my neck,  chest, back and shoulders, including the little bumps.  I will continue to use it for that,  but will keep searching for the right products for my face.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Cerave Products - I used the cream, normal lotion, and face lotion - for my dry, eczema prone, sensitive skin. This is the first time I have tried the &amp;#34;skin renewing&amp;#34; lotion, and let me just say  WOW! Now, to be fair, I purchased this lotion, applied for several days (as I would with the normal lotion) and after going back and reading some reviews about skin smoothing/bumps disappearing I checked out my arms (have always had little bumps ever since I can remember) - and THE BUMPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GONE! I was so amazed I had to write a review - please note the bumps are not 100% gone, but I would say at least 50% and I&#x27;ll try and update in a few weeks if there is more improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - this has all the perks of the normal lotion with the additional benefits of skin smoothing (also going to try this on my face)</li>
            <li> tried everything for those nasty little red upper arm pollka dots.  this works great and unlike all the others i have tried doesn&#x27;t smell like cat pee or isn&#x27;t outrageously expensive</li>
            <li> Excellent for extra dry bumpy skin recommend for my child by our dermatologist in combination  with  aqualant. Cleared up his dry bumpy skin in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell a difference yet</li>
            <li> Nothing else I&#x27;ve tried cleared up the rash on my face.After using this and their hydrating cleanser for one week the difference I see in my skin in phenomenal.I highly recommend this product for anyone suffering with rosacea or a butterfly rash on the face.I will continue to use it to maintain the benefits of it.</li>
            <li> I liked this enough to post this to my friends and family on facebook:  A patient told me a few months ago about a great lotion her dermatologist had recommended, and I finally tried it last night. I am in awe. After literally 20 years of trying different lotions, vaseline with socks on my hands at night, steroid creams and ointments, this is the ONLY thing that has ever made a significant difference on my hands and feet. Literally after one night of use I can tell a dramatic difference with less roughness, peeling, cracking. I have no financial interest in this product, but simply wanted to share the info to anyone who experiences significant dry skin, eczema, cracking hands in the winter, etc. I sound like an infomercial, but this is just an amazing result from one use. FYI I used the CeraVe SA for the roughest areas - has salicylic acid in it that helps with the roughness but some people might be sensitive to that (although I have sensitive skin, and had no issues). Just sharing the love! I&#x27;m so ready for sandals now!</li>
            <li> Light but very good moisturizer. My dermatologist recommended it to smooth skin, which it does within reason.  Great product for sensitive skin and is very light for the moisturizing it delivers. I have used for 2-3 months.  It&#x27;s a little expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and sometimes breakout if my face is too dry. This lotion is great, I use it every night and I love the hydration benefits. Will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I used dermadoctor to get ride of all of the bumps on the back of my legs. This product does a MUCH better job and is A LOT CHEAPER. My legs have never been this smooth. I think any one who want their legs or bum would just stupid to use any other product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 months and I can finally say that it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I take my daily shower, I use a polyester bath mitt to exfoliate. Afterwards, I use this on the body parts that have KP. I use regular Cerave for the rest of my body, which saves money and is all the rest of me needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time in my life, the bumps are gone! The daily mitt scrub and plain body lotion did nothing. This works - if you are consistent and give it time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I have KP that seems to have steadily increased the past year or two and so went off in search of a inexpensive (cheaper than RX) fix.  I read about and tried this specific product, this is the CeraVe with the SA  lotion not cream as well as Amlactin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amlactin cleared up m KP (small bumps white or red under skin often referred to as chicken skin) significantly within two to three days of using twice a day. However, it came back when discontinued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CeraVe SA did not cause any noticeable reduction in my KP at all; however, it significantly moisturized my skin. While I don&#x27;t consider either to be a heavy moisturizer be ause I have such dry shin- I&#x27;m sure most people with normal skin would consider these heavy.  A little of the CerVe goes a long way. If you use too much you can end up with that wet feeling.  CeraVe will continue to moisturize and you do not have to reapply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing Amlactin for KP and will be trying the CeraVe cream (non SA)  as a moisturizer next. So obviously despite the lack of help for my KP I would still recommend Cerave and plan to stay with the line.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my doctor and I find that it is just wonderful. Have used Aveeno for years but this is better. Have told friends about it.</li>
            <li> Nothing great but an okay product. I wouldn&#x27;t go out of my way to find this but if I came across it I probably would buy it again</li>
            <li> This one is for whole body, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that great , there are a lot better creams for body.</li>
            <li> Bought it a few weeks ago to help with keratosis piliras.. I put it on morning, afternoon and night and still have not seen a difference. I do like that it does not have a smell to it, much better than those urea creams I was trying before..</li>
            <li> For once a product that claims to be a moisturizer really performs as the product claims.  Great product, very happy with the results.  This product even works on dry feet.</li>
            <li> everything as expected.</li>
            <li> I was eyeing this product for a few weeks and finally took the plunge and it was worth it. My skin was red and itching around the sides of my nose and my chin with rosacea but even after just one application at it improved a lot. Very happy with this stuff might have to cancel the Dermo&#x27;s appt!</li>
            <li> i have always had dry skin and NOTHING has helped my skin more than this product. for the first time in my adult life where i did not have issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> I truly love the CeraVe product----PROBLEM----the pump does not release and work so I have to pour it out.  I looked on the CeraVe website to ask for a new pump but the site was unavailable.  Can you touch base with CeraVe and ask for a new pump for the 8oz bottle be sent to me??  Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;Helen Alexander&lt;br /&gt;shophere@comcast.net</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my dermatologist to treat my dry skin and keratosis. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the effects last at least a day for me without having to reapply. The cost of this product in my local drugstore was $17.99, but it was $10.97 here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both have eczema.  I will rarely get a dry patch, but my husband suffers with it much more.  He is very picky about the lotion he uses, especially on his hands (too greasy, smells weird, etc.).  However, this one is a success.  I tried it myself the last two days and it feels like it is going on greasy, but disappears.  There is no fragrance that I can detect and my hands are very soft and stay so for a long time.  My husband has said that the little bumps he usually gets on his hands from the eczema are gone.  I first learned about CeraVe from my dermatologist who suggested I use their AM/PM facial lotions after suffering with acne and dryness.  They are amazing products and have done wonders for both my husband and I.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It compares very favorable to other similar products I have used.  The fragrance is not offensive or very noticeable which is a plus for me.  It spreads evenly on the skin and is not sticky.</li>
            <li> This lotion works great I have ordered this from amazon every month. It helps with itchy skin and it&#x27;s not greasy at all. LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> This helps my KP better than anything I&#x27;ve tried. I just wish it smelled a little better, but I just wear a little perfume to cover it up. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers or anything. I do have to use it every single day though. Otherwise my bumps come back!</li>
            <li> Goes on soft and silky. Works well under makeup - you&#x27;ll still need SPF. I usually use it at night. Also use it on my elbows, knees and feet and it makes them nice and soft.</li>
