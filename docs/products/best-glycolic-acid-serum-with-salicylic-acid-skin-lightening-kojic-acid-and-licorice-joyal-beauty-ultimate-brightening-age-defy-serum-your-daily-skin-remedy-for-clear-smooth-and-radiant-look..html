            <li>I very much enjoyed this.  </li>
            <li>Although I was offered to try this free, the opinions and experiences are all my own.</li>

            <li>amogst other of Joyals products,  I take great care in keeping my skin looking and feeling young &amp; more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Wow, &amp;  this stuff is absolutely amazing!!</li>
            <li>thing I really like about Joyal Beauty is that they proudly tell us exactly what is in their products, without using made-up science-y sounding names to make us believe their product has a magical ingredient that no one else has.</li>
            <li>I love how light and smooth</li>
            <li>This serum has a gel like consistency that is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Before I started using, I want to comment on the easy to dispense pump.  </li>
            <li>It’s affordable (under $25.00 for 1 oz) and best of all,  in just short period of time, Joyal Beauty really improved how my skin tone to be more even and brianic honey,royal jelly,propolis)</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in wrinkles or fine lines, but that&#x27;s not what I expect from exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She wears less makeup and looks wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have been posting selfies on my social media accounts and have been getting complimented on my skin and how great I look.  </li>
            <li>amber bottle protects the contents from light.</li>
            <li>Another fantastic product from this line.</li>
            <li>This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of beneficial ingredients thoughtfully incorporated into this serum.  </li>
            <li>It is light, a bit lemonly and floral.  </li>
            <li>serum goes on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>important label claim to look for with cosmetics is paraben, sulfate, and phthalate free.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after applying this.</li>
            <li>because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>I love that it is so healthy and natural.</li>
            <li>It feels cool on the face.</li>
            <li>There are many products on the market that are very aggressive, but with this serum you can get the results, but in a slower calmer manner.</li>
            <li>It’s refreshing to know company who develop and sells product is ready to help you.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it has not caused any irritation at all, not even a mild tingle when I use it.</li>

            <li>Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>My skin has never been more clear, smooth, or youthful.  </li>
            <li>The pump cap easily dispenses a large drop.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful, however when it arrived the top was loose and half of the contents had leaked out.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to apply to any areas with fine wrinkles or damage, such as around the eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>This skin serum is milky and viscous, with a fresh herbal fragrance dominated by witch hazel.</li>
            <li>no animal testing on there products as I&#x27;m an animal rights activist plus all the natural goodies in the bottle for healthy age defying skin...</li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel fresh.</li>
            <li>It makes your face definitely more fresh and clear.  </li>
            <li>They give your skin a healthy young glow.  </li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Adding some type of Hylauronic acid serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would help fade these marks, and it really truly has!</li>
            <li>Kojic acid is what caught my attention first:  </li>
            <li>serum also contains my favorite facial product:  Witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li>So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  </li>
            <li>So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that.</li>
            <li>But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little while now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work well on a damp face, so make sure your skin is dry before you apply.</li>

            <li>I really don&#x27;t think this product did anything for my skin, maybe another bottle or two but no change in one bottle...</li>
            <li>I think it really has helped with my acne too.</li>
            <li>really well.</li>
            <li>My face is much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>I know it might sound contradictory, but the aroma is soothing and energizing at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What I really appreciate about this brightener is that it works gently.</li>
            <li>The product really helps with skin.</li>
            <li>I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  </li>
            <li>Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  </li>
            <li>They are very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.  </li>

            <li>I find this much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>(my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>One other thing I love that they use pumps instead of droppers.</li>
            <li>use this product daily underneath my makeup and a moisturizer and it has not disappointed me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Using this for several weeks now, I can see that the areas are blending in better with my regular skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>
            <li>Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  </li>
            <li>a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer with sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I keep to a strict skincare routine everyday, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks &amp; feels more smoother, tighter, &amp; glowingy</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary bottle of ULTIMATE BRIGHTENING AGE</li>
            <li>I have seen is clearer, brighter skin, with no dull areas at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think this stuff is a miracle and could be great for any common skin problems!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and suffer from eczema, and the ingredients in this didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product really helps in drying up my acne and it also helps to gradually clear up the spot acne left on my face.</li>
            <li>To pamper sensitive or damaged skin, keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling effect when applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I naturally have oily skin.</li>
            <li>suits the sensitive skin too.</li>
            <li>have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  </li>
            <li>Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li>It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li>Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action.</li>
            <li>It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li>It has a gentleness for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As a mother of three who never cared too much about my skin care in my younger years, this means a lot.  </li>
            <li>Nothing is better than natural products without dyes, harsh perfumes &amp; alcohol on your skin!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems in the past using fruit acid exfoliators, as many of them, even in somewhat low concentrations, can irritate or outright</li>
            <li>I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  </li>
            <li>My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  </li>
            <li>These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li>Rather, i think it is diminishing the amount of oil my face generally produces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old and suffer from acne scars and hyperpigmentation from my teenage years.</li>
            <li>And while it is clearing my scars, apparently it is also preventing acne and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>However, It only has been three days since i started using the leave-on exfoliator, and might i say that it is so far working</li>
            <li>The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li>The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  </li>

            <li> because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types.</li>

            <li> I bought this hoping it would help fade these marks, and it really truly has!</li>
            <li> Kojic acid is what caught my attention first:  </li>
            <li> serum also contains my favorite facial product:  Witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> , Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals.</li>
            <li> So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  </li>
            <li> So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that.</li>
            <li> But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little while now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work well on a damp face, so make sure your skin is dry before you apply.</li>

            <li> really well.</li>
            <li> My face is much smoother and softer.</li>

            <li> One other thing I love that they use pumps instead of droppers.</li>
            <li> use this product daily underneath my makeup and a moisturizer and it has not disappointed me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> particular serum has Vitamin E and C -</li>

            <li> I keep to a strict skincare routine everyday, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks &amp; feels more smoother, tighter, &amp; glowingy</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary bottle of ULTIMATE BRIGHTENING AGE</li>
            <li> I have seen is clearer, brighter skin, with no dull areas at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this stuff is a miracle and could be great for any common skin problems!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and suffer from eczema, and the ingredients in this didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product really helps in drying up my acne and it also helps to gradually clear up the spot acne left on my face.</li>
            <li> To pamper sensitive or damaged skin, keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling effect when applied.&lt;br</li>

            <li> It’s gentle enough to use it around eye</li>
            <li> It has a gentleness for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As a mother of three who never cared too much about my skin care in my younger years, this means a lot.  </li>
            <li> Nothing is better than natural products without dyes, harsh perfumes &amp; alcohol on your skin!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past using fruit acid exfoliators, as many of them, even in somewhat low concentrations, can irritate or outright</li>
            <li> I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  </li>
            <li> My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  </li>
            <li> These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge</li>
            <li> Rather, i think it is diminishing the amount of oil my face generally produces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and suffer from acne scars and hyperpigmentation from my teenage years.</li>
            <li> And while it is clearing my scars, apparently it is also preventing acne and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> However, It only has been three days since i started using the leave-on exfoliator, and might i say that it is so far working</li>
            <li> The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li> The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that I managed to get about 3 weeks from my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to tell about my dark spots or acne.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I had too high of expectations or just not enough issues to fix.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty bad but with this stuff , it seems to make it a little better.</li>
            <li> I am now using the serum on my few old spots in hopes of them fading as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So the first one we received had a broken pump</li>
            <li> I use just one pump each time, and I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle.</li>
            <li> My cheeks used to have dark pink dots all over, and now there are only like 2 noticable dots, and the rest are very faint, so no one can really see unless they&#x27;re really up close.</li>
            <li> I will give it a break for a little while and try it again later once all the pimples are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every component is spelled out in clear, common terms.</li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my face and while my face is still wet.</li>
            <li> Because of this problem, I have to be careful what I am putting on my face.  </li>
            <li> I can not really tell if it&#x27;s doing anything to my skin yet but feels good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And as with all the Joyal products I&#x27;ve tried, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This means I won&#x27;t be left with the usual hyper-pigmented spots.</li>
            <li> unlike other serums where I have to contend with an odd medicine dropper, this serum uses a pump to dispense the product.  </li>
            <li> Not really exciting.</li>
            <li> I had dark spots and acne scars since January, and within three days of using this serum the spots are visibly fading and brightening up.</li>
            <li> If you are in your late twenties and above.</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on the side of my neck.  </li>
            <li> I use this serum to even tone skin and eliminate my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I typically get brown spots from my healed pimples which take time to go away.</li>
            <li> As they healed, I noticed the pigment in those areas did not darken as they typically do.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck.</li>
            <li> A little will go</li>
            <li> Since using this serum I noticed my wrinkles around eyes was disappearing little by little.  </li>
            <li> I then put a little moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> They have a few products that I didn’t know the difference and how to use it all together.  </li>
            <li> After a few applications your skin tone starts to even out.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is very uneven (Patches of discoloration) from previous breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried countless bottles of expensive creams/serums recommended by doctors, but it ended up just waste of money, effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’ve used ½ oz creams/serums that cost over $200.00 in the past and it did very little to help my skin.  </li>

            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of this product or stress...</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever wear foundation anymore ....</li>
            <li> Thank you and your staff for all your hard work.</li>
            <li> There is a complex mixture of herb and plant extracts in this serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It saves you from over using &amp; like clumsy me spilling or tipping bottle not good to see your money get soaked in your blankets or floor.</li>
            <li> Naturally, I hate it but have been afraid of using harsh bleaching products for this problem.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This skin serum is milky and viscous, with a fresh herbal fragrance dominated by witch hazel. It contains a host of mostly botanical ingredients that soothe the skin and protect it from loss of moisture, from aloe and glycerin to willow bark and hyaluronic and glycolic acids from plant sources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amber bottle protects the contents from light. The pump cap easily dispenses a large drop. A little will go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be applied after bathing or washing and allowed to be absorbed into the skin and then followed with application of a gentle moisturizer with sunscreen. Be sure to apply to any areas with fine wrinkles or damage, such as around the eyes and mouth. To pamper sensitive or damaged skin, keep it in the refrigerator for a cooling effect when applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty provided a bottle of skin serum for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Another fantastic product from this line. I typically get brown spots from my healed pimples which take time to go away. Naturally, I hate it but have been afraid of using harsh bleaching products for this problem. When I received my bottle, I started using this serum as a spot treatment on my healing pimples and discovered it helps greatly. As they healed, I noticed the pigment in those areas did not darken as they typically do. This means I won&#x27;t be left with the usual hyper-pigmented spots. I am now using the serum on my few old spots in hopes of them fading as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was sent this product in order to review by the company.</li>
            <li> This definitely seemed to brighten and even out my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I managed to get about 3 weeks from my first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t work well on a damp face, so make sure your skin is dry before you apply.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think this product did anything for my skin, maybe another bottle or two but no change in one bottle...</li>
            <li> I see no difference whether I use it or don&#x27;t. I am not sure if I had too high of expectations or just not enough issues to fix. It feels cool on the face. Smells ok. Not really exciting.</li>
            <li> I have been using Joyals Royal Jelly &amp; have this past month been using this ultra moisterizing brightning/leave on exfoliater amogst other of Joyals products,  I take great care in keeping my skin looking and feeling young &amp; more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;Wow, &amp;  this stuff is absolutely amazing!! I keep to a strict skincare routine everyday, I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks &amp; feels more smoother, tighter, &amp; glowingy/brighter. I&#x27;m going 2b 52 soon &amp; look mid 30s so I&#x27;ve been told. &amp; still trying every day to look younger &amp; no Ive had no surgeries or botox. Dont even hesitate I swear by all Joyal products but this is great stuff no animal testing on there products as I&#x27;m an animal rights activist plus all the natural goodies in the bottle for healthy age defying skin... One other thing I love that they use pumps instead of droppers. It saves you from over using &amp; like clumsy me spilling or tipping bottle not good to see your money get soaked in your blankets or floor. So if you want to.look &amp; feel younger try this I wouldn&#x27;t lie I&#x27;ve tried over the yrs every store brand &amp; infomercial skin creams.  Nothing is better than natural products without dyes, harsh perfumes &amp; alcohol on your skin!! Just a tip Dont forget your neck &amp; declate area I even use the extra left on my hands on backs of hands even my arms age shows everywhere.. Hope this review helps you if you had any hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d be happy to answer any questions ☺</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems in the past using fruit acid exfoliators, as many of them, even in somewhat low concentrations, can irritate or outright burn my skin. I&#x27;ve had no problems at all with Joyal&#x27;s Kojic Acid Leave-On Exfoliator. In fact, it has not caused any irritation at all, not even a mild tingle when I use it. I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in wrinkles or fine lines, but that&#x27;s not what I expect from exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I have seen is clearer, brighter skin, with no dull areas at all. I don&#x27;t think it clarifies quite as well as Joyal&#x27;s Vitamin C serum, which I&#x27;ve also been honored to try, but for me, the exfoliation is the key, which leads to brighter looking skin. This serum keeps my skin smooth, shining and flake-free. I&#x27;ll simply resume use of the Vitamin C serum now that I&#x27;m done testing this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really like about Joyal Beauty is that they proudly tell us exactly what is in their products, without using made-up science-y sounding names to make us believe their product has a magical ingredient that no one else has. Every component is spelled out in clear, common terms. They trust that their customers can judge for themselves. And as with all the Joyal products I&#x27;ve tried, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Sample provided for review**</li>
            <li> Does a great job brightening my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 months ago and have been using this every day once or twice a day, and the results are amazing. I use just one pump each time, and I&#x27;m only half way through the bottle. I&#x27;m 20 years old and suffer from acne scars and hyperpigmentation from my teenage years. I bought this hoping it would help fade these marks, and it really truly has! My cheeks used to have dark pink dots all over, and now there are only like 2 noticable dots, and the rest are very faint, so no one can really see unless they&#x27;re really up close. I love that it is so healthy and natural. And while it is clearing my scars, apparently it is also preventing acne and wrinkles. I think it really has helped with my acne too. I have very sensitive skin and suffer from eczema, and the ingredients in this didn&#x27;t seem to irritate my skin at all. Overall, I think this stuff is a miracle and could be great for any common skin problems! I will definitely buy this again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for 3 weeks and I see NO difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I give 5 starts to both the actual product and the seller. The item was delivered soon after my order which i was happy about. However, It only has been three days since i started using the leave-on exfoliator, and might i say that it is so far working really well. It does not leave my skin oily. Rather, i think it is diminishing the amount of oil my face generally produces. I had dark spots and acne scars since January, and within three days of using this serum the spots are visibly fading and brightening up. I love how light and smooth this serum dries on the skin. I think i might as well buy their bit c serum. This is a great investment that you will not regret. I recommend that if you have spots or acne scars use this serum.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels on my skin. I use it after I wash my face and while my face is still wet. I naturally have oily skin. So oily I have to blot my face every hour with a bounty paper towel. It&#x27;s pretty bad but with this stuff , it seems to make it a little better. My face is much smoother and softer. It&#x27;s too early to tell about my dark spots or acne.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. suits the sensitive skin too. Adding some type of Hylauronic acid serum to your skin care regimen can help to hold in some of your skin’s natural moisture, prevent or reduce drying and help keep fine line and wrinkles at bay.This product is a great value for money. If you are in your late twenties and above. Include this product in your skincare routine</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t do sure about this product when I ordered it but after I&#x27;ve used it for the past 3 weeks it has done wonders for my face I get all kinds of compliments now and I hardly ever wear foundation anymore .... love love this product will be ordering again!!!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of beneficial ingredients thoughtfully incorporated into this serum.  Kojic acid is what caught my attention first:  It is used most often to lighten skin.  I have some dark spots on the side of my neck.  Using this for several weeks now, I can see that the areas are blending in better with my regular skin color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum also contains my favorite facial product:  Witch hazel.  Witch hazel helps minimize my pores, and, while I use a witch hazel toner, I will incorporate it any which way I can in my regime.  It also contains aloe and hyaluronic acid, plus more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fragrance from the Melissa essential oil:  It is light, a bit lemonly and floral.  I know it might sound contradictory, but the aroma is soothing and energizing at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum goes on smoothly and evenly.  I apply it after I cleanse and tone my face and neck, but before I moisturize.  This serum is not sticky either, and I like that in our humid climate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Joyal Beauty.</li>
            <li> What I really appreciate about this brightener is that it works gently. There are many products on the market that are very aggressive, but with this serum you can get the results, but in a slower calmer manner. This is especially good if you have sensitive skin but want the benefits of exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product daily underneath my makeup and a moisturizer and it has not disappointed me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty provided this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> I use this serum to even tone skin and eliminate my dark spots. Since using this serum I noticed my wrinkles around eyes was disappearing little by little.  Also it keeps my skin extra moisturized.</li>
            <li> Joyal has four different serums that are all very similar. This serum has a gel like consistency that is easy to apply. It has virtually no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An important label claim to look for with cosmetics is paraben, sulfate, and phthalate free. These are common chemical classes the cosmetic industry can use without specifically calling out on an ingredient line, or they do call out the chemical and because the classes are so huge, a consumer can never figure out one of these three are in the cosmetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great news, Joyal has printed clearly on their label, they are free of these three classes of chemicals. That&#x27;s a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular serum has Vitamin E and C - both shown to be excellent for skin health. And it contains hyaluronic acid; a compound shown to improve collagen development in skin cells (makes cells fatter so wrinkles disappear). These are all wonderful things to have in a skin treatment. There is a complex mixture of herb and plant extracts in this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply this after you have exfoliated or cleaned your skin. Then apply a moisturizer. For men, that&#x27;s about all you need to do. For women, it is best to apply at night; makeup tends to flake off if use this in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found this to help a lot with razor burn; I have a lot less rash around my neck. My skin feels smooth after applying this. It works well on tender areas. My wife&#x27;s skin glows more than it ever did. She wears less makeup and looks wonderful. It has softened her skin a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel fresh. Noticed results immediately after using :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It makes your face definitely more fresh and clear.  I would recommend</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Love this product.  Will buy again.  :)  This is the Mrs. writing this review.</li>
            <li> I LOVE JOYAL BEAUTY OIL! The product really helps with skin. I notice the skin care product helps make the skin look better! Thank you and your staff for all your hard work. Thank you for delivery services and for helping me.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful, however when it arrived the top was loose and half of the contents had leaked out.  I have not been able to contact anyone to report this.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review on 3 Joyal Beauty products. (Kojic acid, royal jelly serum, hyaluronic acid 3% )  Since I am using these products together, I feel this review should be posted on all items that I am using.  So, if someone is reading my review, they know exactly what and how I am using the Joyal Beauty products together.  I also wrote another review here for other 3 items (Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum ,  Retinol Correcting Serum,  Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely sensitive skin and I can’t just pick up facial products and start using it without pre-skin test.  My skin breakout easily, but heals slowly.  Because of this problem, I have to be careful what I am putting on my face.  My skin tone is very uneven (Patches of discoloration) from previous breakouts.  I have multiple visits to Skin care clinics run by dermatologist.  I’ve tried countless bottles of expensive creams/serums recommended by doctors, but it ended up just waste of money, effort and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I want to share my experience using Joyal Beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I try new products, I stop using everything I used prior to new skin care, so I know the results that I am getting is what I am using currently.  So, 3 weeks ago, when I first start using Joyal Beauty products, I did just that. Stop all my skin care items (which it did little to help anyway, but better than not using any).  Then, I did my pre-skin test on Joyal Beauty Products. (my pre-skin test is I apply new serum/creams on my neck first and if my skin doesn’t break out, I start using it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, does Joyal Beauty help my skin as advertised?  Yes, it sure did!  I am usually put some kind of make up to cover uneven skin, even if it is just short distance to the store to pick up something.  I don’t feel comfortable going out in public without some make up on my face.  This is 3rd weeks using Joyal Beauty products.  I am amazed just short time, my skin tone improved so much.  It improved my skin tone so much in such a short period of time, I actually went out shopping without putting any makeup.  I wish I had taken pictures before I started on Joyal products.  I still have spots of discoloration, but it is fading.  These scares/bruises didn’t get there overnight, so I don’t expect it to be disappeared overnight.  But, just short 3 weeks trying this product improved my skin this much, I am very confident this products help improve my skin tone to where it should be in near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about Customer Services and their support?  Joyal Beauty Customer Service amazes me as much as their product line.  It’s refreshing to know company who develop and sells product is ready to help you.  They are very reliable.  So, if you have any questions at all, I am sure you’ll get answers from them without the delay.  They have a few products that I didn’t know the difference and how to use it all together.  So, I sent email and I got my answers right away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I asked and their reply to my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My questions:  Please let me know the difference between these products.&lt;br /&gt;1) Joyal Beauty Super Brightening Vitamin C Serum vs  Kojic acid&lt;br /&gt;2) Joyal Beauty Retinol Correcting Serum. vs  royal jelly serum&lt;br /&gt;3) Joyal Beauty Ultra Hyaluronic Moisturizing Serum vs  hyaluronic acid 3% pure serum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joyal Beauty Team replied:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are our organic anti-aging serum line and they have some similar functions.&lt;br /&gt;Both vitamin c and kojic acid have brightening functions. Age defy serum(kojic acid+AHA+BHA) also has exfoliating effect and it can be used at night. Vitamin c serum, you can use it Am and Pm, but best used at Am to utilize vitamin C’s sun-protecting properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retinol serum(vitamin A) should be used only at night. Royal jelly serum is a bee product (contains organic honey,royal jelly,propolis) Royal jelly and propolis preserve and restore proteins and enzymes for anti-aging action. You may search &amp;#34; royal jelly, skin, benefit&amp;#34; to learn more info. It can be used at Am and Pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We designed 2 different HA serums. The first one is 98% natural 5% HA+5% vitamin c+other anti-aging ingredients.  The second one is 100% natural 3% HA with the simplest ingredients. Why? because some people might be allergic to some ingredients such as jojoba oil, and the original one is oil-free and best for those oily skin or sensitive skin types. One of our customers who has the hypersensitive skin told us this is the only skincare product she can apply to her eye area and does not stimulate her eyes. 3%HA has the thinner texture compared with 5% HA so its absorption is better.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;//&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This information (reply from Joyal Beauty Team) help me to know the best way for me to apply different products, so here is how I use at AM and PM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My AM Skin Care:&lt;br /&gt;• Wash my face with gentle face cleanser.

It’s gentle enough to use it around eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When and if Joyal Beauty comes up with product for facial cleanser and toner, I will not hesitate to buy it.  I’ve used ½ oz creams/serums that cost over $200.00 in the past and it did very little to help my skin.  I really am glad I have a chance to try out Joyal Bauty.

            <li> This product really helps in drying up my acne and it also helps to gradually clear up the spot acne left on my face.</li>
            <li> REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several serums.  This serum is rather different.  It does two things at one.  It brings out the brightening effects and provides moisture and nutrients to your skin at the same time.  It has a gentleness for sensitive skin.  It has a light scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.  A little bit goes a long way.  It should be applied after cleansing in circular motions letting the massaging penetrate deeply.  After applying the serum  my skin feels moist and soothed.  I then put a little moisturizer on. The serum has ingredients like witch hazel, aloe, MSM, kojic and some others.  They give your skin a healthy young glow.  After a few applications your skin tone starts to even out.  It&#x27;s nice to feel your skin so hydrated and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a complimentary bottle of ULTIMATE BRIGHTENING AGE DEFY SERUM from Joyal Beauty for my view of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a little while now and am very pleased.  Before I started using, I want to comment on the easy to dispense pump.  unlike other serums where I have to contend with an odd medicine dropper, this serum uses a pump to dispense the product.  I find this much easier to use.  The scent.  It is more witch hazel than any thing else.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell of witch hazel but for those who do, it might be bothersome...Now for the product use itself... I very much enjoyed this.  I applied before bedtime after my regular cleansing routine.  It absorbed easily and felt great.  It moisturizes without being greasy.  My skin has never been more clear, smooth, or youthful.  I have been posting selfies on my social media accounts and have been getting complimented on my skin and how great I look.  As a mother of three who never cared too much about my skin care in my younger years, this means a lot.  I also love that this company is cruelty free.  I definitely recommend.  Although I was offered to try this free, the opinions and experiences are all my own.</li>
            <li> So the first one we received had a broken pump so I returned it to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The company Joyal Beauty sent me a new bottle for free which was an excellent customer service which I gave another star for.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the product for a couple of weeks now... I can not really tell if it&#x27;s doing anything to my skin yet but feels good.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I started to have pimples but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because of this product or stress... I will give it a break for a little while and try it again later once all the pimples are gone.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review then.</li>
            <li> First time using this serum, it is great.  But I have not seen the result of whitening,may take more time.</li>
