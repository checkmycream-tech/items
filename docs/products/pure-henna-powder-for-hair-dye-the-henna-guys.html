            <li>High quality henna for an excellent price.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a superior quality product, fine, great fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using henna on my hair for years now, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I just used it on my hair for the first time, and got beautiful results.</li>
            <li>It comes well packaged, and very fine texture.  </li>

            <li>thing I most like about</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used henna for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am using this consistently every 4-6 weeks!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>This henna is good, high quality with good dye release, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>It mixes easily and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>and I have a BEAUTIFUL coppery red when all is said and done.</li>
            <li>My hair is still a Beautiful Auburn 6 weeks later.  </li>
            <li>While this was body art quality henna (finely sieved), I have doubts about its freshness.</li>
            <li>If you mix the henna with a lightly acidic liquid (I use a bit of pomegranate juice in brewed hibiscus tea, some people add a bit of lemon juice) and let it sit over night before applying, it will release the dye</li>
            <li>This product is great stuff; the color is fantastic and it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite henna :)</li>
            <li>It leaves a rich red/mahogany stain on the skin.</li>
            <li>Super strong color, very smooth texture when applying and clear instructions included!!</li>
            <li>High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
            <li>I did not experience the initial bright brassy colors that others have given me.</li>
            <li>application method when I do a full henna treatment.</li>
            <li>Dyed my dark brown hair a beautiful auburn.</li>
            <li>Good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a sticky texture, like Rajasthani, which is not a bad thing in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and will be a regular customer.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply to my hair, and didn&#x27;t take as much effort to wash out.</li>
            <li>Sifted very well and smooth.  </li>
            <li>(some say fresh ginger negates the smell)</li>
            <li>The package is date stamped so you know how fresh the powder is.</li>
            <li>Henna is slightly messy if you&#x27;re new to using it, but this had a great smell and was easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Yes, the gray is a bit on the orangey side right now</li>
            <li>I originally planned to use a henna/indigo mix but in the end I wanted it more red than brown, so I ordered this pure henna.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used henna before, but this henna has a very fast dye release.  </li>
            <li>The price of this product is very reasonable with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to rinse out, and the color was nice and dark after only 2 hours application time.</li>
            <li>This application let my hair a very nice shade and extremely shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>and I love the natural variance I get with the henna over my grays and regular hair color (light brown).</li>
            <li>and you get more red out of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added essential oils before to make it smell a bit better</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time henna user.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>I dye my hair with henna monthly and this is better than anything I found while living in the middle east.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time hearing about Henna.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with my first purchase that I purchased again and in a larger quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For instance, mixing with straight water and leaving on for a short time will give you more of a coppery look on lighter colored hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of the henna, the price was terrific, and of course Prime shipping means no waiting over a week for it to arrive like with other companies.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ground very finely, so you can make it into a thick paste which can easily be applied to damp hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a orange color not natural looking</li>
            <li>It seems to be a pretty decent henna.</li>
            <li>The roots blend in very well with the rest of the hair</li>
            <li>The quality of this henna was very noticeable when I  began to apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the dye release is fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had hennas that haven&#x27;t done much of anything to my gray hairs.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out a delightful red color, that matches with previous applications of other products.  </li>
            <li>For instance, I have naturally light brown hair with a lot of premature grey (probably from all those years burning my scalp)</li>
            <li>so I can save the extra in the freezer for root touch ups in between full hennas.</li>
            <li>It had the right smooth texture and a slightly slimy feel to it.</li>
            <li>have been let down many</li>
            <li>I have used henna since I started going grey, am familiar with the product and purchased from a variety of sources.</li>
            <li>first time I purchased this henna, I was a little worried because it was so smooth.  </li>
            <li>All natural and works very well.</li>
            <li>Two months later, my hair still had a nice red cast, and I could see the new gray growth on the red highlights.  </li>
            <li>red is get is just right</li>
            <li>so I mixed up another batch and applied right away.  </li>
            <li>I mixed it with lemon juice and hot water to get a quicker and deeper dye release.</li>
            <li>Mixed it up in a large tipped squeeze bottle, and had no clogging issues.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for a while.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a natural brunette.)</li>
            <li>No gimmicks, and no hidden surprises.</li>
            <li>I apply right before I go to bed then wrap it up and sleep with it in my hair (put some dark towels on and around your pillow).</li>
            <li>I recommend leaving it on for at least 3 - 4 hours if you want more red and letting it &amp;#34;develop&amp;#34; overnight before hand.</li>
            <li>You natural hair color will play a big part in what color you end up with.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and was formerly paying twice this price for henna.</li>
            <li>It thickens my hair (not really something I need since it is thick and course to start with, but I&#x27;m sure some women out there would appreciate that aspect).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve used other henna powders, and spent the next day picking chaff out of your hair, you will very much appreciate the fineness of this powder.</li>
            <li>Mine only fades a little over four to five weeks before I touch up - no worse than any box or</li>

            <li> Mine only fades a little over four to five weeks before I touch up - no worse than any box or</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair naturally</li>
            <li> No major color loss/change.  </li>
            <li> I have an old sheet dedicated for henna use and I always use black towels when I do henna.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used lemon juice to bring out the color, and found I didn&#x27;t have to let it sit as long; it only took a few hours to be ready, where I had to mix it up the night before with my previous henna.  </li>
            <li> Mix it up at least six hours before you use it - it really smooths out the longer it sits.</li>
            <li> Makes my grey hairs auburn and the rest of my hair mahogany brown.</li>
            <li> This product seems equivalent or better and the price was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I do not recommend using lemon juice as it can really dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair red since I was 14 (with a jet black phase in there)</li>
            <li> This application I mixed the henna with a splash of apple cider vinegar and black cherry tea.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It mixes up like a pea green mud so its a little different to apply than regular dye.</li>
            <li> so be careful who you purchase from.</li>
            <li> I will usually use a regular color brush for root touch</li>
            <li> I have also told other people about the henna brothers.</li>
            <li> have dark, dark brown natural 4a hair with a few sprinkles of gray that people usually can&#x27;t see unless I point them out (</li>
            <li> I ordered 300 grams and mixed up about 150 with black tea and Bragg raw organic apple cider vinegar.  </li>
            <li> Once you rinse and dry, it will take a few days for the color to fully develop and the color gets deeper with each henna</li>
            <li> It also knocks my dandruff down for about 3 weeks</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and my grays are no more!!!</li>

            <li> I have been using this henna for over a year now and I won&#x27;t be going back to chemical dyes. I put up with them burning my scalp for 15 years regardless of what level developer/sensitive scalp product I used. It takes a bit more work to use henna, but I love not having to pick peeling pieces of my scalp out for days afterward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red is get is just right and I love the natural variance I get with the henna over my grays and regular hair color (light brown). It&#x27;s like I have copper highlights! It thickens my hair (not really something I need since it is thick and course to start with, but I&#x27;m sure some women out there would appreciate that aspect). It also knocks my dandruff down for about 3 weeks afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to anyone just getting started with henna, here are a few pointers I picked up from doing a bunch of research online about mixing and application. Since henna coats the hair, it will never lighten it, just deposit color. You natural hair color will play a big part in what color you end up with. For instance, I have naturally light brown hair with a lot of premature grey (probably from all those years burning my scalp) so my color comes out reddish auburn with copper streaks. Also, the way you mix it can effect the final result as well. For instance, mixing with straight water and leaving on for a short time will give you more of a coppery look on lighter colored hair. If you mix the henna with a lightly acidic liquid (I use a bit of pomegranate juice in brewed hibiscus tea, some people add a bit of lemon juice) and let it sit over night before applying, it will release the dye and you get more red out of it. I recommend leaving it on for at least 3 - 4 hours if you want more red and letting it &amp;#34;develop&amp;#34; overnight before hand. Once you rinse and dry, it will take a few days for the color to fully develop and the color gets deeper with each henna application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It mixes up like a pea green mud so its a little different to apply than regular dye. I have medium length hair, so I use the &amp;#34;henna bun&amp;#34; application method when I do a full henna treatment. You basically start at the crown and taking 1 inch sections spread the henna from root to tip, coil it up and then wrap the next section around that one, building up a &#x27;bun&amp;#34;. I always order a larger pack than I need so I can save the extra in the freezer for root touch ups in between full hennas. I will usually use a regular color brush for root touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it any messier than regular dye, in that if you get it on something you can stain it. I have an old sheet dedicated for henna use and I always use black towels when I do henna. The smell is... a bit weird. Its kind of like hay and it seems to stay in my hair for a couple of days. I&#x27;ve added essential oils before to make it smell a bit better (some say fresh ginger negates the smell) but I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell now and it goes away after a few washes, so not an issue for me anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attached a recent picture after doing a root touch up about 4 days ago. The roots blend in very well with the rest of the hair and I don&#x27;t have fading issues with henna like I did with regular red dyes. You can also kinda see the variation in colors I get over my gray/brown/blonde hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that henna is difficult to dye over and strip out, so if you like to change your hair color all the time, it may not be for you (although Henna guys have a lot of different color mixes so I guess you could keep going darker). I have dyed my hair red since I was 14 (with a jet black phase in there) so I like the red and want to maintain that look, so it is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and was formerly paying twice this price for henna. This works great. I got the 300 gm size to save on shipping. This packaghe will last me until the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time henna user.  I have dark brown hair naturally but I have been coloring with traditional hair color for years.  I had some coppery highlights and lots of gray roots.  I originally planned to use a henna/indigo mix but in the end I wanted it more red than brown, so I ordered this pure henna.  I have very thick, medium length hair.  I ordered 300 grams and mixed up about 150 with black tea and Bragg raw organic apple cider vinegar.  I let it cure for 10 hours before applying.  Then I ran out of the mix about 2/3 of the way through so I mixed up another batch and applied right away.  I see no difference in color or how well it took so next time I won&#x27;t wait for the mix to cure before applying.  I left it on for five hours, then rinsed without using shampoo.  I missed a lot of areas since I couldn&#x27;t see the back of my head, so I did a second application later that day and only left it on for two hours.  Again, rinsed without shampoo and just used conditioner on the length of my hair.  I absolutely love it!  Yes, the gray is a bit on the orangey side right now but I&#x27;m told it takes a few days to oxide and the color will deepen.  And each application after this will also deepen the color. I&#x27;m really happy with the quality of the henna, the price was terrific, and of course Prime shipping means no waiting over a week for it to arrive like with other companies.  (I had ordered a henna/indigo blend from someone else on the 20th and it didn&#x27;t arrive till the 29th.  Seriously? It takes 9 days to go from TX to SC? I got tired of waiting and ordered the Henna Guys henna instead.  Glad I did!)</li>
            <li> It seems to be a pretty decent henna.</li>
            <li> This product is great stuff; the color is fantastic and it lasts a long time.  I recommend it without reservations.</li>
            <li> Super strong color, very smooth texture when applying and clear instructions included!! No gimmicks, and no hidden surprises. You guys are awesome! thanks so much!</li>
            <li> EASIEST WAY TO DO IT YOURSELF: Go buy a condiment squirt bottle - I purchased one at my grocery store for $1. Mix it up at least six hours before you use it - it really smooths out the longer it sits. I mix mine with cider vinegar and funnel it into the squirt bottle then apply it the same way that I used to with a box of store-bought hair dye. I apply right before I go to bed then wrap it up and sleep with it in my hair (put some dark towels on and around your pillow). Rinse in the morning and I have a BEAUTIFUL coppery red when all is said and done. Mine only fades a little over four to five weeks before I touch up - no worse than any box or salon hair color would. I&#x27;ve used this three times now and have been nothing but happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna before, but this henna has a very fast dye release.  I&#x27;ve always used lemon juice to bring out the color, and found I didn&#x27;t have to let it sit as long; it only took a few hours to be ready, where I had to mix it up the night before with my previous henna.  Definitely impressed.</li>
            <li> I have used henna since I started going grey, am familiar with the product and purchased from a variety of sources. I am sick of playing &amp;#34;russian roulette&amp;#34; and after applying the henna to my hair yesterday. am pleased with the result, plus I did not react.This is definitely a superior quality product, fine, great fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been let down many times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be reordering again from the &amp;#34;henna guys&amp;#34;. It is far too dangerous purchasing online, many sellers are devious so be careful who you purchase from.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Will buy from this seller again and again.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what i wanted.  I&#x27;ve used several different Henna products - a couple were grainy, but not this one.  It comes well packaged, and very fine texture.  Mixed it up in a large tipped squeeze bottle, and had no clogging issues. My hair came out a delightful red color, that matches with previous applications of other products.  No major color loss/change.  I did not experience the initial bright brassy colors that others have given me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna on my hair for years now, but this is by far the best. The powder is so easy to mix, I didn&#x27;t have one clump! Henna is slightly messy if you&#x27;re new to using it, but this had a great smell and was easy to wash out. I&#x27;m so glad I found The Henna Guys!!</li>
            <li> Quality henna! I dye my hair with henna monthly and this is better than anything I found while living in the middle east.  Sifted very well and smooth.  Dyed my dark brown hair a beautiful auburn. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great color with this henna! Yes, it will bleed and fade. This is just the nature of both henna, and red hair color.&lt;br /&gt;The thing I most like about it is how well-sifted it is. If you&#x27;ve used other henna powders, and spent the next day picking chaff out of your hair, you will very much appreciate the fineness of this powder. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Was reluctant to try as I have been a user of Jamila BAQ and Rajasthani henna for years.  This product seems equivalent or better and the price was less expensive.  It does have a sticky texture, like Rajasthani, which is not a bad thing in my opinion.  It mixes easily and rinses easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna for years and this is probably the best type I&#x27;ve bought. It&#x27;s ground very finely, so you can make it into a thick paste which can easily be applied to damp hair. This avoids drips. It was very easy to rinse out, and the color was nice and dark after only 2 hours application time.</li>
            <li> High quality -- makes a very fine paste.</li>
            <li> High quality henna for an excellent price.</li>
            <li> This was my first time hearing about Henna. I love it!!! I have been natural for a while. My hair is soft and my grays are no more!!! It turned my grays a fire red so it looks shrieked. I am very satisfied and it was so easy to wash out. I am ordering again. I have also told other people about the henna brothers.</li>
            <li> The quality of this henna was very noticeable when I  began to apply it to my hair. It had the right smooth texture and a slightly slimy feel to it. It was easy to apply to my hair, and didn&#x27;t take as much effort to wash out. This application I mixed the henna with a splash of apple cider vinegar and black cherry tea.I mixed in the morning and left the henna sitting for 12 hours. I left it in my hair overnight. This application let my hair a very nice shade and extremely shiny and soft. I do not recommend using lemon juice as it can really dry out your hair. I decided not to use it after reading an article investigating the dye release using lemon juice v. water. I am very happy with the results of this product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I color my hair with henna and indigo.  This henna is good, high quality with good dye release, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage!  I noticed that the dye release is fast.  I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I am using this consistently every 4-6 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> I would put a zero if I could! This made my hair to start falling out and stop my hair from growing also it&#x27;s more of a orange color not natural looking</li>
            <li> All natural and works very well. Should be mixed with henna.</li>
            <li> Very fine sifted, like talcum powder, and perfect for body art. The package is date stamped so you know how fresh the powder is. It leaves a rich red/mahogany stain on the skin. I just used it on my hair for the first time, and got beautiful results. Makes my grey hairs auburn and the rest of my hair mahogany brown. (I&#x27;m a natural brunette.) Application notes: I mixed it with lemon juice and hot water to get a quicker and deeper dye release. Left it on my head for 4 hours, then rinsed without shampooing. My hair is silky soft and gorgeous! The price of this product is very reasonable with Prime shipping. My new favorite henna :)</li>
            <li> Love it! I always order from these guys because their product is so good. It lasts and never fades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used henna for many years.  I usually purchase from hennasooq, but her shipping prices get outrageous, and I wanted something that would arrive quickly (the gray hairs were starting to make me nervous), so I took a chance on this.  I was so pleased with my first purchase that I purchased again and in a larger quantity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark, dark brown natural 4a hair with a few sprinkles of gray that people usually can&#x27;t see unless I point them out (but when I look in the mirror, they&#x27;re all I see).  I&#x27;ve had hennas that haven&#x27;t done much of anything to my gray hairs.  Not the case with this product.  My formerly gray hairs all look like red highlights now.  I love it.  And the rest of my hair has a nice flame quality when the sun shines on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I purchased this henna, I was a little worried because it was so smooth.  I&#x27;m used to a few twigs in my henna.  I thought it might be mixed with something else, and knew that if it was, the red color wouldn&#x27;t last.  Two months later, my hair still had a nice red cast, and I could see the new gray growth on the red highlights.  Good enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and will be a regular customer.</li>
            <li> My hair is still a Beautiful Auburn 6 weeks later.  Best quality henna I have every used.  Very finely sifted.</li>
            <li> While this was body art quality henna (finely sieved), I have doubts about its freshness.</li>
