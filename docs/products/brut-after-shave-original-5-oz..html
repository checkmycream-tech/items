            <li>This is my favorite of the Brut line.</li>
            <li>MY HUSBAND HAS WORN BRUTE FOR MANY MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>I have had many comments about how it smells.</li>
            <li>Love it--as I do with all Brut products.</li>
            <li>Brut After-Shave smells better than most brands, and slightly better than the Brut Splash-On.</li>
            <li>Brut is available most chain drugstores.</li>
            <li>Works like it&#x27;s supposed to, and the smell is just clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>But not quite as strong as the Brut Cologne.</li>
            <li>Women loved it when I was young.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of fragrance and the ladies still love it.</li>
            <li>It will be uniquely yours and distinctively clean, smooth and suave.</li>
            <li>WE RETURNED THE BRUT BECAUSE WE HAD ORDERED THE ORIGINAL SCENT</li>
            <li>AREN&#x27;T MAKING THE ORIGINAL SCENT ANYMORE.</li>
            <li>I Love the Brut, In the Mornin&#x27;, when I splash it on, it makes me smeel mainly.</li>
            <li>I love the way this settles down into just a clean smell on my skin that is subtly available most of the day.  </li>
            <li>fast shipping too exactly what i wanted :)</li>
            <li>A good old smell that in todays world smells brand new.  </li>
            <li>Long considered a classic in many circles, I had high hopes for this product: It has been around forever and smelled pretty nice in the bottle.      </li>
            <li>Goes on real smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin either.  </li>
            <li>Application after shaving yielded a mild tingle from the alcohol and intense wallop of fragrance.   </li>
            <li>All in all, there are superior products out there, even at the drugstore, even for less money.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to find it in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I. THANKS FOR FINDING IT FOR US</li>
            <li>Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  </li>
            <li>A pleasant, subtle medium in the Brut Family.</li>
            <li>knowing this product from the states, i ordered with amazon, and i found back the original flavour;</li>
            <li>However my nose is not always the judge, jury, and executioner for a particular scent, so I presented this to the Mrs.</li>
            <li>Brut is classic - this is quality stuff - u feel healing when u splash .</li>
            <li>Classic.</li>
            <li>BUT YOU SENT US THE CLASSIC SCENT</li>
            <li>Performs well as an aftershave and the fragrance is just strong enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>Husband is so tickled with his new bottle of Brut.  </li>
            <li>NOW WE ARE GETTING THE NEW AND IMPROVED STOCKED IN OUR STORES.</li>
            <li>Fabrege has made this affordable, and essential part of a man&#x27;s shaving experience and it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really even remember where I first smelled this scent (maybe my grandpa when I was little)</li>
            <li>I spent the whole day reeking like a skeezy used car salesman, or that jerk you can picture selling washer machines somewhere in the mid-west.  </li>
            <li>Was actually &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;, a new formulation that is totally unlike the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I liked this product because my husband has used it in the past and we have had a hard time finding it.  </li>

            <li> Immediately the scent changed from the way is smelled in the bottle to something slightly unpleasant, something that made me think of licorice.      </li>

            <li> However the worst part of this experience was the smell.  </li>

            <li> One can never go wrong with Brut... and Old Spice, for that matter. Women loved it when I was young.  They love it now that I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I Love the Brut, In the Mornin&#x27;, when I splash it on, it makes me smeel mainly. Yooooohh Adrienne !!</li>
            <li> In the search for the perfect aftershave, I purchased a bottle of Brut After Shave Lotion.  Long considered a classic in many circles, I had high hopes for this product: It has been around forever and smelled pretty nice in the bottle.      Application after shaving yielded a mild tingle from the alcohol and intense wallop of fragrance.   Immediately the scent changed from the way is smelled in the bottle to something slightly unpleasant, something that made me think of licorice.      This aftershave left my face feeling tight and slightly dry, not a desirable feeling.  I attribute this to use of propylene glycol as the moisturizing ingredient, a cheaper alternative to the glycerin of days gone by.      However the worst part of this experience was the smell.  It lingered all day, on both my face and hands.  Not even my trusted Boraxo odor eliminating soap could remove it.   I spent the whole day reeking like a skeezy used car salesman, or that jerk you can picture selling washer machines somewhere in the mid-west.  Not pleasant.       However my nose is not always the judge, jury, and executioner for a particular scent, so I presented this to the Mrs. She wrinkled her nose and shook her head.      All in all, there are superior products out there, even at the drugstore, even for less money.  If you&#x27;ve never used this don&#x27;t buy it online, go to the store and smell a bottle.  If you already use it, stop reading this review and get back to the used car lot.</li>
            <li> Brut is classic - this is quality stuff - u feel healing when u splash . The feel , the smoothness &amp; the quick drying all points to a perfect &amp; well designed after shave .</li>
            <li> Husband is so tickled with his new bottle of Brut.  And he smells so good when he wears it.</li>
            <li> Was not &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; as advertised. Was actually &amp;#34;Classic&amp;#34;, a new formulation that is totally unlike the &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34;. It should not be falsely advertised or pictured if not the actual product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat Brut in my opinion.  It has just the right amount of fragrance and the ladies still love it.</li>
            <li> fast shipping too exactly what i wanted :)</li>
            <li> It is getting hard to find this product. My husband doesn&#x27;t like the Brut splash on lotion at all so I go looking every time he starts to run low. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so hard to find ... but thanks Amazon, I found it here.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the Brut line. Performs well as an aftershave and the fragrance is just strong enough for daily use. I love the way this settles down into just a clean smell on my skin that is subtly available most of the day.  Brut is available most chain drugstores. It&#x27;s inexpensive and reliable.  Trendy fragrances come and go, but I believe this product has carried on for a reason.</li>
            <li> Same aftershave that I used in college.  A good old smell that in todays world smells brand new.  I don&#x27;t know of anyone in this age that produces that distinctive smell of Brut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really even remember where I first smelled this scent (maybe my grandpa when I was little) but I knew I had to find it again. Thankfully i found this beauty of an aftershave. Works like it&#x27;s supposed to, and the smell is just clean and refreshing. Goes on real smooth and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin either.  It does have alcohol denat in it though so that might be a problem for some.</li>
            <li> Classic. It will be uniquely yours and distinctively clean, smooth and suave. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> WE RETURNED THE BRUT BECAUSE WE HAD ORDERED THE ORIGINAL SCENT BUT YOU SENT US THE CLASSIC SCENT WHICH MY HUSBAND DOES NOT LIKE.  WE DID LEARN THAT THEY AREN&#x27;T MAKING THE ORIGINAL SCENT ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> Very good product!  Very good experience with this purchase.  Product was as advertised and sold at a great price.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND HAS WORN BRUTE FOR MANY MANY YEARS. NOW WE ARE GETTING THE NEW AND IMPROVED STOCKED IN OUR STORES. THEY JUST DON&#x27;T CARRY THIS ITEM. I GET SO SICK OF TRYING TO FIND IT. SO, I CAME TO AMAZON AS ALWAYS. SHIPPING WAS GOOD. THE PRODUCT WAS CORRECT. AND HE IS HAPPY AND SO AM I. THANKS FOR FINDING IT FOR US</li>
            <li> Brute After-shave, the famous aftershave that was popular in the 1970&#x27;s is still the best aftershave mass produced today.  This is an aftershave that is essential to put on a mans face immediately after shaving.  It always has an invigorating odor, it cleans and dries out oils which could lead to acne and it has a pleasant lingering smell throughout the day.  This is the after shave that I have used everyday for the last 30 years and will continue to do so.  Fabrege has made this affordable, and essential part of a man&#x27;s shaving experience and it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> Sure is nice to find this product.  I have not been able to find it in my local stores.  I have had many comments about how it smells.</li>
            <li> I liked this product because my husband has used it in the past and we have had a hard time finding it.  It is lightweight to even pack when we travel.</li>
            <li> it really nice ordering brut on amazon i like it</li>
            <li> knowing this product from the states, i ordered with amazon, and i found back the original flavour; everything ok; will buy again!</li>
            <li> Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  Great seller.  Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Love it--as I do with all Brut products.</li>
            <li> very nice but like everything else over priced</li>
            <li> Aroma is everything when it comes to After-Shaves. Brut After-Shave smells better than most brands, and slightly better than the Brut Splash-On. But not quite as strong as the Brut Cologne. A pleasant, subtle medium in the Brut Family.</li>
            <li> used brut for decades and still great</li>
            <li> My husbands loves this after shave. Happy husband happy wife.</li>
            <li> 100% recommended for people whom like good fragance</li>
