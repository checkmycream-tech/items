    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The brushes included are not the greatest.</li>
            <li>The forms are not flimsy and the colors are great!</li>
            <li>One of 3 stenciles fits my brow perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Otherwise great!</li>
            <li>Still, I have to say that the product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>It helps shape and fill in my eyebrows beautifully.</li>
            <li>it works as a great template.  </li>
            <li>I have never used the stencils because I have no need for them, but there are plenty of options and a friend of mine says they work great.  </li>
            <li>NYX did a great job with this product.</li>
            <li>i love this product !!</li>
            <li>I love it, and you will too!!</li>
            <li>They are of good quality, that being said.</li>
            <li>The brushes are neat and of good quality.</li>
            <li>Good quality and a good price.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and you get a good amount of powder for each color</li>
            <li>Like your own brows but better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m checking out the stencils on eyebrows.com, an amazon sponsored link, they have a huge selection and good prices.</li>
            <li>It would be ok for someone who likes that kind of thing&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>The kit is nice, packaging, colors and tools, but the stencils are huge.  </li>
            <li>i wasn&#x27;t able to use it</li>
            <li>okay, my eyebrows just aren&#x27;t that shape.</li>
            <li>, I just want them to appear more defined and darker.</li>
            <li>They should offer much more variety in shape.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews from others before buying and like them, I am totally satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that enhances your brows, but still keeps them looking very natural and not like they are drawn on like a sharpie, this is great.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the powder is great, very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Although I love the stencils and my brows looked fabulous after using the stencils.</li>
            <li>The brushes and stencils are still very useable and the mirror in the case is good quality.</li>
            <li>I do love the white in the pallette, it is a great highlighter.</li>
            <li>so I cannot give an accurate review as of yet,</li>
            <li>Awesome product tho...use it almost everyday</li>
            <li>Maybe I will try to tweeze mine to fit one of the thinner ones, but probably not.</li>
            <li>The powders in this kit are a good mix which allow you to make your brows look enhanced but natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and the results are nice &amp; natural.</li>
            <li>Got the package pretty quickly but product isn&#x27;t worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian with completely black eyebrows and one of the darker colors works great for me.</li>
            <li>Looks more natural.</li>
            <li>While its not the right color for me, the brushes and stencils are still useable.</li>
            <li>cause it just didn&#x27;t look right on me</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a pretty useful kit.</li>
            <li>Unless you have a large head, they won&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>A decent pair of tweezers or a spoolie would be far more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This only took a fraction of the time and looks much better (using the powder brush freehand,</li>
            <li>Not only does it come with 4 different shades but also it includes an eyebrow comb/brush, a precision applicator brush, a built-in compact mirror, and THREE different flexible eyebrow stencils to help you achieve the perfect brow.</li>
            <li>And the fact that you get all of this for such an affordable price makes the product that much better.</li>
            <li>I love this brow filler, but I have to admit I feel a bit duped as I thought that the highlighter was actually brow wax.  </li>
            <li>and I love that there is a band around the box so that it doesn&#x27;t open and the brushes fall out.  </li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>It is just too much like work to use it.</li>
            <li>Very plz&#x27;d</li>
            <li>The colors were much lighter than they appeared.  </li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because, while it is a decent eyebrow kit, its much lighter than the example (of course it can vary by computer screen).</li>
            <li>I have some new eye shadows for now!</li>
            <li>But after a few times your able to do your brows with out the stencil to guide you.</li>
            <li>The colors are believable and are not too dark or too light for dark haired people</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this.</li>
            <li>It is much better than I expected, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Over all I was skeptical about this because of the price, but have been more than pleased and will reorder the minute I run low.</li>
            <li>only really use the darkest brown...wish there was a darker brown.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows look professionally done so I won&#x27;t have to pay to get them done anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used a pencil which took forever to make it look natural, and I messed up plenty.</li>
            <li>They are very hard to use and don&#x27;t work effectively when trying to chose an initial shape.</li>
            <li>Colors last a long time...never really use the stencils.</li>
            <li>The colors on the pallette were much lighter than expected, so if your a lighter brunette, this will be perfet for you, but</li>
            <li>They still do provide a good base to outline your brows with though, and are not completely useless.</li>
            <li>stencils themselves are quite large, as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li>and I draw on half of my brows and there is not the difference in color that comes with some brow fillers out on the market (the color is consistent).  </li>
            <li>if your on the dark to very dark brown side of the spectrum this will be too light.</li>

            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t dark enough for my very dark brows.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lame.</li>
            <li> I am not a blond but seem to always need a blond pencil in order to not have overly dark brows.</li>
            <li> Ill splurge for the Urban Decay brow box next time, because after all, you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BB cream on the brows gets it kinda tacky so a little bit of product goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> if you have pencil thin eyebrows they will be way too big.</li>
            <li> Cruella-De-Ville&#x27;ish looking as some of the very heavy and thick brow stencils in other kits I have bought.  </li>
            <li> I do find the stencils a little hard to use.</li>
            <li> This was a bit pricey and the applicator brush is too small.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to control doing the end of the brow</li>
            <li> I did, however, expect that at least one of them would be a wax.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no wax in this kit, which is disappointing because I wanted to have everything I needed in one place, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> The angled brush is at least useable in a pinch, but I&#x27;ll probably chuch the one that&#x27;s a combo comb/brush.</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll still have to pack my wax or brow</li>

            <li> The plastic shapers are useless.</li>
            <li> like I said the stencils are useless).</li>
            <li> Powder and brush get 5 stars, but took off 1 star for these useless stencils.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this eyebrow kit and how it applies. I only wish that it had a color that was a bit lighter. I am not a blond but seem to always need a blond pencil in order to not have overly dark brows.</li>
            <li> The colors on the pallette were much lighter than expected, so if your a lighter brunette, this will be perfet for you, but if your on the dark to very dark brown side of the spectrum this will be too light. I do love the white in the pallette, it is a great highlighter. While its not the right color for me, the brushes and stencils are still useable. if you have pencil thin eyebrows they will be way too big. I havent tried it with out a primer, but from the texture of the makeup I wouldnt expect it too last very long without it. Either way, I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because, while it is a decent eyebrow kit, its much lighter than the example (of course it can vary by computer screen). The brushes and stencils are still very useable and the mirror in the case is good quality. Ill splurge for the Urban Decay brow box next time, because after all, you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> i do like it even though the colours are so bad but other than that is good.&lt;br /&gt;thanks so much</li>
            <li> The powders in this kit are a good mix which allow you to make your brows look enhanced but natural. Like your own brows but better. I did, however, expect that at least one of them would be a wax. There&#x27;s no wax in this kit, which is disappointing because I wanted to have everything I needed in one place, especially for travel. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll still have to pack my wax or brow gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stencils themselves are quite large, as other reviewers mentioned. They still do provide a good base to outline your brows with though, and are not completely useless. The brushes included are not the greatest. The angled brush is at least useable in a pinch, but I&#x27;ll probably chuch the one that&#x27;s a combo comb/brush. It&#x27;s pretty lame. A decent pair of tweezers or a spoolie would be far more useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a pretty useful kit. I hope NYX improves it by including at least one wax &amp; a few more stencils of different sizes. They are of good quality, that being said. Not just flimsy rubbish.</li>
            <li> The kit is nice, packaging, colors and tools, but the stencils are huge.  Even the smallest was not usable with the powder. I did find a use for the stencil with my eyebrow pencil, instead of drawing freehand it works as a great template.  I&#x27;m checking out the stencils on eyebrows.com, an amazon sponsored link, they have a huge selection and good prices.</li>
            <li> It would be ok for someone who likes that kind of thing&lt;br /&gt;but i wasn&#x27;t able to use it cause it just didn&#x27;t look right on me</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that enhances your brows, but still keeps them looking very natural and not like they are drawn on like a sharpie, this is great.  It is affordable and lasts all day.  I have even slept in it and I still had brows in the morning.  I have never used the stencils because I have no need for them, but there are plenty of options and a friend of mine says they work great.  Over all I was skeptical about this because of the price, but have been more than pleased and will reorder the minute I run low.</li>
            <li> i love this product !! i cant find it on amazon no more why!!!! only have the blond version i need brunette !! baby come back ...</li>
            <li> I like this eyebrow kit. The forms are not flimsy and the colors are great! It&#x27;s easy to use and the results are nice &amp; natural.</li>
            <li> Got the package pretty quickly but product isn&#x27;t worth the buy! Three shadow colors that are just that. . .dry color that looks fake! I thought they might be waxy or at least creamy to help cover my eyebrows! Plus, the stencils are way too big for my face! All four are the same size, just different angles which doesn&#x27;t help me one bit because they all extend off my face! Unless you have a large head, they won&#x27;t work! I have some new eye shadows for now!</li>
            <li> Colors last a long time...never really use the stencils. only really use the darkest brown...wish there was a darker brown. Awesome product tho...use it almost everyday</li>
            <li> It has to be mixed together to even get close to my color.  The browns have reddish in them which I don&#x27;t like.  It is hard to control doing the end of the brow and you can see the powder,  It is just too much like work to use it.</li>
            <li> It is much better than I expected, especially for the price. One of 3 stenciles fits my brow perfectly. I am Caucasian with completely black eyebrows and one of the darker colors works great for me. The brushes are neat and of good quality. My overall satisfaction is 100%.</li>
            <li> Needed help filling in my eyebrows and decided to get this. It&#x27;s amazing!!!!!!! My eyebrows look professionally done so I won&#x27;t have to pay to get them done anymore. Just re-shape your brows with tweezers when necessary, and use this after. Very plz&#x27;d w/ my purchase. Shipping was prompt as well.</li>
            <li> This was a bit pricey and the applicator brush is too small.  The plastic shapers are useless. I threw it in a drawer and eventually will go in the garbage</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.  The colors were much lighter than they appeared.  I am African American with a medium brown complexion and I could not use this product.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this. I find it easier to apply just after applying foundation, in my case, bb cream, but powder your nose and cheeks (Prevents the powders from dropping on your face and if it does, just use your powder brush with some powder to scoot it all away from your nose or cheeks)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BB cream on the brows gets it kinda tacky so a little bit of product goes a looong way.</li>
            <li> The stencils the product comes with didn&#x27;t work for me at all, and they won&#x27;t work for you either unless your eyebrows happen to already be shaped like one of the three stencils provided; unlikely considering the many different eyebrow shapes out there. They also happen to be on the thicker side; but the thinner two seem okay, my eyebrows just aren&#x27;t that shape. Maybe I will try to tweeze mine to fit one of the thinner ones, but probably not. I like my eyebrow shape, I just want them to appear more defined and darker. Anyway, the powder is great, very natural looking. I&#x27;ve always used a pencil which took forever to make it look natural, and I messed up plenty. This only took a fraction of the time and looks much better (using the powder brush freehand, like I said the stencils are useless). Powder and brush get 5 stars, but took off 1 star for these useless stencils. They should offer much more variety in shape.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance  to play with this yet so I cannot give an accurate review as of yet,but when I do I will let you know what I think.</li>
            <li> This brow kit should be a staple in every girl&#x27;s makeup bag!! Not only does it come with 4 different shades but also it includes an eyebrow comb/brush, a precision applicator brush, a built-in compact mirror, and THREE different flexible eyebrow stencils to help you achieve the perfect brow. And the fact that you get all of this for such an affordable price makes the product that much better. NYX did a great job with this product. I love it, and you will too!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It helps shape and fill in my eyebrows beautifully. The only reason that I did not give it 4 stars is because the stencils are a bit impractical.They are very hard to use and don&#x27;t work effectively when trying to chose an initial shape. Otherwise great!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews from others before buying and like them, I am totally satisfied with my purchase. I&#x27;ve always used a pencil to fill in my eye brows but powder is the way to go. Looks more natural. I do find the stencils a little hard to use. But after a few times your able to do your brows with out the stencil to guide you.</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t dark enough for my very dark brows.  Although I love the stencils and my brows looked fabulous after using the stencils.</li>
            <li> I love this brow filler, but I have to admit I feel a bit duped as I thought that the highlighter was actually brow wax.  Still, I have to say that the product is excellent.  The colors are believable and are not too dark or too light for dark haired people and I draw on half of my brows and there is not the difference in color that comes with some brow fillers out on the market (the color is consistent).  The packaging is nice and you get a good amount of powder for each color and I love that there is a band around the box so that it doesn&#x27;t open and the brushes fall out.  I will not use the stencils as I never use them with the kits I have purchased in the past, but it is worth saying that these are not as thick and Cruella-De-Ville&#x27;ish looking as some of the very heavy and thick brow stencils in other kits I have bought.  Good quality and a good price.  I will be buying it again.</li>
