            <li>LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>and it works great with my very fine hair!</li>
            <li>This is  good product.  </li>
            <li>So many products that worked great for me have been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>and then I had to move away; so glad I can get here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>It is ok</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Helps give body to my baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it does give it body.</li>
            <li>Works WONDERS for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>but it did add a coating to my superfine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied that I found something that really does what it says it&#x27;ll do :-)</li>
            <li>It gives hair a good deal of lift at the roots, and enough control that I don&#x27;t bother with any hairspray at all (I comb it through to the ends).  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, it smells wonderfully clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price of the product.</li>
            <li>+, so I was thrilled to order it through Amazon for only $14.76, with no shipping charges!!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who needs some extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34; for their fine hair (oh, I also color my hair blond, and this has been very easy on it).</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely fine, but this thickening mousse provides volume and lasting hold.  </li>
            <li>This product really plumps up the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks much thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from Pureology, to Big Sexy, and A LOT of other high-end products in between, but this one is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is fine, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It works so well with my super fine thin hair just a little goes a long way</li>

            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. It did not live up to the reviews it received.</li>
            <li> Truly thickens hair. Doesn&#x27;t make it crispy.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this mousse to help thicken thin hair. It works quite well.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING!! Last all day!!! I recommend this product for thin or thinning hair you wont be disaapointed!</li>
            <li> This product really plumps up the hair. My hair looks much thicker and fuller. Will continue to use Kenra products.</li>
            <li> best mousse out there!</li>
            <li> It is the best mousse on the market.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Helps give body to my baby fine hair.  Well worth the price of the product.</li>
            <li> It is ok but I am not impressed with the product</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely fine, but this thickening mousse provides volume and lasting hold.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve used for styling my hair.  If your hair is fine, a little goes a long way.  The price in retail stores is $22.00+, so I was thrilled to order it through Amazon for only $14.76, with no shipping charges!!</li>
            <li> Love it. Gives me the volume I need&lt;br /&gt;This line of  products is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a little , I&#x27;ve tried a lot either way makes my hair look stringy not impressed</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair - this was awful, sticky and heavy and left my hair feeling rough. Can&#x27;t even finish the can - giving it away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied that I found something that really does what it says it&#x27;ll do :-)</li>
            <li> Gives me volume I want, and hold the body needed all day.  My hair has begun 2 turn gray so this is an added tool.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that will actually give my baby-fine hair body, style, and shape! LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> It left my hair stiff and dry feeling but it did add a coating to my superfine hair. So many products that worked great for me have been discontinued. I&#x27;ll keep looking - not planning on reordering.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My hair dresser gave me some and then I had to move away; so glad I can get here on Amazon! It works so well with my super fine thin hair just a little goes a long way and I typically only use after I shampoo and condition...next day I just rinse my hair and can still feel the product working so no need to reapply until the next shampoo day.</li>
            <li> This is  good product.  I have fine hair and it does give it body.</li>
            <li> Works WONDERS for fine hair.  I&#x27;ve used everything from Pureology, to Big Sexy, and A LOT of other high-end products in between, but this one is by far my favorite.
