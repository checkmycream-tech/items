            <li>Which is ideal imo because I don&#x27;t want to have to use a stinky or strong chemical nail polish on her.</li>

            <li>My niece looked to cute with this polish on</li>
            <li>absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>love painting my granddaughters nails</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad to know there is nothing toxic that I&#x27;m putting on her.</li>
            <li>Cute, paint can flake off almost immediatley</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and colors of this.  </li>
            <li>love the colors-</li>
            <li>Love how safe it is</li>
            <li>Fun, bright colors but zero staying power.</li>
            <li>so sometimes you have to put on two coats to get a better color.</li>
            <li>Adorable, does not smell and comes off with out even having to use a remover, after a couple of baths it comes off.</li>
            <li>(Which I believe they do have Piggy Paint top coat)</li>
            <li>However, my 5 yr old isn&#x27;t necessarily dainty with her fingers.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it looks on both of my babies toes.</li>
            <li>So cute.</li>
            <li>They are great and super pretty colors.  </li>
            <li>Surprised by all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Having a 1.5 year old (going on 15) who has to paint everyone&#x27;s nails - this polish is great.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for the fact that it&#x27;s water based and not as strong as the &#x27;adult&#x27; nail polish.</li>
            <li>and we have had more fun doing manicures and pedicures!</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily</li>
            <li>Non-toxic and easy to remove should be a bonus.</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I loved the idea of safe nail polish for my two year old.  </li>
            <li>Which is fine with me</li>
            <li>The polish is fine...</li>
            <li>The pink is very bright but matte.</li>
            <li>The colors were great, but I expected a much better product.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick drying.  </li>
            <li>This will be my daughters first summer and painted baby toes are adorable.</li>
            <li>If you are going to create a polish that is kid friendly...</li>
            <li>your packaging should be kid friendly as well.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is safe for my two year old.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure I am a dude.</li>
            <li>My 2 year old granddaughter was thrilled with this polish.</li>
            <li>The pink was very nice, the purple had a defective cap and could not be opened.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I got it off of her before it got into her eye.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>It smelled like real paint and it scratches off so easily just like paint</li>
            <li>I really liked the fact that these polishes were safe for little hands that like to eat everything.  </li>
            <li>The pink is bright and summery and the purple has a shimmer to it.</li>
            <li>Love the piggy paint for my 2 yr old.</li>
            <li>We do 2-3 thin coats and that works perfectly for her nails.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste very nice if your little girls put their fingers in their mouth.</li>
            <li>But it dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at a kid store and it was $11.....</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more piggy paint colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to shellac and this product is the only item I have found that I can safely use.</li>
            <li>By the next morning most had already chipped or rubbed off.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last more than a day.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>This Piggy Paint had good one coat coverage and did not have a harsh smell.</li>
            <li>The pink and purple are cute colors</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>I like the purple color more since it&#x27;s a shiny purple while the pink is matte.</li>
            <li>I even feel comfortable enough to use it on my infant.</li>
            <li>Gentle yet durable.</li>
            <li>Though does chip rather fast.  </li>
            <li>The polish really doesn&#x27;t have any smell and it washes off by itself.</li>
            <li>The colors are really complimentary and there is no harsh chemical smell.</li>
            <li>The pink color is too neon pink for my taste, however the purple is very nice.</li>
            <li>I wanted her sweet little toenails to be pink for photos and heard good things about this nontoxic &amp; water soluble</li>
            <li>Not anything significant compared to regular polish.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s not as toxic compared to conventional brands.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that they do chip very easily and wear off a lot sooner than regular nail polish, but it&#x27;s great to get away from the chemicals and such that are associated with those anyway.</li>
            <li>It does not stay on very well, but at least it is safe!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey but the fact that its non-toxic means more to me.</li>
            <li>I love that this nail polish isn&#x27;t going to be toxic when my little girl chews it off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;safe&#x27; polish to be a non-chip, long lasting polish.</li>
            <li>It does not last very long, but i did not put a top coat on.</li>
            <li>MY 2 YEAR OLD LOVES THESE!</li>
            <li>It dried VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this on my 10 month old.</li>
            <li>This nail polish started chipping off both my 9 and 3 year old girls within a day.</li>
            <li>I painted my 15 mo old nails while she was eating lunch.</li>
            <li>Fun and nontoxic finger nail polish for the little princess in your life, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these for her.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a cute idea, hard to do on a wiggly little one though.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last too long</li>
            <li> If fingers go in their mouths do not expect this paint to last long.</li>
            <li> but it does not stay on for long.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long though.  </li>
            <li> To everyone complaining about the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; of this product - did you use a hair dryer to quickly dry and set it?</li>
            <li> I paint and dry each hand and foot with a hairdryer for about 1 minute.</li>
            <li> They had plenty of time to dry.</li>
            <li> We painted her fingers and toes yesterday afternoon and only one nail is slightly chipped today.</li>
            <li> There is not really a smell to it.</li>
            <li> We have not used it in a long time because it&#x27;s not worth the time and energy, but today I painted my daughter&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> If you want glittery pink instead of matte, you should check the Piggy Paint website for the color name.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> It lasts a few days less then regular polish</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t put any other polish on her fingers.</li>
            <li> While the product says odorless there is a slight odor.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my baby girl&#x27;s little toesies.  </li>
            <li> This company has a few colors like Gabby Goo where the proceeds go to help kids with cancer.  </li>
            <li> I bought two bottles and after one year one of the bottles completely dried up and is no longer usable​.</li>
            <li> Wish the color lasted longer though, it&#x27;s hard to paint a baby&#x27;s toenails!</li>
            <li> This polish is useless because it chips or peels off within 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> I do not know what we were thinking about giving a toddler this, parent fail.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wanted to paint my 1 year olds nails SO BAD!</li>

            <li> My niece looked to cute with this polish on</li>
            <li> Super cute colors and is great for my 7 month olds toes</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter. I wanted her sweet little toenails to be pink for photos and heard good things about this nontoxic &amp; water soluble product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily but you&#x27;ll need two coats. It dries a lot slower than I would expect for a product aimed at kids who are on the go. It didn&#x27;t start to chip for a good week which was nice.</li>
            <li> absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> love painting my granddaughters nails</li>
            <li> Love, love, love! This will be my daughters first summer and painted baby toes are adorable. These colors are great. The pink is bright and summery and the purple has a shimmer to it. There is not really a smell to it. I like that it&#x27;s not toxic as my daughter has recently found her foot, which goes into her mouth.</li>
            <li> I use this on my 10 month old. The pink and purple are cute colors and I&#x27;m glad to know there is nothing toxic that I&#x27;m putting on her. Wish the color lasted longer though, it&#x27;s hard to paint a baby&#x27;s toenails!</li>
            <li> To everyone complaining about the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; of this product - did you use a hair dryer to quickly dry and set it? It really does make a difference. Also, this nail polish is going on your child. Non-toxic and easy to remove should be a bonus. Especially if your child puts his/ her fingers in the mouth. I have been using these products on my 7 yo since she was 3. I paint and dry each hand and foot with a hairdryer for about 1 minute. We painted her fingers and toes yesterday afternoon and only one nail is slightly chipped today.</li>
            <li> Cute, paint can flake off almost immediatley</li>
            <li> This polish is useless because it chips or peels off within 1-2 days. We have not used it in a long time because it&#x27;s not worth the time and energy, but today I painted my daughter&#x27;s nails. Within 2-3 hours, 90% of the polish was gone from her nails. But, what was more disturbing was that chips of the polish were on her eye lid. So I would assume that she rubbed her eye and the polish just flaked off. Luckily I got it off of her before it got into her eye.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and colors of this.  It doesn&#x27;t last too long but it is so easy to reapply and my littles love it!  This company has a few colors like Gabby Goo where the proceeds go to help kids with cancer.  Highly recommend!  AND the prices are best on Amazon.  I bought my first bottle at a kid store and it was $11.....ouch!</li>
            <li> Easy and quick drying.  Love that it is safe for my two year old.</li>
            <li> love the colors- recommend using with the &#x27;Make it Last&#x27; set</li>
            <li> Love how safe it is but it does not stay on for long.</li>
            <li> Surprised by all the great reviews.  This nail polish started chipping off both my 9 and 3 year old girls within a day. Fun, bright colors but zero staying power.</li>
            <li> I painted my daughter&#x27;s nails after dinner and by bed time it had almost all rubbed off.</li>
            <li> Love the piggy paint for my 2 yr old. We do 2-3 thin coats and that works perfectly for her nails. I like the purple color more since it&#x27;s a shiny purple while the pink is matte. I will definitely be buying more piggy paint colors.</li>
            <li> The pink was very nice, the purple had a defective cap and could not be opened.  I need to return it.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure I am a dude. That said all paint experience comes from house or spray types of paint. This Piggy Paint had good one coat coverage and did not have a harsh smell. If fingers go in their mouths do not expect this paint to last long.</li>
            <li> I own a lot of Piggy Paint.  These colors are very cute.  My only gripe with them is that the color starts chipping off within a day.</li>
            <li> My almost 4-year-old daughter always wanted to put on my nail polish, so I bought these after reading about them. It&#x27;s non toxic and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll write about the color since no one did yet. The purple is glittery, which my daughter loves. It&#x27;s a bit watery though, so sometimes you have to put on two coats to get a better color. But it dries pretty quickly. The pink is very bright but matte. It&#x27;s thicker than the purple in terms of consistency. If you want glittery pink instead of matte, you should check the Piggy Paint website for the color name.</li>
            <li> Cute and delightful gift for a young lady</li>
            <li> The colors are great. The quality is great. Having a 1.5 year old (going on 15) who has to paint everyone&#x27;s nails - this polish is great. It is a little pricey but the fact that its non-toxic means more to me. It lasts a few days less then regular polish but she also picks it off. We bought this polish along with the polish remover and have not had to use the polish remover once. I highly recommend this polish.</li>
            <li> Adorable, does not smell and comes off with out even having to use a remover, after a couple of baths it comes off. Which is fine with me</li>
            <li> I do not know what we were thinking about giving a toddler this, parent fail. BTW, this is a pain to wash out</li>
            <li> I wanted to paint my 1 year olds nails SO BAD! Someone told me about this paint so I decided to try it. It is a great product for the fact that it&#x27;s water based and not as strong as the &#x27;adult&#x27; nail polish. It does not last very long, but i did not put a top coat on. (Which I believe they do have Piggy Paint top coat)</li>
            <li> I love that this nail polish isn&#x27;t going to be toxic when my little girl chews it off. I won&#x27;t put any other polish on her fingers. It does not stay on very well, but at least it is safe! No complaints for that reason. I don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;safe&#x27; polish to be a non-chip, long lasting polish. I can see how others might subtract stars though.</li>
            <li> MY 2 YEAR OLD LOVES THESE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to shellac and this product is the only item I have found that I can safely use. I even feel comfortable enough to use it on my infant. Gentle yet durable. Thx for a great product.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a cute idea, hard to do on a wiggly little one though.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Good product. It last about 2-3 days on my toddler. Which is ideal imo because I don&#x27;t want to have to use a stinky or strong chemical nail polish on her.</li>
            <li> I painted my 15 mo old nails while she was eating lunch. They had plenty of time to dry. By the next morning most had already chipped or rubbed off.</li>
            <li> Great coverage.  Though does chip rather fast.  However, my 5 yr old isn&#x27;t necessarily dainty with her fingers.  Love that it&#x27;s not as toxic compared to conventional brands.</li>
            <li> Fun and nontoxic finger nail polish for the little princess in your life, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy these for her.</li>
            <li> They come off very easily. Doesn&#x27;t last more than a day. I bought two bottles and after one year one of the bottles completely dried up and is no longer usable​.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I loved the idea of safe nail polish for my two year old.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very long though.  I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The polish is fine... just a thought for the creator though. If you are going to create a polish that is kid friendly... your packaging should be kid friendly as well.  One slip out of my toddlers hand and the polish hit the tile floor and smashed all over the place.  Never even got to use the purple before it broke.</li>
            <li> Peels off within a day.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my baby girl&#x27;s little toesies.  They are great and super pretty colors.  My only complaint is that they do chip very easily and wear off a lot sooner than regular nail polish, but it&#x27;s great to get away from the chemicals and such that are associated with those anyway.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s second birthday and we have had more fun doing manicures and pedicures! The polish really doesn&#x27;t have any smell and it washes off by itself. I did purchase the polish remover as well, but haven&#x27;t even had to open it yet.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old granddaughter was thrilled with this polish. Her mother was happy about it being non-toxic and easily removed.</li>
            <li> The colors are really complimentary and there is no harsh chemical smell. I love the way it looks on both of my babies toes. So cute.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was not what I expected it to be. It smelled like real paint and it scratches off so easily just like paint would if you painted it on your nails. The colors were great, but I expected a much better product.</li>
            <li> I really liked the fact that these polishes were safe for little hands that like to eat everything.  It held up well to the sandbox and the pool.  Good buy.</li>
            <li> Our grand daughter was very pleased.</li>
            <li> While the product says odorless there is a slight odor. Not anything significant compared to regular polish. It doesn&#x27;t taste very nice if your little girls put their fingers in their mouth. It dried VERY quickly. I am highly impressed. I will be using this on baby girl&#x27;s toes. The pink color is too neon pink for my taste, however the purple is very nice. I will definitely be getting more.</li>
