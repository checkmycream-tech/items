            <li>I like this soap for my baby because the pump is really easy to use with one hand.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good because one con is that (like most natural baby soaps) it is NOT advertised tear free.</li>
            <li>Smell so good and leave baby hair very soft</li>
            <li>The foam is very fun to use and I understand this is a super healthy product too.</li>

            <li>I love the smell and how gentle this shampoo/body wash is to my daughter.</li>
            <li>I love that it foams and is so gentle.  </li>
            <li>Its our favorite organic soap &amp; has a soft fresh scent!</li>
            <li>Hoping that they will come out with a bigger bottle and better pumps.</li>
            <li>It really hasn&#x27;t been a problem for us!</li>
            <li>that &amp;#34;Mama wants you to know!</li>
            <li>I like how my child&#x27;s skin feels really clean after I use it compared to Johnson and Johnson and Aveeno sensitive.  </li>
            <li>And leaves my daughters hair very tangled</li>
            <li>Very light soap and doesn&#x27;t irritate like other products have.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; refuse to use any other for both my children.</li>
            <li>Sometimes my baby will get a little cradle cap type residue on his scalp and this soap seems to take it away after one wash whereas the other brands don&#x27;t do as great of a job.  </li>
            <li>Easy to do with one hand while the other is hanging on to bubs in the tub</li>
            <li>Normally she LOVES baths.  </li>
            <li>and it is my go-to gift for new baby gifts for the nieces and nephews.</li>
            <li>However, I think it needs to be CLEAR that this is NOT a tear-free shampoo.</li>

            <li>We have always used organic shampoos on our 11 month old and just switched this product.</li>
            <li>Natural castile soap is NOT a &amp;#34;no-tear&amp;#34; formula, please use with the self-foaming bottle</li>
            <li>I have tried several shampoo/body wash products in an attempt to find something effective while keeping it natural and with as few chemicals as possible.</li>
            <li>The only down fall is that it is NOT tear free</li>
            <li>So we have to be a little more careful</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pure and natural and has never caused a rash on his delicate skin.</li>

            <li> this is the best baby wash ever. It&#x27;s foamy so you just pump and apply. Easy to do with one hand while the other is hanging on to bubs in the tub so he doesn&#x27;t go under while splashing about. It&#x27;s pure and natural and has never caused a rash on his delicate skin. I deviated from it once because store was sold out and used honest co wash and he got a butt rash. Never again! Love all of the earth mama products (wash and baby lotion) for my son!</li>
            <li> Has a great EWG rating and has cleared up my son&#x27;s eczema on his back! We love this stuff. You do have to be careful since it&#x27;s not tear-free, but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for us at all. We will be using this for a long time to come.</li>

            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t have a whole lot of fragrance which is good I guess for a baby.  Lathers well.  Eh, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> My very favorite baby soap! I have used it on my three kids and it is my go-to gift for new baby gifts for the nieces and nephews. It is not a tear-free formula, which means it has not had anesthetizing agents added to hide the sting. It really hasn&#x27;t been a problem for us!</li>
            <li> I bought the calming lavender and received the unscented one.</li>
            <li> I love this soap for my daughter.  We&#x27;ve been using it for 8 months now (since she was a week old)...I love that it foams and is so gentle.  The best part about it, though, is that it so safe for her.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about any nasty chemicals!</li>

            <li> Absolutely love this Shampoo &amp; Body Wash. I&#x27;ve been using this since my son was born he&#x27;s 6 months old now. It smells great and I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It smells like hand soap. And leaves my daughters hair very tangled</li>
            <li> I love this for my baby. It smells so nice and it&#x27;s nice not to have to wonder if my baby will get cancer from using it.</li>
