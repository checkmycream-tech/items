            <li>/&gt;Overall, a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>Anyway, its a good starter kit, but I may as well trash it.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Good for men and teenagers.</li>
            <li>This works great for blemishes of any kind.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price</li>
            <li>after i used this product i loved it</li>
            <li>and now they loved it.</li>
            <li>it does a good job of stimulating the skin and is convenient for travel.</li>
            <li>I just used the nail buffer to give myself a manicure, and it&#x27;d did a good job.  </li>
            <li>worked good for about a week then stopped working .</li>
            <li>my wife loved it ...</li>
            <li>Finished with a good moistizer and done.</li>
            <li>For the price point, this is actually a really good product.</li>
            <li>They both feel good and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>This product was received in good time and functioned as promised.</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>but I will probably still be using this from time to time - just because it feels good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried the Clarisonic and loved it.</li>
            <li>This brush is probably just as good as those</li>
            <li>We use it primarily to stimulate collagen production and it works wonderfully</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>Good price my daughter loves it</li>
            <li>but it still was a good product.</li>
            <li>It is really good.</li>
            <li>Good all in one for the price</li>
            <li>and she really loved it.</li>
            <li>so I invested in this exfoliating brush and a good exfoliator scrub and the two together once or twice a week</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this product would be good for exfoliating, but I gave it a chance for the price.</li>
            <li>and I was delighted with the speed in which the vendor addressed my issue.</li>
            <li>and they have good customer service.  </li>
            <li>Just as advertised / Good Seller ?</li>
            <li>I also have the good (but pricy) version of this brush, so for that reason, when I use this one, I feel as if I am using a child&#x27;s toy.  </li>
            <li>It &#x27;s good on cleaning your skin and pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 with good collagen and elasticity.</li>
            <li>People are commenting on how great my skin looks, which is really nice because I&#x27;m in my 50s.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I loved it, so</li>
            <li>The case is excellent for travelling, it is light weight and feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li>This is very nice, it comes in its own case.  </li>
            <li>Great product and the size is perfect, the first use a couple of the bristles came off on my face while using it</li>
            <li>I am 40 and having a great exfoliater is where it&#x27;s at on fighting fine lines!</li>
            <li>This is a very nice set in a handy case, lightweight yet effective.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Also wash my face with it &amp; use it on my now more attractive nails....</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular but good for its price</li>
            <li>Oh well still loving my brush, it feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li>Love it !</li>
            <li>So no need to spend your money on more pricey brands!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>My skin looks really healthy!</li>
            <li>and you skin is healthy and refreshed!</li>
            <li>I love this SPA treatment system!  </li>
            <li>I like that it has so many attachments as well!</li>
            <li>But still ok!</li>
            <li>And still love this!</li>
            <li>I love this product !</li>
            <li>I used the buffer on my elbows and it worked like magic!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I recommend you try it before deciding to spend $200 or more on a clarasonic!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and it works like magic!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better than that!  </li>
            <li>I love the purple color too!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did it!</li>
            <li>love this product !</li>
            <li>When I use this product my skin feels softer and more refreshed!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the container for storing it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I agree with that, but sometimes you get more!</li>
            <li>This was the best decision I have made for my skin, this product is worth much more than I paid, I stick by the product and really am happy with the way the scrub leaves my face very clean, it goes way under the pores and leaves my skin radiant with its buffer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept with all the brushes and would be fine if it weren&#x27;t so underpowered.</li>
            <li>The feet buffer is amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin feels amazing after I use this on my face.</li>
            <li>Runs great, Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>When I consider the price, the available replacement brushes and ease of use -- this is a great value.</li>
            <li>I purchased one from a store and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li>The case is nice everything stays in place</li>
            <li>It is a nice product for the value.  </li>
            <li>I keep mine handy</li>
            <li>Says the sponge attachment was nice.</li>
            <li>It is great for exfoliating her skin and making it feel nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>The pumice attachment is also nice.  </li>
            <li>The nail brush is nice and smooths the nails well.  </li>
            <li>I got a great price on this product and it really works great.  </li>
            <li>just as effective.</li>
            <li>but maybe if you like face massages this could be nice for</li>
            <li>I bought these as gifts, everyone thrilled</li>
            <li>It has a nice massaging feeling-</li>
            <li>It has two settings which is also nice.</li>
            <li>, however make sure you use good batteries.</li>
            <li>This is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Great item for keeping your face clean and taken care as well as coming in a nice travel case.</li>
            <li>It is so worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>but I was happy with how clean my face was.</li>
            <li>Although I had an issue with the seller it was quickly resolved to my satisfaction, great customer service.  </li>
            <li>it works great and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries quick.  </li>
            <li>She is delighted with the BrightLeafs 4 in 1 and says it is the best thing she has in her personal cleansing</li>
            <li>I loved the 2 speed setting &amp; the strong bristles on the face brush.</li>
            <li>This was perfect for my 13 year old daughter!</li>
            <li>Very good my wife really likes the way It works on her face.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly how it was described and works great.</li>
            <li>its very light.</li>
            <li>and I like the fact it is batterey operated, the handy travel case makes it easy for me to travel with</li>
            <li>delivered quickly and was as advertised at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this item would work.</li>
            <li>I could scrub my face better with a washcloth.</li>
            <li>I love this product and use it eveyday.  </li>
            <li>We love ours.</li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>and I was pleased with it when I saw it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>It washes my face so much better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t break me out :)</li>
            <li>I was amazed even more by that.</li>
            <li>It does work better when your feet are damp.  </li>
            <li>but I use it for my nails more than anything.  </li>
            <li>i love these electric cleaners.</li>
            <li>For the price its ok.</li>
            <li>I thought this item would have been better based on the reviews</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>.. will wait to save money and buy a Clarasonic :)</li>
            <li>My face is smoother, clearer, and looks much better.</li>
            <li>Sure, it rotates at that speed, but as soon as you touch anything the spinning stops.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it though.</li>
            <li>It sure is Petite and Cute.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t go pay any more for one, this one does everything you need it for.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I hope it works as well as most of the reviews state.</li>
            <li>I guess that I should have paid more attention to the specification about it&#x27;s size instead of trying to go off of the picture.  </li>
            <li>The brush maybe ok for scrubbing some soap onto your face.  </li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>make sure my face is damp before I begin using the device.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and if you think of getting it go for it :)</li>
            <li>Having a system that uses batteries is more convenient than having a charger sitting on my counter taking up space.</li>
            <li>Face feels cleaner, love attachment variety.  </li>
            <li>Glad</li>
            <li>I found and find the product an outstanding value with a 100% rate of performance as stated.  </li>
            <li>It was a great price and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I love this kit.  </li>
            <li>Do not use it under running water and it will be OK.  </li>
            <li>Better than a Clarasonic.  </li>
            <li>Brite Leafs 4-in-1 Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System, was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have one more attachment--a smooth nail buffer to make the nails shine--</li>
            <li>So I guess it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>I used my favorite make up remover gel</li>
            <li>Just love this product</li>
            <li>One is for a deeper scrub and I like being able to have both options.  </li>
            <li>I am entirely satisfied with all aspects of this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>However it is a okay starter brush.</li>
            <li>Does a better job than this does.  </li>
            <li>Love it love it love it.  </li>
            <li>If I had the money I would love to buy it for all of my family for stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li>Would be better to pay more and get something better that could do the job.</li>
            <li>but I think I will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li>A wash-cloth,&lt;br /&gt;which can be put in the cloth-washer, is more sanitary than this electric scrubber&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I know they are better products out there</li>
            <li>The one I use the most is the head with the bristles.</li>
            <li>it is ok</li>
            <li>This item is better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I had hoped but good</li>
            <li>I mostly used the brush for use in exfoliating my face.</li>
            <li>so I was pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>They love working with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I have a PedEgg that works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My  husband was able do repair it, but I feel it should have lasted longer for the price.</li>
            <li>My skin feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>For $25 this product more than did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li>My feet r so smooth!</li>
            <li>great product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has a case to carry it all</li>
            <li>Great product at a reasonable price / A+++</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>BriteLeafs 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System (BL-802) is simply awesome.</li>
            <li>Really glad I took it with me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased with this product...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the pumice or nail brush yet, but I love how the face sponge, and face brush feels on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find this one on Amazon....</li>
            <li>but I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it to lock in place.  </li>
            <li>Even though I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to lock in, the brush stays on while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Works just as well as something that would cost much more.</li>
            <li>This is amazing and such a good price!</li>
            <li>,my face is so much cleaner way better than a wash rag,I work in a machine shop with oil everywhere this cleans!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited about my purchase &amp; immediately started using it.</li>
            <li>Nice carrying case, several attachments and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be more powerful but it still works and makes my skin feel really good and smooth after i use it.</li>
            <li>I bought this a year ago, and I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>For what it is, and for those who know how to use it, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>So far I am very happy with this, the facial scrub is very nice</li>
            <li>The speed of the massager with a new battery is great.  </li>
            <li>loved it a lot it cleans the face and keep it smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>This is a very good facial cleansing brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>and I really appreciate a company that still understands good business.  </li>
            <li>Good power but gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li>The sponge is much more friendly for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a good buy!!!</li>
            <li>Too cool!</li>
            <li>I found its easy for me to travel with</li>
            <li>Did make my face feel clean, love putting on my face lotion with it.</li>
            <li>The case easily broke.</li>
            <li>So, I bought this because of the price and the easy removed attachments.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is compact, has a compact container, and easily used for traveling.  </li>
            <li>The easy attachments comes on and off without any problem.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to store.</li>
            <li>One thing I can say for sure is that my face is absolutely clean now.</li>
            <li>ok, i would recommand it for others to clean your face and feet</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li>The power is fine, easy to handle</li>
            <li>and this one is hands down the best ever.  </li>
            <li>this one works just fine</li>
            <li>the pumice stone attachment went on fine, didnt snap though but didnt fall off either.</li>
            <li>But I thing is fine, for now thank you.</li>
            <li>but it works fine</li>
            <li>but this works just fine.</li>
            <li>I use the sponge and the brush for my face which works fine</li>
            <li>I emailed the vendor and without delay they replaced the brush which works fine.  </li>
            <li>Product is fine, you got what you paid for.</li>
            <li>The gentle meaage is surely doing wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li>Awesome little set for $20.</li>
            <li>This compact little device is wonderful</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, the materials used to construct this product are ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li>Great product for a low price!  </li>
            <li>Not only that it&#x27;s a great buy for the price.  </li>
            <li>The customer service from &amp;#34;Jeff&amp;#34; was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap when you use</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so smooth and has helped not to have blemishes.</li>
            <li>Thank You for a smooth purchase.</li>
            <li>This item is cheap.</li>
            <li>cause it was cheap</li>
            <li>makes my face really smooth</li>
            <li>I was considering Proactive just to get the free brush, but decided to look online just for the brush when I found this one.  </li>
            <li>This thing will almost fit into the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li>The device is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>Using it on the face leaves your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li>But to be honest, that didn&#x27;t prove to be too much of an issue.</li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Its cheap and it</li>
            <li>The more often its used the better and more clear</li>
            <li>CHEAP...</li>
            <li>CHEAP...</li>
            <li>CHEAP.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li>Would not recommend this item even if it was free.</li>
            <li>Yes, it looks and feels a bit cheap, but whats important is that it does what it is meant to do which</li>
            <li>This facial massage is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It wasnt worth it, I bought one for CVS that was a better quality.</li>
            <li>Please, It&#x27;s worth every penny:)</li>
            <li>It is rather cheaply made</li>
            <li>, it has two speeds and the multiple heads are great.</li>
            <li>She loves it, it cleans wonderfully, and has held up for everyday use for a year.&lt;br /&gt;glenda</li>
            <li>This is really tiny lol.</li>
            <li>it is cheaply made but has worked without any malfunctions so far.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li>Stick to light chemical peels or see a esthetician for something stronger.</li>
            <li>I like the two speeds and the light weight of the handle.  </li>
            <li>Good product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>The product is exactly as advertised and exactly what I needed at a good price for a product that I had never tried before.</li>
            <li>I had one from Avon for many years, loved it, but it finally wore out, and I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement ever since.</li>
            <li>Its a good product and value for money, the speed of the motor gives sufficient cleansing and brushing action on the skin</li>
            <li>This product is very powerful for its size.</li>
            <li>Since this is run on batteries, I guess I should have known that it wouldn&#x27;t be very powerful.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Episonic is $189.00 but groupon has it available for $59.99 right now!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try out this item, I wanted to see if using an electric brush would help improve my sin any verses using a washcloth or my hands.</li>
            <li>works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Rather then the original that cost over $200</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for callus control.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I am impressed with this product despite the fact that it looks cheap and I had a hard time getting the brush to stay.</li>
            <li>When I recieved it I did not expect this to clean so well for the cheaper price.</li>
            <li>clean my makeup off my face before using this device in order to keep the brush head cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin with a clean look and feel.  </li>
            <li>It truly has a clean feeling after each use.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like it does remove all make up and dirt leaving my skin feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>The system has many different tips and it comes in a nice compact case to travel with.</li>
            <li>It has a powerful water jet stream and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>And super cheaply made.</li>
            <li>The price is right!</li>
            <li>I love the product ,it&#x27;s pretty powerful compared to others I bought now</li>
            <li>The additional attachments are great for rough skin on your heels or buffing nails.</li>
            <li>worked very well love the 2 speeds</li>
            <li>The brush falls off the handle, not waterproof, but I guess for the money, can&#x27;t really ask for more.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>She wants 6 more just in case one Breaks.</li>
            <li>i really only use the scrubber but its good for the price</li>
            <li>My acne is still here and there sometimes, but my skin looks so much better that it doesn&#x27;t even seem to hurt my appearance as much as it would have before.</li>
            <li>I have used this on the stronger setting most of the time as the lower setting doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  </li>
            <li>The 4 attachments makes it very versatile for many uses.  </li>
            <li>I am very satified with how the product performs and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, he absolutely loves loves using it.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed...it suppose to be electric but is batery operated.&lt;br /&gt;They want me to write more</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a fresh &amp; clean feel!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: I am pleased to say that US Advanced Healthcare immediately sent me out a replacement unit after my review and so far that one is working!</li>
            <li>Good, good, although my elderly electric facial product still works and the brushes from the new on can&#x27;t be transferred to the older model.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a cheaper option to other at home exfoliation options, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li>This product is pure garbage !!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean .</li>
            <li>The attachments don&#x27;t want to stay on, but if you put your cleaner on first the put your insert in it;s fine.  </li>
            <li>I used the brush and sponge after a shower and they left my skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adequate for the a quick leaning.  </li>
            <li>It does the job when we are in a hurry and need a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of deeply cleaning my skin, and it makes it much easier to apply my moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.....</li>
            <li>It ISN&#x27;T waterproof, so that&#x27;s the only downside, but it really does a great job on cleaning my face</li>
            <li>very satisfied I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li>Personally I just use the soft brush with a gentle foaming cleanser and it is just perfect.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I did not try the unit, because the cheap lightweight plastic was enough to tell me that it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.  </li>
            <li>and this makes it super easy and fast.</li>
            <li>what to say its a very hight quality product it makes your face as a baby skin , easy to use at home</li>
            <li>Product arrived in a good time and is exactly the same as the picture.</li>
            <li>it easy to use and very convince and can carry it anywhere.</li>
            <li>The brush was fine (though not as pictured), however the pumice stone and sponge were quite ineffective and went largely unused.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am extremely pleased!</li>
            <li>Turns out, this works pretty well!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this one little gaget saves me from having to pack more in an over night bag!</li>
            <li>How can it possibly get better than that!</li>
            <li>and I have very smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li>It most definitely isn&#x27;t waterproof, and I could tell right away it was easy to break.</li>
            <li>it self does not scrach my face, so guys if you live like i do its worth it!!</li>
            <li>Received this today...was excited with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Left face feeling amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is only $15 and an amazing dupe.</li>
            <li>This brush is great, not too rough, though cleans the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used all the components yet but was happy to find a round for my nails and feet.</li>
            <li>Made face washing for my daughter so much fun and easier.</li>
            <li>but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>Both levels honestly feel the same.</li>
            <li>The immediate results are worth</li>
            <li>Cheaper than a spa facial, plus I can use my own product that I know</li>
            <li>powerful and was the strength i was hoping</li>
            <li>I have not tried the nail buffer yet and the sponge doesn&#x27;t seem useful to me.  </li>
            <li>I rather have spent more for something better...</li>
            <li>I also got a similar machine from Conair and the Conair one is not as nice as this one by BriteLeafs.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>powerful at all&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>it works far better than a wash cloth or my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Product had useful attachments, but it did not run when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The cleansing brush makes my face feel fresh and stimulated.  </li>
            <li>Nice product for facial or foot use</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the hastle of trying to return it, so I lost the $20 plus it cost me.</li>
            <li>It was worth the money.</li>
            <li>after a few days of using it I did see a difference - my acne scars were fading, I wasn&#x27;t breaking out any more at all (which is unusual to me), and my skin was just overall glowing - even my best friend noticed.</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 star is because the brush attachment appears to wearing out sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest a more firmer bristles or maybe have a soft one and a firmer one included.  </li>
            <li>She said that it works as intended and liked the fact that it came with different attachments.</li>
            <li>The product is not as powerful as i hoped it would be</li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>but the callus stone and nail buffers don&#x27;t have enough power to be effective.  </li>
            <li>This was well worth the money</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hardly worth it, just the slightest pressure and the motor stops.  </li>
            <li>This has lead to a semi changed smile and visible lines.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it is not the same quality as the more expensive ones, but for what I needed, right now, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>This is not waterproof but because of the 4 batteries it still works better than most of the other products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this and has many uses other then</li>
            <li>Mine broke pretty quickly after I received it.</li>
            <li>I love it as I feel my skin extremely clean after wash &amp; massage, I use it daily &amp;</li>
            <li>I have to say that this product is a good one , but it should be able to go under water because usually its much easier to use it during the shower</li>
            <li>I see an esthetician who told me a spin brush is a spin brush, all work as good at the other.</li>
            <li>The other applications are just as good too.  </li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped one of the attachments on the floor and right away the brush peeled off from the plastic.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right size and and it has no cord, so you can get to every area of your body.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for something like this for a while and realized that right now, I didn&#x27;t want to spend some 200 dollars on something trivial</li>
            <li>I get regular facial massages about twice a month; but it is nice to know that I can take care of my facial skin each morning with out great fuss.</li>
            <li>but you can always spend a little more for something better.</li>
            <li>This product is a wonderful little skin facial cleaning system.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice little case that holds the attachments securely and will travel well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>works great, as well as more expensive one</li>
            <li>The facial brush and sponge are both gentle but effective.  </li>
            <li>For those purposes, it is adequate, but I would not put too much stake in getting any benefit from the pumice attachments.</li>
            <li>I really like that this comes in it&#x27;s own travel case and has multiple brush heads.</li>
            <li>It was pretty cheap, and honestly I dont think any of the super expensive ones would do any better job.</li>
            <li>very cheap for a reason, broke instantly after two uses....</li>
            <li>Its very gentle.</li>
            <li>This little machine is really good-</li>
            <li>I will spend more money on a different product eventually.</li>
            <li>When I first used the product, I selected the bristle brush for my face.</li>
            <li>Skin felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used the foot pumus stone for the first time today, and I have to say,</li>
            <li>i first took it out of its plastic storage container</li>
            <li>oh wow, that&#x27;s incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li>I tried several batteries to make sure that the lack of \\&quot;workage\\&quot; was the brush system.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>You will be pleased with the results instantly.</li>
            <li>My husband used it after he had applied sun screen&lt;br /&gt;Through out the day, and he said he felt the refreshing feel it left after first use.</li>
            <li>First of all, do not expect a $20.00 to perform like a $200.00 product.</li>
            <li>It really exfolliates my face!</li>
            <li>I love this facial brush</li>
            <li>The facial cleansing is okay as well, but I think I need a different brush size in order to have better results.</li>
            <li>I was able to do the job with properly cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>When I first started it up it sounded like it was struggling to spin</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this first.</li>
            <li>I turned it on away from my face and hair first to make sure the brush was spinning properly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>The pumice attachment broke on the first use</li>
            <li>However, I will invest the money in a better product next time.</li>
            <li>This came exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it hurt a bit.</li>
            <li>Love the facial exfoliator</li>
            <li>Love that it has several accessory heads that come with it.  </li>
            <li>Will buy more products in the future.</li>
            <li>This cleansing and exfoliating brush system is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love BRITELEAFS facial and body scrubber.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of the facial brush and sponge!</li>
            <li>Make sure to have double A batteries ready as this does not come with batteries ; you are going to want to experience this treasure the moment you get it!</li>
            <li>During my first use i scratched my face twice</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li>Thanks !  </li>
            <li>I bought the best batteries I could, and it was really sad</li>
            <li>The case and the unit are pretty and it does work, just not as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I love my BriteLeafs Face cleaner \\&quot;system\\&quot;... but only after my husband \\&quot;fixed\\</li>
            <li>I use it for about 2 minutes at a time, making sure I get my entire face, and neck as well.</li>
            <li>you are looking for a face cleaning system that will increase skin elasticity and has better facial product absorption - then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and it so easy yo take care of and I just love how my face feels when I finishes cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>The set looks kind weak but it is actually ok...</li>
            <li>This little gadget really works good on your skin .  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>i guess i just needed something to clean my pores so its doing the job so far.</li>
            <li>Fast and not time consuming, safe to use daily.</li>
            <li>This brush is ok for its price, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough to get to really like it.</li>
            <li>I really liked my electric cleaning system and I have only used one brush so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to get a few for my nieces…since they were most interested in mine!!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for something that will clean and exfoliate from head to toe!</li>
            <li>After reading all the stellar reviews I was very dissapointed when I used the cleaning system.</li>
            <li>It cleans my face pretty well, and it even comes with its own little case so I can take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li>it kind of stops, and the high speed I can&#x27;t use everyday because it makes my face feel kind of dry.</li>
            <li>First one rusted out, ordered another, will be more careful and hang it in front of bathroom fan after use.</li>
            <li>mostly use the facial brush attachment to deep clean my pores...</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep it dry as its not water proof.</li>
            <li>i pick this because of the price it turned out to be a good product for my facial needs i would highly recommend to anyone who needs a deep cleaning facial.after one use there was improvement in texture and look my skin was softer and clearer instantly!GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li>and the contact is too large and the battery does not make contact, so it does not work.</li>
            <li>Large assortment of attachment heads.  </li>
            <li>and I was certain that it wasn&#x27;t going to do anything</li>
            <li>Again, in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is a certain \\&quot;cheapness\\&quot; about this product.  </li>
            <li>The brush dosen&#x27;t irritate your skin and it is a smart buy for the performance and price.</li>
            <li>I love that it came in a nice small compact case with multiple attachments if you so desire.</li>
            <li>Its the only nail device I&#x27;ve been able to use on my LhasaTzu, who has Very Sensitive Hearing...</li>
            <li>it was fine until it broke 3 months later.</li>
            <li>Great little facial scrub brush for the price.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like reviewing anything, but I will when the product is not up to par.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think this would be a problem, but it really is.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li>And I feel much cleaner after use it.</li>
            <li>My daughter really enjoys using this item.  </li>
            <li>and it work very well for me.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>You can see that is really cleans the pours out.</li>
            <li>It takes two AA batteries and is a bit loud but is worth it and is compact.</li>
            <li>The brushes don&#x27;t really attach on, they fall off when you lean the device downward.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this item</li>
            <li>but I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>Compared to similair products that cost twice as much</li>
            <li>I think this item is a real steal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product for the cleaning aspect and nail filing uses.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Sponge attachment very soothing to face.  </li>
            <li>I received my product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleansing feeling.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to massage my face gently and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>Gently move in circles over whole face,  than rinse and your done.  </li>
            <li>and it really cleaned all the make-up off my face.</li>
            <li>even the brush on high setting does not irritate my skin!  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend wants to steal it for his feet.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the nail file attachment</li>
            <li>I wasnt ready to pay $100 for the name brand</li>
            <li>Cleans very well</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about</li>
            <li>The newer one is stronger and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well while it lasted.</li>
            <li>Both worked very well</li>
            <li>In the end I like how compact it is, as it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my cabinets.</li>
            <li>I Haven&#x27;t had  the time to really try all the functions out.</li>
            <li>I must say that the seller was very concerned about my problem and promptly offered a replacement or refund.</li>
            <li>The nail buffer pad didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything either.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>The disappointment of using batteries and not being able to plug the spa into an outlet diminished when she saw how powerful and effective this spa was.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much nicer than the one I bought from Oley.</li>
            <li>Ironic.</li>
            <li>It CAN be done, and it can be done at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pores minimized with this gentle cleaning process.  </li>
            <li>Worked good for awhile, then noticed red veins forming on face that don&#x27;t go away, should have sticked with having acne because its not permenetly scaring, way too rough to use on the face</li>
            <li>looking for a different kind of facial brush.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>The two attachments for face are really good, the one for nails is ok, the one for your foot is completely useless!</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the facial massage brush stays on during use all the time and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I was soooo excited about this facial brush until I got ready to turn it on</li>
            <li>As long as your not clumsy with it and your not using it in the shower, you&#x27;re golden!!</li>
            <li>No need to go any further for a budget friendly spa experience.</li>
            <li>Something small and lightweight that can be tucked away in a carry on bag but still powerful enough to do a good job.  </li>
            <li>, just helps your skin to clean deeply.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t always give me a deep clean</li>
            <li>It works a lot better if your feet have been soaked for a few min first.</li>
            <li>I especially like the pink file; it really helps my nails to stop splitting and grow long and beautiful.</li>
            <li>final thought is do not expect too much from this device but it is a good way to prepare your skin for a more expensive device.</li>
            <li>I have previously owned two facial brushes and loved them.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made my face dry, just really soft :)</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed how soft and radiant my skin looked.</li>
            <li>My face feels so much softer, and my acne is slowly diminishing, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>right on par with the &#x27;&#x27;major brand&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try something new!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rate it even less if I were able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a low cost alternative to some of the more costly facial and body brush spa cleaning systems.</li>
            <li>feel confident that my skin is getting the deep cleaning that is essential.</li>
            <li>Even the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used before didn&#x27;t offer anything better.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a super glue to put it back together.</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve said that, this product is decent for the money.</li>
            <li>I ordered this a while back but just started using it more regularly.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re mainly buying this to use on your face, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>but I was very pleasantly proved wrong!</li>
            <li>Highly recommanded.</li>
            <li>turned it on high.</li>
            <li>it was highly recommeded to buy.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this before &amp;#34;investing&amp;#34; in a high end brush.</li>
            <li>used the pumice stone attachment, even on the high speed</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Could be a little stronger but made face feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin) to deep clean my pores.  </li>
            <li>Even though the brush is a bit hard, but 4 in 1 Electric Facial... is very useful and very cheap.  </li>
            <li>but it is a pretty cheap little device.</li>
            <li>I need a gentle way to exfoliate and smooth very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be just as effective as the more expensive facial cleansing tools.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this.  </li>
            <li>This is a cute and small electric brush but very affective.</li>
            <li>The foot brush is probably the least effective but does smooth out some of the rough spots.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t even worth the headache of trying to send it back</li>
            <li>My co-worker actually asked me that following day what I had done differently that morning because my face looked really nice.</li>
            <li>I want to love this, but it broke apart in the shower after a few days</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my sensitive skin yet strong enough to exfoliat my skin.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this same brush for several years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>I really only use the bristle brush, as the other ones don&#x27;t do much without more power.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rough enough to clean anything</li>
            <li>But I used it the next day with a different method and it was fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is comparable to my older electric cleaner, slightly better because i like the small size and weight of it.</li>
            <li>However, the motor and power source are so weak, it can only be effective on the most sensitive areas of skin, such as face and neck.</li>
            <li>brush bristles could have been a little more soft, sometimes it hurts the skin</li>
            <li>then it requires new battery.</li>
            <li>The product arrived, and I put new batteries in.  </li>
            <li>used 3 times a week even with new batteries it would not turn on anymore.</li>
            <li>so I need a new one.</li>
            <li>I can live with this and maybe, as customer service says, it will eventually click.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I will write a new review in about one or two weeks.</li>
            <li>It also is not that powerful, the medium speed has a hard time going unless you just lightly touch it to your skin.</li>
            <li>In short, I enjoy using this product daily and have shared this fact with family.  </li>
            <li>The product is more compact that I expected, and comes with a plastic case similar to a glasses case to keep everything together.</li>
            <li>I got this because I had super dry skin for a while and was trying to buff it off.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have much power, but then again I think I was expecting something similar to a buffing wheel for a car.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it religiously and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>facial scrubber is very gentle</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The second one seemed new and has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen and used similar items that were much more expensive that don&#x27;t work any better.  </li>
            <li>This company saw my post and is sending me a replacement brush for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It barely spins, it really seems like there&#x27;s no point in using it at all.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>This was somewhat cheap and not worth the money.</li>
            <li>I originally got it to just help with exfoliation, but after reading reviews I decided to use it everynight with regular facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>The brush bristles is starting to fold in the middle and most likely I may have to get another replacement soon.  </li>
            <li>Also, I have a moderate acne problem and when I first started using the brush it did irratate</li>
            <li>I found that this product works well for me and the price is better than other similar products.</li>
            <li>I am planning on using it tomorrow, but it is exactly what I thought it was and have used something similar</li>
            <li>If you are using it for the first time, I suggest you start with low speed.</li>
            <li>(I usually only use it for face), my pores are noticeably smaller and my face feels so fresh after using it!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night and this morning</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>This thing works and its better than buying those more expensive ones when it does the same thing.</li>
            <li>This product works but simply does not have much power even on the high setting and with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this power facial scrubber - it was very highly rated.</li>
            <li>She has had hand surgery and had problems that didn&#x27;t allow her to grip sponges and other things to clean her face.</li>
            <li>I always used it on the high setting because the low one didn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much.</li>
            <li>She noticed the same results on her other body parts and liked the different attachments.  </li>
            <li>And like the other reviewers be careful when placing your facial wash on the brush, because it can fly everywhere, so what I do is put my facial wash on my face and then scrub from there.</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little nicer because of the description, but this one works fine.</li>
            <li>If your looking for one of these facial polishers, you could pay more for less . . .</li>
            <li>Also, the brush only spins in one direction, so skin gets pulled and hair is easily tangled and mixed into your facial products.</li>
            <li>Then I use the facial sponge attachment to put lotion on my face, leaves my face feeling clean and soft and helps with minor acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comes with a lovely translucent hard carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got this to help clear up Acne, and I don&#x27;t think it made a difference in my Acne at all</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not fast enough to really smooth out any calluses on your feet.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is not as soft as a lady&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>This irritated my 60 yr old skin when I used it on my face..</li>
            <li>I really like the extra cleaning it does for my face.  </li>
            <li>I really like the additional components that are included like the porous stone used for your feet and the facial scrub device.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only wish it was just the brush as I don&#x27;t use the others much</li>
            <li>It is soft on your face and the kit comes with instructions.</li>
            <li>Just a note of caution when using it near your eyes.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 of these one for myself and my 14 year old both</li>
            <li>My complexion looks clearer and my skin feels so soft after I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
            <li>Altogether, I didn&#x27;t get that much out of the brush and it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t surprised by that.</li>
            <li>change the brush into the buffing sponge and apply my moisturizer directly to the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>skin is extremely soft</li>
            <li>The BriteLeafs body brush and soft sponge did the trick.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and so refreshed.</li>
            <li>and I really like that there are multiple attachments.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it deep in but is still gentle.</li>
            <li>I really like having four different applicators.</li>
            <li>it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how affordable this was and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft and looks radiant after.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel harsher and the motor doesn&#x27;t have near the level of power of the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel so smooth and silky getting off all that dead skin.  </li>
            <li>A skin brightening daily scrub, for exfoliation, is a much better&lt;br /&gt;way of cleaning your face.</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin this may hurt you a bit.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s reasonable for the low price.</li>
            <li>When I use this it makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li>but I do know that any gentle massage on my face with stimulate the facial muscles.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use on my 3 year old feet, but it doesn&#x27;t work, it stops all the time.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old, acne prone, and it helped to clear my skin.  </li>
            <li>Made in China made my decision to return it complete.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks much clearer once I started using a facial brush.</li>
            <li>I paid twice as much for mine, and it only has one brush.</li>
            <li>His has four attachments: soft sponge, soft brush, pumice, and a nail polisher.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how surprised I was at some of the prices out there.  </li>
            <li>Also LOVE the pumice for removing all the gross dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t had any new major breakouts.</li>
            <li>I used the soap I usually use on the scrubbing pad (low setting) and the moisturizer I usually use with the sponge (on high setting), and the results have been great.</li>
            <li>This of course leads to more breakouts if you are unable to clean your skin properly.</li>
            <li>The seller sent me a new pumice rock and free new small brush when I wrote them and asked for it!  </li>
            <li>The nail file attachment is useful for taking off sharp edges, and I have found the pumice works if you follow the directions that come with it.</li>
            <li>It works very well; needless to say, my facial texture feels super smooth after one use.</li>
            <li>This is really more like a toy than a serious beauty and health product.  </li>
            <li>I have used a facial brush in the past which was more than twice the size of this.  </li>
            <li>Could be little bigger for the price also, the machine no sons to strong.</li>
            <li>I used my cream facial cleanser, with the machine on high.</li>
            <li>get ripped off and purchase one of those high dollar ones when this one does the same thing.</li>
            <li>have used the high speed and the low speed and each works as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it with a facial scrub (even on high power it has never scratched my skin</li>
            <li>It appears small and cheaply made online.</li>
            <li>This was the primary reason I wanted this device since I expected it to allow me to keep my feet salon soft with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>Buffed put lotion on abd my elbows are back to normal .</li>
            <li>At first it seems like the surface area of the heads is too small, but they are actually just right.</li>
            <li>Expected a little more</li>
            <li>My nails split easily and are hard to grow BriteLeafs</li>
            <li>facial buff may be low-tech, but it never broke and never needed new batteries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to open it up and fix it, hit it a few times lightly and still will not turn.</li>
            <li>The bristles no the face brush aren&#x27;t as firm as I expected, it will need to be replaced many times.</li>
            <li>but I love the color that it comes in a soft plum Dusty plum.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li>but I actually disagree completely!</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; but the batter runs out quickly, or it&#x27;s just not powerful enough regardless of battery quality.  </li>
            <li>The low speed is useless and high works okay as long as you don&#x27;t apply any pressure, which will cause it to completely stop if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;BriteLeads 4-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush&amp;#34; ultimately won in my search of an exfoliating brush because of its simple design, affordability, and mostly positive reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I thought that I was going to be getting a large head brush, about as big as a back scrubber&#x27;s head, that I could use as a power brush to scrub my back with.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that when I received this product, the motor was very slow but without even asking, the company was nice enough to send me a second one</li>
            <li>I do the slower speed for general cleaning and then use the faster setting over my problem areas where i&#x27;ve been getting acne, and its helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Totally soft facial scrubber.</li>
            <li>So far I have only used the brush and the sponge.</li>
            <li>The product offers several options, rather than just cleansing the face, which I have done.</li>
            <li>but i spent to much time with it on my face and the brissels</li>
            <li>You can only use it for your face and so far it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me.</li>
            <li>The facial brush is not at all soft</li>
            <li>I found that my acne decreased and my face looks much better.</li>
            <li>They should have included an ac adapter to help the brush move faster, (for those who want more power behind the brush).  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s how it works: Get the brush attachment wet, snap it into the hand-held part, wet your face and apply a light amount of facial cleanser, turn it on, and rub the moist spinning brush part over your skin.</li>
            <li>but other then that it cleans very well</li>
            <li>I also had a hard time to clean the sponge after one use</li>
            <li>Are there any other interchangeable attachments readily sold elsewhere to add to this kit of brushes and attachments?</li>
            <li>My face is sensitive and the brush was a little bit much for me.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this fun little kit for my face.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t bother with the overpriced ones,  this little facial scrubber is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>If I am starting to break out, I&#x27;ll use the brush for a day or two and usually my skin starts to clear up right away.</li>
            <li>At first I did not use it every day because it dried my face out a little, but now I am using it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>So be careful when you are using it and don&#x27;t overdo it on the high setting like I did.</li>
            <li>The brush is not as soft as some other brushes but doesn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin which is really sensitive.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how it will work in the long run but it was worth the money so far.</li>
            <li>First shipment stopped working after a few days.</li>
            <li>I found the spinning would bog down at the slightest amount of resistance no matter how much cleanser and water I used on my face.</li>
            <li>At first I was skeptical because it cost so much less than most others.  </li>
            <li>On the first use, and only after a little use the pumice rock fell off of the plastic part that it was attached to.  </li>
            <li>I wish though, that it came with extra facial brushes instead of the other 3 attachments, which really don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, turn the cleaner off, take the head out (takes a small amount of effort), clean the brush head well, and store someplace it can dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am seeing a lot of positive and negative feedback on this, but I can only assume the positives are coming from new users of face products.  </li>
            <li>The other day I used it on the low setting, then the high, and I got a cut on my face.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is very small, the brush is small and soft, and very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>The battery operated motor it little more than a toy so that if you press too hard on your skin it will stop moving.</li>
            <li>I agree with other uses that it is not super powerful-</li>
            <li>So this item is used for face and body cleansing, buffing, and polishing; however, the directiosn clearly state that it should not get wet.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;Overall, a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Anyway, its a good starter kit, but I may as well trash it.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Good for men and teenagers.</li>
            <li> This works great for blemishes of any kind.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> after i used this product i loved it</li>
            <li> and now they loved it.</li>
            <li> it does a good job of stimulating the skin and is convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> I just used the nail buffer to give myself a manicure, and it&#x27;d did a good job.  </li>
            <li> worked good for about a week then stopped working .</li>
            <li> my wife loved it ...</li>
            <li> Finished with a good moistizer and done.</li>
            <li> For the price point, this is actually a really good product.</li>
            <li> They both feel good and do a good job.  </li>
            <li> This product was received in good time and functioned as promised.</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> but I will probably still be using this from time to time - just because it feels good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried the Clarisonic and loved it.</li>
            <li> This brush is probably just as good as those</li>
            <li> We use it primarily to stimulate collagen production and it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Does a good job.</li>
            <li> Good price my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> but it still was a good product.</li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>
            <li> Good all in one for the price</li>
            <li> and she really loved it.</li>
            <li> so I invested in this exfoliating brush and a good exfoliator scrub and the two together once or twice a week</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product would be good for exfoliating, but I gave it a chance for the price.</li>
            <li> and I was delighted with the speed in which the vendor addressed my issue.</li>
            <li> and they have good customer service.  </li>
            <li> Just as advertised / Good Seller ?</li>
            <li> I also have the good (but pricy) version of this brush, so for that reason, when I use this one, I feel as if I am using a child&#x27;s toy.  </li>
            <li> It &#x27;s good on cleaning your skin and pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 with good collagen and elasticity.</li>
            <li> People are commenting on how great my skin looks, which is really nice because I&#x27;m in my 50s.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I loved it, so</li>
            <li> The case is excellent for travelling, it is light weight and feels good in your hand.  </li>
            <li> This is very nice, it comes in its own case.  </li>
            <li> Great product and the size is perfect, the first use a couple of the bristles came off on my face while using it</li>
            <li> I am 40 and having a great exfoliater is where it&#x27;s at on fighting fine lines!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set in a handy case, lightweight yet effective.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Also wash my face with it &amp; use it on my now more attractive nails....</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular but good for its price</li>
            <li> Oh well still loving my brush, it feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> So no need to spend your money on more pricey brands!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> My skin looks really healthy!</li>
            <li> and you skin is healthy and refreshed!</li>
            <li> I love this SPA treatment system!  </li>
            <li> I like that it has so many attachments as well!</li>
            <li> But still ok!</li>
            <li> And still love this!</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> I used the buffer on my elbows and it worked like magic!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I recommend you try it before deciding to spend $200 or more on a clarasonic!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and it works like magic!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for better than that!  </li>
            <li> I love the purple color too!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did it!</li>
            <li> love this product !</li>
            <li> When I use this product my skin feels softer and more refreshed!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the container for storing it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I agree with that, but sometimes you get more!</li>
            <li> This was the best decision I have made for my skin, this product is worth much more than I paid, I stick by the product and really am happy with the way the scrub leaves my face very clean, it goes way under the pores and leaves my skin radiant with its buffer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great concept with all the brushes and would be fine if it weren&#x27;t so underpowered.</li>
            <li> The feet buffer is amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after I use this on my face.</li>
            <li> Runs great, Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> When I consider the price, the available replacement brushes and ease of use -- this is a great value.</li>
            <li> I purchased one from a store and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as nice as this one.  </li>
            <li> The case is nice everything stays in place</li>
            <li> It is a nice product for the value.  </li>
            <li> I keep mine handy</li>
            <li> Says the sponge attachment was nice.</li>
            <li> It is great for exfoliating her skin and making it feel nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> The pumice attachment is also nice.  </li>
            <li> The nail brush is nice and smooths the nails well.  </li>
            <li> I got a great price on this product and it really works great.  </li>
            <li> just as effective.</li>
            <li> but maybe if you like face massages this could be nice for</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts, everyone thrilled</li>
            <li> It has a nice massaging feeling-</li>
            <li> It has two settings which is also nice.</li>
            <li> , however make sure you use good batteries.</li>
            <li> This is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Great item for keeping your face clean and taken care as well as coming in a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> It is so worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> but I was happy with how clean my face was.</li>
            <li> Although I had an issue with the seller it was quickly resolved to my satisfaction, great customer service.  </li>
            <li> it works great and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries quick.  </li>
            <li> She is delighted with the BrightLeafs 4 in 1 and says it is the best thing she has in her personal cleansing</li>
            <li> I loved the 2 speed setting &amp; the strong bristles on the face brush.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for my 13 year old daughter!</li>

            <li> delivered quickly and was as advertised at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;have</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this item would work.</li>
            <li> I could scrub my face better with a washcloth.</li>

            <li> It washes my face so much better than a washcloth.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t break me out :)</li>
            <li> I was amazed even more by that.</li>
            <li> It does work better when your feet are damp.  </li>
            <li> but I use it for my nails more than anything.  </li>
            <li> i love these electric cleaners.</li>
            <li> For the price its ok.</li>
            <li> I thought this item would have been better based on the reviews</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> .. will wait to save money and buy a Clarasonic :)</li>
            <li> My face is smoother, clearer, and looks much better.</li>
            <li> Sure, it rotates at that speed, but as soon as you touch anything the spinning stops.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it though.</li>
            <li> It sure is Petite and Cute.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go pay any more for one, this one does everything you need it for.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I hope it works as well as most of the reviews state.</li>
            <li> I guess that I should have paid more attention to the specification about it&#x27;s size instead of trying to go off of the picture.  </li>
            <li> The brush maybe ok for scrubbing some soap onto your face.  </li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> make sure my face is damp before I begin using the device.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and if you think of getting it go for it :)</li>
            <li> Having a system that uses batteries is more convenient than having a charger sitting on my counter taking up space.</li>
            <li> Face feels cleaner, love attachment variety.  </li>
            <li> Glad</li>
            <li> I found and find the product an outstanding value with a 100% rate of performance as stated.  </li>
            <li> It was a great price and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  </li>
            <li> Do not use it under running water and it will be OK.  </li>
            <li> Better than a Clarasonic.  </li>
            <li> Brite Leafs 4-in-1 Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System, was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have one more attachment--a smooth nail buffer to make the nails shine--</li>
            <li> So I guess it&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> I used my favorite make up remover gel</li>
            <li> Just love this product</li>
            <li> One is for a deeper scrub and I like being able to have both options.  </li>
            <li> I am entirely satisfied with all aspects of this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> However it is a okay starter brush.</li>
            <li> Does a better job than this does.  </li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.  </li>
            <li> If I had the money I would love to buy it for all of my family for stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li> Would be better to pay more and get something better that could do the job.</li>
            <li> but I think I will be satisfied.  </li>
            <li> A wash-cloth,&lt;br /&gt;which can be put in the cloth-washer, is more sanitary than this electric scrubber&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I know they are better products out there</li>
            <li> The one I use the most is the head with the bristles.</li>
            <li> it is ok</li>
            <li> This item is better than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped but good</li>
            <li> I mostly used the brush for use in exfoliating my face.</li>
            <li> so I was pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> They love working with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I have a PedEgg that works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My  husband was able do repair it, but I feel it should have lasted longer for the price.</li>
            <li> My skin feels softer and more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> For $25 this product more than did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li> My feet r so smooth!</li>
            <li> great product, reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Love that it has a case to carry it all</li>
            <li> Great product at a reasonable price / A+++</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> BriteLeafs 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System (BL-802) is simply awesome.</li>
            <li> Really glad I took it with me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased with this product...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the pumice or nail brush yet, but I love how the face sponge, and face brush feels on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find this one on Amazon....</li>
            <li> but I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it to lock in place.  </li>
            <li> Even though I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to lock in, the brush stays on while I&#x27;m using it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as something that would cost much more.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and such a good price!</li>
            <li> ,my face is so much cleaner way better than a wash rag,I work in a machine shop with oil everywhere this cleans!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my purchase &amp; immediately started using it.</li>
            <li> Nice carrying case, several attachments and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be more powerful but it still works and makes my skin feel really good and smooth after i use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago, and I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> For what it is, and for those who know how to use it, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this, the facial scrub is very nice</li>
            <li> The speed of the massager with a new battery is great.  </li>
            <li> loved it a lot it cleans the face and keep it smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> This is a very good facial cleansing brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> and I really appreciate a company that still understands good business.  </li>
            <li> Good power but gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li> The sponge is much more friendly for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Too cool!</li>
            <li> I found its easy for me to travel with</li>
            <li> Did make my face feel clean, love putting on my face lotion with it.</li>
            <li> The case easily broke.</li>
            <li> So, I bought this because of the price and the easy removed attachments.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it is compact, has a compact container, and easily used for traveling.  </li>
            <li> The easy attachments comes on and off without any problem.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to store.</li>
            <li> One thing I can say for sure is that my face is absolutely clean now.</li>
            <li> ok, i would recommand it for others to clean your face and feet</li>
            <li> It was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Glad</li>
            <li> The power is fine, easy to handle</li>
            <li> and this one is hands down the best ever.  </li>
            <li> this one works just fine</li>
            <li> the pumice stone attachment went on fine, didnt snap though but didnt fall off either.</li>
            <li> But I thing is fine, for now thank you.</li>
            <li> but it works fine</li>
            <li> but this works just fine.</li>
            <li> I use the sponge and the brush for my face which works fine</li>
            <li> I emailed the vendor and without delay they replaced the brush which works fine.  </li>
            <li> Product is fine, you got what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The gentle meaage is surely doing wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> Awesome little set for $20.</li>
            <li> This compact little device is wonderful</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, the materials used to construct this product are ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li> Great product for a low price!  </li>
            <li> Not only that it&#x27;s a great buy for the price.  </li>
            <li> The customer service from &amp;#34;Jeff&amp;#34; was fantastic.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap when you use</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so smooth and has helped not to have blemishes.</li>
            <li> Thank You for a smooth purchase.</li>
            <li> This item is cheap.</li>
            <li> cause it was cheap</li>
            <li> makes my face really smooth</li>
            <li> I was considering Proactive just to get the free brush, but decided to look online just for the brush when I found this one.  </li>
            <li> This thing will almost fit into the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> The device is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> Using it on the face leaves your skin so smooth.  </li>
            <li> But to be honest, that didn&#x27;t prove to be too much of an issue.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Its cheap and it</li>
            <li> The more often its used the better and more clear</li>
            <li> CHEAP...</li>
            <li> CHEAP...</li>
            <li> CHEAP.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective.  </li>
            <li> Would not recommend this item even if it was free.</li>
            <li> Yes, it looks and feels a bit cheap, but whats important is that it does what it is meant to do which</li>
            <li> This facial massage is a great product.  </li>
            <li> It wasnt worth it, I bought one for CVS that was a better quality.</li>
            <li> Please, It&#x27;s worth every penny:)</li>
            <li> It is rather cheaply made</li>
            <li> , it has two speeds and the multiple heads are great.</li>
            <li> She loves it, it cleans wonderfully, and has held up for everyday use for a year.&lt;br /&gt;glenda</li>
            <li> This is really tiny lol.</li>
            <li> it is cheaply made but has worked without any malfunctions so far.&lt;br /&gt;however</li>
            <li> Stick to light chemical peels or see a esthetician for something stronger.</li>
            <li> I like the two speeds and the light weight of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Good product for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> The product is exactly as advertised and exactly what I needed at a good price for a product that I had never tried before.</li>
            <li> I had one from Avon for many years, loved it, but it finally wore out, and I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement ever since.</li>
            <li> Its a good product and value for money, the speed of the motor gives sufficient cleansing and brushing action on the skin</li>
            <li> This product is very powerful for its size.</li>
            <li> Since this is run on batteries, I guess I should have known that it wouldn&#x27;t be very powerful.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Episonic is $189.00 but groupon has it available for $59.99 right now!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try out this item, I wanted to see if using an electric brush would help improve my sin any verses using a washcloth or my hands.</li>
            <li> works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Rather then the original that cost over $200</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for callus control.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I am impressed with this product despite the fact that it looks cheap and I had a hard time getting the brush to stay.</li>
            <li> When I recieved it I did not expect this to clean so well for the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> clean my makeup off my face before using this device in order to keep the brush head cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin with a clean look and feel.  </li>
            <li> It truly has a clean feeling after each use.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like it does remove all make up and dirt leaving my skin feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> The system has many different tips and it comes in a nice compact case to travel with.</li>
            <li> It has a powerful water jet stream and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> And super cheaply made.</li>
            <li> The price is right!</li>
            <li> I love the product ,it&#x27;s pretty powerful compared to others I bought now</li>
            <li> The additional attachments are great for rough skin on your heels or buffing nails.</li>
            <li> worked very well love the 2 speeds</li>
            <li> The brush falls off the handle, not waterproof, but I guess for the money, can&#x27;t really ask for more.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> She wants 6 more just in case one Breaks.</li>
            <li> i really only use the scrubber but its good for the price</li>
            <li> My acne is still here and there sometimes, but my skin looks so much better that it doesn&#x27;t even seem to hurt my appearance as much as it would have before.</li>
            <li> I have used this on the stronger setting most of the time as the lower setting doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  </li>
            <li> The 4 attachments makes it very versatile for many uses.  </li>
            <li> I am very satified with how the product performs and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, he absolutely loves loves using it.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed...it suppose to be electric but is batery operated.&lt;br /&gt;They want me to write more</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for a fresh &amp; clean feel!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I am pleased to say that US Advanced Healthcare immediately sent me out a replacement unit after my review and so far that one is working!</li>
            <li> Good, good, although my elderly electric facial product still works and the brushes from the new on can&#x27;t be transferred to the older model.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a cheaper option to other at home exfoliation options, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> This product is pure garbage !!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean .</li>
            <li> The attachments don&#x27;t want to stay on, but if you put your cleaner on first the put your insert in it;s fine.  </li>
            <li> I used the brush and sponge after a shower and they left my skin nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adequate for the a quick leaning.  </li>
            <li> It does the job when we are in a hurry and need a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of deeply cleaning my skin, and it makes it much easier to apply my moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.....</li>
            <li> It ISN&#x27;T waterproof, so that&#x27;s the only downside, but it really does a great job on cleaning my face</li>
            <li> very satisfied I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Personally I just use the soft brush with a gentle foaming cleanser and it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I did not try the unit, because the cheap lightweight plastic was enough to tell me that it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.  </li>
            <li> and this makes it super easy and fast.</li>
            <li> what to say its a very hight quality product it makes your face as a baby skin , easy to use at home</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a good time and is exactly the same as the picture.</li>
            <li> it easy to use and very convince and can carry it anywhere.</li>
            <li> The brush was fine (though not as pictured), however the pumice stone and sponge were quite ineffective and went largely unused.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> Turns out, this works pretty well!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this one little gaget saves me from having to pack more in an over night bag!</li>
            <li> How can it possibly get better than that!</li>
            <li> and I have very smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> It most definitely isn&#x27;t waterproof, and I could tell right away it was easy to break.</li>
            <li> it self does not scrach my face, so guys if you live like i do its worth it!!</li>
            <li> Received this today...was excited with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Left face feeling amazing.</li>
            <li> This product is only $15 and an amazing dupe.</li>
            <li> This brush is great, not too rough, though cleans the skin very well.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the components yet but was happy to find a round for my nails and feet.</li>
            <li> Made face washing for my daughter so much fun and easier.</li>
            <li> but it is still worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> Both levels honestly feel the same.</li>
            <li> The immediate results are worth</li>
            <li> Cheaper than a spa facial, plus I can use my own product that I know</li>
            <li> powerful and was the strength i was hoping</li>
            <li> I have not tried the nail buffer yet and the sponge doesn&#x27;t seem useful to me.  </li>
            <li> I rather have spent more for something better...</li>
            <li> I also got a similar machine from Conair and the Conair one is not as nice as this one by BriteLeafs.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> powerful at all&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> it works far better than a wash cloth or my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Product had useful attachments, but it did not run when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush makes my face feel fresh and stimulated.  </li>
            <li> Nice product for facial or foot use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the hastle of trying to return it, so I lost the $20 plus it cost me.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money.</li>
            <li> after a few days of using it I did see a difference - my acne scars were fading, I wasn&#x27;t breaking out any more at all (which is unusual to me), and my skin was just overall glowing - even my best friend noticed.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 star is because the brush attachment appears to wearing out sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest a more firmer bristles or maybe have a soft one and a firmer one included.  </li>
            <li> She said that it works as intended and liked the fact that it came with different attachments.</li>
            <li> The product is not as powerful as i hoped it would be</li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> but the callus stone and nail buffers don&#x27;t have enough power to be effective.  </li>
            <li> This was well worth the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly worth it, just the slightest pressure and the motor stops.  </li>
            <li> This has lead to a semi changed smile and visible lines.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it is not the same quality as the more expensive ones, but for what I needed, right now, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is not waterproof but because of the 4 batteries it still works better than most of the other products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this and has many uses other then</li>
            <li> Mine broke pretty quickly after I received it.</li>
            <li> I love it as I feel my skin extremely clean after wash &amp; massage, I use it daily &amp;</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is a good one , but it should be able to go under water because usually its much easier to use it during the shower</li>
            <li> I see an esthetician who told me a spin brush is a spin brush, all work as good at the other.</li>
            <li> The other applications are just as good too.  </li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped one of the attachments on the floor and right away the brush peeled off from the plastic.</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right size and and it has no cord, so you can get to every area of your body.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for something like this for a while and realized that right now, I didn&#x27;t want to spend some 200 dollars on something trivial</li>
            <li> I get regular facial massages about twice a month; but it is nice to know that I can take care of my facial skin each morning with out great fuss.</li>
            <li> but you can always spend a little more for something better.</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful little skin facial cleaning system.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice little case that holds the attachments securely and will travel well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> works great, as well as more expensive one</li>
            <li> The facial brush and sponge are both gentle but effective.  </li>
            <li> For those purposes, it is adequate, but I would not put too much stake in getting any benefit from the pumice attachments.</li>
            <li> I really like that this comes in it&#x27;s own travel case and has multiple brush heads.</li>
            <li> It was pretty cheap, and honestly I dont think any of the super expensive ones would do any better job.</li>
            <li> very cheap for a reason, broke instantly after two uses....</li>
            <li> Its very gentle.</li>
            <li> This little machine is really good-</li>
            <li> I will spend more money on a different product eventually.</li>
            <li> When I first used the product, I selected the bristle brush for my face.</li>
            <li> Skin felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used the foot pumus stone for the first time today, and I have to say,</li>
            <li> i first took it out of its plastic storage container</li>
            <li> oh wow, that&#x27;s incredibly cheap.</li>
            <li> I tried several batteries to make sure that the lack of \\&quot;workage\\&quot; was the brush system.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> You will be pleased with the results instantly.</li>
            <li> My husband used it after he had applied sun screen&lt;br /&gt;Through out the day, and he said he felt the refreshing feel it left after first use.</li>
            <li> First of all, do not expect a $20.00 to perform like a $200.00 product.</li>
            <li> It really exfolliates my face!</li>
            <li> I love this facial brush</li>
            <li> The facial cleansing is okay as well, but I think I need a different brush size in order to have better results.</li>
            <li> I was able to do the job with properly cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> When I first started it up it sounded like it was struggling to spin</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this first.</li>
            <li> I turned it on away from my face and hair first to make sure the brush was spinning properly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> The pumice attachment broke on the first use</li>
            <li> However, I will invest the money in a better product next time.</li>
            <li> This came exactly as it was described.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it hurt a bit.</li>
            <li> Love the facial exfoliator</li>
            <li> Love that it has several accessory heads that come with it.  </li>
            <li> Will buy more products in the future.</li>
            <li> This cleansing and exfoliating brush system is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love BRITELEAFS facial and body scrubber.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of the facial brush and sponge!</li>
            <li> Make sure to have double A batteries ready as this does not come with batteries ; you are going to want to experience this treasure the moment you get it!</li>
            <li> During my first use i scratched my face twice</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying it.</li>
            <li> Thanks !  </li>
            <li> I bought the best batteries I could, and it was really sad</li>
            <li> The case and the unit are pretty and it does work, just not as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I love my BriteLeafs Face cleaner \\&quot;system\\&quot;... but only after my husband \\&quot;fixed\\</li>
            <li> I use it for about 2 minutes at a time, making sure I get my entire face, and neck as well.</li>
            <li> you are looking for a face cleaning system that will increase skin elasticity and has better facial product absorption - then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and it so easy yo take care of and I just love how my face feels when I finishes cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> The set looks kind weak but it is actually ok...</li>
            <li> This little gadget really works good on your skin .  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> i guess i just needed something to clean my pores so its doing the job so far.</li>
            <li> Fast and not time consuming, safe to use daily.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok for its price, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough to get to really like it.</li>
            <li> I really liked my electric cleaning system and I have only used one brush so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to get a few for my nieces…since they were most interested in mine!!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for something that will clean and exfoliate from head to toe!</li>
            <li> After reading all the stellar reviews I was very dissapointed when I used the cleaning system.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face pretty well, and it even comes with its own little case so I can take it with me when I travel.</li>
            <li> it kind of stops, and the high speed I can&#x27;t use everyday because it makes my face feel kind of dry.</li>
            <li> First one rusted out, ordered another, will be more careful and hang it in front of bathroom fan after use.</li>
            <li> mostly use the facial brush attachment to deep clean my pores...</li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep it dry as its not water proof.</li>
            <li> i pick this because of the price it turned out to be a good product for my facial needs i would highly recommend to anyone who needs a deep cleaning facial.after one use there was improvement in texture and look my skin was softer and clearer instantly!GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE</li>
            <li> and the contact is too large and the battery does not make contact, so it does not work.</li>
            <li> Large assortment of attachment heads.  </li>
            <li> and I was certain that it wasn&#x27;t going to do anything</li>
            <li> Again, in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is a certain \\&quot;cheapness\\&quot; about this product.  </li>
            <li> The brush dosen&#x27;t irritate your skin and it is a smart buy for the performance and price.</li>
            <li> I love that it came in a nice small compact case with multiple attachments if you so desire.</li>
            <li> Its the only nail device I&#x27;ve been able to use on my LhasaTzu, who has Very Sensitive Hearing...</li>
            <li> it was fine until it broke 3 months later.</li>
            <li> Great little facial scrub brush for the price.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like reviewing anything, but I will when the product is not up to par.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would be a problem, but it really is.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely amazed.</li>
            <li> And I feel much cleaner after use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter really enjoys using this item.  </li>
            <li> and it work very well for me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> You can see that is really cleans the pours out.</li>
            <li> It takes two AA batteries and is a bit loud but is worth it and is compact.</li>
            <li> The brushes don&#x27;t really attach on, they fall off when you lean the device downward.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this item</li>
            <li> but I actually really like it.</li>
            <li> Compared to similair products that cost twice as much</li>
            <li> I think this item is a real steal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the cleaning aspect and nail filing uses.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Sponge attachment very soothing to face.  </li>
            <li> I received my product in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleansing feeling.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to massage my face gently and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Gently move in circles over whole face,  than rinse and your done.  </li>
            <li> and it really cleaned all the make-up off my face.</li>
            <li> even the brush on high setting does not irritate my skin!  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend wants to steal it for his feet.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the nail file attachment</li>
            <li> I wasnt ready to pay $100 for the name brand</li>
            <li> Cleans very well</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about</li>
            <li> The newer one is stronger and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Both worked very well</li>
            <li> In the end I like how compact it is, as it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my cabinets.</li>
            <li> I Haven&#x27;t had  the time to really try all the functions out.</li>
            <li> I must say that the seller was very concerned about my problem and promptly offered a replacement or refund.</li>
            <li> The nail buffer pad didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything either.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> The disappointment of using batteries and not being able to plug the spa into an outlet diminished when she saw how powerful and effective this spa was.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much nicer than the one I bought from Oley.</li>
            <li> Ironic.</li>
            <li> It CAN be done, and it can be done at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pores minimized with this gentle cleaning process.  </li>
            <li> Worked good for awhile, then noticed red veins forming on face that don&#x27;t go away, should have sticked with having acne because its not permenetly scaring, way too rough to use on the face</li>
            <li> looking for a different kind of facial brush.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> The two attachments for face are really good, the one for nails is ok, the one for your foot is completely useless!</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the facial massage brush stays on during use all the time and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I was soooo excited about this facial brush until I got ready to turn it on</li>
            <li> As long as your not clumsy with it and your not using it in the shower, you&#x27;re golden!!</li>
            <li> No need to go any further for a budget friendly spa experience.</li>
            <li> Something small and lightweight that can be tucked away in a carry on bag but still powerful enough to do a good job.  </li>
            <li> , just helps your skin to clean deeply.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t always give me a deep clean</li>
            <li> It works a lot better if your feet have been soaked for a few min first.</li>
            <li> I especially like the pink file; it really helps my nails to stop splitting and grow long and beautiful.</li>
            <li> final thought is do not expect too much from this device but it is a good way to prepare your skin for a more expensive device.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned two facial brushes and loved them.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made my face dry, just really soft :)</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed how soft and radiant my skin looked.</li>
            <li> My face feels so much softer, and my acne is slowly diminishing, I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> right on par with the &#x27;&#x27;major brand&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try something new!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rate it even less if I were able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a low cost alternative to some of the more costly facial and body brush spa cleaning systems.</li>
            <li> feel confident that my skin is getting the deep cleaning that is essential.</li>
            <li> Even the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used before didn&#x27;t offer anything better.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a super glue to put it back together.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve said that, this product is decent for the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a while back but just started using it more regularly.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re mainly buying this to use on your face, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> but I was very pleasantly proved wrong!</li>
            <li> Highly recommanded.</li>
            <li> turned it on high.</li>
            <li> it was highly recommeded to buy.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this before &amp;#34;investing&amp;#34; in a high end brush.</li>
            <li> used the pumice stone attachment, even on the high speed</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Could be a little stronger but made face feel fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin) to deep clean my pores.  </li>
            <li> Even though the brush is a bit hard, but 4 in 1 Electric Facial... is very useful and very cheap.  </li>
            <li> but it is a pretty cheap little device.</li>
            <li> I need a gentle way to exfoliate and smooth very dry sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be just as effective as the more expensive facial cleansing tools.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this.  </li>
            <li> This is a cute and small electric brush but very affective.</li>
            <li> The foot brush is probably the least effective but does smooth out some of the rough spots.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t even worth the headache of trying to send it back</li>
            <li> My co-worker actually asked me that following day what I had done differently that morning because my face looked really nice.</li>
            <li> I want to love this, but it broke apart in the shower after a few days</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my sensitive skin yet strong enough to exfoliat my skin.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this same brush for several years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> I really only use the bristle brush, as the other ones don&#x27;t do much without more power.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rough enough to clean anything</li>
            <li> But I used it the next day with a different method and it was fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is comparable to my older electric cleaner, slightly better because i like the small size and weight of it.</li>
            <li> However, the motor and power source are so weak, it can only be effective on the most sensitive areas of skin, such as face and neck.</li>
            <li> brush bristles could have been a little more soft, sometimes it hurts the skin</li>
            <li> then it requires new battery.</li>
            <li> The product arrived, and I put new batteries in.  </li>
            <li> used 3 times a week even with new batteries it would not turn on anymore.</li>
            <li> so I need a new one.</li>
            <li> I can live with this and maybe, as customer service says, it will eventually click.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I will write a new review in about one or two weeks.</li>
            <li> It also is not that powerful, the medium speed has a hard time going unless you just lightly touch it to your skin.</li>
            <li> In short, I enjoy using this product daily and have shared this fact with family.  </li>
            <li> The product is more compact that I expected, and comes with a plastic case similar to a glasses case to keep everything together.</li>
            <li> I got this because I had super dry skin for a while and was trying to buff it off.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have much power, but then again I think I was expecting something similar to a buffing wheel for a car.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it religiously and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> facial scrubber is very gentle</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The second one seemed new and has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen and used similar items that were much more expensive that don&#x27;t work any better.  </li>
            <li> This company saw my post and is sending me a replacement brush for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It barely spins, it really seems like there&#x27;s no point in using it at all.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> This was somewhat cheap and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I originally got it to just help with exfoliation, but after reading reviews I decided to use it everynight with regular facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> The brush bristles is starting to fold in the middle and most likely I may have to get another replacement soon.  </li>
            <li> Also, I have a moderate acne problem and when I first started using the brush it did irratate</li>
            <li> I found that this product works well for me and the price is better than other similar products.</li>
            <li> I am planning on using it tomorrow, but it is exactly what I thought it was and have used something similar</li>
            <li> If you are using it for the first time, I suggest you start with low speed.</li>
            <li> (I usually only use it for face), my pores are noticeably smaller and my face feels so fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night and this morning</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> This thing works and its better than buying those more expensive ones when it does the same thing.</li>
            <li> This product works but simply does not have much power even on the high setting and with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this power facial scrubber - it was very highly rated.</li>
            <li> She has had hand surgery and had problems that didn&#x27;t allow her to grip sponges and other things to clean her face.</li>
            <li> I always used it on the high setting because the low one didn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much.</li>
            <li> She noticed the same results on her other body parts and liked the different attachments.  </li>
            <li> And like the other reviewers be careful when placing your facial wash on the brush, because it can fly everywhere, so what I do is put my facial wash on my face and then scrub from there.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little nicer because of the description, but this one works fine.</li>
            <li> If your looking for one of these facial polishers, you could pay more for less . . .</li>
            <li> Also, the brush only spins in one direction, so skin gets pulled and hair is easily tangled and mixed into your facial products.</li>
            <li> Then I use the facial sponge attachment to put lotion on my face, leaves my face feeling clean and soft and helps with minor acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comes with a lovely translucent hard carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this to help clear up Acne, and I don&#x27;t think it made a difference in my Acne at all</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fast enough to really smooth out any calluses on your feet.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is not as soft as a lady&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> This irritated my 60 yr old skin when I used it on my face..</li>
            <li> I really like the extra cleaning it does for my face.  </li>
            <li> I really like the additional components that are included like the porous stone used for your feet and the facial scrub device.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only wish it was just the brush as I don&#x27;t use the others much</li>
            <li> It is soft on your face and the kit comes with instructions.</li>
            <li> Just a note of caution when using it near your eyes.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these one for myself and my 14 year old both</li>
            <li> My complexion looks clearer and my skin feels so soft after I&#x27;m done using it.</li>
            <li> Altogether, I didn&#x27;t get that much out of the brush and it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t surprised by that.</li>
            <li> change the brush into the buffing sponge and apply my moisturizer directly to the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> skin is extremely soft</li>
            <li> The BriteLeafs body brush and soft sponge did the trick.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and so refreshed.</li>
            <li> and I really like that there are multiple attachments.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it deep in but is still gentle.</li>
            <li> I really like having four different applicators.</li>
            <li> it stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how affordable this was and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft and looks radiant after.</li>
            <li> The bristles feel harsher and the motor doesn&#x27;t have near the level of power of the Clarisonic Mia.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel so smooth and silky getting off all that dead skin.  </li>
            <li> A skin brightening daily scrub, for exfoliation, is a much better&lt;br /&gt;way of cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin this may hurt you a bit.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s reasonable for the low price.</li>
            <li> When I use this it makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> but I do know that any gentle massage on my face with stimulate the facial muscles.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use on my 3 year old feet, but it doesn&#x27;t work, it stops all the time.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old, acne prone, and it helped to clear my skin.  </li>
            <li> Made in China made my decision to return it complete.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks much clearer once I started using a facial brush.</li>
            <li> I paid twice as much for mine, and it only has one brush.</li>
            <li> His has four attachments: soft sponge, soft brush, pumice, and a nail polisher.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how surprised I was at some of the prices out there.  </li>
            <li> Also LOVE the pumice for removing all the gross dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t had any new major breakouts.</li>
            <li> I used the soap I usually use on the scrubbing pad (low setting) and the moisturizer I usually use with the sponge (on high setting), and the results have been great.</li>
            <li> This of course leads to more breakouts if you are unable to clean your skin properly.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a new pumice rock and free new small brush when I wrote them and asked for it!  </li>
            <li> The nail file attachment is useful for taking off sharp edges, and I have found the pumice works if you follow the directions that come with it.</li>
            <li> It works very well; needless to say, my facial texture feels super smooth after one use.</li>
            <li> This is really more like a toy than a serious beauty and health product.  </li>
            <li> I have used a facial brush in the past which was more than twice the size of this.  </li>
            <li> Could be little bigger for the price also, the machine no sons to strong.</li>
            <li> I used my cream facial cleanser, with the machine on high.</li>
            <li> get ripped off and purchase one of those high dollar ones when this one does the same thing.</li>
            <li> have used the high speed and the low speed and each works as described.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it with a facial scrub (even on high power it has never scratched my skin</li>
            <li> It appears small and cheaply made online.</li>
            <li> This was the primary reason I wanted this device since I expected it to allow me to keep my feet salon soft with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> Buffed put lotion on abd my elbows are back to normal .</li>
            <li> At first it seems like the surface area of the heads is too small, but they are actually just right.</li>
            <li> Expected a little more</li>
            <li> My nails split easily and are hard to grow BriteLeafs</li>
            <li> facial buff may be low-tech, but it never broke and never needed new batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to open it up and fix it, hit it a few times lightly and still will not turn.</li>
            <li> The bristles no the face brush aren&#x27;t as firm as I expected, it will need to be replaced many times.</li>
            <li> but I love the color that it comes in a soft plum Dusty plum.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in the appearance of my skin</li>
            <li> but I actually disagree completely!</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; but the batter runs out quickly, or it&#x27;s just not powerful enough regardless of battery quality.  </li>
            <li> The low speed is useless and high works okay as long as you don&#x27;t apply any pressure, which will cause it to completely stop if too much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;BriteLeads 4-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush&amp;#34; ultimately won in my search of an exfoliating brush because of its simple design, affordability, and mostly positive reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought that I was going to be getting a large head brush, about as big as a back scrubber&#x27;s head, that I could use as a power brush to scrub my back with.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that when I received this product, the motor was very slow but without even asking, the company was nice enough to send me a second one</li>
            <li> I do the slower speed for general cleaning and then use the faster setting over my problem areas where i&#x27;ve been getting acne, and its helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Totally soft facial scrubber.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the brush and the sponge.</li>
            <li> The product offers several options, rather than just cleansing the face, which I have done.</li>
            <li> but i spent to much time with it on my face and the brissels</li>
            <li> You can only use it for your face and so far it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me.</li>
            <li> The facial brush is not at all soft</li>
            <li> I found that my acne decreased and my face looks much better.</li>
            <li> They should have included an ac adapter to help the brush move faster, (for those who want more power behind the brush).  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s how it works: Get the brush attachment wet, snap it into the hand-held part, wet your face and apply a light amount of facial cleanser, turn it on, and rub the moist spinning brush part over your skin.</li>
            <li> but other then that it cleans very well</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time to clean the sponge after one use</li>
            <li> Are there any other interchangeable attachments readily sold elsewhere to add to this kit of brushes and attachments?</li>
            <li> My face is sensitive and the brush was a little bit much for me.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this fun little kit for my face.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the overpriced ones,  this little facial scrubber is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> If I am starting to break out, I&#x27;ll use the brush for a day or two and usually my skin starts to clear up right away.</li>
            <li> At first I did not use it every day because it dried my face out a little, but now I am using it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> So be careful when you are using it and don&#x27;t overdo it on the high setting like I did.</li>
            <li> The brush is not as soft as some other brushes but doesn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin which is really sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how it will work in the long run but it was worth the money so far.</li>
            <li> First shipment stopped working after a few days.</li>
            <li> I found the spinning would bog down at the slightest amount of resistance no matter how much cleanser and water I used on my face.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical because it cost so much less than most others.  </li>
            <li> On the first use, and only after a little use the pumice rock fell off of the plastic part that it was attached to.  </li>
            <li> I wish though, that it came with extra facial brushes instead of the other 3 attachments, which really don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, turn the cleaner off, take the head out (takes a small amount of effort), clean the brush head well, and store someplace it can dry out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am seeing a lot of positive and negative feedback on this, but I can only assume the positives are coming from new users of face products.  </li>
            <li> The other day I used it on the low setting, then the high, and I got a cut on my face.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is very small, the brush is small and soft, and very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> The battery operated motor it little more than a toy so that if you press too hard on your skin it will stop moving.</li>
            <li> I agree with other uses that it is not super powerful-</li>
            <li> So this item is used for face and body cleansing, buffing, and polishing; however, the directiosn clearly state that it should not get wet.  </li>
            <li> Before i got this kind of brush from a famous beauty and cosmetics product but sad to say i forgot it when i was at cali, and that one is so expensive!</li>
            <li> For some strange reason I had a hard time keeping the brush in the device as it kept on falling out despite the fact that I was pushing kind of hard to get it to stay.</li>
            <li> how long it will last since I have only used it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> This was good the first like three times I used it, but it turned out to be a terrible product.</li>
            <li> This brush is really small, it is not as large as it appears in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t contain all the parts.</li>
            <li> for the full cleaning system, which I felt was quite a rip-off.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, sensitive skin, like myself, and other skin types as well.</li>
            <li> but I think that the other brushes aren&#x27;t necessary, for my case, because I only bought this for the facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> Since I bought this product I mean after first of January 2013,  I used it four times</li>
            <li> The fact that it was battery driven, with such lightweight plastic, made me believe that if it got wet, the batteries well may do the same.</li>
            <li> It arrived within a week which is always nice, however the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is useless, it rotates a few seconds and stops.</li>
            <li> Ive tried other, more expensive systems and this one works just as well as any.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The lack of power and oomph using the battery system pretty much rendered the other tool heads useless.</li>
            <li> For the price, this little machine removes makeup and dead skin very well!  </li>
            <li> Given that this ISN&#x27;T water proof and pumice stones generally work 10x better when your feet are submerged, the pumice is literally useless....and still too weak (again, for a man [who doesn&#x27;t work as a manual laborer]), the nail file isn&#x27;t productive because again the machine is too weak.  </li>
            <li> With that said, none of the attachments &amp;#34;lock into place&amp;#34; or attach securely to the device at all, which makes use difficult at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Obviously, you cannot tell from the sales picture, so I was surprised at how small it was when I opened the package.  </li>
            <li> The brush isn&#x27;t flush with the handle and her long hair got caught in the rotating head.</li>
            <li> I should have bought this a long time ago</li>
            <li> just add my cleanser wet face and let the facial scrubber do the work.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time but it was cost prohibitive.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft on the face but does the job in removing dead skin cells.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide and</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want one that&#x27;s too powerful or you will end up irritating your skin and damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I got the red marks other people said they were getting too.</li>
            <li> I received this item earlier than expected date!</li>
            <li> May use the other attachments in the future.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a mini-dermabrasion unit, helping your skin renew itself by taking the older dull layers off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only thing so far that keeps it from being a five star, is the fact that the attachments are hard to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my face feels cleaner and softer than it has in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> i use it almost every night because if you a lot of it at night every night, your face tends to get dry so moisturize your face after you go to bed</li>
            <li> The rotating help remove blackheads and dry skin.</li>
            <li> The brush head works well at defoliating dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin has been extremely dry and damaged from chemotherapy</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughters and they have only been using it for a few weeks but its working well enough according to them.</li>
            <li> so I know its removing every single bit of make up which never happened using my fingers</li>
            <li> actual unit was a little smaller than I expected, however, that&#x27;s not an issue.  </li>
            <li> Its not really powerful, but it is quiet.</li>
            <li> This facial brush is NOT worth buying.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to tell if this is the culprit as I also started using a couple of new products for my face.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t flip it back down.</li>
            <li> typical Christmas present</li>
            <li> I previously had a store bought one that I had been using for the last 6 months</li>
            <li> During my first few uses I figured the motor was just slow then after maybe the fifth use</li>
            <li> But regardless, the face brush is so weak and really does nothing but tickle your face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for one for a long time, but not willing to pay what dept. stores charged.  </li>
            <li> When I read the directions on the box, they said that my facial brush is not water tight.  </li>
            <li> If you have gotten a pedicure before you know what I mean; they usually hack at your feet vigorously so this really does nothing for your feet if you are looking for those same results.  </li>
            <li> I like this little face cleanser the only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because it didn&#x27;t come with batteries!!!</li>
            <li> I have only had this a little over a week, and I can see it helping.</li>
            <li> I got this system just to see how my sensitive and hard to shop for skin would react to being cleaned with a brush instead of just hands.</li>
            <li> it did not feel too hard or soft on my face-</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the price, but when I received the product was pleased with the way it worked.  </li>
            <li> This products bristles are just too harsh for my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but to avoid a total waste of money will keep using it for a while until I get a clarisonic or a nutrisonic.</li>
            <li> Kinda whimpy, but not much is really need to scrub ones face.</li>
            <li> I wonder if I was using it to rough though.</li>
            <li> I use the pink head on her nails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;brush heads are just firm enough (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it but just be careful with the pieces.</li>
            <li> You can save some money if you don&#x27;t want to spent 50+ Dollars.</li>
            <li> I keep it in its case so that it doesn&#x27;t get wet</li>
            <li> Thanks again for being one of the fewer companies that stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> I expected the brush to be softer but it&#x27;s like a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Not very convenient its just sitting around somewhere in my house now.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;do not ever use &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; on your face.</li>
            <li> Be careful to not over use it because it can start to peel off needed layers to your skin.</li>
            <li> like I expected</li>
            <li> I had to constantly stop rinse the brush and start again which was annoying more than anything.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spin deeply at all,and not very safe due to the battery acid and the use of water.</li>
            <li> but IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR FEET.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  </li>
            <li> None the less, I only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the brushes except the face scrubber - not sure what to use the other attachments for actually.</li>
            <li> but it made my nails so slick that the polish came off and didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Please consider other options.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> The low setting is pointless.</li>
            <li> but none of the other attachments.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> Pretty much useless for anything.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried the other attachments yet</li>
            <li> The sponge head is pretty much useless for me.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you about the other changeable heads you can use for other grooming aspects.</li>
            <li> The brush add on was so rough on my face!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because of this, my husband converted it to DC by connecting the correct size wires to the battery terminals and adding an external power supply (a small wall-wart) that plugs in to the bathroom outlet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s suppose to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; in place like all the other attachments</li>
            <li> I started to use the other attachments</li>
            <li> This spa brush was purchased after reading other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I use it, but have to be very careful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the pieces where broken and they sent me out a new piece.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super unhappy with this product, would not buy again, would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to get rid of dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I find the faster speed to be too irritating.  </li>
            <li> I know its for my face, but I need something a little harder on the scrubbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the rough side</li>
            <li> I could use the same batteries for at least a month.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> The nail polisher does an average job.</li>
            <li> To the customer that complained that the brush fell off the handle, I can only say that it doesn&#x27;t fall off if you put it on correctly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help get rid of milia-cysts in the delicate area beneath my eye, and only 10 days after getting it, they are already gone.  </li>
            <li> Not sure the long term perks of it yet</li>
            <li> when using the sponge attachment it does bog down upon skin contact.</li>
            <li> one down side</li>
            <li> but now it does not bog down as soon as slight pressure is applied, nor does it run out of\\&quot; juice\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> After using roughly ~5 times, this facial brush fell off a table of approximately a foot.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and when I use this 2-3 times a week they are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I dropped it and it shattered into pieces after less than a week.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels softer, smother and less black heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for less than a year.</li>
            <li> skin is smoother, softer, brighter, and I&#x27;ve had less acne outbreaks in the time I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Just a slight touch will make it stop working again.</li>
            <li> The fatal flaw was the switch broke, and I was unable to push it up into high again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a few dark areas (surgical scars) that I wanted to buff away.</li>
            <li> and I use it once a week to get rid of all the dirt I get from the harsh living contitions, I also found that the scrubber does not bog down under mormal contioions.  </li>
            <li> But when i got this,the brush is really really the same with what i had before, but i got a lil disappointment with these because it is not waterproof, and i cant take/use it during shower time!</li>
            <li> But one of my attachments wasn&#x27;t in properly and fell down got broken on my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Too weak not enough power</li>
            <li> the first thing I noticed when shopping for a brush was how expensive these things are!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and use it with my Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for all the people who have little time.</li>
            <li> little con: thought it was electric and not battery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a waste of $20.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just messy when I&#x27;m washing up, but this is still something that should be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I suggest not to use it every time everyday.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend exfoliating everyday.</li>
            <li> I a deployed soldier, I use this face spa scrubber, beacause of the harsh weather and dirt that accumalates on my face.</li>
            <li> The thing is already dead, had it for almost 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Dead.</li>
            <li> But now, after a few months, mine has already quit working and is on its way to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems:&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> The attachments do not stay firmly on the unit.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this thing almost everyday.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Exfoliating cloths left flaky skin behind.  </li>
            <li> But if you have money, don&#x27;t waste it on this and splurge on the Clarasonic.</li>
            <li> It isnt water proof so you cant use this inside the shower which im annoyed by also it says facial &amp; body brush however there is no body brush attachment and</li>
            <li> My husband tried to fix it and it would run for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not a very powerful motor spins too slow to work well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to push the button down from the \\&quot;high speed\\&quot; position to the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position.</li>
            <li> It was not a good product for me as the advertisement that I saw indicated that it could get wet.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and no more bristles has fallen</li>
            <li> But now no need, I will stick with this little beauty!</li>
            <li> This little brush does the trick!  </li>
            <li> The motor is a little slow.</li>
            <li> The motor has very little torque.</li>
            <li> You have your choice between slow and semi-fast for speeds and if you press too hard the machine shuts down.  </li>
            <li> I only rated it with 4 stars since the pumice stone feature is almost useless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m anxious to try all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small than I the picture shows.  </li>
            <li> and I have seen drastic improvements over the past week just from using this.</li>
            <li> Who needs an expensive facial cleanser?  </li>
            <li> One less adolescent problem to deal with!!</li>
            <li> In other words, it no longer runs on batteries, but as I found, it did a poor job of that anyway.</li>
            <li> w not very good but works alittle</li>
            <li> are hard</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no release button to remove the attachments -- you just have to yank really hard.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job, I just wish there was a warning on the label that tells the consumer that pressing too hard could cause scratches.</li>
            <li> This little gem is a spa at your fingertips!!</li>
            <li> The speed is just too slow and if I push too hard, it stops rotating altogether and I have to twist it to get it started again.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> This product--or at least the one they sent me--doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least 1-2 x per week</li>
            <li> In the meantime, hopefully the company will take this to heart and make it at least rechargeable with a charging station, like my electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This has two settings, really slow and not as slow.</li>
            <li> Ive used it a few times and every time i was annoyed.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used the other items that come with the device because you cannot apply pressure to the unit without it stopping or making some type of weird noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the low quality workmanship.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use an electric facial cleaning system, but the one she offered was very expensive.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I reccomend buying this product.</li>
            <li> And if she fails down the road, I will just buy another!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush does not fit that one &amp; that product does not have replacement brushes.</li>
            <li> sorry I wasted my money on this product</li>
            <li> I am disappointed  because we only used it one time</li>
            <li> I saw reviews and some people said it was too weak for them, so I was worried</li>
            <li> The horsepower on the brush was a bit weak.  </li>
            <li> This brush moves very slowly when it rotates, maybe because that&#x27;s the hardest that it can pull with the AA battery power.</li>
            <li> think it horrible to require a certain amount of words from us to describe whether we like a product or not.</li>
            <li> poor workmanship</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply a poorly made product and I DO NOT recommend it for purchase.</li>
            <li> They stand behind their product and were helpful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sending it back because I&#x27;d rather pay the shipping then use this for 2-3 months and have it crap out on me.</li>
            <li> and I hate going thru the hassle of mailing back things</li>
            <li> and it was basically broken.  </li>
            <li> the device isnt waterproof so you guys might want to fix the name because that is false advertisement.....</li>
            <li> and I have seen some dramatic changes in my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the one I received had a problem with a poorly functioning switch.  </li>
            <li> Im sorry to say I was not happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I as in no way disappointed with my BriteLeafs Cleaning System however one of the brushes came apart after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this might be a weak, flimsy product</li>
            <li> No power very weak motor</li>
            <li> Now its useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The attachments are -- in my experience -- useless.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I may be doing something wrong, but after awhile I figured out how to get it to stay in</li>
            <li> I prefer this one Over the expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to adjust if your fingers are wet.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I will still be way ahead of the game!</li>
            <li> I like the nail buffer because I&#x27;m so lazy that I hate filing my fingernails</li>
            <li> It keeps cutting off.</li>
            <li> Disappointing product.</li>
            <li> , i fully expect it to get used like crazy for a couple weeks, then retired to the dungeon under the sink where all gadgets end up.</li>
            <li> Failed!</li>
            <li> HE SORRY!</li>
            <li> Using the brush on \\&quot;high\\&quot; is not so bad, however if you use any amount of pressure it stops.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am hugely disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed and</li>
            <li> I just hate this product.</li>
            <li> it will hurt your face very bad.</li>
            <li> My face was in terrible shape; Blackheads, oily, break outs all over..</li>
            <li> It was terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> worked very well love the 2 speeds</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like reviewing anything, but I will when the product is not up to par.  I am seeing a lot of positive and negative feedback on this, but I can only assume the positives are coming from new users of face products.  It could also be because i&#x27;m a guy and my skin is not as soft as a lady&#x27;s face.  But regardless, the face brush is so weak and really does nothing but tickle your face.  Given that this ISN&#x27;T water proof and pumice stones generally work 10x better when your feet are submerged, the pumice is literally useless....and still too weak (again, for a man [who doesn&#x27;t work as a manual laborer]), the nail file isn&#x27;t productive because again the machine is too weak.  Anyway, its a good starter kit, but I may as well trash it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good facial cleansing brush for the price.  I&#x27;ve seen and used similar items that were much more expensive that don&#x27;t work any better.  I wish though, that it came with extra facial brushes instead of the other 3 attachments, which really don&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I had ask my facial expert to choose one for me and this is what she recommended. Excellant!</li>
            <li> battery spring fell out when opened to check batteries, now does not work anymore, used 1 time only, cannot find spring as it rolled away on the carpet  somewhere. but now the space between the battery and the contact is too large and the battery does not make contact, so it does not work. poor workmanship I am disappointed  because we only used it one time and I had bought extra heads to use later on. Now its useless.</li>
            <li> This irritated my 60 yr old skin when I used it on my face..This company saw my post and is sending me a replacement brush for sensitive skin! Awesome company will def be buying from them again!!</li>
            <li> This is really more like a toy than a serious beauty and health product.  Disappointed on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned two facial brushes and loved them. This products bristles are just too harsh for my facial skin. I use it, but have to be very careful. I&#x27;d advise purchasing a different brand that focuses solely on facial exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The two attachments for face are really good, the one for nails is ok, the one for your foot is completely useless!</li>
            <li> This was good the first like three times I used it, but it turned out to be a terrible product. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to push the button down from the \\&quot;high speed\\&quot; position to the \\&quot;off\\&quot; position. It hurts your finger to just turn the darn thing off. The bristles no the face brush aren&#x27;t as firm as I expected, it will need to be replaced many times. It&#x27;s simply a poorly made product and I DO NOT recommend it for purchase. I&#x27;m going to try something new! It&#x27;s just a waste of $20.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;BriteLeads 4-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush&amp;#34; ultimately won in my search of an exfoliating brush because of its simple design, affordability, and mostly positive reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately I am hugely disappointed with this product. And frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are -- in my experience -- useless. The brush was fine (though not as pictured), however the pumice stone and sponge were quite ineffective and went largely unused. With that said, none of the attachments &amp;#34;lock into place&amp;#34; or attach securely to the device at all, which makes use difficult at best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, this device is just too underpowered. Even on the highest setting it was just too weak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, not water-proof! I didn&#x27;t think this would be a problem, but it really is. Maybe I&#x27;m just messy when I&#x27;m washing up, but this is still something that should be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the materials used to construct this product are ridiculously cheap. In fact, the quality is not dissimilar to something that popped out of a 50 cent gumball machine. After using roughly ~5 times, this facial brush fell off a table of approximately a foot. And broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I&#x27;m super unhappy with this product, would not buy again, would not recommend. Ever.</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this.  Now I&#x27;m sold.  I really like the extra cleaning it does for my face.  Does not take a lot of time to get results. The pumice attachment works well for my feet.  My feet need some extra care especially in the summer time!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful item. I wasn&#x27;t sure how well this item would work. It uses two AA batteries. I was absolutely amazed. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works. It does a wonderful job. If you are looking for a facial spa brush, this is the one to buy. It&#x27;s four in one and they all work great.</li>
            <li> It barely spins, it really seems like there&#x27;s no point in using it at all. I could scrub my face better with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Even though the brush is a bit hard, but 4 in 1 Electric Facial... is very useful and very cheap.  Highly recommanded.</li>
            <li> This is a low cost alternative to some of the more costly facial and body brush spa cleaning systems. I&#x27;ve been using it daily for my face and I can see the difference already.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it eveyday.  It appears to be just as effective as the more expensive facial cleansing tools. I purchased 2 addiitonal ones as gifts.  I really like the additional components that are included like the porous stone used for your feet and the facial scrub device.&lt;br /&gt;I feel confident that my skin is getting the deep cleaning that is essential.</li>
            <li> i pick this because of the price it turned out to be a good product for my facial needs i would highly recommend to anyone who needs a deep cleaning facial.after one use there was improvement in texture and look my skin was softer and clearer instantly!GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE GETS THE JOB DONE</li>
            <li> Worked good for awhile, then noticed red veins forming on face that don&#x27;t go away, should have sticked with having acne because its not permenetly scaring, way too rough to use on the face</li>
            <li> Love it ! Made face washing for my daughter so much fun and easier. Totally soft facial scrubber. She only exfoliates once a week. The feet buffer is amazing. You got to remember not to submerge the machine in water. Only the attachments. We love ours. We bought two. The price is right! Love it love it</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost a month ago and I have seen some dramatic changes in my skin. I can feel my lotion actually hydrating my skin now and I no longer have a problem with dryness. I would recommend this product to anyone who has dry, sensitive skin, like myself, and other skin types as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> Good quality. And I feel much cleaner after use it. But I suggest not to use it every time everyday.</li>
            <li> Great product for the money. I only wish it was just the brush as I don&#x27;t use the others much but it is still worth it. Am buying as gifts too. Good for men and teenagers. I use it 3 times a week. Feels great!</li>
            <li> I chose this because of the price. It wasn&#x27;t too expensive, but I got what I paid for. I don&#x27;t use any of the brushes except the face scrubber - not sure what to use the other attachments for actually. I tried the pumice stone for my feet during my pedicures, but its not the same as doing it myself. This has two settings, really slow and not as slow. I know its for my face, but I need something a little harder on the scrubbing. The speed is just too slow and if I push too hard, it stops rotating altogether and I have to twist it to get it started again. I still will be using it as it does the basic job I need it for. I will spend more money on a different product eventually.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little nicer because of the description, but this one works fine. It arrived promptly and was well-priced, so thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product for a low price!  All in a compact case.</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial spa kit before. It appears small and cheaply made online. When I recieved it I did not expect this to clean so well for the cheaper price. But I am thinking \\&quot;what the heck, only 20 dollars.\\&quot; The brush cleans deeply. It is soft on your face and the kit comes with instructions. I advice everyone to start on low, especially if you&#x27;ve never used this before. I ended up with a \\&quot;red\\&quot; face. It works! I am very pleased. My skin feels tighter and shines. This works great for blemishes of any kind. I have a few dark areas (surgical scars) that I wanted to buff away. So far I am pleased. If you dont want to spend a lot of money, but want results, try this kit!</li>
            <li> I have a problematic skin and this cleaner helps me remove all the make up properly. It was pretty cheap, and honestly I dont think any of the super expensive ones would do any better job. So no need to spend your money on more pricey brands! this one works just fine, I use it every day and am very happy with it. But ladies, dont expect miracles to happen with your skin! Its just a cleaner and it wont make you look any different, just helps your skin to clean deeply.</li>
            <li> My daughter really enjoys using this item.  Not only that it&#x27;s a great buy for the price.  I shopped around before purchasing this one on line and I was pleased with it when I saw it.  I purchased one from a store and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as nice as this one.  The case is nice everything stays in place and it works great.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this item last week and have used 3 times since getting it. When I first used the product, I selected the bristle brush for my face. For some strange reason I had a hard time keeping the brush in the device as it kept on falling out despite the fact that I was pushing kind of hard to get it to stay. I may be doing something wrong, but after awhile I figured out how to get it to stay in and it work very well for me. After using the product on my face, I did see a remarkable difference in the tone and cleanliness of my face. I&#x27;ve never used a spa cleaning kit before and I must say that I am impressed with this product despite the fact that it looks cheap and I had a hard time getting the brush to stay. And like the other reviewers be careful when placing your facial wash on the brush, because it can fly everywhere, so what I do is put my facial wash on my face and then scrub from there.</li>
            <li> The brush falls off the handle, not waterproof, but I guess for the money, can&#x27;t really ask for more. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but to avoid a total waste of money will keep using it for a while until I get a clarisonic or a nutrisonic.</li>
            <li> I basically just use it for my face. It doesn&#x27;t always give me a deep clean like I want it to. It keeps cutting off. Both levels honestly feel the same. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Great product. Left face feeling amazing. Skin felt soft and smooth. Fast and not time consuming, safe to use daily. I would not recommend exfoliating everyday.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful. Got stuck in my daughter&#x27;s hair! The brush isn&#x27;t flush with the handle and her long hair got caught in the rotating head.</li>
            <li> the product is great and had no problems receiving it in a timely manner</li>
            <li> I just got it yesterday; and wow! The immediate results are worth it&#x27;s price.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I must say \\&quot;take it slow\\&quot;. I used my cream facial cleanser, with the machine on high. I had white stuff flying in my eyes, my chest, floor, and mirrors. Just a note of caution when using it near your eyes. Get accustomed to it&#x27;s movement before putting it under, or around the eyes, because it will pull itself into your eyelids. It works very well; needless to say, my facial texture feels super smooth after one use. Comes with a lovely translucent hard carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not waterproof!!! Do not use in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Not electric... battery operated device</li>
            <li> It washes my face so much better than a washcloth. It works great. All the attachments work well too.</li>
            <li> I like this product it does a great job the low setting a bit too low for my liking but it will work. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for the price.  The customer service from &amp;#34;Jeff&amp;#34; was fantastic.  They stand behind their product and were helpful.  It is a nice product for the value.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love it! Cheaper than a spa facial, plus I can use my own product that I know won&#x27;t break me out :) I used the foot pumus stone for the first time today, and I have to say, I was amazed even more by that. It does work better when your feet are damp.  Overall, I am extremely pleased!</li>
            <li> I especially like the pink file; it really helps my nails to stop splitting and grow long and beautiful. Initially, I only wanted it for the brush and pumice but I use it for my nails more than anything.  I used it to buff my nail polish but it made my nails so slick that the polish came off and didn&#x27;t last so I use it on the nail edges to prevent splitting and it works like a charm.  My nails split easily and are hard to grow BriteLeafs 4-in-one helps my nails grow.  I keep mine handy and I like keeping it in the case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these one for myself and my 14 year old both and they broke within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I felt like I needed an extra kick in my facial regiment. I found that my acne decreased and my face looks much better. I would recommend this product. The only thing I might recommend is spending the extra $10 for waterproof version.</li>
            <li> This is a cute and small electric brush but very affective. I got one for my friend as well and hope she likes it!</li>
            <li> This brush is ok for its price, maybe I haven&#x27;t used it enough to get to really like it. But the low speed is too low that when I&#x27;m trying to brush my face it kind of stops, and the high speed I can&#x27;t use everyday because it makes my face feel kind of dry. I haven&#x27;t used the rest of the attachments, so I don&#x27;t know yet how they work.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is a good one , but it should be able to go under water because usually its much easier to use it during the shower</li>
            <li> Kinda whimpy, but not much is really need to scrub ones face.</li>
            <li> This is amazing and such a good price!</li>
            <li> i love these electric cleaners. i couldnt find where to buy attachment heads for my relaxor so i bought this briteleaf as a back-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when i first took it out of its plastic storage container i thought oh wow, that&#x27;s incredibly cheap. its very light. i tried it. the pumice stone attachment went on fine, didnt snap though but didnt fall off either. turned it on high. it was very good speed. powerful and was the strength i was hoping for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is comparable to my older electric cleaner, slightly better because i like the small size and weight of it. it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the stellar reviews I was very dissapointed when I used the cleaning system. It&#x27;s a great concept with all the brushes and would be fine if it weren&#x27;t so underpowered. It runs off two AA batteries which is not enough juice IMHO. The low speed is useless and high works okay as long as you don&#x27;t apply any pressure, which will cause it to completely stop if too much pressure is applied. It might be enough power for females but not for males. I&#x27;m sending it back because I&#x27;d rather pay the shipping then use this for 2-3 months and have it crap out on me. Design it with a 110v and I&#x27;m a buyer!</li>
            <li> I a deployed soldier, I use this face spa scrubber, beacause of the harsh weather and dirt that accumalates on my face. I found its easy for me to travel with and I like the fact it is batterey operated, the handy travel case makes it easy for me to travel with and I use it once a week to get rid of all the dirt I get from the harsh living contitions, I also found that the scrubber does not bog down under mormal contioions.  the face scrubber brush it self does not scrach my face, so guys if you live like i do its worth it!! try it, I also use Retinol cream after use of the facial and im telling you my face is not dryed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CPL ESPOSITO&lt;br /&gt;US ARMY</li>
            <li> Love this! It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean . I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week so I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes in the appearance of my skin but I hope to see a cleaner clearer look as I continue with this product .</li>
            <li> I got the red marks other people said they were getting too. I wonder if I was using it to rough though. I see an esthetician who told me a spin brush is a spin brush, all work as good at the other. Did make my face feel clean, love putting on my face lotion with it.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> I use this product a lot. It makes my skin so smooth and has helped not to have blemishes. You can see that is really cleans the pours out.</li>
            <li> I tried several batteries to make sure that the lack of \\&quot;workage\\&quot; was the brush system. After three different batteries I decided that the product just did not work. Please consider other options. This was somewhat cheap and not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Too weak not enough power</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1MMI24QW6QIGM]]I bought this cleaning system only for the brush for my face.  The other day I used it on the low setting, then the high, and I got a cut on my face. So be careful when you are using it and don&#x27;t overdo it on the high setting like I did. However, it does rejuvenate your face and you can see the difference.  I have acne scars and when I use this 2-3 times a week they are less noticeable. I tried to use the pumice for my feet but IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR FEET.  If you have gotten a pedicure before you know what I mean; they usually hack at your feet vigorously so this really does nothing for your feet if you are looking for those same results.  I have not tried the nail buffer yet and the sponge doesn&#x27;t seem useful to me.  If you are buying this for your face then go for it! It takes two AA batteries and is a bit loud but is worth it and is compact.</li>
            <li> very cheap for a reason, broke instantly after two uses....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long and doesn&#x27;t contain all the parts. Doesn&#x27;t spin deeply at all,and not very safe due to the battery acid and the use of water. Disappointing product.</li>
            <li> She loves it.  Says the sponge attachment was nice. Her skin is glowing since she started using it. I am going to order one for myself.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try out this item, I wanted to see if using an electric brush would help improve my sin any verses using a washcloth or my hands. the first thing I noticed when shopping for a brush was how expensive these things are! so for the price I decided to try BriteLeafs. It sucks. It arrived within a week which is always nice, however the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting is useless, it rotates a few seconds and stops. Using the brush on \\&quot;high\\&quot; is not so bad, however if you use any amount of pressure it stops. If it gets any water in the space where the brush connects to the handle, it stops. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> The motor is a little slow. For the price its ok. My face did not feel any cleaner with this system.</li>
            <li> I thought this item would have been better based on the reviews but it is a pretty cheap little device. The brushes don&#x27;t really attach on, they fall off when you lean the device downward. It also is not that powerful, the medium speed has a hard time going unless you just lightly touch it to your skin. I rather have spent more for something better...</li>
            <li> right on par with the &#x27;&#x27;major brand&#x27;&#x27; very satisfied I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> As Advertised. Would buy again. Thank You for a smooth purchase. Everything as advertised. Wife Loves it. She wants 6 more just in case one Breaks.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this item but I actually really like it. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month now and use it with my Proactiv. My complexion looks clearer and my skin feels so soft after I&#x27;m done using it. I especially like all the attachments it comes with. Compared to similair products that cost twice as much I think this item is a real steal.</li>
            <li> No power very weak motor</li>
            <li> I love it as I feel my skin extremely clean after wash &amp; massage, I use it daily &amp; it was highly recommeded to buy.</li>
            <li> This item is cheap. It is made out of garbage. It will only last a month of use maybe a total of 15 times. I wish I would of never purchased this item. DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED IF YOU DO&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> The 4-in-1 is a one hundred dollar facial and body system for 1/4 of the price! No need to go any further for a budget friendly spa experience.</li>
            <li> So far I have only used the brush and the sponge. I also got a similar machine from Conair and the Conair one is not as nice as this one by BriteLeafs. I got this to help clear up Acne, and I don&#x27;t think it made a difference in my Acne at all but I do like the machine. My Acne has cleared up but I think it had been triggered by a change in cleansers so my BriteLeafs didn&#x27;t help, what did the trick was just switching cleansers again.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product.  The case is excellent for travelling, it is light weight and feels good in your hand.  Wish they had a larger brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this product for the cleaning aspect and nail filing uses.  I have very sensitive skin, so I find the faster speed to be too irritating.  I use the face brush on the lower setting several times per week.  The sponge is much more friendly for my skin.  I only rated it with 4 stars since the pumice stone feature is almost useless.  This was the primary reason I wanted this device since I expected it to allow me to keep my feet salon soft with minimal effort.  It does not because the unit does not have enough strength to truly pumice your feet.  If you apply any pressure, the unit stalls and would probably burn up the motor.</li>
            <li> This is a Must Have Item! My skin is in excellent condition! Great Buy! I have no problem with battery life nor the brushes! I prefer this one Over the expensive Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> The thing is already dead, had it for almost 2 months.  Thing rusted out on the inside.  Dead.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more, especially for the price. Even the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used before didn&#x27;t offer anything better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this product, I&#x27;m gonna keep it cause it was cheap and I hate going thru the hassle of mailing back things.. will wait to save money and buy a Clarasonic :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t utilized all of the uses of this product, but I believe they will all work well and do what I need done.  The product offers several options, rather than just cleansing the face, which I have done. I&#x27;m anxious to try all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\\\\\\\\</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended that I use an electric facial cleaning system, but the one she offered was very expensive. I chose this as an alternative. Great price and works well. I have been using it for about three weeks now. At first I did not use it every day because it dried my face out a little, but now I am using it everyday and love it. My face is smoother, clearer, and looks much better.</li>
            <li> i only gave four stars because it isnt water proff but other then that it cleans very well makes my face really smooth i really only use the scrubber but its good for the price</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter who has skin breakouts occasionally and compensates by pancaking her makeup. This of course leads to more breakouts if you are unable to clean your skin properly. For the price, this little machine removes makeup and dead skin very well!  She loves it and has fewer breakouts now , so she doesn&#x27;t pancake her foundation and powder anymore. One less adolescent problem to deal with!!</li>
            <li> after i used this product i loved it and i bought it for my daughter and my friend for the Christmas presents for them and now they loved it. now my face is cleaner and softer than before. i&#x27;m enying it every night.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this power facial scrubber - it was very highly rated. But now, after a few months, mine has already quit working and is on its way to the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problems:&lt;br /&gt;1) The attachments do not stay firmly on the unit. This is not a fatal flaw, but an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;2) The low setting is pointless. Sure, it rotates at that speed, but as soon as you touch anything the spinning stops. It&#x27;s also difficult to adjust if your fingers are wet.&lt;br /&gt;3) The fatal flaw was the switch broke, and I was unable to push it up into high again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My facial buff may be low-tech, but it never broke and never needed new batteries. I&#x27;m going back to that!</li>
            <li> Love this thing.  Large assortment of attachment heads.  I was considering Proactive just to get the free brush, but decided to look online just for the brush when I found this one.  Now I have the brush, without the Proactive and I am happy about that.</li>
            <li> The case easily broke. I accidentally dropped one of the attachments on the floor and right away the brush peeled off from the plastic. I had to buy a super glue to put it back together. It&#x27;ll do for your face but you can always spend a little more for something better. I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with it though.</li>
            <li> Its not really powerful, but it is quiet. Its the only nail device I&#x27;ve been able to use on my LhasaTzu, who has Very Sensitive Hearing...So Yeah! I use the pink head on her nails. It sure is Petite and Cute.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth the money. Don&#x27;t go pay any more for one, this one does everything you need it for.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get ripped off and purchase one of those high dollar ones when this one does the same thing.</li>
            <li> Although I had an issue with the seller it was quickly resolved to my satisfaction, great customer service.  This is a Christmas gift so I cannot rate the product itself at this time.  I hope it works as well as most of the reviews state.</li>
            <li> This brush is really small, it is not as large as it appears in the picture.  I thought that I was going to be getting a large head brush, about as big as a back scrubber&#x27;s head, that I could use as a power brush to scrub my back with.  This thing will almost fit into the palm of my hand.  It&#x27;s only about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide and the scrubbing head on the brush is about an inch in diameter.  I guess that I should have paid more attention to the specification about it&#x27;s size instead of trying to go off of the picture.  The brush maybe ok for scrubbing some soap onto your face.  But, I haven&#x27;t found a lot of use for it, and have only used it once.  This brush moves very slowly when it rotates, maybe because that&#x27;s the hardest that it can pull with the AA battery power. They should have included an ac adapter to help the brush move faster, (for those who want more power behind the brush).  On the first use, and only after a little use the pumice rock fell off of the plastic part that it was attached to.  The seller sent me a new pumice rock and free new small brush when I wrote them and asked for it!  Altogether, I didn&#x27;t get that much out of the brush and it definitely wasn&#x27;t what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> This was the best decision I have made for my skin, this product is worth much more than I paid, I stick by the product and really am happy with the way the scrub leaves my face very clean, it goes way under the pores and leaves my skin radiant with its buffer. You will be pleased with the results instantly. My husband used it after he had applied sun screen&lt;br /&gt;Through out the day, and he said he felt the refreshing feel it left after first use.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. You get what you pay for, so you can&#x27;t expect miracles. Probably could achieve the same results with a washcloth.</li>
            <li> Very good my wife really likes the way It works on her face.</li>
            <li> First of all, do not expect a $20.00 to perform like a $200.00 product. Now that I&#x27;ve said that, this product is decent for the money. I bought this product as a preview before I spend my money on the more expensive set. So here it goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;4 interchangeable brushes/items&lt;br /&gt;easy to use&lt;br /&gt;brush heads are just firm enough (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not powerful at all&lt;br /&gt;Not water proof&lt;br /&gt;Takes batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew the cons before I bought the device so I wasn&#x27;t surprised by that. I like the device because it did what I needed it to do and that was exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s how I use the device:&lt;br /&gt;I clean my makeup off my face before using this device in order to keep the brush head cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;I make sure my face is damp before I begin using the device.&lt;br /&gt;I do not apply any pressure while cleaning, I allow the brush to rotate and exfoliate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I change the brush into the buffing sponge and apply my moisturizer directly to the sponge.&lt;br /&gt;I allow the device to rotate without applying any pressure.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is extremely soft which is what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the other items that come with the device because you cannot apply pressure to the unit without it stopping or making some type of weird noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final thought is do not expect too much from this device but it is a good way to prepare your skin for a more expensive device. I have just ordered the episonic facial cleansing system and I will compare the two once it arrives.  Episonic is $189.00 but groupon has it available for $59.99 right now! I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I can definitely see the difference in my skin after using this for a week. This thing is awesome. I originally got it to just help with exfoliation, but after reading reviews I decided to use it everynight with regular facial cleansing. I used the soap I usually use on the scrubbing pad (low setting) and the moisturizer I usually use with the sponge (on high setting), and the results have been great. My skin looks really healthy! My acne is still here and there sometimes, but my skin looks so much better that it doesn&#x27;t even seem to hurt my appearance as much as it would have before. The nail file attachment is useful for taking off sharp edges, and I have found the pumice works if you follow the directions that come with it. Awesome little set for $20.</li>
            <li> I use it often. Good product for sensitive skin.  I would recommend it to get rid of dry, dead skin.</li>
            <li> I got this in a week which was great i been using it and it works well the only thing is that I wished it was bigger but still does it work after using. Your face feels great I have just used the brush and the sponge I use the sponge to put on mosterizer  over all it works great and if you think of getting it go for it :)</li>
            <li> definitely BUY THIS!!! i use it almost every night because if you a lot of it at night every night, your face tends to get dry so moisturize your face after you go to bed and you skin is healthy and refreshed! hope you guys like it, it works for me! and i am picky..</li>
            <li> I use mine every day and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. At first I was skeptical because it cost so much less than most others.  Thankfully it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I love this SPA treatment system!  Ive tried other, more expensive systems and this one works just as well as any. I like that it has so many attachments as well! Having a system that uses batteries is more convenient than having a charger sitting on my counter taking up space. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this thing almost everyday. It is great for exfoliating her skin and making it feel nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product! Face feels cleaner, love attachment variety.  Can&#x27;t wait to use pumas stone on my heels.  Sponge attachment very soothing to face.  2 speeds. Great storage case.</li>
            <li> Works well in aqueous conditions</li>
            <li> I received my product in a very timely manner. I have been using it religiously and I like it very much. I think it works as well as any of the more expensive ones. I am very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li> what to say its a very hight quality product it makes your face as a baby skin , easy to use at home</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product! Inexpensive and does the job! Glad I purchased this instead of paying hundreds of dollars for a clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!!!! I would definitely consider buying additional products like this..</li>
            <li> First shipment stopped working after a few days. Appeared as if one attachment may have been used though. The second one seemed new and has been working pretty well.</li>
            <li> works great, as well as more expensive one</li>
            <li> So, I bought this because of the price and the easy removed attachments. But one of my attachments wasn&#x27;t in properly and fell down got broken on my bathroom floor. I also had a hard time to clean the sponge after one use so I guess I have to buy one. The power is fine, easy to handle and I would recommend it but just be careful with the pieces.</li>
            <li> I received this item earlier than expected date! Im sooo inlove with this! It really exfolliates my face! Before i got this kind of brush from a famous beauty and cosmetics product but sad to say i forgot it when i was at cali, and that one is so expensive! But when i got this,the brush is really really the same with what i had before, but i got a lil disappointment with these because it is not waterproof, and i cant take/use it during shower time! But still ok! And still love this!</li>
            <li> I found and find the product an outstanding value with a 100% rate of performance as stated.  In short, I enjoy using this product daily and have shared this fact with family.  It is a staple in my skin cleaning regiment!</li>
            <li> Failed! This product is a waste of money.  This product work for a short time approx 5 min then it requires new battery. The motor has very little torque.</li>
            <li> This product is very powerful for its size. it does a good job of stimulating the skin and is convenient for travel.</li>
            <li> I love this facial brush it works great and doesn&#x27;t go through batteries quick.  I could use the same batteries for at least a month.  It was a great price and the shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to recived on time then I will going to gift to some body. But I thing is fine, for now thank you.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t bad but I think that the other brushes aren&#x27;t necessary, for my case, because I only bought this for the facial cleansing. The facial cleansing is okay as well, but I think I need a different brush size in order to have better results.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this fun little kit for my face.&lt;br /&gt;And it works far better than a wash cloth or my hands.&lt;br /&gt;I have used the high speed and the low speed and each works as described.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to try it on my feet.</li>
            <li> I love this kit.  The facial brush and sponge are both gentle but effective.  It leaves my skin with a clean look and feel.  Excellent product and a great price.</li>
            <li> I need a gentle way to exfoliate and smooth very dry sensitive skin.  Exfoliating cloths left flaky skin behind.  Vigorous rubbing with my fingertips raised blisters.  The BriteLeafs body brush and soft sponge did the trick.  The device is gentle yet effective.  I used the brush and sponge after a shower and they left my skin nice and smooth.  The pumice attachment is also nice.  At first it seems like the surface area of the heads is too small, but they are actually just right. I was afraid this might be a weak, flimsy product but it is not.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is not waterproof but because of the 4 batteries it still works better than most of the other products.  Do not use it under running water and it will be OK.  First one rusted out, ordered another, will be more careful and hang it in front of bathroom fan after use.</li>
            <li> Better than a Clarasonic.  I have used both and this one is hands down the best ever.  Would recommend to people.</li>
            <li> Brite Leafs 4-in-1 Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System, was the best purchase I&#x27;ve made.  Using it on the face leaves your skin so smooth.  It truly has a clean feeling after each use.  The other applications are just as good too.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for something that will clean and exfoliate from head to toe!</li>
            <li> i ordered 2 of these, i like but i spent to much time with it on my face and the brissels are hard so it scraped my skin off so now i have a mark on my face...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more powerful but it still works and makes my skin feel really good and smooth after i use it. I dropped it on my ceramic tile bathroom floor and it still works so it is durable</li>
            <li> Product had useful attachments, but it did not run when it arrived. I was not the only reviewer who had that expderience</li>
            <li> Your shipping was great this product works awesome I should have bought this a long time ago,my face is so much cleaner way better than a wash rag,I work in a machine shop with oil everywhere this cleans!! My face excellent,I would recommend this to everyone..</li>
            <li> it broke after 1 week</li>
            <li> The cleansing brush makes my face feel fresh and stimulated.  I just used the nail buffer to give myself a manicure, and it&#x27;d did a good job.  It would be nice to have one more attachment--a smooth nail buffer to make the nails shine--the only reason to make my evaluation a 4star instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I ordered this a while back but just started using it more regularly. The brush is not as soft as some other brushes but doesn&#x27;t scratch or irritate my skin which is really sensitive. I have used the foam head once or twice but none of the other attachments. This gets the job done well and I feel like it does remove all make up and dirt leaving my skin feeling and looking clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago, and I think it&#x27;s pretty good. It cleans my face pretty well, and it even comes with its own little case so I can take it with me when I travel. It most definitely isn&#x27;t waterproof, and I could tell right away it was easy to break. But to be honest, that didn&#x27;t prove to be too much of an issue. As long as your not clumsy with it and your not using it in the shower, you&#x27;re golden!!</li>
            <li> worked good for about a week then stopped working . Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> A gift for my daughter.  She says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; but the batter runs out quickly, or it&#x27;s just not powerful enough regardless of battery quality.  So I guess it&#x27;s just ok.  When they get the power inside it, it will truly be &amp;#34;amazing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have only used the face brush, but I like it.  Gentle cleansing feeling.  The set looks kind weak but it is actually ok...</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made.  Once applied to the skin it stops massaging with any pressure.  I dropped it and it shattered into pieces after less than a week.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price!&lt;br /&gt;The suction power is poor!&lt;br /&gt;I think it horrible to require a certain amount of words from us to describe whether we like a product or not.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and it so easy yo take care of and I just love how my face feels when I finishes cleaning my face. It feels soft and so refreshed. It is so worth the money!!! I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used a facial / body brush before...now I wonder what I was waiting for. After just one use my skin is glowing!!! Also LOVE the pumice for removing all the gross dead skin on my feet.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by the price, but when I received the product was pleased with the way it worked.  I was able to do the job with properly cleaning my face.  I am using it with proactive products.</li>
            <li> Good, good, although my elderly electric facial product still works and the brushes from the new on can&#x27;t be transferred to the older model.</li>
            <li> It feel on the floor and NEVER worked again.</li>
            <li> Works well, as advertised.</li>
            <li> great gift ... my wife loved it ... excellent product</li>
            <li> This is a very nice set in a handy case, lightweight yet effective.  I bought it to massage my face gently and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> My skin feels amazing after I use this on my face. When I first started it up it sounded like it was struggling to spin and I was certain that it wasn&#x27;t going to do anything but I was very pleasantly proved wrong! I even bought one for my mom after and she lives it too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Gentle enough for my sensitive skin yet strong enough to exfoliat my skin.  I use a gel cleanser  just add my cleanser wet face and let the facial scrubber do the work. Gently move in circles over whole face,  than rinse and your done.  I used it to remove my make up too.  I used my favorite make up remover gel and it really cleaned all the make-up off my face. Finished with a good moistizer and done. My daughter says my skin looks clearer and brighter. Don&#x27;t bother with the overpriced ones,  this little facial scrubber is well worth the price. You don&#x27;t want one that&#x27;s too powerful or you will end up irritating your skin and damaging it.&lt;br /&gt;This facial scrubber is very gentle and I have very sensitive skin even the brush on high setting does not irritate my skin!  Just love this product</li>
            <li> Its cheap and it works!!!&lt;br /&gt;Rather then the original that cost over $200</li>
            <li> For the price point, this is actually a really good product. I was skeptical at first but it works fine and I really like that there are multiple attachments. I like the face brush the best... If I am starting to break out, I&#x27;ll use the brush for a day or two and usually my skin starts to clear up right away. I also recently tried the pumice attachment. It works a lot better if your feet have been soaked for a few min first. I was impressed. My boyfriend wants to steal it for his feet. I didn&#x27;t really like the nail file attachment but maybe it would just take some getting used to. I used the skin massager sponge a couple times but after the brush, I don&#x27;t need it. My skin is pretty sensitive so I didn&#x27;t want to overdo it.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it deep in but is still gentle. The rotating help remove blackheads and dry skin. The more often its used the better and more clear your complexion becomes, I&#x27;ve alreadt recommended to my daughter and son.</li>
            <li> Nice product for facial or foot use</li>
            <li> When I read the directions on the box, they said that my facial brush is not water tight.  What??? I can&#x27;t use this brush in the shower which is where I was my face.</li>
            <li> I really like having four different applicators. The facial brush exfoliates well. But, it has fallen off of the the applicator twice. On the other hand, the facial massage brush stays on during use all the time and does a good job.  The nail polisher does an average job. I have not used the pumice yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with anticipation of getting some inexpensive, self help for my skin.  The product arrived, and I put new batteries in.  Nothing happened.  This product--or at least the one they sent me--doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed.  I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s worth the hastle of trying to return it, so I lost the $20 plus it cost me.</li>
            <li> It was worth the money. Nothing spectacular but good for its price and it does the basic so I won&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I love this product ! It has all the attachments needed to do everything you want to do. I used the buffer on my elbows and it worked like magic! Buffed put lotion on abd my elbows are back to normal . And my face feels awesome! LOVE IT! And the price is out of this world! BUY IT YOU WON&#x27;T HE SORRY!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have been using it for about 1 wk now and my skin feels softer, smother and less black heads. I only would fix one thing and that would be to make it water proof.</li>
            <li> So far I am very happy with this, the facial scrub is very nice and I like that there are two brushes for the face. One is for a deeper scrub and I like being able to have both options.  They both feel good and do a good job.  The nail brush is nice and smooths the nails well.  The foot brush is probably the least effective but does smooth out some of the rough spots.  I have used this on the stronger setting most of the time as the lower setting doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power.  Overall I like it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great item for keeping your face clean and taken care as well as coming in a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> This product was received in good time and functioned as promised. I am entirely satisfied with all aspects of this purchase. To the customer that complained that the brush fell off the handle, I can only say that it doesn&#x27;t fall off if you put it on correctly.</li>
            <li> This product is pure garbage !! During my first few uses I figured the motor was just slow then after maybe the fifth use it stopped working completely. I changed the battery thinking it was that but it wasn&#x27;t. This facial brush is NOT worth buying. CHEAP...CHEAP...CHEAP. I would&#x27;ve returned but I throw the box away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adequate for the a quick leaning.  It does the job when we are in a hurry and need a quick cleaning.</li>
            <li> this was inexpensive and does the job, especially for oily skin.  delivered quickly and was as advertised at a fair price.&lt;br /&gt;have not used the pumice attachment, just for  basic deep cleaning</li>
            <li> Runs great, Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. All in all great product. You can save some money if you don&#x27;t want to spent 50+ Dollars.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase. I wasnt ready to pay $100 for the name brand so I decided to try this first. Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> The facial/body brush spa cleaning system is great!  It is gentle yet effective.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was soooo excited about this facial brush until I got ready to turn it on and I watched it begin to smoke and burn in my hand.  Thank God I turned it on away from my face and hair first to make sure the brush was spinning properly.  Wasn&#x27;t even worth the headache of trying to send it back but I will NEVER purchase from this store again.</li>
            <li> This is crappy, it has only one speed and it was basically broken.  Would not recommend this item even if it was free.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in a good time and is exactly the same as the picture. I have not yet had the chance to experience it but I&#x27;m look forward to doing so.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how affordable this was and worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Works awesome very good cleaning on my pores for blackheads!</li>
            <li> No, did not like at all!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  Something small and lightweight that can be tucked away in a carry on bag but still powerful enough to do a good job.  I&#x27;m very satisfied!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good deal for the price. I got this system just to see how my sensitive and hard to shop for skin would react to being cleaned with a brush instead of just hands. Turns out, this works pretty well! I always used it on the high setting because the low one didn&#x27;t seem to accomplish much. after a few days of using it I did see a difference - my acne scars were fading, I wasn&#x27;t breaking out any more at all (which is unusual to me), and my skin was just overall glowing - even my best friend noticed. I moved on to clarisonic Mia but I will probably still be using this from time to time - just because it feels good and it works well too.</li>
            <li> I like this little face cleanser the only reason I gave it four stars and not five is because it didn&#x27;t come with batteries!!! Other than that it&#x27;s a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> Started clearing up my skin within the end of the week. So drastic results and cleared skin by end of the month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 4 days but I have already noticed a difference in my skin. It does a great job of deeply cleaning my skin, and it makes it much easier to apply my moisturizer afterwards. I do the slower speed for general cleaning and then use the faster setting over my problem areas where i&#x27;ve been getting acne, and its helped a lot. i haven&#x27;t had any new major breakouts. I have only tried the face brush but i&#x27;m gunna try the sponge soon and toenail buffer. Yes, it looks and feels a bit cheap, but whats important is that it does what it is meant to do which i think it does. I keep it in its case so that it doesn&#x27;t get wet so it will last longer. I recommend you try it before deciding to spend $200 or more on a clarasonic! This product is only $15 and an amazing dupe.</li>
            <li> This facial massage is a great product.  I like the fact that it is compact, has a compact container, and easily used for traveling.  The easy attachments comes on and off without any problem.  The 4 attachments makes it very versatile for many uses.  The speed of the massager with a new battery is great.  It provides 2 speeds with enough revolutions to massage your skin.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it a perfect 5 star is because the brush attachment appears to wearing out sooner than I expected.  The brush bristles is starting to fold in the middle and most likely I may have to get another replacement soon.  I would suggest a more firmer bristles or maybe have a soft one and a firmer one included.  Overall, I like the product and would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as advertised and exactly what I needed at a good price for a product that I had never tried before.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it at least 1-2 x per week and it works like magic! Skin feels soft and looks radiant after. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This Item is NOT water proof, so you can&#x27;t use it in the shower. However it is a okay starter brush. The stone broke after 3 days, and the sponge was not that great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help get rid of milia-cysts in the delicate area beneath my eye, and only 10 days after getting it, they are already gone.  Can&#x27;t ask for better than that!  Two months of exfoliating by hand with a facial scrub did nothing; using the exfoliation brush on this device 4x in a week did the trick.  Also, my teenage daughter has used the sponge attachment to help remove theater make-up after every show, and I&#x27;ve seen an improvement in her acne breakouts. Again, in just a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, there is a certain \\&quot;cheapness\\&quot; about this product.  There&#x27;s no release button to remove the attachments -- you just have to yank really hard.  I could see that causing something to break eventually, since it&#x27;s only made of plastic.  But for the price ... meh. I can replace it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried the Clarisonic and loved it. I couldn&#x27;t rationalize the price tag, so I thought I could get a substitute product and have similar results. This isn&#x27;t even close. The bristles feel harsher and the motor doesn&#x27;t have near the level of power of the Clarisonic Mia. The pumice attachment broke on the first use (stone came off of the attachment). I should have bought the Mia, and I plan to do so.</li>
            <li> Up until purchasing this product, I used Target facial scrub.  Does a better job than this does.  Product just doesn&#x27;t have any power.</li>
            <li> I really liked my electric cleaning system and I have only used one brush so far. It helps me wash my face in no time. I recommend it for all the people who have little time.</li>
            <li> Works very nicely, and  can&#x27;t beat the price! I wanted to try this before &amp;#34;investing&amp;#34; in a high end brush. But now no need, I will stick with this little beauty! And if she fails down the road, I will just buy another! I will still be way ahead of the game!</li>
            <li> Expected a little more but it serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.  Makes my face feel so smooth and silky getting off all that dead skin.  If I had the money I would love to buy it for all of my family for stocking stuffers.  Not that it matters but I love the color that it comes in a soft plum Dusty plum.  Cleans very well and I think the motor has plenty of ump</li>
            <li> It broke in the 1st month. It wasnt worth it, I bought one for CVS that was a better quality.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this item because I saw alot of commercials on TV advertising this microdermabrasion facial brush. But those were over a $100 dollars! This brush is probably just as good as those so this is a great buy! The first time I used it I noticed how soft and radiant my skin looked. My co-worker actually asked me that following day what I had done differently that morning because my face looked really nice. Also, I have a moderate acne problem and when I first started using the brush it did irratate my skin alittle bit. However, after using it for 3 weeks now, I haven&#x27;t had a break out in 2 weeks! I definately would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Seriously, I reccomend buying this product. It has done wonders for my face, I only got it yesterday. My face was in terrible shape; Blackheads, oily, break outs all over..It was terrible. Then I got this baby and put it to use..My skin feels wonderful. Please, It&#x27;s worth every penny:)</li>
            <li> No where in the product description is there a measurement as to how small/large of a device you are buying.  Obviously, you cannot tell from the sales picture, so I was surprised at how small it was when I opened the package.  I have used a facial brush in the past which was more than twice the size of this.  This does work. It is rather cheaply made and I have no idea how long it will last since I have only used it for a couple of weeks. The battery operated motor it little more than a toy so that if you press too hard on your skin it will stop moving. I will continue to use this one until it falls apart.  However, I will invest the money in a better product next time.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this.  I was burned and need to exfoliate regularly.  This works great, it has two speeds and the multiple heads are great.</li>
            <li> Very low power and capability.  Pretty much useless for anything.  I would not recommend this item.  Would be better to pay more and get something better that could do the job.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery..... I love the product ,it&#x27;s pretty powerful compared to others I bought now I&#x27;m going to buy one for my daughter,100% recommended!</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 for presents to women fighting the aging process. We use it primarily to stimulate collagen production and it works wonderfully</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time but it was cost prohibitive.  I got a great price on this product and it really works great.  My face feels so clean.  I have not tried the other attachments yet but I think I will be satisfied.  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> This brush is great, not too rough, though cleans the skin very well.  I love the purple color too!  Leaves skin glowing!</li>
            <li> Real good product. Easy to use. Does a good job. Real nice price. I would buy it again. Easy to store.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my grand daughter, It works perfect and she loves it. It has a lot of extras that come with it. A great value cost wise and durability, Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who was looking to replace one of a different brand which no longer worked.  She said that it works as intended and liked the fact that it came with different attachments.</li>
            <li> Works great I really like it. I have never used a clarisonic but this works just fine. I would recommend to friends</li>
            <li> I was contemplating wether to buy one of those mia expensive brush, so glad I decided to try brite leaf. It is an excellent brush for the money.&lt;br /&gt;My little con: thought it was electric and not battery operated....... Oh well still loving my brush, it feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for the scrubber re-placement sponge, by mistake.  I meant the&lt;br /&gt;review for the full cleaning system, which I felt was quite a rip-off.  A wash-cloth,&lt;br /&gt;which can be put in the cloth-washer, is more sanitary than this electric scrubber&lt;br /&gt;and just as effective. A skin brightening daily scrub, for exfoliation, is a much better&lt;br /&gt;way of cleaning your face.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a face brush because I felt my beauty routine was lacking something. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money so after looking around I came across this product and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I did it! I know they are better products out there but if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money then this is your thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The one I use the most is the head with the bristles. I use it with my facial cleanser and it works wonders. It&#x27;s a little on the rough side so if you have sensitive skin this may hurt you a bit. But every time after I&#x27;m done I see that the foam is not white but the color of my make up so I know its removing every single bit of make up which never happened using my fingers alone.&lt;br /&gt;  The sponge head is pretty much useless for me. It&#x27;s not rough enough to clean anything but maybe if you like face massages this could be nice for you.&lt;br /&gt;  I like the nail buffer because I&#x27;m so lazy that I hate filing my fingernails and this makes it super easy and fast. The last head, the one for your feet, I haven&#x27;t tried so I can&#x27;t say much about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I have noted some improvement on my skin but it&#x27;s hard to tell if this is the culprit as I also started using a couple of new products for my face. One thing I can say for sure is that my face is absolutely clean now.</li>
            <li> I have to say that when I received this product, the motor was very slow but without even asking, the company was nice enough to send me a second one and I really appreciate a company that still understands good business.  The newer one is stronger and I really like it.  Thanks again for being one of the fewer companies that stands behind their products.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once or twice but it works ok, i would recommand it for others to clean your face and feet</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. I had the pricey version prior to this and this item surpasses it. I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> So this item is used for face and body cleansing, buffing, and polishing; however, the directiosn clearly state that it should not get wet.  It was not a good product for me as the advertisement that I saw indicated that it could get wet. None the less, I only used it a few times.</li>
            <li> This came exactly as it was described. It works great! I like the brush tool and moisturizing tool the best.</li>
            <li> it was fine until it broke 3 months later. used 3 times a week even with new batteries it would not turn on anymore. it did it&#x27;s job very well while it lasted. the brushes seem to hold onto the dirt and grime spreading that over your face. I had to constantly stop rinse the brush and start again which was annoying more than anything. looking for a different kind of facial brush. cannot justify the cost of clarsonic search continues</li>
            <li> This product works but simply does not have much power even on the high setting and with new batteries.  Maybe that&#x27;s reasonable for the low price.</li>
            <li> I bought these as gifts, everyone thrilled</li>
            <li> Good price my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive product, it works well.  It leaves my face feeling soft and clean.  I got it specifically to scrub my face, so I couldn&#x27;t tell you about the other changeable heads you can use for other grooming aspects.</li>
            <li> The product is not as powerful as i hoped it would be but i guess for the price it is ok</li>
            <li> I saw reviews and some people said it was too weak for them, so I was worried but I actually disagree completely! I expected the brush to be softer but it&#x27;s like a toothbrush. The first time I used it, it hurt a bit. But I used it the next day with a different method and it was fine. I can feel my skin being a lot cleaner than when I wash with my hands. I use a makeup removing cleanser with this brush and it gets the job done perfectly (except eye makeup of course). I suggest this to teenagers and people who are in need of a cleansing brush with a budget! But if you have money, don&#x27;t waste it on this and splurge on the Clarasonic. They last for years!</li>
            <li> This product did not work. I tried 2 different sets of batteries, and it still did not work. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This item is better than I thought it would be.  It has a nice massaging feeling- it did not feel too hard or soft on my face- just right.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for callus control. However, the motor and power source are so weak, it can only be effective on the most sensitive areas of skin, such as face and neck. For those purposes, it is adequate, but I would not put too much stake in getting any benefit from the pumice attachments.</li>
            <li> This compact little device is wonderful it buffs your complexion invigorating collagen reproduction. Makes your skin glow. I love that it came in a nice small compact case with multiple attachments if you so desire. Personally I just use the soft brush with a gentle foaming cleanser and it is just perfect.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had hoped but good</li>
            <li> typical Christmas present, i fully expect it to get used like crazy for a couple weeks, then retired to the dungeon under the sink where all gadgets end up.</li>
            <li> Perfect size for me! and i like how it came with different heads. I mostly used the brush for use in exfoliating my face. I had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of beauty products so I was pleased with this one. It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> The head comes off. Ive used it a few times and every time i was annoyed. Not very convenient its just sitting around somewhere in my house now.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product for it&#x27;s quality, service and value above all others..&lt;br /&gt;It deserves a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife. She has had hand surgery and had problems that didn&#x27;t allow her to grip sponges and other things to clean her face. She is delighted with the BrightLeafs 4 in 1 and says it is the best thing she has in her personal cleansing kit.&lt;br /&gt; A+++ for the product.</li>
            <li> I want to love this, but it broke apart in the shower after a few days so I need a new one.</li>
            <li> love this product ! Would def purchase again !!!!</li>
            <li> When I use this it makes my face so soft. Its very gentle. It has two settings which is also nice. Great price.</li>
            <li> I found that this product works well for me and the price is better than other similar products. Well worth it. Love the facial exfoliator</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughters and they have only been using it for a few weeks but its working well enough according to them. I am not sure how it will work in the long run but it was worth the money so far.</li>
            <li> My daughters are entering that age when facial skin care is crucial and this 4-in-1 brush does the job wonderfully! They love working with it.</li>
            <li> I like the product, I like the case that it sit in thats why I picked it out, however make sure you use good batteries. I&#x27;m very happy with it and thank you</li>
            <li> I have not actually used this item yet.  I am planning on using it tomorrow, but it is exactly what I thought it was and have used something similar</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this...Not strong enough and I don&#x27;t know why they mention &amp;#34;the face and the body&amp;#34; in their ad. You can only use it for your face and so far it doesn&#x27;t satisfy me.</li>
            <li> I only use the brush and the sponge applicator of this product.  May use the other attachments in the future.  This is not a battery hog.  The brush is soft on the face but does the job in removing dead skin cells.  Does sponge infuse the creams into my face?  I do not know but I do know that any gentle massage on my face with stimulate the facial muscles.  You have your choice between slow and semi-fast for speeds and if you press too hard the machine shuts down.  This is a nice feature.  I get regular facial massages about twice a month; but it is nice to know that I can take care of my facial skin each morning with out great fuss.</li>
            <li> The only problem I found was that it isn&#x27;t waterproof. That would have been a bonus since that&#x27;s where I like to exfoliate at but it still was a good product.</li>
            <li> Great! Really good! If you are using it for the first time, I suggest you start with low speed. It is really good. My skin is smooth and clean after using it. It is cleaner than before.</li>
            <li> Had this for over a month now, I can see the difference in my skin. It ISN&#x27;T waterproof, so that&#x27;s the only downside, but it really does a great job on cleaning my face (I usually only use it for face), my pores are noticeably smaller and my face feels so fresh after using it!</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with the spa cleaner!  I have used both the. Facial cleansing brush and the pedicure stone tool.  Both worked very well and I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item a week ago it came in the mail yesterday.  I used it for the first time last night and this morning and I noticed a difference already hope this work out for me I&#x27;ve been trying everything to get rid of my blackhead problem. I will recommend this brush I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Good all in one for the price</li>
            <li> Great little facial scrub brush for the price.  Love that it has several accessory heads that come with it.  This was perfect for my 13 year old daughter!</li>
            <li> The brush add on was so rough on my face! I had redness for a week.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and learned exfoliating should decrease breakouts. When I use this product my skin feels softer and more refreshed! I haven&#x27;t used all the components yet but was happy to find a round for my nails and feet. The product is more compact that I expected, and comes with a plastic case similar to a glasses case to keep everything together. In the end I like how compact it is, as it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space in my cabinets.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know the purpose of it besides for the face. I tried to use on my 3 year old feet, but it doesn&#x27;t work, it stops all the time. I guess it is definitely only for face, but I still don&#x27;t see the purpose of it.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.  Wife used it once and said it was junk.</li>
            <li> The brush head works well at defoliating dry skin.  I Haven&#x27;t had  the time to really try all the functions out.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift an, I had one myself. She loves it, it cleans wonderfully, and has held up for everyday use for a year.&lt;br /&gt;glenda Kottsick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. But it&#x27;s the identical stuff as the 7.99 ones. Such a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;do not ever use &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; on your face. it will hurt your face very bad.</li>
            <li> This is really tiny lol. It isnt water proof so you cant use this inside the shower which im annoyed by also it says facial &amp; body brush however there is no body brush attachment and the device isnt waterproof so you guys might want to fix the name because that is false advertisement..... but it does the job i guess i just needed something to clean my pores so its doing the job so far. Anyone who doesnt want a fancy face brush i would reccommend this</li>
            <li> The item is exactly how it was described and works great. Will buy more products in the future. great item</li>
            <li> This product seemed to actually improve my skin.  Unfortunately the one I received had a problem with a poorly functioning switch.  I must say that the seller was very concerned about my problem and promptly offered a replacement or refund.</li>
            <li> This was smaller than I expected but so far it does the job and for the price you cant beat it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;{edit 01/12/14}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the pumice stone attachment, even on the high speed it&#x27;s not fast enough to really smooth out any calluses on your feet.  The nail buffer pad didn&#x27;t seem to do much of anything either.  I have a PedEgg that works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use the facial brush attachment to deep clean my pores...I use it with a facial scrub (even on high power it has never scratched my skin and I have sensitive skin) to deep clean my pores.  Then I use the facial sponge attachment to put lotion on my face, leaves my face feeling clean and soft and helps with minor acne issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re mainly buying this to use on your face, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> This was a great product to purchase. I had never gotten a brush like this so I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Now that I&#x27;m using it my face feels tighter and cleaner.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenager. She seems to be using it  but hasn&#x27;t given me any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Great product and the size is perfect, the first use a couple of the bristles came off on my face while using it but that only happen once.....I use this everyday and no more bristles has fallen</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best cleaning system. Since I bought this product I mean after first of January 2013,  I used it four times and I have very smooth and clear skin.</li>
            <li> I used this facial scrubber daily for about 2 months then it broke. My  husband was able do repair it, but I feel it should have lasted longer for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small than I the picture shows.  The attachments don&#x27;t want to stay on, but if you put your cleaner on first the put your insert in it;s fine.  Just don&#x27;t flip it back down.</li>
            <li> The system has many different tips and it comes in a nice compact case to travel with. I&#x27;m glad I got this and has many uses other then face cleaning. Just make sure you keep it dry as its not water proof.</li>
            <li> This was given to my mother as a gift and she really loved it. Its functional purposes are working properly. I have a question that I have been wondering, however. Are there any other interchangeable attachments readily sold elsewhere to add to this kit of brushes and attachments?</li>
            <li> It has worked as well as the ones that cost over $100. I am very satified with how the product performs and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. It feels my needs.</li>
            <li> This cleansing and exfoliating brush system is exactly what I wanted. My skin feels softer and more moisturized. I look forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with exfoliation during the winter months and it works well.  I am 30 years old, acne prone, and it helped to clear my skin.  I agree with other uses that it is not super powerful- I use the sponge and the brush for my face which works fine but the callus stone and nail buffers don&#x27;t have enough power to be effective.  If you are looking for a cheaper option to other at home exfoliation options, this is a great choice.</li>
            <li> Love BRITELEAFS facial and body scrubber. Works great !</li>
            <li> Could be a little stronger but made face feel fresh and clean. havent had a chance to use file yet. pore cleaner i got w not very good but works alittle</li>
            <li> loved it a lot it cleans the face and keep it smooth and fresh. it easy to use and very convince and can carry it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Wow! This little gem is a spa at your fingertips!! It comes in a cute compact case perfect for home storage or travel. I love the fact that this one little gaget saves me from having to pack more in an over night bag! I love the feel of the facial brush and sponge! I am 40 and having a great exfoliater is where it&#x27;s at on fighting fine lines! Switching out the heads is effortless, and in a blink I can have a mani and a pedi.  A compact facial, mani and pedi all in one??? Really? How can it possibly get better than that! Make sure to have double A batteries ready as this does not come with batteries ; you are going to want to experience this treasure the moment you get it! This will make perfecf affordable gifts!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. My skin has been extremely dry and damaged from chemotherapy and I have seen drastic improvements over the past week just from using this.</li>
            <li> I bought the BriteLeaf  Electric Facial &amp; Body Spa Cleaning System for my twin sister for her birthday and she enjoys the spa and acknowledged that her face looked cleaner and smoother.  She noticed the same results on her other body parts and liked the different attachments.  The disappointment of using batteries and not being able to plug the spa into an outlet diminished when she saw how powerful and effective this spa was.  It&#x27;s just the right size and and it has no cord, so you can get to every area of your body. The brush dosen&#x27;t irritate your skin and it is a smart buy for the performance and price.</li>
            <li> I have been having a problem with getting acne in my t zone area on my forehead so I invested in this exfoliating brush and a good exfoliator scrub and the two together once or twice a week has been great! I have only had this a little over a week, and I can see it helping. My face feels so much softer, and my acne is slowly diminishing, I absolutely love it! Be careful to not over use it because it can start to peel off needed layers to your skin. Everyones skin is different and face sensitivity will vary.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product would be good for exfoliating, but I gave it a chance for the price. During my first use i scratched my face twice but I was happy with how clean my face was. For $25 this product more than did it&#x27;s job, I just wish there was a warning on the label that tells the consumer that pressing too hard could cause scratches.</li>
            <li> I as in no way disappointed with my BriteLeafs Cleaning System however one of the brushes came apart after a few uses.  I emailed the vendor and without delay they replaced the brush which works fine.  This was well worth the money and I was delighted with the speed in which the vendor addressed my issue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hardly worth it, just the slightest pressure and the motor stops.  I would not recommend this knock off brand.</li>
            <li> Im sorry to say I was not happy with the product. It did not work upon arrival and did not know how to return it for a refund. I was embarrassed because it had been a gift. I would just like my money back.</li>
            <li> Does the surface brushing well and they have good customer service.  The horsepower on the brush was a bit weak.  Over all it&#x27;s OK&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the pieces where broken and they sent me out a new piece.</li>
            <li> This thing works and its better than buying those more expensive ones when it does the same thing. I like it.</li>
            <li> Received this today...was excited with all the positive reviews. The unit itself is very small, the brush is small and soft, and very cheaply made.  I can honestly say that I did not try the unit, because the cheap lightweight plastic was enough to tell me that it wasn&#x27;t worth keeping.  Made in China made my decision to return it complete.  The fact that it was battery driven, with such lightweight plastic, made me believe that if it got wet, the batteries well may do the same. I&#x27;d rather pay a bit more for better quality.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks much clearer once I started using a facial brush. WOW!!!</li>
            <li> I use this item 2&#x27;s a day !!! 4 different tools for your face !!! I even use this item on the top of my hands too !!! Skin is feeling softer !! There are 2speeds !!! So, glad I made this purchase !!!</li>
            <li> The facial brush is not at all soft like I expected but it&#x27;s doable. I don&#x27;t think I would purchase this again. My face is sensitive and the brush was a little bit much for me. I don&#x27;t if all facial brushes are like that or not. If so, I will definitely not purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Love it! My feet r so smooth! Also wash my face with it &amp; use it on my now more attractive nails....</li>
            <li> great product, reasonably priced.  I&#x27;d been looking for one for a long time, but not willing to pay what dept. stores charged.  I had one from Avon for many years, loved it, but it finally wore out, and I&#x27;d been looking for a replacement ever since.</li>
            <li> Works well.  I haven&#x27;t used all of the attachments, but, I like it for washing my face.</li>
            <li> overall it works weel. it is cheaply made but has worked without any malfunctions so far.&lt;br /&gt;however when using the sponge attachment it does bog down upon skin contact.</li>
            <li> Great product.... Love the container for storing it! The gentle meaage is surely doing wonders for my skin!</li>
            <li> This product is a wonderful little skin facial cleaning system. Love that it has a case to carry it all in.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried the pumice, the facial sponge, or the nail polisher yet, but that&#x27;s soon to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing so far that keeps it from being a five star, is the fact that the attachments are hard to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> Its a good product and value for money, the speed of the motor gives sufficient cleansing and brushing action on the skin&lt;br /&gt;The brush bristles could have been a little more soft, sometimes it hurts the skin</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It has a powerful water jet stream and is easy to clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for less than a year. I used it 2x week. The brush now stopped turning. I&#x27;ve tried to open it up and fix it, hit it a few times lightly and still will not turn. Frankly, try another product.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised / Good Seller ? Great product at a reasonable price / A+++</li>
            <li> Got this for my mom as Christmas present and it comes in a great compact case. Not sure the long term perks of it yet but the reviews I had read made me think it will be great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a week and I have used all the attachments already.  My heals are softer and my face is smoother. This is a great product and I will purchase it again when the attachments need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I also have the good (but pricy) version of this brush, so for that reason, when I use this one, I feel as if I am using a child&#x27;s toy.  Also, the brush only spins in one direction, so skin gets pulled and hair is easily tangled and mixed into your facial products.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. The additional attachments are great for rough skin on your heels or buffing nails.</li>
            <li> This little gadget really works good on your skin .  This is my first time trying it. Thanks !  It &#x27;s good on cleaning your skin and pores.</li>
            <li> It was not electric. Not water proof. And super cheaply made. Returned and bought something else and I&#x27;m happy with store bought facial cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> Not a very powerful motor spins too slow to work well</li>
            <li> The brush clings to skin! I&#x27;m 29 with good collagen and elasticity. After using this device two nights in a row, I&#x27;m worried about permanent damage. Under my nose has been my biggest issue, as I bought it for clogged pours. This has lead to a semi changed smile and visible lines. I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed. After years of chemical exfoliation and meticulous skin care, I should of never tried this piece of trash.. STAY AWAY! Stick to light chemical peels or see a esthetician for something stronger.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and I would recommend it to anyone.  I had been looking for something like this for a while and realized that right now, I didn&#x27;t want to spend some 200 dollars on something trivial but then I found this and I could not be happier.  I am sure that it is not the same quality as the more expensive ones, but for what I needed, right now, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> Who needs an expensive facial cleanser?  This little brush does the trick!  Nice carrying case, several attachments and works beautifully.  I love it!</li>
            <li> NO power to this thing.  I bought the best batteries I could, and it was really sad the lack of power it had.  Thankfully, the company gave me a full refund.</li>
            <li> BriteLeafs 4-in-1 Electric Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System (BL-802) is simply awesome. I bought this for my  boyfriend. When he opened the box, I could not believe my eyes. It&#x27;s so much nicer than the one I bought from Oley. I paid twice as much for mine, and it only has one brush. His has four attachments: soft sponge, soft brush, pumice, and a nail polisher. It also comes with a case. Too cool! It has two speeds just like Olay&#x27;s as well. Most importantly, he absolutely loves loves using it. If your looking for one of these facial polishers, you could pay more for less . . . but why.</li>
            <li> Since this is run on batteries, I guess I should have known that it wouldn&#x27;t be very powerful. I really only use the bristle brush, as the other ones don&#x27;t do much without more power. The case and the unit are pretty and it does work, just not as well as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> The Brite leaf is a very nice item for the amount paid.  It was easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I was very excited about my purchase &amp; immediately started using it. I loved the 2 speed setting &amp; the strong bristles on the face brush. However, after 1 week of daily use, the on/off speed button on the system stopped working. I now have to remove a battery to turn it off &amp; re-insert it to start it &amp; it&#x27;s stuck on 1 setting. I&#x27;m a little disappointed with the low quality workmanship. I previously had a store bought one that I had been using for the last 6 months &amp; it still works for a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, the brush does not fit that one &amp; that product does not have replacement brushes. Ironic. Could be  that it was a defective one but, for the cost, I won&#x27;t take the chance of getting another.</li>
            <li> This little machine is really good- I took it on a short family trip and it worked so well. I used the facial brush twice a day. Really glad I took it with me. I&#x27;ll have to get a few for my nieces…since they were most interested in mine!!</li>
            <li> I love my BriteLeafs Face cleaner \\&quot;system\\&quot;... but only after my husband \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; it - see below*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s done a remarkable job on the appearance of my skin. Here&#x27;s how it works: Get the brush attachment wet, snap it into the hand-held part, wet your face and apply a light amount of facial cleanser, turn it on, and rub the moist spinning brush part over your skin. I use it for about 2 minutes at a time, making sure I get my entire face, and neck as well. Afterwards, turn the cleaner off, take the head out (takes a small amount of effort), clean the brush head well, and store someplace it can dry out.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother, softer, brighter, and I&#x27;ve had less acne outbreaks in the time I&#x27;ve used it. People are commenting on how great my skin looks, which is really nice because I&#x27;m in my 50s.&lt;br /&gt;Use it in the evening to take off makeup and the grime from the day. It&#x27;s like a mini-dermabrasion unit, helping your skin renew itself by taking the older dull layers off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Now the caveat and feedback for the company: The battery does NOT give it enough power to do the job properly or for any length of time. I found the spinning would bog down at the slightest amount of resistance no matter how much cleanser and water I used on my face. Because of this, my husband converted it to DC by connecting the correct size wires to the battery terminals and adding an external power supply (a small wall-wart) that plugs in to the bathroom outlet. In other words, it no longer runs on batteries, but as I found, it did a poor job of that anyway. This modification gives it the power to do the job properly. I&#x27;m NOT talking sandblasting power - I want to take care of my skin, not remove it entirely - but now it does not bog down as soon as slight pressure is applied, nor does it run out of\\&quot; juice\\&quot;. With this modification, I would compare my results to the horribly-expensive Clarisonic ANY DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lack of power and oomph using the battery system pretty much rendered the other tool heads useless. If you&#x27;ve got a way to convert, this tool is perfect. In the meantime, hopefully the company will take this to heart and make it at least rechargeable with a charging station, like my electric toothbrush. It CAN be done, and it can be done at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have bought TWO of these BriteLeafs - one for myself, and (after she saw my skin results) one for my 30-year-old daughter. My husband converted hers to DC as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased with this product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial &amp; body brush spa cleaning system comes with 4 brushes - Face Sponge - Face Brush - Pumice - Nail Brush. I haven&#x27;t used the pumice or nail brush yet, but I love how the face sponge, and face brush feels on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a face cleaning system that will increase skin elasticity and has better facial product absorption - then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Good power but gentle on skin.  Pores minimized with this gentle cleaning process.  I really like that this comes in it&#x27;s own travel case and has multiple brush heads.</li>
            <li> This is very nice, it comes in its own case.  I like this product.</li>
            <li> I recently decided I wanted to try a facial cleaning brush.  I had something similar when I was a teenager and I loved it, so I began my quest to find another one.  I did a lot of research  and compared products in the local stores.  I can&#x27;t say how surprised I was at some of the prices out there.  Some of the specialty stores wanted between $150 and $200.  I was pleased to find this one on Amazon....I read all the reviews and decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for about a week and my face feels cleaner and softer than it has in a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;The actual unit was a little smaller than I expected, however, that&#x27;s not an issue.  It comes in a nice little case that holds the attachments securely and will travel well.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is with the actual facial brush.  It&#x27;s suppose to \\&quot;snap\\&quot; in place like all the other attachments but I still haven&#x27;t been able to get it to lock in place.  Customer service says \\&quot;Regarding the brush not clicking, you can push it and it will eventually click.\\&quot;  Even though I haven&#x27;t been able to get it to lock in, the brush stays on while I&#x27;m using it.  I can live with this and maybe, as customer service says, it will eventually click.&lt;br /&gt;The pumice stone is wonderful on the feet and the nail buffer is great for working my nail cream into the nails.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a great deal for the price and I give it five stars!!!</li>
            <li> Mine broke pretty quickly after I received it. My husband tried to fix it and it would run for a few minutes. Just a slight touch will make it stop working again. I&#x27;m really disappointed and sorry I wasted my money on this product so I&#x27;m rating this at a one. I&#x27;d rate it even less if I were able to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I am pleased to say that US Advanced Healthcare immediately sent me out a replacement unit after my review and so far that one is working! I will write a new review in about one or two weeks. -Martha</li>
            <li> My face has never felt cleaner! I dont know what I did without this! Highly recommended for a fresh &amp; clean feel!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 4 in 1 for about 3 weeks now. I use the facial brush about 4 times a week. It hasn&#x27;t made my face dry, just really soft :) The nail filer is great too! Pumas stone works well too! I have yet to use the sponge; it&#x27;ll probably work well.&lt;br /&gt;The one down side it that it is battery operated. I haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet, but i feel the time is coming.</li>
            <li> Could be little bigger for the price also, the machine no sons to strong. I don&#x27;t think you can use on your feet.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have used the face ones from the beginning. I started to use the other attachments and I ended up liking them as well. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This spa brush was purchased after reading other reviews.  I like the two speeds and the light weight of the handle.  When I consider the price, the available replacement brushes and ease of use -- this is a great value.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, you got what you paid for. However, it provides very low motor power and Not Water Proof!</li>
            <li> Have been using this same brush for several years, and it&#x27;s still going strong. Works just as well as something that would cost much more. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s battery operated. Even so, I only have to change the batteries once every two months, maybe. If you&#x27;re looking for an electric brush that works great but does&#x27;nt cost an arm and a leg, get this one. Oh, as a plus it also has two speeds and the brush actually spins, not just vibrates. These are features that some of the more expensive products don&#x27;t offer. They say you get what you pay for and I agree with that, but sometimes you get more!</li>
            <li> I got this because I had super dry skin for a while and was trying to buff it off.  It doesn&#x27;t really have much power, but then again I think I was expecting something similar to a buffing wheel for a car.  For what it is, and for those who know how to use it, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed...it suppose to be electric but is batery operated.&lt;br /&gt;They want me to write more but I have nothing else to say....I just hate this product.</li>
