    <ol>
            <li>This seems to work best.  </li>
            <li>and it cover both my cheeks perfectly.</li>
            <li>The product is great, believe me!  </li>

            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>the best thing is it is not lose it for along time</li>
            <li>So beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have a darker skin complexion and both colors look great on me.</li>
            <li>This is a great blush.  </li>
            <li>it looks and feels great on me.</li>
            <li>but the product is great.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin, and it looks really nice on me.</li>
            <li>It is so amazingly pigmented!</li>
            <li>Great price, good quality.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews about this product, so I was expecting it to be BRIGHT</li>

            <li>I have this blush in the two darkest colors and they fit me perfectly.</li>
            <li>Way too bright for my fair skin</li>
            <li>Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li>I am just in love with this line!</li>
            <li>With some finishing spray on top, my blush lasts all day!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>However, given the superior pigmentation of this product it is very important to apply it correctly or you will end up looking like a clown.</li>
            <li>This blush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Arrived in great condition goes on smooth shows as color showing ..</li>
            <li>and it goes on creamy and dries to a nice powdery consistency.</li>
            <li>Nice color and texture.</li>
            <li>This product is a nice pinky coral.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite makeup product!!!</li>
            <li>It is definitely easy to overdo, so start with a miniscule amount!</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>It is a great, fresh color that gives a healthy glow to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Way better than powders on aging skin.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this E.L.F. product.</li>
            <li>You can also use this on the lips safely.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a alternative to Tarte, which I love.  </li>
            <li>I love the color, though.  </li>
            <li>I love this blush</li>
            <li>I will buy more of this soon.</li>
            <li>I wish there was more colors.</li>
            <li>Think I&#x27;ll be interrelated in buying more colors</li>
            <li>It gives a more dewy glow than powder blush.</li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>Love SUPERSTAR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an interesting product.  </li>
            <li>Had to start over because it doesnt blend out as most blushes will.  </li>
            <li>and it was still pretty bright</li>
            <li>But you must use a VERY light hand when applying to faces, like feather light.</li>
            <li>and the colors are so vibrant and warm!  </li>
            <li>It looked okay; but it wasn&#x27;t filled up all the way and looked watery on the inside.</li>
            <li>Other E.L.F. products I&#x27;ve tried have also been the best value ever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad color but it is very very unnaturally bright.</li>
            <li>maybe that&#x27;s a good thing normally.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is a light medium shade to medium, depending on the season.</li>
            <li>The color is a nice warm pink.  </li>
            <li>Such a great product at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>With some blending, it gave a really nice, natural looking glow.</li>
            <li>Use it on tiny proper amounts and it IS the most charming blush you could ever wear on your cheeks!</li>
            <li>If I apply too much (which is very easy to do due to my fair skin)</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to try a cheek stain since powder blush always seems to fade too quickly, so I decided to start off with this one.</li>
            <li>If you like really bold cheeks, this is for you.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a bargain that provides a huge bang for the buck!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>The color is pink, slightly warm, and when used sparingly, gives a natural &#x27;glow&#x27; to my oily-t-zone, fair skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks great and goes on smooth, but I was disappointed (but happy?)</li>
            <li>This is such a lovely color and texture!</li>
            <li>Also, the ingredients are all 0 on CosDNA which is phenomenal since I have really sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>You need a good brush to apply this one, or it&#x27;s going to be super super dark.</li>
            <li>This often still leaves too strong a color on my cheeks, so I have gotten to where I keep a little tissue handy and blot right after before it dries.  </li>
            <li>a great product.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a loooooong way!</li>
            <li>It came quickly and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>The color is just exactly as it looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>This product is interesting and easier to use than regular powder blush.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite blush in the entire world.</li>
            <li>I start with very little product, blending it in very well, because you can always layer more if you want a more intense color.</li>
            <li>I use a large domed kabuki to apply -</li>
            <li>I have it in Superstar and Headliner and both colors are gorgeous and work well with my very pale skin.</li>
            <li>A little DOES goes a long way with this gorgeous product!  </li>
            <li>Very good blush , long life and very little used because it is in cream</li>
            <li>It is both very translucent and transparent.</li>
            <li>It is so highly pigmented!</li>
            <li>Color not as described and comes out fast...</li>
            <li>This very concentrated, and is a mousse like consistency.  </li>
            <li>It spreads well, but I have to use too much to cover each cheek(and</li>
            <li>I imagine those with darker skin won&#x27;t have as much of a problem.  </li>
            <li>I might try one of the paler colors-maybe this one is just too intense for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I looked very unnatural.</li>
            <li>I really like this blush</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to  use much.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, took the normal amount and ended up looking like a granny clown.  </li>
            <li>Please note that I am very pale (L&#x27;oreal True Match N1 or W2), and I must use a very light hand when applying this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product and it will last forever, but because of the pigmentation the user has to be very careful.</li>
            <li>If you like a more subtle cheek, I&#x27;d recommend practicing before wearing it to an important meeting.</li>
            <li>Even once I applied it somewhat decently, I looked like a 5 year old playing with makeup for the first time.</li>
            <li>love that it is in a pump bottle, so that there is less bacteria introduced to it as I continue to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is only 3$ on the elf website though, I don&#x27;t know why amazon inflates the prices so much, but anyway, this is DEFINITELY worth the money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to play with it a little more to see if I can make it work for me.</li>
            <li>The actual product itself didn&#x27;t seem so useful</li>
            <li>Mix a very tiny amount with moisturizer or it is very intense.</li>
            <li>For sure won&#x27;t order this product again; not sure if I will from this source either.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this product, with the advice that a decent makeup sponge must be used to apply it properly.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that the pump distrubutes a large amount each time</li>
            <li>it will also last forever as it is very highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>to find it so much cheaper at my local Target!</li>
            <li>and I would never recommend applying the product directly from the container to the face.</li>
            <li>SO natural looking.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It looks NATURAL on me</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful not to push to fast!</li>
            <li>This blusher is very concentrated, but not very emollient.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it on, I thought I was only putting a little bit on, but...</li>
            <li>No matter how little I try to pump out, I end up with way too much.</li>

            <li> so you have to be careful not to push to fast!</li>
            <li> This blusher is very concentrated, but not very emollient.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it on, I thought I was only putting a little bit on, but...</li>
            <li> No matter how little I try to pump out, I end up with way too much.</li>
            <li> Very dark and highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> it DOESN&#x27;T last long...</li>
            <li> When using the smallest amount possible, this blush was still very &amp;#34;clown-like&amp;#34; and hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> Heed the warnings from other reviewers, you only need a *tiny* amount of product.</li>
            <li> And just the tiniest dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I recommend it but careful you only need a pin prick amount and it stays all day!</li>
            <li> A tiny dot on the sponge is enough to do all the areas where i need a little color.</li>
            <li> I suggest putting a dot on the back of your hand and tap a little on the middle of your apples before blending out.</li>
            <li> The thing I didn&#x27;t expect was how dry it is.  </li>
            <li> Given the fact I have to use so little, this will probably last the rest of my lifetime!</li>
            <li> A coral pink.  </li>
            <li> A little bit truly goes a long way with this product.</li>
            <li> mo32A2LDYVZUID8]]This blush is inexpensive and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, having to use such a small amount.  </li>
            <li> BUT, they are extremely pigmented.</li>

            <li> I then blend the product on the back of my hand with the ELF Small Stippling brush and then apply it to my cheeks.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t go on too dark but done that way</li>
            <li> I get the little dot of blush on my index finger and press it to my other index finger.  </li>
            <li> If you can figure out how to get even less out of the pump, then that will probably work for you.  </li>
            <li> So I tried again with significantly less product</li>
            <li> I would dispense less than a pump and have excess.</li>
            <li> I put the cap on every time, but it dries out and makes a mess every time I try to use it.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a loooong way, so use just a little bit.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, having to use such a small amount.  I&#x27;ve tried just dabbing tiny spots on and then smoothing them in.  This seems to work best.  Way better than powders on aging skin.  Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just need a needle head size of this and it cover both my cheeks perfectly. A little DOES goes a long way with this gorgeous product!  It is so amazingly pigmented! and the colors are so vibrant and warm!  I have it on superstar and it looks like a coral peachy pink, so natural and it spreads SO nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily, it does not clogs my pores, god i just ADORE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only 3$ on the elf website though, I don&#x27;t know why amazon inflates the prices so much, but anyway, this is DEFINITELY worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the people that claim that this makes you look like a clown, please, learn to use the pump properly, and THEN give your reviews. With the lightest push you can get the correct amount of product , rub it with your fingertips and apply it.  The product is great, believe me!  Use it on tiny proper amounts and it IS the most charming blush you could ever wear on your cheeks! I am just in love with this line!</li>
            <li> SO pigmented - maybe that&#x27;s a good thing normally. But you must use a VERY light hand when applying to faces, like feather light.</li>
            <li> Looks great and goes on smooth, but I was disappointed (but happy?) to find it so much cheaper at my local Target!</li>
            <li> When applied with a damp makeup sponge, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a loooooong way! A tiny dot on the sponge is enough to do all the areas where i need a little color. The color is pink, slightly warm, and when used sparingly, gives a natural &#x27;glow&#x27; to my oily-t-zone, fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel at all heavy to me, and seems to have staying power.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is in a pump bottle, so that there is less bacteria introduced to it as I continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product, with the advice that a decent makeup sponge must be used to apply it properly.</li>
            <li> I like the product. A little bit goes a loooong way, so use just a little bit. The color is just exactly as it looks in the picture. Will be getting different shades. Great price, good quality.</li>
            <li> Such a great product at a reasonable price! With some finishing spray on top, my blush lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad color but it is very very unnaturally bright.</li>
            <li> Considering the price, this cream blush stays on longer than any I&#x27;ve tried. It is both very translucent and transparent. And just the tiniest dab goes a long way. I am so glad I found this E.L.F. product. Other E.L.F. products I&#x27;ve tried have also been the best value ever!</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews about this product, so I was expecting it to be BRIGHT and I knew I had to buff a tiny dot on with a brush/blender.  The thing I didn&#x27;t expect was how dry it is.  It comes out of the pump like a little rock, then squirts all over my bathroom sink!  I put the cap on every time, but it dries out and makes a mess every time I try to use it.  Aside from that, the color and staying power is GREAT!</li>
            <li> This blush is amazing. It is so highly pigmented! A little bit truly goes a long way with this product. I have a darker skin complexion and both colors look great on me. I have no complaints!</li>
            <li> This is such a lovely color and texture! I cannot believe this is only 6 dollars. I think it will last over a year. Please note that I am very pale (L&#x27;oreal True Match N1 or W2), and I must use a very light hand when applying this product. If I apply too much (which is very easy to do due to my fair skin) I apply foundation powder over my cheeks and that makes the color look lighter,</li>
            <li> Color not as described and comes out fast...</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a light medium shade to medium, depending on the season. I have this blush in the two darkest colors and they fit me perfectly. So beautiful. BUT, they are extremely pigmented. One is a bit thinner and the other is thicker in consistency. I suggest putting a dot on the back of your hand and tap a little on the middle of your apples before blending out. What also helps is using a small stipple brush (Elf has one for three dollars that works well). It&#x27;s a good product and it will last forever, but because of the pigmentation the user has to be very careful. You can also use this on the lips safely.</li>
            <li> Mix a very tiny amount with moisturizer or it is very intense.</li>
            <li> Very dark and highly pigmented.  Way too bright for my fair skin</li>
            <li> This blusher is very concentrated, but not very emollient. My skin &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34; it, making it look like clown blush. To use it, I have to mix it with moisturizer and apply with a brush. Not convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a great blush.  it will also last forever as it is very highly pigmented.  You only need the tiniest bit for both cheeks! It is a great, fresh color that gives a healthy glow to the skin.  It also lasts all day! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a bargain that provides a huge bang for the buck!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a alternative to Tarte, which I love.  This very concentrated, and is a mousse like consistency.  When they say use a little, they are NOT kidding.  I have medium skin, and I use the smallest amount you can get out at a time-which is like the head of a pin.  I get the little dot of blush on my index finger and press it to my other index finger.  It spreads well, but I have to use too much to cover each cheek(and then I look like a clown) so I use a setting spray which(the one I use) is like a herbal tea for skin with a little shimmer.  I spray each index finger and spread each one on a cheek.  This often still leaves too strong a color on my cheeks, so I have gotten to where I keep a little tissue handy and blot right after before it dries.  That usually does it.  If you can figure out how to get even less out of the pump, then that will probably work for you.  I imagine those with darker skin won&#x27;t have as much of a problem.  I love the color, though.  A coral pink.  I might try one of the paler colors-maybe this one is just too intense for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this blush it looks and feels great on me. I will buy more of this soon. I wish there was more colors.</li>
            <li> Arrived in great condition goes on smooth shows as color showing .. Think I&#x27;ll be interrelated in buying more colors</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite makeup product!!! Love love love! I recommend it but careful you only need a pin prick amount and it stays all day! The pigmentation is out of this world and so inexpensive</li>
            <li> When using the smallest amount possible, this blush was still very &amp;#34;clown-like&amp;#34; and hard to blend in. I looked very unnatural.</li>
            <li> This product is interesting and easier to use than regular powder blush.  The color may be a bit too orange for some but the product is great.</li>
            <li> I really like this blush it&#x27;s the perfect color and it goes on creamy and dries to a nice powdery consistency. It came quickly and was very inexpensive. The only issue I have is that the pump distrubutes a large amount each time so you have to be careful not to push to fast! Great product!</li>
            <li> I like elf cosmetics, but this is just terrible. Comes out very pigmented and is very difficult to apply. Even once I applied it somewhat decently, I looked like a 5 year old playing with makeup for the first time.</li>
            <li> v.good and the best thing is it is not lose it for along time</li>
            <li> I like this blush. You have to mix it with a little face lotion so it doesn&#x27;t go on too dark but done that way it&#x27;s very pretty. Nice color and texture. You don&#x27;t need to  use much. It should last forever.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to try a cheek stain since powder blush always seems to fade too quickly, so I decided to start off with this one. The first time I tried it on, I thought I was only putting a little bit on, but... I kinda looked like a clown. So I tried again with significantly less product and it was still pretty bright and it&#x27;s difficult to work with. I&#x27;m going to play with it a little more to see if I can make it work for me. If you like really bold cheeks, this is for you. If you like a more subtle cheek, I&#x27;d recommend practicing before wearing it to an important meeting.</li>
            <li> Very good blush , long life and very little used because it is in cream</li>
            <li> This product is a nice pinky coral. I have very fair skin, and it looks really nice on me. It gives a more dewy glow than powder blush. Heed the warnings from other reviewers, you only need a *tiny* amount of product. I would dispense less than a pump and have excess. I would then take the product and apply it to a blush brush. I would smear it around the blush brush to distribute before applying. With some blending, it gave a really nice, natural looking glow. It is definitely easy to overdo, so start with a miniscule amount!</li>
            <li> This is so concentrated that a dot the size of a pin head is plenty. . . This bottle will last years.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo32A2LDYVZUID8]]This blush is inexpensive and a little goes a long way.

            <li> This blush is soooooooo pigmented! I have it in Superstar and Headliner and both colors are gorgeous and work well with my very pale skin. It also lasts forever on your cheeks. However, given the superior pigmentation of this product it is very important to apply it correctly or you will end up looking like a clown. I always shake it before applying and then I squirt the smallest quantity possible - that will be plenty! I always do this on the back of my hand and I would never recommend applying the product directly from the container to the face. I then blend the product on the back of my hand with the ELF Small Stippling brush and then apply it to my cheeks. I start with very little product, blending it in very well, because you can always layer more if you want a more intense color. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
            <li> It looked okay; but it wasn&#x27;t filled up all the way and looked watery on the inside. It appeared like it was possibly opened before. For sure won&#x27;t order this product again; not sure if I will from this source either. The actual product itself didn&#x27;t seem so useful..stained the face but it did not exceed my expectations at all. &amp;#34;Just okay..kinda skeptical over it.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;-Mich</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite blush in the entire world. It is PIGMENTED. You need a good brush to apply this one, or it&#x27;s going to be super super dark. I use a large domed kabuki to apply - I squirt product onto the cap and tap my brush on it until the product is distributed on the brush evenly, then I go in and tap the apples of my cheeks. SO natural looking. Also, the ingredients are all 0 on CosDNA which is phenomenal since I have really sensitive skin! I hope they never discontinue this.</li>
            <li> Love SUPERSTAR!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks NATURAL on me so I use it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t like that it DOESN&#x27;T last long...</li>
            <li> This is an interesting product.  No matter how little I try to pump out, I end up with way too much. The first time I used it, took the normal amount and ended up looking like a granny clown.  Had to start over because it doesnt blend out as most blushes will.  The color is a nice warm pink.  Given the fact I have to use so little, this will probably last the rest of my lifetime!</li>
