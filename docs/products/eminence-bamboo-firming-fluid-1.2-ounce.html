            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I use this as my moisturizer morning and night after washing my face with Cerave cleanser (Clarisonic brush in the morning).</li>
            <li>I was wearing because my skin looked so good--</li>
            <li>The Eminence product is a bit spendy, so I use sparingly and try to find good deals on it.</li>
            <li>This product works good with my skin.</li>

            <li>It smells great and light weight.  </li>
            <li>nice alternative to retinol products.  </li>
            <li>so, it&#x27;s nice for day and night use and for any type of skin combination.</li>
            <li>It also gives a nice glow to your skin .</li>
            <li>this product feels great in my skin, it refreshes my skin and smells great - very fruity.</li>

            <li>My boss asked me what kind of make-up</li>
            <li>and it has firmed my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fragrance and texture.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice organic serum.</li>
            <li>Really nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice skin product.</li>
            <li>love love love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice and light cream</li>
            <li>This smells amazing, works amazing, and its my favorite line of products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive around my eye area, but this cream seems to work great and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions!</li>
            <li>I have switched to all Eminence products, but I find this one probably the most effective on my skin.</li>
            <li>Throughout the day my skin remained looking balanced and hydrated with a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>it is light and feels good</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, but the combination of this product and the Stone Crop Hydrating mist are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It feels great and soaks right in, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>so I was thrilled to be able to pay a much better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and smells okay.</li>
            <li>but my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li>And I love how this product smells.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford it otherwise.</li>
            <li>Love this firming lotion.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better using this and the eye and skin cremes.</li>
            <li>Love all the products eminence sells.</li>
            <li>I love this product and I have continue to use it for months.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and feel of this product.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff..</li>

            <li>I love the look and feel of my skin after using this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer creams are lovely too.</li>
            <li>Love the way it performs and smells.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing this again for sure ...</li>
            <li>and I will be adding more to my collection.</li>
            <li>Do something healthy 4 yourself and use eminence.</li>
            <li>I tried this because of the safe ingredients</li>
            <li>product line truly works and works better than anything</li>
            <li>Love the way this feels.</li>
            <li>Love it and buy it for all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li>love this product use it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>Love itâ€¦.worth</li>
            <li>It is amazing and worth the price!</li>
            <li>Love this product - highly recommend - great purchase experience</li>
            <li>It works great, has a fresh scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the modest results.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face feel so soft and my skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product that actually does what it says - tightens and firms (plus it smells good).</li>
            <li>But the others stay together and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean lifts and is refreshing.</li>
            <li>but it has a strong fragrance that down&#x27;t belong</li>
            <li>I loved the product but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high cost for it at the spa.</li>
            <li>There is a reason why fine spas all over the country use them for facials.</li>
            <li>There is a noticeable difference in the firmness and decrease in fine lines--especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li>but I use just 1 and that works fine for me.</li>
            <li>More gentle on the skin than Retin A!!  </li>
            <li>I recently experienced this product at a spa when I recieved a facial.</li>
            <li>and I notice a difference my face is smooth and iridescent</li>
            <li>I enjoy using Eminence products.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Wheat proteins and lactic acid seal in hydration while vitamin C aids in building collagen to smooth lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This stuff is like the cream version of the fountain of smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It is nice to have such great products which are organic and really help my skin.</li>
            <li>After about two days of using this instead, I noticed my skin was glowing â€” looking smooth and healthy and with good color â€” in a way it hadn&#x27;t in a long time.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it has a light, clean, fragrance not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>My new favorite product!</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product that is great for sensitive skin and is very hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>and my face consistently looks and feels incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li>how good they smell--the good smell is a far second from how well they work.</li>
            <li>I first bought this in a spa boutique and paid a lot more for it than on Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the difference in another month.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I had gotten samples of several Eminence products from a local dermatology office &amp; liked most of them, decided to get them via Amazon because I found some good pricing &amp; shipped free through Prime...</li>
            <li>It is a nice serum, leaving my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>So far, I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Getting it online certainly made it more affordable.  </li>
            <li>I love all eminence, they are pure and work so well.  </li>
            <li>I am 50-years old, and I can truly tell an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad that Amazon sells Eminence as it is much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>So far, I am really loving it.  </li>
            <li>I started using this fluid under my moisturizer about a year ago, and it really is good, even when I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li>I do like the PCA EXLINEA better than this, but it&#x27;s very pricey.</li>
            <li>Recommended by my estetician and is so light and fresh.</li>
            <li>Superior natural ingredients that really work.</li>
            <li>Seller shipped item quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to add to your skin care ritual. :)</li>
            <li>When I am rich I will buy more frequently.</li>
            <li>Firming without drying ( which I find, on my skin, is a big downside to many firming fluids)!</li>
            <li>Goes on light and is very hydrating.</li>
            <li>Love all of the Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>but I love that I&#x27;m putting natural ingredients on my skin with no artificial fragrance .</li>
            <li>but I love the results so far.</li>
            <li>and I did not feel they absorbed well together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks and am expecting great things from it if the results I see so far continue.</li>
            <li>I love the elegant ingredients in this and layer it in with other products.</li>
            <li>and I applied it right away.</li>
            <li>I do live in a climate where the summers are very humid, so for winter I may need a moisturizing lotion on top of this.  </li>
            <li>Yes, my fairly large pores aren&#x27;t gone and the redness in my cheeks isn&#x27;t all resolved but overall my skin is improved and has a nice glow.</li>
            <li>It came very fast in the mail</li>
            <li>I really love this firming fluid.  </li>
            <li>My skin it smooth and soft, not at all oily.</li>
            <li>I first put the Couperose-c on and once dried/absorbed</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels after putting the Bamboo Firming Fluid on.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smooth.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t touched it since the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li>It absorbed nicely into my skin and left my face feeling supple &amp; hydrated, not tight at all.</li>
            <li>I believe this one was either diluted w water or some other kind of lotion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of natural moisturizers and this brand is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>My skin definitely looks healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>I live in the hot dry Arizona desert and love that my skin always feels and looks heathly.</li>
            <li>Product seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li>I really like these two.</li>
            <li>There is a bigger size available.</li>
            <li>I really miss the employee discount.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of months now and can really notice a difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning after cleansing my face and before using my moisturizer and it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>Vitamin E provides antioxidants that shield and protect skin from daily stress and free</li>
            <li>After only two days, a friend commented on how smooth my forehead looked.</li>
            <li>I only use Eminence products but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Usually I use this in lieu of a moisturizer, because it&#x27;s amazing as a primer under make-up.</li>
            <li>My doctor carries this line in her office, but I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for less money.  </li>
            <li>so far so good, starting to notice a difference after a few weeks</li>
            <li>Right when I started using this and the moisturizer my mother in law asked me what I had been doing with my skin because she said my face was simply glowing.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see that it firms up much at all compared with Derma Silk which does a very good job of filling in lines temporarily but has bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li>And with the help of Eminence, I am hoping to keep new wrinkles at bay for another 5-10 years.</li>
            <li>I just wish I had $40 to spend each month on a new bottle.  </li>
            <li>New as described...</li>
            <li>Because it made my skin very soft and I feel like it moisturized my skin also</li>
            <li>Every drop gets used so no waste!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Their Facial Recovery Oil is my other favorite.</li>
            <li>These are the first products I&#x27;ve used that have actually given visible results and are all natural.</li>
            <li>As for the hyperpigmentation, it&#x27;s way too early to see any results, but so far my skin is liking this!</li>
            <li>I use this at night and it is not a heavy cream but keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>All natural, all organic.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how young my skin looks.</li>
            <li>All natural</li>
            <li>It seems firmer and the overall appearance is much improved.</li>
            <li>This product has natural peptites in it.  </li>
            <li>She suggested it because it has natural forms of retinol which can help even out skin tone.</li>
            <li>Really works, one squirt for bags under the eyes and a second squirt for sagging jowls</li>
            <li>My skin started feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s early, but I like the way it goes on....too early yet on whether it firms over time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks and already noticed improvement in my Skin, lines have faded and my face has more elasticity, looking to order a refill.</li>
            <li>And I think I&#x27;m slowly falling in love with this brand.</li>
            <li>They are more expensive than the products you buy at the discount-stores, but buy the time you buy ones that do not work, then buy some more that do not work--you end up spending less per year on products that DO work.</li>
            <li>not sure yet if this really firms yet but love their other creams!</li>
            <li>I like it very much, but I have to buy the other products that go with it as part of the treatment.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several months now, and my skin texture is very soft, and it leaves my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is that the clear plastic cover for the bottle doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li>If I put a little bit on my finger it rolls right off.</li>
            <li>I noticed slight skin tigthening and lifting effect after the first use.  </li>
            <li>The firming fluid goes on smoothly with no greasy feel, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Love this product, its smell very faintly and is very gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li>It really smells bad - kind of like rotten grapefruit.  </li>
            <li>I will continue using it to see if the results eventrually will be more dramatic.</li>

            <li> I love the smell, the exfoliation and the firming properties of this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> The health of my skin is amazing !</li>
            <li> Beauty junkies this stuff is amazing !</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, but</li>
            <li> Good,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;face crack&amp;#34; (in a good way).</li>
            <li> This is a good serum, I use the brightening moisterizer over it...</li>
            <li> Received package in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I use this as my moisturizer morning and night after washing my face with Cerave cleanser (Clarisonic brush in the morning).</li>
            <li> I was wearing because my skin looked so good--</li>
            <li> The Eminence product is a bit spendy, so I use sparingly and try to find good deals on it.</li>
            <li> This product works good with my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  </li>

            <li> it is amazing.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and light weight.  </li>
            <li> nice alternative to retinol products.  </li>
            <li> so, it&#x27;s nice for day and night use and for any type of skin combination.</li>
            <li> It also gives a nice glow to your skin .</li>
            <li> this product feels great in my skin, it refreshes my skin and smells great - very fruity.</li>
            <li> Excellent product very smoothing.</li>
            <li> My boss asked me what kind of make-up</li>
            <li> and it has firmed my skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance and texture.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice organic serum.</li>
            <li> Really nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice skin product.</li>
            <li> love love love it!!</li>
            <li> Very nice and light cream</li>
            <li> This smells amazing, works amazing, and its my favorite line of products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive around my eye area, but this cream seems to work great and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions!</li>
            <li> I have switched to all Eminence products, but I find this one probably the most effective on my skin.</li>
            <li> Throughout the day my skin remained looking balanced and hydrated with a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> it is light and feels good</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, but the combination of this product and the Stone Crop Hydrating mist are amazing.  </li>
            <li> It feels great and soaks right in, no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> so I was thrilled to be able to pay a much better price on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and smells okay.</li>
            <li> but my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li> And I love how this product smells.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Love this firming lotion.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better using this and the eye and skin cremes.</li>
            <li> Love all the products eminence sells.</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have continue to use it for months.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this product.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good product!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love and recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love my Age Corrective products from Eminence.</li>
            <li> I love the Eminence products.  </li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I am 34 and started noticing these wrinkles appearing and continuing to get more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff..</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> There are no products that are any better than the Eminence line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, my face seems to say ahhhhhhh every time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I have started using this product line and love, love, love it.</li>
            <li> I love the look and feel of my skin after using this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer creams are lovely too.</li>
            <li> Love the way it performs and smells.  </li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this again for sure ...</li>
            <li> and I will be adding more to my collection.</li>
            <li> Do something healthy 4 yourself and use eminence.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the safe ingredients</li>
            <li> product line truly works and works better than anything</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels.</li>
            <li> Love it and buy it for all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> love this product use it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> Love itâ€¦.worth</li>
            <li> It is amazing and worth the price!</li>
            <li> Love this product - highly recommend - great purchase experience</li>
            <li> It works great, has a fresh scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the modest results.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face feel so soft and my skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product that actually does what it says - tightens and firms (plus it smells good).</li>
            <li> But the others stay together and is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean lifts and is refreshing.</li>
            <li> but it has a strong fragrance that down&#x27;t belong</li>
            <li> I loved the product but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high cost for it at the spa.</li>
            <li> There is a reason why fine spas all over the country use them for facials.</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in the firmness and decrease in fine lines--especially around my eyes.</li>
            <li> but I use just 1 and that works fine for me.</li>
            <li> More gentle on the skin than Retin A!!  </li>
            <li> I recently experienced this product at a spa when I recieved a facial.</li>
            <li> and I notice a difference my face is smooth and iridescent</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Eminence products.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Wheat proteins and lactic acid seal in hydration while vitamin C aids in building collagen to smooth lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This stuff is like the cream version of the fountain of smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have such great products which are organic and really help my skin.</li>
            <li> After about two days of using this instead, I noticed my skin was glowing â€” looking smooth and healthy and with good color â€” in a way it hadn&#x27;t in a long time.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it has a light, clean, fragrance not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is great for sensitive skin and is very hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> and my face consistently looks and feels incredibly healthy.</li>
            <li> how good they smell--the good smell is a far second from how well they work.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in a spa boutique and paid a lot more for it than on Amazon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the difference in another month.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I had gotten samples of several Eminence products from a local dermatology office &amp; liked most of them, decided to get them via Amazon because I found some good pricing &amp; shipped free through Prime...</li>
            <li> It is a nice serum, leaving my face soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> So far, I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Getting it online certainly made it more affordable.  </li>
            <li> I love all eminence, they are pure and work so well.  </li>
            <li> I am 50-years old, and I can truly tell an amazing difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I am glad that Amazon sells Eminence as it is much cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> So far, I am really loving it.  </li>
            <li> I started using this fluid under my moisturizer about a year ago, and it really is good, even when I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> I do like the PCA EXLINEA better than this, but it&#x27;s very pricey.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my estetician and is so light and fresh.</li>
            <li> Superior natural ingredients that really work.</li>
            <li> Seller shipped item quickly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to add to your skin care ritual. :)</li>
            <li> When I am rich I will buy more frequently.</li>
            <li> Firming without drying ( which I find, on my skin, is a big downside to many firming fluids)!</li>
            <li> Goes on light and is very hydrating.</li>
            <li> Love all of the Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> but I love that I&#x27;m putting natural ingredients on my skin with no artificial fragrance .</li>
            <li> but I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> and I did not feel they absorbed well together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks and am expecting great things from it if the results I see so far continue.</li>
            <li> I love the elegant ingredients in this and layer it in with other products.</li>
            <li> and I applied it right away.</li>
            <li> I do live in a climate where the summers are very humid, so for winter I may need a moisturizing lotion on top of this.  </li>
            <li> Yes, my fairly large pores aren&#x27;t gone and the redness in my cheeks isn&#x27;t all resolved but overall my skin is improved and has a nice glow.</li>
            <li> It came very fast in the mail</li>
            <li> I really love this firming fluid.  </li>
            <li> My skin it smooth and soft, not at all oily.</li>
            <li> I first put the Couperose-c on and once dried/absorbed</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after putting the Bamboo Firming Fluid on.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, smooth.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t touched it since the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> It absorbed nicely into my skin and left my face feeling supple &amp; hydrated, not tight at all.</li>
            <li> I believe this one was either diluted w water or some other kind of lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of natural moisturizers and this brand is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> My skin definitely looks healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I live in the hot dry Arizona desert and love that my skin always feels and looks heathly.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> I really like these two.</li>
            <li> There is a bigger size available.</li>
            <li> I really miss the employee discount.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and can really notice a difference in the firmness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning after cleansing my face and before using my moisturizer and it really does make a difference.</li>
            <li> Vitamin E provides antioxidants that shield and protect skin from daily stress and free</li>
            <li> After only two days, a friend commented on how smooth my forehead looked.</li>
            <li> I only use Eminence products but this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Usually I use this in lieu of a moisturizer, because it&#x27;s amazing as a primer under make-up.</li>
            <li> My doctor carries this line in her office, but I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for less money.  </li>
            <li> so far so good, starting to notice a difference after a few weeks</li>
            <li> Right when I started using this and the moisturizer my mother in law asked me what I had been doing with my skin because she said my face was simply glowing.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see that it firms up much at all compared with Derma Silk which does a very good job of filling in lines temporarily but has bad ingredients.  </li>
            <li> And with the help of Eminence, I am hoping to keep new wrinkles at bay for another 5-10 years.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had $40 to spend each month on a new bottle.  </li>
            <li> New as described...</li>
            <li> Because it made my skin very soft and I feel like it moisturized my skin also</li>
            <li> Every drop gets used so no waste!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Their Facial Recovery Oil is my other favorite.</li>
            <li> These are the first products I&#x27;ve used that have actually given visible results and are all natural.</li>
            <li> As for the hyperpigmentation, it&#x27;s way too early to see any results, but so far my skin is liking this!</li>
            <li> I use this at night and it is not a heavy cream but keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> All natural, all organic.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how young my skin looks.</li>
            <li> All natural</li>
            <li> It seems firmer and the overall appearance is much improved.</li>
            <li> This product has natural peptites in it.  </li>
            <li> She suggested it because it has natural forms of retinol which can help even out skin tone.</li>
            <li> Really works, one squirt for bags under the eyes and a second squirt for sagging jowls</li>
            <li> My skin started feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s early, but I like the way it goes on....too early yet on whether it firms over time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks and already noticed improvement in my Skin, lines have faded and my face has more elasticity, looking to order a refill.</li>
            <li> And I think I&#x27;m slowly falling in love with this brand.</li>
            <li> They are more expensive than the products you buy at the discount-stores, but buy the time you buy ones that do not work, then buy some more that do not work--you end up spending less per year on products that DO work.</li>
            <li> not sure yet if this really firms yet but love their other creams!</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but I have to buy the other products that go with it as part of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several months now, and my skin texture is very soft, and it leaves my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is that the clear plastic cover for the bottle doesn&#x27;t stay on</li>
            <li> If I put a little bit on my finger it rolls right off.</li>
            <li> I noticed slight skin tigthening and lifting effect after the first use.  </li>
            <li> The firming fluid goes on smoothly with no greasy feel, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its smell very faintly and is very gentle on skin.  </li>
            <li> It really smells bad - kind of like rotten grapefruit.  </li>
            <li> I will continue using it to see if the results eventrually will be more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it does much for wrinkles as I have not noticed any reduction in the depth of those on my forehead</li>
            <li> I had a facial not that long ago</li>
            <li> Not sure yet that I see any dramatic results but will say it make my face feel nice.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I can&#x27;t review the long term effects!</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Eminence Bamboo Age Corrective Masque infuses dry skin with moisture to reveal a softer, suppler complexion.</li>
            <li> If your skin is very dry you may want to add a moisturizer , I probably will in the winter</li>
            <li> They last a long time, in that a small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t dare travel with this firming fluid as I don&#x27;t want it to get pushed during travel and waste</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have to be careful with products because my skin is sensitive--this works for me</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I buy this product about every other month.</li>
            <li> but i can see the difference between this and other products i&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> using other products in line...</li>
            <li> and thankfully only have a few little creases between my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other people are referring to by the strong, unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> If used correctly, they will last at least 6-months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would recommend it before other setums!</li>
            <li> This is half the price.</li>
            <li> The lines are less.</li>
            <li> I dont know if my wrinkles are less</li>
            <li> are less, but hopefully preventative.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried retinols in the past, but found them to be irritating to my skin and made me extremely sun sensitive.</li>
            <li> One of the few I have use for years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I use it with the Eminence  Firm Skin Acai Moisturizer and the Eminence Coconut Age Corrective Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using collagen from Dermaquest and felt like it was a waste of a lot of money.</li>
            <li> .this is lightweight and works IMMEDIATELY to firm you r skin .</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t firm up quite like the PCA, but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> but after using for a month the results are not outstanding, just average.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly (not greasy).</li>
            <li> The smell is not great is the only reason did not give it a five.</li>
            <li> To see a dramatic difference, I suggest using the entire skin line.</li>
            <li> My skin has gradually improved over the past year.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could post my before and after pictures because they are not touched up and not like more before and after where on the before you look your worst</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever know how well this product works as I may not use it.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because quite honestly, I&#x27;m not sure I see any difference.  </li>
            <li> This is the small bottle.</li>
            <li> Small lines and stretch mark are minimized.</li>
            <li> The bamboo firming fluid is very thin.</li>
            <li> It is likely impossible to know which of these things are improving my skin--</li>
            <li> its subtly changing and restoring.</li>
            <li> The results are subtle but short of a face lift you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not easily bothered by odors, but this stuff really stinks</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 2 months ago and have seen dramatic results.</li>
            <li> started seeing improvements in 2-weeks after I began using this line, then dramatic differences after 4-weeks.</li>
            <li> Just seems to plump up the skin a bit (nothing dramatic, tho).</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, caused irritation and try skin... very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Eminence products are the best. Superior natural ingredients that really work. After a couple of weeks of use, I can definitely see the difference.</li>
            <li> I recently experienced this product at a spa when I recieved a facial. I loved the product but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high cost for it at the spa. Amazing product that actually does what it says - tightens and firms (plus it smells good). Highly recommend to add to your skin care ritual. :)</li>
            <li> Good, but I guess it take a while to see results...</li>
            <li> Not sure yet that I see any dramatic results but will say it make my face feel nice. It is not greasy and smells okay. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and it is not a heavy cream but keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. One of the few I have use for years and will continue to.</li>
            <li> I have just discovered Eminence products and am in love! I am currently using the Acai Firming Moisturizer, Stone Crop Cleansing Gel, Strawberry Rhubarb Dermafoliant and this Bamboo Firming Fluid. It is likely impossible to know which of these things are improving my skin-- but my skin looks so much better it is amazing. Yes, my fairly large pores aren&#x27;t gone and the redness in my cheeks isn&#x27;t all resolved but overall my skin is improved and has a nice glow. And it is definitely firmer. Without question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 35 and thankfully only have a few little creases between my eyebrows. And with the help of Eminence, I am hoping to keep new wrinkles at bay for another 5-10 years. And I love how this product smells. It is heavenly. My only criticism is that the clear plastic cover for the bottle doesn&#x27;t stay on so I don&#x27;t dare travel with this firming fluid as I don&#x27;t want it to get pushed during travel and waste any product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I am glad that Amazon sells Eminence as it is much cheaper than anywhere else. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to afford it otherwise.</li>
            <li> Love this firming lotion.  Give it some time.  My skin looks so much better using this and the eye and skin cremes.</li>
            <li> Love this product - highly recommend - great purchase experience</li>
            <li> This product has superb texture and a wonderful smell. I can totally feel &amp; see the results in just 3 weeks!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, quick service, good price!</li>
            <li> I really love this firming fluid.  The results are subtle but short of a face lift you will not be disappointed. I use it with the Eminence  Firm Skin Acai Moisturizer and the Eminence Coconut Age Corrective Moisturizer.  Seller shipped item quickly.</li>
            <li> Love all the products eminence sells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive around my eye area, but this cream seems to work great and doesn&#x27;t cause any reactions!</li>
            <li> I love this serum!! It makes your face feel so soft and my skin has never looked better!!</li>
            <li> This Concentrate is phenomenal! I have been using it for several months now, and my skin texture is very soft, and it leaves my skin hydrated. It can be worn under makeup without caking up. This should be a part of everybody&#x27;s beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> This is what I use day to day.  Usually I use this in lieu of a moisturizer, because it&#x27;s amazing as a primer under make-up. This smells amazing, works amazing, and its my favorite line of products.</li>
            <li> In the movie &amp;#34;Beauty Shop,&amp;#34; they refer to the miracle hair product Queen Latifa&#x27;s character makes as &amp;#34;hair crack.&amp;#34; I&#x27;d say the same about this firming fluid. It&#x27;s &amp;#34;face crack&amp;#34; (in a good way). I&#x27;d been using collagen from Dermaquest and felt like it was a waste of a lot of money. After about two days of using this instead, I noticed my skin was glowing â€” looking smooth and healthy and with good color â€” in a way it hadn&#x27;t in a long time. I&#x27;ve now been using it for three weeks and my face consistently looks and feels incredibly healthy. The smell is wonderful too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this in combination with Eminence Eight Greens Whip Moisturizer and a Dermaquest sunblock by day and an AHA 15% lotion and Eminence Monoi Age Corrective Night Cream at night.</li>
            <li> so far so good, starting to notice a difference after a few weeks, I&#x27;ll keep using and let you know.</li>
            <li> Eminence is the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used. All natural, all organic. Smells great! Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> This is another great product from Eminence. Very satisfied. Have been using for 3-4 weeks. Skin has improved.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell, but I have not noticed any improvement in firmness.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of my favorite Eminence products!!</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how young my skin looks. (I am going to be 49.)  Been using this product for almost 10 months.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and the product was great. Also a great &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; bottle. Every drop gets used so no waste!</li>
            <li> So far, I love this product!  More gentle on the skin than Retin A!!  Hope it diminishes the wrinkles.....</li>
            <li> Thank you for the savings!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I have continue to use it for months. All natural and it makes your skin amazing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I could see a difference in my skin almost immediately! I have switched to all Eminence products, but I find this one probably the most effective on my skin. I am 55 and don&#x27;t look saggy at all!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product...love love love it!!</li>
            <li> When you get to be over 60, only surgery or chemical injections help wrinkles, but this serum if used twice a day will lighten the look of wrinkles. I like it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and feel of this product.  nice alternative to retinol products.  I use it with the coconut cleanser from eminence.</li>
            <li> Because it made my skin very soft and I feel like it moisturized my skin also but I did not think it firmed!! Overall a good product!!</li>
            <li> Product is great.  It really helps to firm up your skin and eliminate age lines.</li>
            <li> Awesome lightweight moisturizer.  Works great on neck!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I buy this product about every other month. Sometimes I look for the cheapest seller. Now I know why it was cheaper... The bamboo firming fluid is very thin. Not at all like the last one I ordered. If I put a little bit on my finger it rolls right off. But the others stay together and is easy to apply. I believe this one was either diluted w water or some other kind of lotion. The smell is off too. I will not buy from this seller ever again!</li>
            <li> Of course it can&#x27;t perform miracles; but, it does seem to have a bit of firming effect.  I&#x27;m happy with the modest results.  Love all of the Eminence products I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love and recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product that is great for sensitive skin and is very hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this product, its smell very faintly and is very gentle on skin.  Not greasy at all and keeps skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.  I had a facial not that long ago and this was the product that was used and recommended.  So far, I am really loving it.  Obviously, I can&#x27;t review the long term effects!</li>
            <li> I had gotten samples of several Eminence products from a local dermatology office &amp; liked most of them, decided to get them via Amazon because I found some good pricing &amp; shipped free through Prime... This is a good serum, I use the brightening moisterizer over it...</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me at all....I would not buy this again...I tried 2 bottles and I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Received package in good condition.  Product seems to be working very well.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I use was not quite enough, I added this to my regime and wow! It&#x27;s a perfect combination. My skin it smooth and soft, not at all oily. It seems firmer and the overall appearance is much improved.</li>
            <li> I love my Age Corrective products from Eminence. The health of my skin is amazing !</li>
            <li> This is a sheerer lotion so, it&#x27;s nice for day and night use and for any type of skin combination.</li>
            <li> Beauty junkies this stuff is amazing ! I was looking for a lightweight moisturizer serum I can wear under makeup in the  warmer months .this is lightweight and works IMMEDIATELY to firm you r skin . It also gives a nice glow to your skin . I&#x27;m no  chemist but I love that I&#x27;m putting natural ingredients on my skin with no artificial fragrance . My skin can tend to be acne prone especially with anti aging products , I have been using this for a week and have had no breakouts . If your skin is very dry you may want to add a moisturizer , I probably will in the winter but I tend to be oily in the summer so I don&#x27;t need one with this product ,</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer. Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I LOvE THIS PRODUCT!!! And I think I&#x27;m slowly falling in love with this brand. I bought it to use it after microdermabrasion, but ended up using it every day before the moisturizer. My skin is glowing, feels and smells good, and I&#x27;m very happy))</li>
            <li> I love the Eminence products.  They last a long time, in that a small amount goes a long way.  My skin has gradually improved over the past year.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this product feels great in my skin, it refreshes my skin and smells great - very fruity. one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Awesome product line.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Works great!  It not only firms, but evens skin tone out.  The smell is wonderful and relaxing!</li>
            <li> I started using this fluid under my moisturizer about a year ago, and it really is good, even when I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> This product has natural peptites in it.  Very good for your skin. Getting it online certainly made it more affordable.  I love this product</li>
            <li> This is a recurring purchase.  I have been using this product for about 9 months.  In fact my facial products are only from Eminence.  It is nice to have such great products which are organic and really help my skin.</li>
            <li> Firms facial skin from the inside out. Helps rebuild the elastin we lose as we age. Excellent product very smoothing.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful. I use this during the day after cleansing and toning, under my Eminence day cream. I do like the PCA EXLINEA better than this, but it&#x27;s very pricey. This is half the price. doesn&#x27;t firm up quite like the PCA, but I will continue to use it. I am 45.</li>
            <li> I only use Eminence products but this is by far my favorite. I was hooked after only a week of use. The firming fluid goes on smoothly with no greasy feel, a little bit goes a long way. I live in the hot dry Arizona desert and love that my skin always feels and looks heathly.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream and I notice a difference my face is smooth and iridescent</li>
            <li> I enjoy using Eminence products.</li>
            <li> It is a nice serum, leaving my face soft and smooth.  Good product but after using for a month the results are not outstanding, just average.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product from an esthetician at a Spa to help with some hyperpigmentation on my forehead from being in the sun.  She suggested it because it has natural forms of retinol which can help even out skin tone. I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 days but I love the results so far. Surprisingly, I use this as my moisturizer morning and night after washing my face with Cerave cleanser (Clarisonic brush in the morning). My intent was to use it as a serum, not as a moisturizer, but after I applied this I noticed I didn&#x27;t need a moisturizer. It absorbed nicely into my skin and left my face feeling supple &amp; hydrated, not tight at all. Throughout the day my skin remained looking balanced and hydrated with a nice healthy glow. I do live in a climate where the summers are very humid, so for winter I may need a moisturizing lotion on top of this.  As for the hyperpigmentation, it&#x27;s way too early to see any results, but so far my skin is liking this!</li>
            <li> I was using this with the Acai Booster and I did not feel they absorbed well together. I now have switched to this Bamboo and the Couperose-c and I found my perfect combination serum. I really like these two. I first put the Couperose-c on and once dried/absorbed I add the Bamboo Firming...Wa&#x27;la...perfection!</li>
            <li> My new favorite product!</li>
            <li> I love this it is light and feels good I would recommend this to all my friends and family. I will reorder when I need it</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels after putting the Bamboo Firming Fluid on. I use it every day after cleansing. I receive a lot of complements. My face is not greasy after it is applied.</li>
            <li> I am 34 and started noticing these wrinkles appearing and continuing to get more noticeable. I purchased this product about 2 months ago and have seen dramatic results. I love this stuff.. I wish I could post my before and after pictures because they are not touched up and not like more before and after where on the before you look your worst and then the after you are smiling and make up and everything.&lt;br /&gt;I would say this is a must have for anyone any age!</li>
            <li> great product solon recommend it to me and I love it</li>
            <li> There are no products that are any better than the Eminence line. There is a reason why fine spas all over the country use them for facials. Simply said, this firming fluid works. I am 50-years old, and I can truly tell an amazing difference in my skin. To see a dramatic difference, I suggest using the entire skin line. I use the Age-Corrective and the Firm-Skin products--you can buy starter kits. They are more expensive than the products you buy at the discount-stores, but buy the time you buy ones that do not work, then buy some more that do not work--you end up spending less per year on products that DO work. If used correctly, they will last at least 6-months.&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing improvements in 2-weeks after I began using this line, then dramatic differences after 4-weeks. My skin is soft, smooth. There is a noticeable difference in the firmness and decrease in fine lines--especially around my eyes. My boss asked me what kind of make-up I was wearing because my skin looked so good--I did not have make-up on!&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else on my skin. Yes, everyone always writes in their reviews how good they smell--the good smell is a far second from how well they work.</li>
            <li> The Bamboo Firming Fluid does what it says it will.  I use 2 pumps twice a day and it has firmed my skin nicely.  I will definitely re-order!</li>
            <li> I noticed slight skin tigthening and lifting effect after the first use.  It has a nice fragrance and texture.  I will continue using it to see if the results eventrually will be more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I use this after toner to keep my skin&#x27;s elasticity up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll ever know how well this product works as I may not use it.  It really smells bad - kind of like rotten grapefruit.  I&#x27;m not easily bothered by odors, but this stuff really stinks and I haven&#x27;t touched it since the first time I put it on.</li>
            <li> Great company to order through. I will again!! I love this stuff. It keeps my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Love it..This is my seconf bottle! I have noticed a big difference in the firmness of my face..Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I like it very much, but I have to buy the other products that go with it as part of the treatment.</li>
            <li> I started using this year ago and let me just say I stopped doing injectable on my face. No need. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, my face seems to say ahhhhhhh every time I use it.  Morning and night....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few weeks and already noticed improvement in my Skin, lines have faded and my face has more elasticity, looking to order a refill.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice organic serum. Makes my skin feel clean lifts and is refreshing. Would recommend it before other setums!</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because quite honestly, I&#x27;m not sure I see any difference.  I&#x27;ve been using approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Really works, one squirt for bags under the eyes and a second squirt for sagging jowls does the trick. Great product.</li>
            <li> it never worked...sent it back.</li>
            <li> I have started using this product line and love, love, love it.I can defiantly see a change in my skin.  its subtly changing and restoring.</li>
            <li> I first bought this in a spa boutique and paid a lot more for it than on Amazon so I was thrilled to be able to pay a much better price on Amazon. I love the look and feel of my skin after using this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly (not greasy). I just apply it to the wrinkle areas. I could tell it made a difference, when I stopped using it for about a week. Just seems to plump up the skin a bit (nothing dramatic, tho). However, I do use it in conjunction with a retinol cream from Purtian&#x27;s Pride. The Eminence product is a bit spendy, so I use sparingly and try to find good deals on it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! Immediately after applying I notice my skin looks plumper, firmer, and my complexion has a dewy youthful appearance. I use this with an Eminence moisturizer over it and the combo truly gives noticeable results. Right when I started using this and the moisturizer my mother in law asked me what I had been doing with my skin because she said my face was simply glowing. I&#x27;m not sure what other people are referring to by the strong, unpleasant smell. In my opinion it has a light, clean, fragrance not at all overpowering. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of natural moisturizers and this brand is by far my favorite. These are the first products I&#x27;ve used that have actually given visible results and are all natural. The moisturizer creams are lovely too.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, and all Eminence products!</li>
            <li> What is this supposed to do again? Didn&#x27;t notice any effect.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and it is great!</li>
            <li> Really nice.  It seems to be making a difference and is adding back some of the elasticity to my skin.</li>
            <li> Five Stars In Every Way*****</li>
            <li> The cream may be very good but it has a strong fragrance that down&#x27;t belong&lt;br /&gt;on one&#x27;s face and stuffs up my sinuses. After paying quite a bit for it, I can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> The smell is not great is the only reason did not give it a five.Will still be using this again.</li>
            <li> This product works good with my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s moisturinzing and absorbs well at the same time. After four weeks I can tell a difference around my eyes and mouth definitely. The lines are less. I&#x27;m excited to see the difference in another month.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny! Firming without drying ( which I find, on my skin, is a big downside to many firming fluids)! I do appreciate the organic ingredients and lack of substances I  have to look up to ascertain what is truly being included in my skincare.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t match well with my skin. I find with emminence it helps to go to a facialist and they will tell you which ones to buy.</li>
            <li> I love the elegant ingredients in this and layer it in with other products.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice skin product. I&#x27;ve only used it for a couple of weeks and am expecting great things from it if the results I see so far continue.</li>
            <li> Hope springs eternal!!  This is a good product.  Wish that I would have known about it earlier.  The wrinkles are here now, but does seem to minimize them.  Would like to know what they recommend for moisturizer for night and day.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a friend: I am relaying her review of this product:&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product. It came very fast in the mail and I applied it right away. My skin started feeling so soft. I showed my husband and he wanted to try it - now he is also using it.</li>
            <li> My doctor carries this line in her office, but I was so pleased to find it on Amazon for less money.  It works great, has a fresh scent and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the way it performs and smells.  I use it twice daily and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.  It is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> Best face moisturizer ever. Goes on light and is very hydrating. Great smell. All natural ingredients. Who could ask for more? This is the small bottle. There is a bigger size available.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, the exfoliation and the firming properties of this product!!</li>
            <li> It smells great and light weight.  I dont know if my wrinkles are less are less, but hopefully preventative.  H</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel great</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I always notice a difference  after using it.  Quality ingredients.  It lasts me about a month.  I just wish I had $40 to spend each month on a new bottle.  I purchased my mom a bottle for Christmas and she loved it as well!  She could notice an almost immediate difference.  I used to work at a salon that sold Eminence products.  Clients loved all of the products including this one, and so did we as employees.  I really miss the employee discount.  Thank you, Eminence, for the great products!  When I am rich I will buy more frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for 5 days but i can see the difference between this and other products i&#x27;ve used... I will be purchasing this again for sure ...</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with products because my skin is sensitive--this works for me and I would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, but the combination of this product and the Stone Crop Hydrating mist are amazing.  My skin glows, like I have had a facial.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my estetician and is so light and fresh. Every Eminence product I have tried I&#x27;ve loved!!!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin radiant and healthy-looking. I am not sure that it does much for wrinkles as I have not noticed any reduction in the depth of those on my forehead but it DOES nourish and even-out your skin tone. My skin definitely looks healthier and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and can really notice a difference in the firmness of my skin. I use it every morning after cleansing my face and before using my moisturizer and it really does make a difference. Try it...you won&#x27;t be sorry. Eminence recommends 1 or 2 pumps but I use just 1 and that works fine for me. Excellent product and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Eminence Bamboo Firming Fluid is a retinol alternative. I&#x27;ve tried retinols in the past, but found them to be irritating to my skin and made me extremely sun sensitive. I LOVE this product! It has all the benefits of a retinol without the side effects. Their Facial Recovery Oil is my other favorite.</li>
            <li> Great product line and I will be adding more to my collection.</li>
            <li> Great product and awesome price!</li>
            <li> I love all eminence, they are pure and work so well.  My teen daughter uses them and I turn 50 this year.  Do something healthy 4 yourself and use eminence.</li>
            <li> I tried this because of the safe ingredients but I don&#x27;t see that it firms up much at all compared with Derma Silk which does a very good job of filling in lines temporarily but has bad ingredients.  Pricey for what it does.</li>
            <li> Eminence Bamboo Age Corrective Masque infuses dry skin with moisture to reveal a softer, suppler complexion. Wheat proteins and lactic acid seal in hydration while vitamin C aids in building collagen to smooth lines and wrinkles. Vitamin E provides antioxidants that shield and protect skin from daily stress and free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product line truly works and works better than anything</li>
            <li> smell was sooooooo perfumy that I couldn&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> Small lines and stretch mark are minimized. This stuff is like the cream version of the fountain of smooth skin. It is amazing and worth the price!</li>
            <li> using other products in line...not sure yet if this really firms yet but love their other creams!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with the eminence couperose-c serum for one week and am seeing and feeling a big difference in the firmness of my skin. After only two days, a friend commented on how smooth my forehead looked. It feels great and soaks right in, no greasy feel. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way this feels.</li>
            <li> Love it and buy it for all of my girlfriends.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, caused irritation and try skin... very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very nice and light cream</li>
            <li> Great product!  Very happy with this selection!</li>
            <li> love this product use it twice a day.  My daughter also, loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Stick with the twice daily regiment ...it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s early, but I like the way it goes on....too early yet on whether it firms over time.  we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Love itâ€¦.worth the price!</li>
            <li> New as described... Made the wife happy.</li>
