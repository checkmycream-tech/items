            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I successfully returned and was reimbursed for the unopened stick.    </li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t smell too pleasant.</li>
            <li>It is unscented, and it is, but the oils and waxes used have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Best part about it is it moisterizing my skin better than most moisturizers !</li>
            <li>My fair skinned, red-head son hasn&#x27;t gotten a sun burn since we started using this product.  </li>
            <li>Whoa! Smells good.</li>
            <li>But has good coverage</li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>Even smells good.</li>
            <li>I have had pre cancer areas removed from my face so a good sunscreen is a must for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best for going in the water with a bald head and light skin.</li>
            <li>so good</li>
            <li>good ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I feel good about using it often without soaking our skin in chemicals.</li>
            <li>Beautiful Skin Is Always In... :)</li>
            <li>This is a great product for covering your kid - most of the time she can do it herself.  </li>
            <li>but this one is nice because doesn&#x27;t seem to run and get in her eyes so is good for faces.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply, does a good job on blocking the sun.  </li>
            <li>I love badger sunscreen!</li>
            <li>if so, I&#x27;d be fully satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li>I speak not of its ability to work mind you, but its safe to say it didn&#x27;t work because they wouldn&#x27;t wear it!  </li>
            <li>I love Badger sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>I love this zinc oxide sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Works great and easy to put on wiggling kinds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, safe option!  </li>
            <li>The face stick is amazing.</li>
            <li>Once you rub it in, the skin feels great and smooth, not sticky or greasy.  </li>
            <li>After much research on-line, I found this product, and it&#x27;s wonderful that Amazon carries it.  </li>
            <li>Handy dandy stick applicator style.</li>
            <li>okay, as this company has a good reputation,</li>
            <li>A stick is nice b/c</li>
            <li>Finally, good reviews by the EWG was of utmost importance to me and Badger always gets top marks.</li>
            <li>We have NOT had any burns but have gotten some nice tan color to our skin.</li>
            <li>it has a very strong odor...</li>
            <li>Conversely, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Stick is easy to toss in a bag and go!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes my face and offers very good sunburn protection.</li>
            <li>Love this for using on the face :)</li>
            <li>I am able to spread it on and rub it *</li>
            <li>mostly* in on my 1,</li>
            <li>This is OK to use on children running out an about.</li>
            <li>You can smell the cocoa butter, but I love that it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li>EWG has rated this as a top sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin, which is good.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s safe for lakes and oceans.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works</li>
            <li>need I say more</li>
            <li>Love this face stick.</li>
            <li>also feel better about the ingredient list on Badger.</li>
            <li>I consider Badger to be one of the better sunscreens on the market.</li>
            <li>I feel confident putting this on my family.  </li>
            <li>Ordered this because I have already use the Badger Bug Balm and love it.</li>
            <li>i love zinc-heavy sunblock sticks for the face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they make this</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s available on Amazon!</li>
            <li>I love being able to use a face stick without the chemicals.</li>
            <li>-- I use it on my nose and cheeks as that is were I mostly get sun even if i wear a hat.</li>
            <li>Many sunscreens make me break out or get a rash, but this did neither.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect product for people who love to spend time outside in the sun but don&#x27;t want sun damaged skin.</li>
            <li>Environemental Working Group and many others love this product and so do we.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try Badger since I see so many suggestions in parenting forums and blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say Badger helped protect my son&#x27;s skin and protected him from any sunburn.  </li>
            <li>We have had days where we were in the sun most of the day in the water and not had any problems.</li>
            <li>We love this and continue to use for all sun exposures...pool, vacation, soccer</li>
            <li>Yes I recommend this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what Badger has come up with to top this.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Their regular sunblock is awesome!</li>
            <li>While I know it was a good product, it wasn&#x27;t right for my kids.</li>
            <li>This particular sunblock stick is great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply to the face and it really stays put, which is great when you&#x27;re swimming and don&#x27;t want sunblock running into your eyes.</li>
            <li>It feels good when it goes on, doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue and has no weird aroma.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to put it on about 30 minutes before you are out in the sun or you&#x27;ll get burned if you burn easily.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is very light and scattered on the face which is where I use it, very practical not been any allergy, and leaves skin well hydrated in good condition, has filled all my expectations</li>
            <li>It has worked great so far.  </li>
            <li>Great all natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Works well and like that its natural, it has great rating on EWG.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>And it is easy to rub in.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to put on.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use for face.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and to carry with you to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li>(The purpose of a stick, in my opinion, being that you can put it on while you&#x27;re out at the beach or the playground and keep your fingers and palms clean for eating or touching your baby or your phone or camera.)</li>
            <li>Taking it off isn&#x27;t quite as easy as putting it on.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to rub onto my son&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and easy to take with you.</li>
            <li>It does&#x27;t apply easily and must be rubbed in.  </li>
            <li>It easily rubs in.</li>
            <li>So be prepared for a strong zinc smell.  </li>
            <li>Very nice product,  will tell you more when we get back -end of months vacation.</li>
            <li>I had hoped she was exaggerating (thinking, if Badger&#x27;s \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; cream smells pleasant, then \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stick would likely be as good or better), but when I took a whiff, I agreed the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stick smells very yucky.</li>
            <li>As long as you know that in advance and are OK with it, than this product will be great for you.  </li>
            <li>but it end up blending in fine.</li>
            <li>I like the size for being able to carry around for quick re-applications.</li>
            <li>It was super helpful to be able to smear it all over and then blend -- it helped me know that I was covering all skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will do a great job of stopping harmful sun rays from damaging your skin and doesn&#x27;t contain more harmful ingredients, but you will look odd.  </li>
            <li>perfect, a little bit works.</li>
            <li>I find that this product gives me great coverage, you do have to rub it in or it leaves white on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Neither of us minds its light scent at all.</li>
            <li>I used the sunscreen stick for a marathon in Hawaii, and it fit conveniently into the pocket of my running shorts.</li>
            <li>After using it on a trip to a very sunny and warm climate, I understand why.</li>
            <li>It was a smooth glide on the face.</li>
            <li>This product is a nice and gentle face sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it often because it is more work than it is worth</li>
            <li>When it comes to any facial product I am very picky and Badger&#x27;s sunscreen is perfect for my face and skin</li>
            <li>On the whole, though, I am very happy with this product, and I will definitely want to buy it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li>Love Love this, protects my skin very well and doesn&#x27;t suffocate it.</li>
            <li>This smells great, is gentle on my skin, but it does not work very well as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>But this is a good product that is natural and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li>My son is allergic to most other sunscreens, but this is a great option for his face.  </li>
            <li>I was a huge fan of Loving Naturals, but the sunscreen I normally bought from them was unavailable/discontinued.  </li>
            <li>It really works, doesn&#x27;t make you look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; on the face, very easy to apply and carry around.</li>
            <li>It is friendly to all skin types, and protects well against burn.  </li>
            <li>Success!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave a bit of a white tinge, but I know that comes with the territory of using a product that is both safe for my skin and effective against the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li>My toddler likes to put it on himself, but this one doesn&#x27;t roll super smoothly, and is a bit sticky going on.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would rub in better since it&#x27;s specifically for face, but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;ll just go back to making my own.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing and natural</li>
            <li>This protects my fair skinned child from facial sunburn..</li>
            <li>Badger seems to absorb into my skin more readily, and is easier to wash off.</li>
            <li>And most importantâ€”my skin really feels protected.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t want to fuss with a full body application with this stick, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s its intended purpose anyway.</li>
            <li>so it is safe for the whole family.</li>
            <li>I also like how it isn&#x27;t full of chemicals, dyes and scents.</li>
            <li>My son is three and he liked to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; put it on his forehead and cheeks while I applied sunscreen everywhere else -- and if you have a three year old</li>
            <li>It seems to be effective as far as keeping her protected, however, when she gets sweaty it runs and she complains of her eyes burning.  </li>
            <li>stick goes on pretty easily</li>
            <li>but my kids look super chalky.</li>
            <li>If you have older kids, they might be able to tolerate it</li>
            <li>Very convenient for using on my child&#x27;s face, and offers good protection.</li>
            <li>Their super liberal profile is neither super or liberal.</li>
            <li>Such a shame because I LOVE the Badger brand and their dedication to safe products.</li>
            <li>and I could fit pretty well into my bag.</li>
            <li>Easy to carry in pure, backpack, or pocket.</li>
            <li>I love that they are all natural as well!</li>
            <li>After I bought my first tube and tried it I liked it so much I came back and bought two more.</li>
            <li>I wish this was a little easier to apply - it isn&#x27;t great and my son does not want it on his face which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a great rating on EWG.org, which means that it has little or no harmful</li>
            <li>I just recently switched to natural sunscreen, I&#x27;m a multi-sport athlete and spend a great deal of time in the sun.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t like putting on any type of sun product, but when you find one that works, it makes it all worth it.  </li>
            <li>(Last year I also purchased (and really liked)</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re probably allergic or sensitive to one or more ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>I like that this is natural and safer than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li>My kids have sensitive skin and break out from most sunscreens but they don&#x27;t break out from this one.</li>
            <li>Love that it is all natural</li>
            <li>The big downside of the whiteness/having to rub it in is that you wind up with it all over your fingers, which kind of defeats the purpose of a stick.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a residue of dryness that needs to be washed away before applying a moisturizer, but the convenience of the stick makes it worth it.</li>
            <li>We try to use the more natural sunscreens when we can.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m expecting, and my doctor recommended a more natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s listed as one of the least harmful sunscreen products by the Environmental Working Group, gives great coverage when in the sun for long periods, and has a good feel when it goes</li>
            <li>I am a big believer in avoiding all of the toxic chemicals found in most commercial sunscreen products, so I was very pleased to find the Badger SPF 35 Sunscreen Face Stick</li>
            <li>/&gt;If not getting skin cancer is your main concern over looking &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; at the beach, or if keeping the oceans chemical free so the reefs don&#x27;t get destroyed, then this is the sunscreen for you.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and relatively chemical free (for a sunscreen).</li>
            <li>If you can get past the smell, it&#x27;s a great buy; I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for great skin protection.</li>
            <li>It works very well for our family with very light sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This sunscreen was fine, but it completely ruined my snorkeling goggles!</li>
            <li>I purchased this sunscreen stick after much research in trying to find more natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s probably a good product if you or your child are not too sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>For optimum performance, Badger recommends you re-apply every hour and a half.</li>
            <li>This may be a good product, but when your kid won&#x27;t wear it, it&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li>just good sun protection for little ones.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better than all the chemicals that are in regular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>When my daughter willingly tried the Badger stick, she crinkled her nose and said \\&quot;it smells yucky\\</li>
            <li>In any case, if you are trying the Badger stick for the first time, I advise you buy a lightly scented stick: steer clear of the unscented one &#x27;cause it smells yucky.</li>
            <li>That being said I burned to a crisp.  </li>
            <li>but my 10,8 and 7 year olds refused to put it on after we tried the first time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You can try putting oil on the face first then put this on, but it is still tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On top of that, the cocoa butter in it makes it smell like white chocolate.</li>
            <li>and I broke out for the first time in 20 years after coating my face with it.</li>
            <li>The sweat did not remove the zinc, and the product continued to work consistently.</li>
            <li>My point is this, if you rub the sunscreen in until you no longer can see it then you are defeating how this product works and most likely will get burned.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen!</li>
            <li>My wife says it smells funny</li>
            <li>thanks again Badger!</li>
            <li>I first arrive at teh beach, I rub the cream all over my face and</li>
            <li>I was excited to use my all natural (organic) sunblock this passed weekend since I have gradually eliminated chemicals from my life....</li>
            <li>love the healthy aspect of the product, but it&#x27;s so hard to rub in...</li>
            <li>The smell (or lack thereof) doesn&#x27;t bother me which is surprising since I am pregnant and my usual high sensitivity to sunscreen smell is heightened.</li>
            <li>I know, I know that is pretty much always the case when it comes to zinc oxide, but I wanted to believe otherwise.  </li>
            <li>product is 100% natural and manufactured from farm raised, grass fed badgers that are lovingly interacted with daily prior to being humanely slaughtered, ground up into a fine paste and pressed into push-up stick form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is all natural and organic, especially since it goes right on my face.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is perfect for someone who typically has very sensitive skin that can get very dry.</li>
            <li>I live in a state where its gets very cold, which means that moisterizing is very important and the fact that I can use this in the winter time is perfect.</li>
            <li>Gives me warm and fuzzies that someday I will be less wrinkly on account of having used this product.</li>
            <li>I also use it for a quick application on my young kids.</li>
            <li>This large stick is very convenient and it is also extremely natural with no bad ingredients.</li>
            <li>It certainly does make you look pasty but that goes away if you rub it in a bit.</li>
            <li>While I realize that isn&#x27;t uncommon in sunscreens, I would expect the specific face sticks to run a lot less</li>
            <li>I needed a strong, natural sunblock for my lips that would not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I probably will end of getting rid of it because my kids will cooperate more willingly with other products.</li>
            <li>I have a feeling that I might have had an allergic reaction to it as my face was fine the next day.  </li>
            <li>A very good sun Block &amp; not messy or skin irritating.</li>
            <li>I have olive skin and got very sunburn while using it.</li>
            <li>Really like Badger&#x27;s sun protection.  </li>
            <li>Plus it smells very yummy,</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, sunburned.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really use it because the smell and texture are quite disagreeable.</li>
            <li>Use it on my face and chest and it works very well.</li>
            <li>CB is much whiter when applied, and goes on thicker.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the cream &amp; works very well in tropical climates.</li>
            <li>Thanks Badger.</li>
            <li>It is primarily zinc oxide, so it goes on white and has to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Stays on really well while swimming and sweating.</li>
            <li>This stick makes application much easier than it used to be.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 applications she now says &amp;#34;No stick!&amp;#34; and wants me to apply lotion to her face instead.</li>
            <li>My daughter really dislikes it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s size is very convenient and the product doesn&#x27;t run in my eyes or sting when I sweat.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>works great!Have been using this for years on my whole family (3 kids since baby age).</li>
            <li>Stayed at the beach for a whole week and my daughter didn&#x27;t get burned at all.</li>
            <li>Plus it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>No matter how much you&#x27;ve rubbed it in, once you start sweating, this stuff will run into your eyes.</li>
            <li>Chalky, but love the fact that it is all natural and uses only ZnO for sunblock.  </li>
            <li>i can get a good, thick, controlled schmear of the stuff on my kids&#x27; faces.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive as the pigment of my skin is a shade of red, and I have very dry skin, this product is amazing !</li>
            <li>really only very useful on the nose, as it will NOT spread beyond the application zone.</li>
            <li>I often have trouble with sunburned lips and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that feels good and actually protects my lips from getting burned.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to use when I run outside.</li>
            <li>I also have not gotten sunburned while wearing this, which is a lot more than I can say for other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m not sure whether Badger&#x27;s sells a \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; stick that smells like its \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; cream--</li>
            <li>This works ok, not great, but forget about getting this off your face easily.</li>
            <li>just bought babo botanicals clear face stick and wearing it now for the first time.</li>
            <li>Forget trying to get this near a childs face which is exactly where its intended to be used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty natural.</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so if I use certain sun block lotions, my lips will break out.</li>
            <li>To remove, I used a wet wipe, and it came off easily, leave the skin silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan and ongoing user of Badger&#x27;s SPF 30 Lightly Scented All Natural Moisturizing Sun Cream for both myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li>Does not smell and we got it for a decent price on amazon after researching safer sunscreen alternatives.</li>
            <li>However, one of the main ingredients that protects your skin is Zinc.  </li>
            <li>Then, it&#x27;s just a few quick rubs to smooth it around his face in a nice, thick layer.  </li>
            <li>is the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It feels a little heavy at first, but absorbs very nicely in the time it takes to brush your teeth and hair before you apply any makeup, assuming you want to.  </li>
            <li>but I still give this one high marks for ease of use and effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended by the EWG sunscreen guide every May when the guide is released.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Unscented version.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old son however, really objects to the scent.  </li>
            <li>So far I have had much luck with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;15mins of extra work during application is worth the no tan protection</li>
            <li>I had severe flakiness/redness, especially on my forehead and chin, after a week&#x27;s worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good, but not great.</li>
            <li>I use these sticks specifically to protect a black tattoo on my arm, so the whitening factor is important to me, and very easy to judge (like testing deodorant on a black shirt!)</li>
            <li>Comparing the two: Badger has a more &#x27;natural&#x27; smell (nutty), but I slightly prefer CB (floral).</li>
            <li>Works well but doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly like other sunblock sticks I have tried and took some effort to rub in so you didn&#x27;t have streaks on your face.</li>
            <li>While I like the high content of zinc and titanium oxide, the consistency of this product is almost took thick to rub in and it has a pretty strong smell.</li>
            <li>It does seem to be completely clear but I&#x27;ll use it a few more times before recommending it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a really dried out glue stick vs a soft Chapstick texture or even a stick deodorant texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right before I go out, I smear a ton of the stick over my nose and under eye area and lightly rub it in, leaving a thick layer on those super sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I liked the high spf given that it is a natural product, it does show white, real white when you apply it, which could be less if you spread it evenly, but Then It might not offer so much protection if you do that.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;or have ultra sensitive skin and hates smells then skip this one!</li>
            <li>Takes only slightly more effort than regular sunscreen to rub in, definitely NOT a deal breaker though.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m busy getting pitted!</li>
            <li>I used it the first day and was only at the beach for an hour or so.  </li>
            <li>- It&#x27;s a minor issue, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>It is very thick and white, but that is the trade off for being natural, which is more important to me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and it is hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised how clear Badger is!</li>
            <li>It does require a little extra rubbing to get it fully absorbed, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li>need a clear face stick.</li>
            <li>all natural.</li>
            <li>so my 5 year old daughter could apply sunscreen at school by herself.)     </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, and I was looking for some sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out upon application.  </li>
            <li>This is WAY too white for my skin, plus it is very greasy.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old is extremely sensitive with her eyes.</li>
            <li>There was no harsh chemical smell, and my skin did not break out.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t bother my two year old at all.</li>
            <li>I use it all over, not just on the face, and neither my two-year old nor I have had any skin issues with it</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2 year old thinking</li>
            <li>, I like the natural smell.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 5 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>She also said it stung her eye even though I didn&#x27;t get near her eye.</li>
            <li>My 3 year old \\&quot;paints\\&quot; her face</li>
            <li>Just to be safe, I did a few touch up swipes before the next dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love badger products, but this sunscreen stick is so thick and paste-like</li>
            <li>It has a very light almondy smell and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but a little does go a long way with the face stick.</li>
            <li>Overall, I highly recommend this product for its durability, and the ability to stay on regardless of weather or body conditions.</li>
            <li>smell is actually the smell of unrefined Cocoa Butter and Shea butter, it is not a bad smell, so I am unsure why other reviewers stated it as an offensive smell...</li>
            <li>I live in sunny Southern California.</li>
            <li>This year, given our ongoing success with Badger&#x27;s cream product, I switched to Badger&#x27;s unscented stick product because it cost less.</li>
            <li>I also have oily screen and worried this product might make me breakout, but since I started using badger sunscreens my skin actually appears very clear and balanced.</li>
            <li>Zinc is an abrasive apparently so when cleaning the lenses on my goggles it scratched them to the point where they are no longer usable!</li>
            <li>I didnt get a sunburn at all, it does exactly what it is suppose to do unlike other products like this.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, we only used this a couple of times early in the summer because I can&#x27;t stand the waxy smell.</li>
            <li>It is a natural smell and if you are not used to the smell of unrefined shea butter or cocoa butter it will be a different smell to you of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest Kabana, it is the only natural zinc sunscreen that does not make you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li>I used this on myself and my three year old daughter on a Caribbean vacation last week</li>
            <li>but this didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as the generic brand.</li>
            <li>My son doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I can barely smell it, an neither can my daughter.  </li>
            <li>The benefits of no chemicals and sun protection far out weigh the issue of a white face.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not for sensitive skin - Everyone&#x27;s different, but it didn&#x27;t react well to my dry-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves behind a whitish residue, which I am sure is the zinc in the stick.</li>
            <li>ZnO doesn&#x27;t absorb through the skin like other chemicals which is much safer.  </li>
            <li>but my boyfriend is not mixed and is super pale and he normally burns with other products but has NOT had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li>I used to love Badger&#x27;s original formulations for their sunscreens, but unfortunately after they decided to remove some of the nice essential oils for some which changed their base formulations as well as using a different zinc type for all their sunscreens....</li>
            <li>The skin on my face is fairly sensitive, and parts of it occasionally dry out and peel.</li>
            <li>As an Esthetician/Makeup Artist/Former Nurse I&#x27;ve used personally and professionally products well over this price with not nearly the SPF.  </li>
            <li>Super thick.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it took a good half hour to rub in enough</li>
            <li>Works very well - goes on a little white.</li>

            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t smell too pleasant.</li>
            <li> It is unscented, and it is, but the oils and waxes used have a pleasant smell.</li>

            <li> This is a great product for covering your kid - most of the time she can do it herself.  </li>
            <li> but this one is nice because doesn&#x27;t seem to run and get in her eyes so is good for faces.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply, does a good job on blocking the sun.  </li>
            <li> I love badger sunscreen!</li>
            <li> if so, I&#x27;d be fully satisfied with the product!</li>
            <li> I speak not of its ability to work mind you, but its safe to say it didn&#x27;t work because they wouldn&#x27;t wear it!  </li>

            <li> Handy dandy stick applicator style.</li>
            <li> okay, as this company has a good reputation,</li>
            <li> A stick is nice b/c</li>
            <li> Finally, good reviews by the EWG was of utmost importance to me and Badger always gets top marks.</li>
            <li> We have NOT had any burns but have gotten some nice tan color to our skin.</li>

            <li> This is OK to use on children running out an about.</li>
            <li> You can smell the cocoa butter, but I love that it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> EWG has rated this as a top sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin, which is good.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s safe for lakes and oceans.</li>

            <li> Their regular sunblock is awesome!</li>
            <li> While I know it was a good product, it wasn&#x27;t right for my kids.</li>
            <li> This particular sunblock stick is great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply to the face and it really stays put, which is great when you&#x27;re swimming and don&#x27;t want sunblock running into your eyes.</li>
            <li> It feels good when it goes on, doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue and has no weird aroma.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to put it on about 30 minutes before you are out in the sun or you&#x27;ll get burned if you burn easily.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very light and scattered on the face which is where I use it, very practical not been any allergy, and leaves skin well hydrated in good condition, has filled all my expectations</li>
            <li> It has worked great so far.  </li>
            <li> Great all natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Works well and like that its natural, it has great rating on EWG.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> And it is easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Easy to put on.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use for face.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and to carry with you to reapply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> (The purpose of a stick, in my opinion, being that you can put it on while you&#x27;re out at the beach or the playground and keep your fingers and palms clean for eating or touching your baby or your phone or camera.)</li>
            <li> Taking it off isn&#x27;t quite as easy as putting it on.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is easy to rub onto my son&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> It does&#x27;t apply easily and must be rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> It easily rubs in.</li>
            <li> So be prepared for a strong zinc smell.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product,  will tell you more when we get back -end of months vacation.</li>
            <li> I had hoped she was exaggerating (thinking, if Badger&#x27;s \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; cream smells pleasant, then \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stick would likely be as good or better), but when I took a whiff, I agreed the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stick smells very yucky.</li>
            <li> As long as you know that in advance and are OK with it, than this product will be great for you.  </li>
            <li> but it end up blending in fine.</li>
            <li> I like the size for being able to carry around for quick re-applications.</li>
            <li> It was super helpful to be able to smear it all over and then blend -- it helped me know that I was covering all skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will do a great job of stopping harmful sun rays from damaging your skin and doesn&#x27;t contain more harmful ingredients, but you will look odd.  </li>
            <li> perfect, a little bit works.</li>
            <li> I find that this product gives me great coverage, you do have to rub it in or it leaves white on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Neither of us minds its light scent at all.</li>
            <li> I used the sunscreen stick for a marathon in Hawaii, and it fit conveniently into the pocket of my running shorts.</li>
            <li> After using it on a trip to a very sunny and warm climate, I understand why.</li>
            <li> It was a smooth glide on the face.</li>
            <li> This product is a nice and gentle face sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often because it is more work than it is worth</li>
            <li> When it comes to any facial product I am very picky and Badger&#x27;s sunscreen is perfect for my face and skin</li>
            <li> On the whole, though, I am very happy with this product, and I will definitely want to buy it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> Love Love this, protects my skin very well and doesn&#x27;t suffocate it.</li>
            <li> This smells great, is gentle on my skin, but it does not work very well as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> But this is a good product that is natural and non-toxic.  </li>
            <li> My son is allergic to most other sunscreens, but this is a great option for his face.  </li>
            <li> I was a huge fan of Loving Naturals, but the sunscreen I normally bought from them was unavailable/discontinued.  </li>
            <li> It really works, doesn&#x27;t make you look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; on the face, very easy to apply and carry around.</li>
            <li> It is friendly to all skin types, and protects well against burn.  </li>
            <li> Success!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave a bit of a white tinge, but I know that comes with the territory of using a product that is both safe for my skin and effective against the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> My toddler likes to put it on himself, but this one doesn&#x27;t roll super smoothly, and is a bit sticky going on.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would rub in better since it&#x27;s specifically for face, but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;ll just go back to making my own.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing and natural</li>
            <li> This protects my fair skinned child from facial sunburn..</li>
            <li> Badger seems to absorb into my skin more readily, and is easier to wash off.</li>
            <li> And most importantâ€”my skin really feels protected.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to fuss with a full body application with this stick, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s its intended purpose anyway.</li>
            <li> so it is safe for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I also like how it isn&#x27;t full of chemicals, dyes and scents.</li>
            <li> My son is three and he liked to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; put it on his forehead and cheeks while I applied sunscreen everywhere else -- and if you have a three year old</li>
            <li> It seems to be effective as far as keeping her protected, however, when she gets sweaty it runs and she complains of her eyes burning.  </li>
            <li> stick goes on pretty easily</li>
            <li> but my kids look super chalky.</li>
            <li> If you have older kids, they might be able to tolerate it</li>
            <li> Very convenient for using on my child&#x27;s face, and offers good protection.</li>
            <li> Their super liberal profile is neither super or liberal.</li>
            <li> Such a shame because I LOVE the Badger brand and their dedication to safe products.</li>
            <li> and I could fit pretty well into my bag.</li>
            <li> Easy to carry in pure, backpack, or pocket.</li>
            <li> I love that they are all natural as well!</li>
            <li> After I bought my first tube and tried it I liked it so much I came back and bought two more.</li>
            <li> I wish this was a little easier to apply - it isn&#x27;t great and my son does not want it on his face which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a great rating on EWG.org, which means that it has little or no harmful</li>
            <li> I just recently switched to natural sunscreen, I&#x27;m a multi-sport athlete and spend a great deal of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t like putting on any type of sun product, but when you find one that works, it makes it all worth it.  </li>
            <li> (Last year I also purchased (and really liked)</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re probably allergic or sensitive to one or more ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I like that this is natural and safer than most sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My kids have sensitive skin and break out from most sunscreens but they don&#x27;t break out from this one.</li>
            <li> Love that it is all natural</li>
            <li> The big downside of the whiteness/having to rub it in is that you wind up with it all over your fingers, which kind of defeats the purpose of a stick.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a residue of dryness that needs to be washed away before applying a moisturizer, but the convenience of the stick makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> We try to use the more natural sunscreens when we can.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m expecting, and my doctor recommended a more natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s listed as one of the least harmful sunscreen products by the Environmental Working Group, gives great coverage when in the sun for long periods, and has a good feel when it goes</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in avoiding all of the toxic chemicals found in most commercial sunscreen products, so I was very pleased to find the Badger SPF 35 Sunscreen Face Stick</li>
            <li> /&gt;If not getting skin cancer is your main concern over looking &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; at the beach, or if keeping the oceans chemical free so the reefs don&#x27;t get destroyed, then this is the sunscreen for you.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and relatively chemical free (for a sunscreen).</li>
            <li> If you can get past the smell, it&#x27;s a great buy; I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for great skin protection.</li>
            <li> It works very well for our family with very light sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was fine, but it completely ruined my snorkeling goggles!</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen stick after much research in trying to find more natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s probably a good product if you or your child are not too sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> For optimum performance, Badger recommends you re-apply every hour and a half.</li>
            <li> This may be a good product, but when your kid won&#x27;t wear it, it&#x27;s kind of useless.</li>
            <li> just good sun protection for little ones.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better than all the chemicals that are in regular sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> When my daughter willingly tried the Badger stick, she crinkled her nose and said \\&quot;it smells yucky\\</li>
            <li> In any case, if you are trying the Badger stick for the first time, I advise you buy a lightly scented stick: steer clear of the unscented one &#x27;cause it smells yucky.</li>
            <li> That being said I burned to a crisp.  </li>
            <li> but my 10,8 and 7 year olds refused to put it on after we tried the first time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You can try putting oil on the face first then put this on, but it is still tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On top of that, the cocoa butter in it makes it smell like white chocolate.</li>
            <li> and I broke out for the first time in 20 years after coating my face with it.</li>
            <li> The sweat did not remove the zinc, and the product continued to work consistently.</li>
            <li> My point is this, if you rub the sunscreen in until you no longer can see it then you are defeating how this product works and most likely will get burned.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen!</li>
            <li> My wife says it smells funny</li>
            <li> thanks again Badger!</li>
            <li> I first arrive at teh beach, I rub the cream all over my face and</li>
            <li> I was excited to use my all natural (organic) sunblock this passed weekend since I have gradually eliminated chemicals from my life....</li>
            <li> love the healthy aspect of the product, but it&#x27;s so hard to rub in...</li>
            <li> The smell (or lack thereof) doesn&#x27;t bother me which is surprising since I am pregnant and my usual high sensitivity to sunscreen smell is heightened.</li>
            <li> I know, I know that is pretty much always the case when it comes to zinc oxide, but I wanted to believe otherwise.  </li>
            <li> product is 100% natural and manufactured from farm raised, grass fed badgers that are lovingly interacted with daily prior to being humanely slaughtered, ground up into a fine paste and pressed into push-up stick form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is all natural and organic, especially since it goes right on my face.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is perfect for someone who typically has very sensitive skin that can get very dry.</li>
            <li> I live in a state where its gets very cold, which means that moisterizing is very important and the fact that I can use this in the winter time is perfect.</li>
            <li> Gives me warm and fuzzies that someday I will be less wrinkly on account of having used this product.</li>
            <li> I also use it for a quick application on my young kids.</li>
            <li> This large stick is very convenient and it is also extremely natural with no bad ingredients.</li>
            <li> It certainly does make you look pasty but that goes away if you rub it in a bit.</li>
            <li> While I realize that isn&#x27;t uncommon in sunscreens, I would expect the specific face sticks to run a lot less</li>
            <li> I needed a strong, natural sunblock for my lips that would not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I probably will end of getting rid of it because my kids will cooperate more willingly with other products.</li>
            <li> I have a feeling that I might have had an allergic reaction to it as my face was fine the next day.  </li>
            <li> A very good sun Block &amp; not messy or skin irritating.</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and got very sunburn while using it.</li>
            <li> Really like Badger&#x27;s sun protection.  </li>
            <li> Plus it smells very yummy,</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, sunburned.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really use it because the smell and texture are quite disagreeable.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and chest and it works very well.</li>
            <li> CB is much whiter when applied, and goes on thicker.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the cream &amp; works very well in tropical climates.</li>
            <li> Thanks Badger.</li>
            <li> It is primarily zinc oxide, so it goes on white and has to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li> Stays on really well while swimming and sweating.</li>
            <li> This stick makes application much easier than it used to be.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 applications she now says &amp;#34;No stick!&amp;#34; and wants me to apply lotion to her face instead.</li>
            <li> My daughter really dislikes it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s size is very convenient and the product doesn&#x27;t run in my eyes or sting when I sweat.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work too well</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> works great!Have been using this for years on my whole family (3 kids since baby age).</li>
            <li> Stayed at the beach for a whole week and my daughter didn&#x27;t get burned at all.</li>
            <li> Plus it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> No matter how much you&#x27;ve rubbed it in, once you start sweating, this stuff will run into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Chalky, but love the fact that it is all natural and uses only ZnO for sunblock.  </li>
            <li> i can get a good, thick, controlled schmear of the stuff on my kids&#x27; faces.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive as the pigment of my skin is a shade of red, and I have very dry skin, this product is amazing !</li>
            <li> really only very useful on the nose, as it will NOT spread beyond the application zone.</li>
            <li> I often have trouble with sunburned lips and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that feels good and actually protects my lips from getting burned.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to use when I run outside.</li>
            <li> I also have not gotten sunburned while wearing this, which is a lot more than I can say for other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m not sure whether Badger&#x27;s sells a \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; stick that smells like its \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; cream--</li>
            <li> This works ok, not great, but forget about getting this off your face easily.</li>
            <li> just bought babo botanicals clear face stick and wearing it now for the first time.</li>
            <li> Forget trying to get this near a childs face which is exactly where its intended to be used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty natural.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so if I use certain sun block lotions, my lips will break out.</li>
            <li> To remove, I used a wet wipe, and it came off easily, leave the skin silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan and ongoing user of Badger&#x27;s SPF 30 Lightly Scented All Natural Moisturizing Sun Cream for both myself and my daughter.</li>
            <li> Does not smell and we got it for a decent price on amazon after researching safer sunscreen alternatives.</li>
            <li> However, one of the main ingredients that protects your skin is Zinc.  </li>
            <li> Then, it&#x27;s just a few quick rubs to smooth it around his face in a nice, thick layer.  </li>
            <li> is the main reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy at first, but absorbs very nicely in the time it takes to brush your teeth and hair before you apply any makeup, assuming you want to.  </li>
            <li> but I still give this one high marks for ease of use and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended by the EWG sunscreen guide every May when the guide is released.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the Unscented version.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old son however, really objects to the scent.  </li>
            <li> So far I have had much luck with this sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;15mins of extra work during application is worth the no tan protection</li>
            <li> I had severe flakiness/redness, especially on my forehead and chin, after a week&#x27;s worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good, but not great.</li>
            <li> I use these sticks specifically to protect a black tattoo on my arm, so the whitening factor is important to me, and very easy to judge (like testing deodorant on a black shirt!)</li>
            <li> Comparing the two: Badger has a more &#x27;natural&#x27; smell (nutty), but I slightly prefer CB (floral).</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly like other sunblock sticks I have tried and took some effort to rub in so you didn&#x27;t have streaks on your face.</li>
            <li> While I like the high content of zinc and titanium oxide, the consistency of this product is almost took thick to rub in and it has a pretty strong smell.</li>
            <li> It does seem to be completely clear but I&#x27;ll use it a few more times before recommending it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a really dried out glue stick vs a soft Chapstick texture or even a stick deodorant texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right before I go out, I smear a ton of the stick over my nose and under eye area and lightly rub it in, leaving a thick layer on those super sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I liked the high spf given that it is a natural product, it does show white, real white when you apply it, which could be less if you spread it evenly, but Then It might not offer so much protection if you do that.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;or have ultra sensitive skin and hates smells then skip this one!</li>
            <li> Takes only slightly more effort than regular sunscreen to rub in, definitely NOT a deal breaker though.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m busy getting pitted!</li>
            <li> I used it the first day and was only at the beach for an hour or so.  </li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s a minor issue, but worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and white, but that is the trade off for being natural, which is more important to me.  </li>
            <li> Love this product and it is hard to find where I live.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised how clear Badger is!</li>
            <li> It does require a little extra rubbing to get it fully absorbed, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> need a clear face stick.</li>
            <li> all natural.</li>
            <li> so my 5 year old daughter could apply sunscreen at school by herself.)     </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I was looking for some sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out upon application.  </li>
            <li> This is WAY too white for my skin, plus it is very greasy.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old is extremely sensitive with her eyes.</li>
            <li> There was no harsh chemical smell, and my skin did not break out.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t bother my two year old at all.</li>
            <li> I use it all over, not just on the face, and neither my two-year old nor I have had any skin issues with it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old thinking</li>
            <li> , I like the natural smell.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> She also said it stung her eye even though I didn&#x27;t get near her eye.</li>
            <li> My 3 year old \\&quot;paints\\&quot; her face</li>
            <li> Just to be safe, I did a few touch up swipes before the next dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love badger products, but this sunscreen stick is so thick and paste-like</li>
            <li> It has a very light almondy smell and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but a little does go a long way with the face stick.</li>
            <li> Overall, I highly recommend this product for its durability, and the ability to stay on regardless of weather or body conditions.</li>
            <li> smell is actually the smell of unrefined Cocoa Butter and Shea butter, it is not a bad smell, so I am unsure why other reviewers stated it as an offensive smell...</li>
            <li> I live in sunny Southern California.</li>
            <li> This year, given our ongoing success with Badger&#x27;s cream product, I switched to Badger&#x27;s unscented stick product because it cost less.</li>
            <li> I also have oily screen and worried this product might make me breakout, but since I started using badger sunscreens my skin actually appears very clear and balanced.</li>
            <li> Zinc is an abrasive apparently so when cleaning the lenses on my goggles it scratched them to the point where they are no longer usable!</li>
            <li> I didnt get a sunburn at all, it does exactly what it is suppose to do unlike other products like this.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we only used this a couple of times early in the summer because I can&#x27;t stand the waxy smell.</li>
            <li> It is a natural smell and if you are not used to the smell of unrefined shea butter or cocoa butter it will be a different smell to you of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest Kabana, it is the only natural zinc sunscreen that does not make you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> I used this on myself and my three year old daughter on a Caribbean vacation last week</li>
            <li> but this didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as the generic brand.</li>
            <li> My son doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I can barely smell it, an neither can my daughter.  </li>
            <li> The benefits of no chemicals and sun protection far out weigh the issue of a white face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not for sensitive skin - Everyone&#x27;s different, but it didn&#x27;t react well to my dry-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a whitish residue, which I am sure is the zinc in the stick.</li>
            <li> ZnO doesn&#x27;t absorb through the skin like other chemicals which is much safer.  </li>
            <li> but my boyfriend is not mixed and is super pale and he normally burns with other products but has NOT had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I used to love Badger&#x27;s original formulations for their sunscreens, but unfortunately after they decided to remove some of the nice essential oils for some which changed their base formulations as well as using a different zinc type for all their sunscreens....</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is fairly sensitive, and parts of it occasionally dry out and peel.</li>
            <li> As an Esthetician/Makeup Artist/Former Nurse I&#x27;ve used personally and professionally products well over this price with not nearly the SPF.  </li>
            <li> Super thick.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it took a good half hour to rub in enough</li>
            <li> Works very well - goes on a little white.</li>
            <li> so even if you manage to get enough on the face it spreads white and leaves white patching on the face and exaggerates any dry patches you may have on your face, especially if you use acne</li>
            <li> I am a lifeguard therefore on the beach everyday and protecting my face is the main priority when it comes to sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The stick will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the stick is pretty thick</li>
            <li> Too much zinc, makes you very white, hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever smelled badger entrails on a hot summer day, you understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> I use this every single day no matter what season and whether I&#x27;m going outside or not.</li>
            <li> Sure, the lotion is a little hard to rub in, but frankly, they looked a little ghostly to start with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little harder to wash off, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Goes on white and then turns slightly pink on cheeks.</li>
            <li> It has a strange smell and burns my face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this as long as they make it.</li>
            <li> Long time in the sun, and no burn.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to blend into my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not recommending you go out in the sun that long without reapplying, but the amount I put on my face seems to allow me to go out that long</li>
            <li> SPF 30 Tangerine/Vanilla on my face ( which is still thick, but not as much as this one)</li>
            <li> Only down side you look white and it rubs off on things.</li>
            <li> This is free of the worst ingredients, and isn&#x27;t stinky, although it does have a very mild scent (it&#x27;s not perfumed, though).</li>
            <li> It seemed a little gritty, but it didn&#x27;t present any problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the ONLY sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, even after rubbing them.</li>
            <li> I do like the limited list of ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I put some jojoba oil under my eyes before I try to rub this sunscreen in and it covers up my dark circles to the point where it looks like I actually sleep sometimes.</li>
            <li> but regardless...until I can find an all natural product that works, I will be sticking to my usual chemicals and a hat when I go in the sun.  </li>
            <li> The only down fall is</li>
            <li> : Badger&#x27;s stick costs less because it is physically smaller than California Baby&#x27;s stick (it was my mistake that I hadn&#x27;t noticed the weight difference when I was price shopping).</li>
            <li> Does leave white smudges on my black purses sometimes, but it comes off with cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves a film - I was never able to fully absorb the sunscreen, and it left an obvious film on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin a little white</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Goes on a little white, so requires some rubbing.  </li>
            <li> Badger has found a sleek and discreet way of protecting your face against sun damage in this tiny little stick.  </li>
            <li> Once applied, it remains white on the face and is difficult to rub in without really pulling on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have a few different products and all of them have worked well.</li>
            <li> Product is harder to put on than I thought.</li>
            <li> Seller sent as expected.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit silly, but worth it for added protection.</li>
            <li> My nose and under my eyes were pink afterwards</li>
            <li> We spent 10 days at a North Carolina beach this summer and spent a lot of time in the sun and sand.  </li>
            <li> The drawback would be that I found it difficult to rub in in comparison to some of the less healthy options I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> and we can check how she did because it leaves a very slight white film where she has applied.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this product is crap...or if ordering from a 3rd party has anything to do with the products potency...</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviews and passed by this product.</li>
            <li> Purchased due to score on EWG.org but will look for another product.</li>
            <li> I have tried about a dozen other brands.</li>
            <li> We also try and stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the days and also use other methods like hats and shade when we can.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t cover my entire face with this as it is very thick, but I do put it under my eyes, around my mouth, ears, nose, back of neck, etc.  </li>
            <li> And if I put a little lip gloss over it, you can&#x27;t even see the pale white zinc.</li>
            <li> 2 of my kids are very pale taking after their father, their ethnicity is mixed...</li>
            <li> It does leave you with a ghostly white face, no matter how hard you rub it in.</li>
            <li> You have to push hard and when you smear it sometimes big globs come off.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviewers don&#x27;t seem to know how a mineral based sunscreen works, they complain about a white layer, they complain about being hard to rub in.  </li>
            <li> hard for my son to wipe the white stuff in.</li>
            <li> I use sunblock sticks on my younger children, easier for me and automatically thick application without running in their eyes.  </li>
            <li> This may work well for other people but not for me!</li>
            <li> Oh, and less cancer-ridden.</li>
            <li> It also was very white on my skin which is okay, but what made me stop using it was the terrible smell!  </li>
            <li> and/or contain less irritants.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thicker than I&#x27;d like but just knowing that this is all-natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the chemicals in my sunscreen just puts my mind at ease.  </li>
            <li> This may have worked a little</li>
            <li> Little blending with finger tips for the visible streaks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with the other two unused ones.</li>
            <li> This face stick is very thick and turned the skin white.</li>
            <li> Makes you a little white in the face, but there are worse things.</li>
            <li> found this sun stick to be too hard and too difficult to apply for the face, it is also very drying</li>
            <li> My dog was getting sunburned on his nose because he&#x27;s white with thin fur in some spots.</li>
            <li> I have trouble with waxy/greasy residue with CB, always had to use soap to get it off at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> For us, it seems to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I found Badger on the EWG database, and thought I might try the stick variation for convienient everyday use.</li>
            <li> But keep in mind that, as with any other sunscreen, you need to apply a thick layer for the FPS to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick</li>
            <li> A little thick to rub in, but does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, so it smells pretty bad which was his biggest complaint.</li>
            <li> I was in the sun for a few hours, so I suppose I could have reapplied at least once, which I did not.  </li>
            <li> This has to be the most disgusting smelling sunscreen on the planet.  </li>
            <li> one gets when applying it and the size of the product is too small for the price charged.</li>
            <li> Usually.  </li>
            <li> It smells a bit like flowers when  you first open it, but as you put it on and as you wear it, the smell changes to something nasty.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it is for sun protection.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult to wash out of clothes (especially rash guards) but that is a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> Not sure if ethnicity has anything to do with ability to burn since there are some reviews of people being burned with this product...</li>
            <li> usually surf for 2-4 hours</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought several.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to apply around the eyes without pulling on that delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> The worst part is that, after applying it on the face, my kids look like white ghosts, like they are ready to go to a Halloween party.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s thick, I usually help my daughter apply it to her face.</li>
            <li> 3 and 7 yr old children without much complaint about the rubbing (which does take some effort), and the California Baby was almost impossible to rub in because it came off in chunks.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is too hard to put on, I end up pulling my skin</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to apply.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s really hard to work on face.</li>
            <li> But really it&#x27;s not that difficult</li>
            <li> This face stick goes on really thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick and doesn&#x27;t glide on like you would think it should.</li>
            <li> It seems to go on really thick</li>
            <li> it is really thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> Very thick a bit hard to apply.</li>
            <li> However, it is very thick and hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply but it prevents me from tanning when out in sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to run in, too!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have evil chemicals and is small enough to pack anywhere.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the worst sun stick I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> There are other EWG-approved sunscreens that are not as annoying to use.</li>
            <li> In the past, I would have used 30 spf with chemicals and probably have gone for hours without reapplying and would NOT have burned as badly.  </li>
            <li> But this face stick smells bad, I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to get my child to wear it this summer.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to rub into kids faces.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to rub into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, and I have since switched to Kabana Green Screen tinted, so I will not look like a ghost!</li>
            <li> it can be difficult to apply, it&#x27;s not cream but stick.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product itself though.</li>
            <li> difficult to wash off&lt;br /&gt;protects</li>
            <li> Sorry as I, too, am looking for a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I even put it on very thin</li>
            <li> If my lips get sunburnt, they will break out in cold sores.</li>
            <li> stinks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just very difficult sunscreen to apply and spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> This zinc is very difficult to apply and rub in.</li>
            <li> The bottom twist broke off before I even had a chance to use it :(</li>
            <li> My kids hate the smell.</li>
            <li> very disappointed with this product..</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Hate it!</li>
            <li> Saves our kids from the Arizona sun but doesn&#x27;t get nasty stuff into their bloodstream.  </li>
            <li> This product smells awful, like plastic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this for using on the face :)</li>
            <li> I have olive skin and got very sunburn while using it. Will try something else</li>
            <li> Really like Badger&#x27;s sun protection.  I have never gotten burned using any of their products.  Only down side you look white and it rubs off on things. I also like that it stays on when running, sweating, or even on the water doing some stand up paddle boarding.</li>
            <li> I love badger sunscreen! I have a few different products and all of them have worked well. I just recently switched to natural sunscreen, I&#x27;m a multi-sport athlete and spend a great deal of time in the sun. I find that this product gives me great coverage, you do have to rub it in or it leaves white on your skin.  But really it&#x27;s not that difficult and it&#x27;s much better than all the chemicals that are in regular sunscreen.  Plus it smells very yummy, all natural. I also have oily screen and worried this product might make me breakout, but since I started using badger sunscreens my skin actually appears very clear and balanced.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever!  We have used the name brands for years, until I learned about the potential cancer damage of the chemicals in those products.  After much research on-line, I found this product, and it&#x27;s wonderful that Amazon carries it.  We don&#x27;t like putting on any type of sun product, but when you find one that works, it makes it all worth it.  My fair skinned, red-head son hasn&#x27;t gotten a sun burn since we started using this product.  We have the regular tube that we use on his body, and this face stick makes it easier to get his face covered.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan and ongoing user of Badger&#x27;s SPF 30 Lightly Scented All Natural Moisturizing Sun Cream for both myself and my daughter. Since it&#x27;s thick, I usually help my daughter apply it to her face. Neither of us minds its light scent at all. (Last year I also purchased (and really liked) California Baby&#x27;s Sun Stick so my 5 year old daughter could apply sunscreen at school by herself.)     This year, given our ongoing success with Badger&#x27;s cream product, I switched to Badger&#x27;s unscented stick product because it cost less. 1st surprise: Badger&#x27;s stick costs less because it is physically smaller than California Baby&#x27;s stick (it was my mistake that I hadn&#x27;t noticed the weight difference when I was price shopping). 2nd surprise: It ain&#x27;t unscented! When my daughter willingly tried the Badger stick, she crinkled her nose and said \\&quot;it smells yucky\\&quot;. I had hoped she was exaggerating (thinking, if Badger&#x27;s \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; cream smells pleasant, then \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stick would likely be as good or better), but when I took a whiff, I agreed the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; stick smells very yucky. I had purchased two sticks. I successfully returned and was reimbursed for the unopened stick.    Bottom line: I&#x27;m not sure whether Badger&#x27;s sells a \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; stick that smells like its \\&quot;lightly scented\\&quot; cream--if so, I&#x27;d be fully satisfied with the product! (Since I don&#x27;t want to risk another potential return-by-mail situation, I am going to stick to the Badger cream and go back to California Baby&#x27;s stick.) In any case, if you are trying the Badger stick for the first time, I advise you buy a lightly scented stick: steer clear of the unscented one &#x27;cause it smells yucky.</li>
            <li> Handy dandy stick applicator style. Non-toxic. Makes you a little white in the face, but there are worse things. I put some jojoba oil under my eyes before I try to rub this sunscreen in and it covers up my dark circles to the point where it looks like I actually sleep sometimes. Whoa! Smells good. Gives me warm and fuzzies that someday I will be less wrinkly on account of having used this product. Oh, and less cancer-ridden. Sweat-resistant--they weren&#x27;t kidding. I wore this playing army in 105-degree heat and it stayed on. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use my all natural (organic) sunblock this passed weekend since I have gradually eliminated chemicals from my life....sunblock is one of the harder items to find in the all natural no/low chemical market.  I went on a recommendation here.  I used this this stick on my face, I used plenty of it.  I was in the sun for a few hours, so I suppose I could have reapplied at least once, which I did not.  That being said I burned to a crisp.  My face was on fire all weekend and I had big circles where my sunglasses were.  In the past, I would have used 30 spf with chemicals and probably have gone for hours without reapplying and would NOT have burned as badly.  Not sure if this product is crap...or if ordering from a 3rd party has anything to do with the products potency...but regardless...until I can find an all natural product that works, I will be sticking to my usual chemicals and a hat when I go in the sun.  This stick is in the garbage.  Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t offer to use it on my niece and nephews.</li>
            <li> Product is harder to put on than I thought. Kids did not like smell. While I know it was a good product, it wasn&#x27;t right for my kids. Seller sent as expected.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t rub in very well, sunburned.</li>
            <li> love the healthy aspect of the product, but it&#x27;s so hard to rub in... we look like ghosts</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my daughter because it was considered one of the safer sunscreen products by the Environmental Working Group (EWG).  However, it made my daughter&#x27;s face itch.  I tried it, and my skin also itched and burned after using it.  We&#x27;re probably allergic or sensitive to one or more ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we only used this a couple of times early in the summer because I can&#x27;t stand the waxy smell. It&#x27;s supposed to be unscented, but it definitely has an odor and it&#x27;s not pleasant. I should have listened to the other reviews and passed by this product.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen does prevent burns but my kids look super chalky. It&#x27;s hard to run in, too!</li>
            <li> This has to be the most disgusting smelling sunscreen on the planet.  Forget trying to get this near a childs face which is exactly where its intended to be used.  If you have older kids, they might be able to tolerate it but my 10,8 and 7 year olds refused to put it on after we tried the first time.  I speak not of its ability to work mind you, but its safe to say it didn&#x27;t work because they wouldn&#x27;t wear it!  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I used to love Badger&#x27;s original formulations for their sunscreens, but unfortunately after they decided to remove some of the nice essential oils for some which changed their base formulations as well as using a different zinc type for all their sunscreens....all their sunscreens now seem to be too drying on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this sun stick to be too hard and too difficult to apply for the face, it is also very drying so even if you manage to get enough on the face it spreads white and leaves white patching on the face and exaggerates any dry patches you may have on your face, especially if you use acne medications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now try to use it just on my hands and try to spread it. It may work better if it melted upon contact to the skin, but unfortunately it does not.&lt;br /&gt;You can try putting oil on the face first then put this on, but it is still tough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is actually the smell of unrefined Cocoa Butter and Shea butter, it is not a bad smell, so I am unsure why other reviewers stated it as an offensive smell... it is not. It is a natural smell and if you are not used to the smell of unrefined shea butter or cocoa butter it will be a different smell to you of course.&lt;br /&gt;It is just very difficult sunscreen to apply and spread on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love Badger sunscreen!  It&#x27;s one of the safest sunscreens, and it works well.  I used the sunscreen stick for a marathon in Hawaii, and it fit conveniently into the pocket of my running shorts.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen was fine, but it completely ruined my snorkeling goggles! Zinc is an abrasive apparently so when cleaning the lenses on my goggles it scratched them to the point where they are no longer usable! Totally disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I prefer this to the California Baby sunscreen stick because it is easier to apply.  It is very thick and white, but that is the trade off for being natural, which is more important to me.  I am able to spread it on and rub it *mostly* in on my 1, 3 and 7 yr old children without much complaint about the rubbing (which does take some effort), and the California Baby was almost impossible to rub in because it came off in chunks.  My 7 year old son however, really objects to the scent.  Like others have said, he and I agree that it has a yucky smell to it.  Just because of that I will be trying another brand, but I still give this one high marks for ease of use and effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this sunscreen stick after much research in trying to find more natural sunscreen.  It does leave the skin a little white but my kids don&#x27;t mind.  It is very effective.  I will likely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> A bit difficult to rub into kids faces. Goes on white and then turns slightly pink on cheeks. Not the best to use on the go, but not the worst.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is perfect for someone who typically has very sensitive skin that can get very dry. When it comes to any facial product I am very picky and Badger&#x27;s sunscreen is perfect for my face and skin and I am so happy I found it. I live in a state where its gets very cold, which means that moisterizing is very important and the fact that I can use this in the winter time is perfect. The size is an added bonus and I have added this stick to list of things I check for before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> This face stick goes on really thick. Does not smell and we got it for a decent price on amazon after researching safer sunscreen alternatives. It does leave you with a ghostly white face, no matter how hard you rub it in. This is OK to use on children running out an about. I quite using it for myself, and just use Badger Kids SPF 30 Tangerine/Vanilla on my face ( which is still thick, but not as much as this one)</li>
            <li> This face stick is very thick and turned the skin white. While the kids didn&#x27;t burn, I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and I was looking for some sunscreen that wouldn&#x27;t make me break out upon application.  I researched Badger Sunscreen and found all rave reviews.  So far I have had much luck with this sunscreen.  It is friendly to all skin types, and protects well against burn.  However, one of the main ingredients that protects your skin is Zinc.  So be prepared for a strong zinc smell.  If you can get past the smell, it&#x27;s a great buy; I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  If I can, I think I will opt for a scented variety next time.</li>
            <li> Hate it! It has a strange smell and burns my face. I have very sensitive skin. I am going back to using AUBREY ORGANICS. It you use rentin -A&lt;br /&gt;or have ultra sensitive skin and hates smells then skip this one!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Takes only slightly more effort than regular sunscreen to rub in, definitely NOT a deal breaker though. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen stick was one of the best sunscreens according to Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website.  It has worked great so far.  I play tennis and it stays on and keeps me protected while I play.  I plan on having my kids use it on their faces as well.</li>
            <li> The skin on my face is fairly sensitive, and parts of it occasionally dry out and peel. Not so when I use this stick. It moisturizes my face and offers very good sunburn protection. It feels a little heavy at first, but absorbs very nicely in the time it takes to brush your teeth and hair before you apply any makeup, assuming you want to.  I could almost swear that it even improves the tone of my skin. On top of that, the cocoa butter in it makes it smell like white chocolate. Yum!    The size of the tube is perfect for purse or carry-on luggage.    My only complaint is that it is a little difficult to apply around the eyes without pulling on that delicate skin.  Still figuring out how to do that.    On the whole, though, I am very happy with this product, and I will definitely want to buy it again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for covering your kid - most of the time she can do it herself.  And it is easy to rub in.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the stick is pretty thick so it&#x27;s leaves white marks where you put it and it is difficult to rub into the skin.  Protects well though.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for using on my child&#x27;s face, and offers good protection. You can smell the cocoa butter, but I love that it&#x27;s unscented.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars, except that I wouldn&#x27;t use it on myself because it leaves a white look from the zinc oxide.</li>
            <li> Chalky, but love the fact that it is all natural and uses only ZnO for sunblock.  ZnO doesn&#x27;t absorb through the skin like other chemicals which is much safer.  Doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
            <li> EWG has rated this as a top sunscreen. After using it on a trip to a very sunny and warm climate, I understand why. It does a great job of blocking the suns rays without being overly greasy. It does require a little extra rubbing to get it fully absorbed, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.  Great all natural sunscreen.  I also read that zinc has healing properties for scars.  This stick has the highest percentage of zinc out of all the brands that I researched.  The stick will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I like that this is natural and safer than most sunscreens. It doesn&#x27;t get absorbed into the skin, which is good. And it&#x27;s safe for lakes and oceans. It goes on very white and can get flakey especially if you&#x27;re sunburned and peeling. It&#x27;s a little harder to wash off, but I&#x27;ll definitely keep using it because it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Best brand of sunscreen! I bought this for my husband to use on his tattoos. I also use it for a quick application on my young kids.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now and could not be happier.  It&#x27;s listed as one of the least harmful sunscreen products by the Environmental Working Group, gives great coverage when in the sun for long periods, and has a good feel when it goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a bit of a white tinge, but I know that comes with the territory of using a product that is both safe for my skin and effective against the sun&#x27;s rays.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it works okay, as this company has a good reputation, but I don&#x27;t really use it because the smell and texture are quite disagreeable.</li>
            <li> This is WAY too white for my skin, plus it is very greasy. I can&#x27;t wear it because I dont want to look gross and white at school. Plus, if I dab the oil off, it takes the sunscreen off so that defeats the purpose! Plus it is too hard to put on, I end up pulling my skin and I do NOT want any wrinkles! This may work well for other people but not for me! Disappointed, and I have since switched to Kabana Green Screen tinted, so I will not look like a ghost! I suggest Kabana, it is the only natural zinc sunscreen that does not make you look like a ghost.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen stick does it&#x27;s job and protects you from the sun. However, it leaves your face chalky white. Even trying to rub it in will leave your face white with flakes. This stuff just doesn&#x27;t absorb well. The white effect defeats the purpose of a face stick since I can&#x27;t walk around the office looking like I came from a construction site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought babo botanicals clear face stick and wearing it now for the first time. It does seem to be completely clear but I&#x27;ll use it a few more times before recommending it.</li>
            <li> If my lips get sunburnt, they will break out in cold sores. I also have very sensitive skin, so if I use certain sun block lotions, my lips will break out. I needed a strong, natural sunblock for my lips that would not irritate my sensitive skin. This has worked perfectly. And if I put a little lip gloss over it, you can&#x27;t even see the pale white zinc.</li>
            <li> I love this zinc oxide sunscreen! It really works, doesn&#x27;t make you look &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; on the face, very easy to apply and carry around.</li>
            <li> Always happy when a product does what it says... Bought this b/c i Don&#x27;t like putting 1000 chemicals on my daughter. This protects my fair skinned child from facial sunburn.. A stick is nice b/c it limits the chance of poking eyes and sunscreen in eyes.. My 3 year old is extremely sensitive with her eyes.</li>
            <li> Use it on my face and chest and it works very well. I especially like using it on my lips! K after looking at my vacation pictures I will not be using this anymore...got milk...need I say more</li>
            <li> Love Love this, protects my skin very well and doesn&#x27;t suffocate it. Also, leaves a matte appearance. The only down fall is it can be difficult to apply, it&#x27;s not cream but stick. I dot it over my skin.</li>
            <li> Badger does what it&#x27;s suppose to do - no drips, no burning eyes...just good sun protection for little ones.  It&#x27;s a quality product!</li>
            <li> My dog was getting sunburned on his nose because he&#x27;s white with thin fur in some spots. I bought this for him because of the lack of chemicals.  It&#x27;s great! No problems with his skin and it&#x27;s easy to apply.  I stole one of his tubes and I have been using it on my face.  The moisturizers have been great for my skin and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts on my face from the product.  As a bonus it smells great!</li>
            <li> This large stick is very convenient and it is also extremely natural with no bad ingredients. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Goes on white, stays white. Can be rubbed in to reduce the whiteness, but only a bit. Will rub off onto clothing, so beware.</li>
            <li> Comes on very white but does protect you from the sun. I am a lifeguard therefore on the beach everyday and protecting my face is the main priority when it comes to sunscreen. Love this face stick.</li>
            <li> This works ok, not great, but forget about getting this off your face easily. They should sell this in a pack that comes with a remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....and I broke out for the first time in 20 years after coating my face with it. I only dab it on the tip of my nose now sometimes when the sun is blaring and I&#x27;m busy getting pitted!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t cover my entire face with this as it is very thick, but I do put it under my eyes, around my mouth, ears, nose, back of neck, etc.  Great smelling.</li>
            <li> I used California Baby stick for 2+ years, but recently switched after CB had reformulation drama. Comparing the two: Badger has a more &#x27;natural&#x27; smell (nutty), but I slightly prefer CB (floral). CB is much whiter when applied, and goes on thicker. I&#x27;m surprised how clear Badger is! I use these sticks specifically to protect a black tattoo on my arm, so the whitening factor is important to me, and very easy to judge (like testing deodorant on a black shirt!) Badger seems to absorb into my skin more readily, and is easier to wash off. I have trouble with waxy/greasy residue with CB, always had to use soap to get it off at the end of the day. With badger, I don&#x27;t even bother washing it off because it&#x27;s not noticeable! :D&lt;br /&gt;I also feel better about the ingredient list on Badger.</li>
            <li> This is very hard to apply.  You have to push hard and when you smear it sometimes big globs come off.</li>
            <li> The face stick is amazing. It was a smooth glide on the face. It leaves behind a whitish residue, which I am sure is the zinc in the stick. It looks a bit silly, but worth it for added protection. I used the stick on my face and went out into 94 degree weather, to walk around town. Even through sun and sweat, the Badger SPF sunscreen stayed put. The sweat did not remove the zinc, and the product continued to work consistently. To remove, I used a wet wipe, and it came off easily, leave the skin silky and moisturized. There was no harsh chemical smell, and my skin did not break out. Overall, I highly recommend this product for its durability, and the ability to stay on regardless of weather or body conditions. This product is a gem of a sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Easy to put on. It&#x27;s a little thick but you can rub it in and it doesn&#x27;t bother my two year old at all.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be easier to apply. It&#x27;s really thick and doesn&#x27;t glide on like you would think it should. It&#x27;s more like a really dried out glue stick vs a soft Chapstick texture or even a stick deodorant texture. Feel like improvements to the formula could be made to have it apply easier.</li>
            <li> I used this on myself and my three year old daughter on a Caribbean vacation last week and I was really happy with it. It&#x27;s easy to apply to the face and it really stays put, which is great when you&#x27;re swimming and don&#x27;t want sunblock running into your eyes. I often have trouble with sunburned lips and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that feels good and actually protects my lips from getting burned. It smells great, like cocoa butter. It certainly does make you look pasty but that goes away if you rub it in a bit. I like the size for being able to carry around for quick re-applications. A winner for us.</li>
            <li> perfect, a little bit works.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is amazing!  I love the fact that it is all natural and organic, especially since it goes right on my face.  It feels good when it goes on, doesnâ€™t leave a sticky residue and has no weird aroma.  And most importantâ€”my skin really feels protected. Even with the zinc oxide, it doesnâ€™t leave your skin looking white if you rub it in well. I will be purchasing Badger again and again.</li>
            <li> consistency of a glue stick. really only very useful on the nose, as it will NOT spread beyond the application zone.</li>
            <li> I consider Badger to be one of the better sunscreens on the market. This is easy to use for face. I also purchased the cream &amp; works very well in tropical climates. I will purchase again. A very good sun Block &amp; not messy or skin irritating.</li>
            <li> I feel confident putting this on my family.  It&#x27;s a nice, safe option!  The drawback would be that I found it difficult to rub in in comparison to some of the less healthy options I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> This may be a good product, but when your kid won&#x27;t wear it, it&#x27;s kind of useless. It&#x27;s unscented, so it smells pretty bad which was his biggest complaint. It also stays very white, but that didn&#x27;t entirely surprise me. Overall it&#x27;s probably a good product if you or your child are not too sensitive to smells. For us, it seems to be a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Ordered this because I have already use the Badger Bug Balm and love it. My husband works outside every day and loves this because he doesn&#x27;t have to touch it and risk getting in his eyes. Wonderful products! I love that they are all natural as well!</li>
            <li> I use this every single day no matter what season and whether I&#x27;m going outside or not. I originally bought this to use when I run outside. It has made a noticeable improvement in my skin tone. This is the only sunscreen I have found that does not break me out. After I bought my first tube and tried it I liked it so much I came back and bought two more. I will continue to use this as long as they make it. It works great blocking the sun and great as a moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using daily for over six months and it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li> This does a great job of protecting the face even during a two hour afternoon Waterpolo practice!</li>
            <li> I keep one of these in my purse always for reapplying several times a day. Has no smell and doesn&#x27;t irritate. Does leave white smudges on my black purses sometimes, but it comes off with cleaning and it&#x27;s a small price to pay for great skin protection.</li>
            <li> I use this on myself and my balding chihuahua, it works great. Beware it is zinc though so until you rub it in you are white.</li>
            <li> Very thick a bit hard to apply. But has good coverage</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to put on wiggling kinds. I like all Badger products but this one is nice because doesn&#x27;t seem to run and get in her eyes so is good for faces. I wouldn&#x27;t want to fuss with a full body application with this stick, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s its intended purpose anyway. I haven&#x27;t tried with swimming so I can&#x27;t attest to how waterproof it may/may not be. Finally, good reviews by the EWG was of utmost importance to me and Badger always gets top marks.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed. This product worked great don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it took a good half hour to rub in enough do that you don&#x27;t look like you are wearing a white face mask.</li>
            <li> It works great but I don&#x27;t like the ghostly look one gets when applying it and the size of the product is too small for the price charged. Nothing wrong with the product itself though.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wanted sunscreen that is just zinc oxide and nothing else. I like that you don&#x27;t have to get it on your hands to apply. However, you might want to rub it in or spread it around a bit. Easy to carry in pure, backpack, or pocket. Thanks Badger.</li>
            <li> it looks like i painted my face white after putting this on. need a clear face stick.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be unsented.. it has a very strong odor...very disappointed with this product.. I will not order this again ..</li>
            <li> i love zinc-heavy sunblock sticks for the face.  i can get a good, thick, controlled schmear of the stuff on my kids&#x27; faces.  good product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Super thick. Even smells good.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little thicker than I&#x27;d like but just knowing that this is all-natural and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the chemicals in my sunscreen just puts my mind at ease.  I&#x27;m glad they make this and it&#x27;s available on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this product and it is hard to find where I live. It is highly recommended by the EWG sunscreen guide every May when the guide is released. I have had pre cancer areas removed from my face so a good sunscreen is a must for me. This is easy to use and to carry with you to reapply throughout the day. You do have to spread it over the area until the white disappears but that is no big deal to do.</li>
            <li> I love being able to use a face stick without the chemicals. My kids have sensitive skin and break out from most sunscreens but they don&#x27;t break out from this one. It doesn&#x27;t rub in that well but they haven&#x27;t gotten a sun burn using this product</li>
            <li> Works well. Love that it is all natural so it is safe for the whole family.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen after it received a very good review on the EWG&#x27;s web site.  I like it -- I use it on my nose and cheeks as that is were I mostly get sun even if i wear a hat. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Will use it for the rest of my life! It leaves a white residue but you just have to rub it in well. Besides that it&#x27;s a great product for those who want to take good care of their skin!!</li>
            <li> 9am-1130am and 6-8pm South Texas five days a week&lt;br /&gt;We have not burned.  A lot of reviewers don&#x27;t seem to know how a mineral based sunscreen works, they complain about a white layer, they complain about being hard to rub in.  Mineral based sunscreens don&#x27;t absorb, they leave a layer on your skin to disperse the rays. Chemical sunscreens absorb and that is why we are trying to avoid them.  So are we all ghostly? Yes. My point is this, if you rub the sunscreen in until you no longer can see it then you are defeating how this product works and most likely will get burned. Think 80&#x27;s zinc oxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Points you might care about:&lt;br /&gt;The stick goes on pretty easily&lt;br /&gt;Very difficult to wash off&lt;br /&gt;protects in and out of water&lt;br /&gt;eyes don&#x27;t burn&lt;br /&gt;your not going to win the sexiest beach goer award</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I keep it in my purse for touch ups and also keep one in my backpack for camping trips.</li>
            <li> Works well but doesn&#x27;t apply smoothly like other sunblock sticks I have tried and took some effort to rub in so you didn&#x27;t have streaks on your face. Also it doesn&#x27;t smell too pleasant.</li>
            <li> It works well. It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply but it prevents me from tanning when out in sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;15mins of extra work during application is worth the no tan protection</li>
            <li> Good, but not great. Probably the best in the least-toxic category, though. This is free of the worst ingredients, and isn&#x27;t stinky, although it does have a very mild scent (it&#x27;s not perfumed, though). It is primarily zinc oxide, so it goes on white and has to be rubbed in. My toddler likes to put it on himself, but this one doesn&#x27;t roll super smoothly, and is a bit sticky going on. The big downside of the whiteness/having to rub it in is that you wind up with it all over your fingers, which kind of defeats the purpose of a stick. (The purpose of a stick, in my opinion, being that you can put it on while you&#x27;re out at the beach or the playground and keep your fingers and palms clean for eating or touching your baby or your phone or camera.) The upside of the white color is that you can see that you haven&#x27;t missed any spots. I use it all over, not just on the face, and neither my two-year old nor I have had any skin issues with it (and I do react to some sunscreens, Aveeno, for one).</li>
            <li> Very effective. As with other natural sunscreens, needs to be rubbed in or you&#x27;ll have a ghost face!</li>
            <li> I know everyone is concerned about sunscreen chemicals so I tried this... but this didn&#x27;t work anywhere near as well as the generic brand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell...</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for going in the water with a bald head and light skin. Stays on really well while swimming and sweating.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and relatively chemical free (for a sunscreen). Also contains non-nano zinc.</li>
            <li> A little thick to rub in, but does the job.</li>
            <li> This stick makes application much easier than it used to be. If you&#x27;re a lifeguard, sailor, skier then you know what I&#x27;m talking about. Taking it off isn&#x27;t quite as easy as putting it on. There&#x27;s a residue of dryness that needs to be washed away before applying a moisturizer, but the convenience of the stick makes it worth it.</li>
            <li> This zinc is very difficult to apply and rub in. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The bottom twist broke off before I even had a chance to use it :(</li>
            <li> We will buy again.  My son doesn&#x27;t like the smell, but I can barely smell it, an neither can my daughter.  It is a bit &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;, but that makes it easier to spread around.  It is expensive, so we use it mostly for over the nose and &amp;#34;raccoon eyes&amp;#34; part of the kids face and use cheaper stuff for elsewhere.  Usually.  ;-)</li>
            <li> Works very well - goes on a little white.</li>
            <li> My review is actually for the creme and not the stick.  It also was very white on my skin which is okay, but what made me stop using it was the terrible smell!  It smells a bit like flowers when  you first open it, but as you put it on and as you wear it, the smell changes to something nasty.  Sorry as I, too, am looking for a &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old thinking she&#x27;s like it for her face. I was severely mistaken. After 2-3 applications she now says &amp;#34;No stick!&amp;#34; and wants me to apply lotion to her face instead. I don&#x27;t have any complaints on the sublock itself--it works well to prevent sunburn. But just like the Badger cream it leaves a visible white discoloration. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It seems to go on really thick and my daughter didn&#x27;t like the smell but that is a matter of taste.  I am not sure how it is for sun protection.</li>
            <li> Works well and like that its natural, it has great rating on EWG.</li>
            <li> Badger Face Stick delivered all it was needed for. Long time in the sun, and no burn. Face wasn&#x27;t sticky and there was no scent. An all around excellent product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I like to keep a stick of sunscreen in my purse for my children just in case we need to reapply when we are out and about. While I like the high content of zinc and titanium oxide, the consistency of this product is almost took thick to rub in and it has a pretty strong smell. My daughter really dislikes it. I probably will end of getting rid of it because my kids will cooperate more willingly with other products.</li>
            <li> Too much zinc, makes you very white, hard to rub in. But it is odorless.</li>
            <li> As a scuba diver, I require a sunscreen that will stand up to the sun, wind and lots of salt water. I also want to use a product that is environmentally-friendly and won&#x27;t make my skin breakout. At last, I found The One.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently went diving in Bonaire and after a 60 minute dive I touched my face and could feel the sunscreen was still there!  I have never had a sunscreen hold up this well. Just to be safe, I did a few touch up swipes before the next dive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also training for a century ride. I keep the Badger stick in my jersey pocket. It&#x27;s size is very convenient and the product doesn&#x27;t run in my eyes or sting when I sweat.</li>
            <li> I love badger products, but this sunscreen stick is so thick and paste-like, it&#x27;s hard to apply. I bought this thinking it would make sunscreening my kids faster and easier, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I do like the limited list of ingredients.  However, it is very thick and hard to apply.  Once applied, it remains white on the face and is difficult to rub in without really pulling on the skin.  There are other EWG-approved sunscreens that are not as annoying to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this sunscreen for use at the beaches of Cape Cod. I used it the first day and was only at the beach for an hour or so.  My nose and under my eyes were pink afterwards and I did not go into the water.  I have a feeling that I might have had an allergic reaction to it as my face was fine the next day.  I did not use it for the rest of vacation - used Alba Botanica Mineral sunscreen instead on both face and body and it worked great.  I will have to give this one another try when I&#x27;m up for a possible adverse reaction again.  I know that others have said they swear by this product so it is very possible that I am allergic to one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work too well and I am olive tone and still burned with it on. Without it, I don&#x27;t burn. Also, the product leaves a white covering on your skin. Purchased due to score on EWG.org but will look for another product.</li>
            <li> I applied before going surfing and took the stick with me.  Reapplied after seventy or eighty minutes in the water and continued surfing for another eighty or ninety minutes, and the sunscreen stayed.  Actually, it only came off when I washed my face with soap, later that day.  Next day, same thing.  Great product.  Just bought another 4 sticks.  But keep in mind that, as with any other sunscreen, you need to apply a thick layer for the FPS to work.</li>
            <li> This product is a nice and gentle face sunscreen.  Many sunscreens make me break out or get a rash, but this did neither.  I also have not gotten sunburned while wearing this, which is a lot more than I can say for other sunscreens I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing and natural</li>
            <li> Just what EWG.org recommended for me &amp; my kiddos. Sure, the lotion is a little hard to rub in, but frankly, they looked a little ghostly to start with. That&#x27;s why we needed the sunscreen. Conversely, it&#x27;s very easy to apply and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> For everyone using Badger products, keep in mind that they screw all of their employees and fire people with cancer. Their super liberal profile is neither super or liberal. Buy some zinc from cvs and your money doesn&#x27;t go to people who claim one thing then practice another.</li>
            <li> Badger makes a sunscreen that does not contain parabens, fragrances, etc., that I&#x27;m trying to eliminate. I have a tube of their sunscreen and like it a lot. I bought the stick version for easier transport when I travel via plane.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen! I was trying to find one what I could use specifically on my face that wasn&#x27;t greasy and I could fit pretty well into my bag. This one&#x27;s about the size of a jumbo lip balm. It does go on white, so you need to rub it in a bit. It also isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34;. It has a nutty chocolaty scent (probably the Shea butter) which I actually like. I also like how it isn&#x27;t full of chemicals, dyes and scents. It&#x27;s pretty natural. Overall, I&#x27;d highly recommend this :)</li>
            <li> This is the perfect product for people who love to spend time outside in the sun but don&#x27;t want sun damaged skin. It is very easy to apply, does a good job on blocking the sun.  Doesn&#x27;t have evil chemicals and is small enough to pack anywhere.  It is like lip balm for your face.  It goes on white and stays white, but hey, I am a red head and have fare skin.  If people don&#x27;t like they way it looks, tell them not to look at you.  The benefits of no chemicals and sun protection far out weigh the issue of a white face.  My wife says it smells funny, I like the natural smell.  Great product and idea, thanks again Badger!</li>
            <li> This is rated as one of the best non-toxic sunscreens and for good reason.  Environemental Working Group and many others love this product and so do we.  Saves our kids from the Arizona sun but doesn&#x27;t get nasty stuff into their bloodstream.  It can be difficult to wash out of clothes (especially rash guards) but that is a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> This smells great, is gentle on my skin, but it does not work very well as a sunscreen. In addition, it&#x27;s sticky and makes me look like a shiny mime for about 30 minutes until it absorbs all the way.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very light and scattered on the face which is where I use it, very practical not been any allergy, and leaves skin well hydrated in good condition, has filled all my expectations, I&#x27;ll buy from now on badger brand, so good I had no objection to the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was fast.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> I have been looking for sunscreen to put around my eyes that doesn&#x27;t sting.  This is the only stuff I found that works - I have tried about a dozen other brands.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive as the pigment of my skin is a shade of red, and I have very dry skin, this product is amazing ! I didnt get a sunburn at all, it does exactly what it is suppose to do unlike other products like this. Best part about it is it moisterizing my skin better than most moisturizers !</li>
            <li> I am a big believer in avoiding all of the toxic chemicals found in most commercial sunscreen products, so I was very pleased to find the Badger SPF 35 Sunscreen Face Stick Unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is 100% natural and manufactured from farm raised, grass fed badgers that are lovingly interacted with daily prior to being humanely slaughtered, ground up into a fine paste and pressed into push-up stick form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Unscented version.  If you&#x27;ve ever smelled badger entrails on a hot summer day, you understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time obsessing over sunscreens for my son.  I was a huge fan of Loving Naturals, but the sunscreen I normally bought from them was unavailable/discontinued.  I decided to try Badger since I see so many suggestions in parenting forums and blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a tube of the sunscreen and bought this Face Stick for...well, obviously his face.  It was super helpful to be able to smear it all over and then blend -- it helped me know that I was covering all skin.  My son is three and he liked to &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; put it on his forehead and cheeks while I applied sunscreen everywhere else -- and if you have a three year old, you know any distraction is welcome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We didn&#x27;t have any problems with irritation, redness, or sensitivity.  It seemed a little gritty, but it didn&#x27;t present any problems. We spent 10 days at a North Carolina beach this summer and spent a lot of time in the sun and sand.  I&#x27;m glad to say Badger helped protect my son&#x27;s skin and protected him from any sunburn.  We&#x27;ll be buying this again next summer!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 5 year old daughter.  We try to use the more natural sunscreens when we can.  It seems to be effective as far as keeping her protected, however, when she gets sweaty it runs and she complains of her eyes burning.  While I realize that isn&#x27;t uncommon in sunscreens, I would expect the specific face sticks to run a lot less and/or contain less irritants.  Stick to the sport sticks.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Goes on a little white, so requires some rubbing.  But this is a good product that is natural and non-toxic.  Just what I was looking for. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Do not believe any of the reviews that say this doesn&#x27;t leave your face white or purplish.  This doesn&#x27;t blend it at all.  I know, I know that is pretty much always the case when it comes to zinc oxide, but I wanted to believe otherwise.  I&#x27;m sure it will do a great job of stopping harmful sun rays from damaging your skin and doesn&#x27;t contain more harmful ingredients, but you will look odd.  As long as you know that in advance and are OK with it, than this product will be great for you.  However, for me they still need to figure out how to not use chemicals, but also not let me and my family look like we have clown faces on.</li>
            <li> I wish this was a little easier to apply - it isn&#x27;t great and my son does not want it on his face which is what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> works great!Have been using this for years on my whole family (3 kids since baby age). 2 of my kids are very pale taking after their father, their ethnicity is mixed...we have not had any problems with this. We have NOT had any burns but have gotten some nice tan color to our skin. Not sure if ethnicity has anything to do with ability to burn since there are some reviews of people being burned with this product...but my boyfriend is not mixed and is super pale and he normally burns with other products but has NOT had any problems with this product. SO I dont think ethnicity has anything to do with it. We have used it in Australia, Hawaii, Mexico...places with tons of sun! We have had days where we were in the sun most of the day in the water and not had any problems. We also try and stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the days and also use other methods like hats and shade when we can. We love this and continue to use for all sun exposures...pool, vacation, soccer</li>
            <li> Badger sunblock stick works well. It is easy to rub onto my son&#x27;s face. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This is basically white paint</li>
            <li> I use sunblock sticks on my younger children, easier for me and automatically thick application without running in their eyes.  This particular sunblock stick is great.  Once you rub it in, the skin feels great and smooth, not sticky or greasy.  The smell (or lack thereof) doesn&#x27;t bother me which is surprising since I am pregnant and my usual high sensitivity to sunscreen smell is heightened.</li>
            <li> Stayed at the beach for a whole week and my daughter didn&#x27;t get burned at all. I even put it on very thin so she wouldn&#x27;t look white. Great product!</li>
            <li> My son is allergic to most other sunscreens, but this is a great option for his face.  He lets me put it on without fighting me since I tell him I&#x27;m drawing on him.  Then, it&#x27;s just a few quick rubs to smooth it around his face in a nice, thick layer.  Yes, it&#x27;s white, but he didn&#x27;t burn at all three days at the beach and pool.  Success!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to do ... prevent sunburns.&lt;br /&gt;It has a great rating on EWG.org, which means that it has little or no harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;That is the main reason I purchased it. This product is WHITE though and does not blend easily.&lt;br /&gt;I put it on my kids faces when they are in the water. I do not care that it is white. This way I know it is on ... if I can&#x27;t see it then it is time to re-apply ... that is my philosophy. Easy to apply and easy to take with you.</li>
            <li> hard for my son to wipe the white stuff in. good ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but this is the ONLY sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes, even after rubbing them. Plus it is very moisturizing. It takes a long time to blend into my skin but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> This may have worked a little but I still had some sunburn on my face.</li>
            <li> Impressive. Badger has found a sleek and discreet way of protecting your face against sun damage in this tiny little stick.  Anything that fights premature aging has my attention. I like not having my hands overloaded or slippery. Little blending with finger tips for the visible streaks. For unscented it did have a fragrance I&#x27;m not to fond of. But 35 SPF for all seasons is a winner for me especially living in Texas where we get all 4 seasons in 1 week...lol! Yes I recommend this product and can&#x27;t wait to see what Badger has come up with to top this. As an Esthetician/Makeup Artist/Former Nurse I&#x27;ve used personally and professionally products well over this price with not nearly the SPF.  Beautiful Skin Is Always In... :)</li>
            <li> Very nice product,  will tell you more when we get back -end of months vacation.</li>
            <li> I use this and it&#x27;s sister cream for surfing in SoCal summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first arrive at teh beach, I rub the cream all over my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then change (get in bathing suit or wetsuit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wax or comb my board, put my key some where, get a drink, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right before I go out, I smear a ton of the stick over my nose and under eye area and lightly rub it in, leaving a thick layer on those super sensitive areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually surf for 2-4 hours and I never burn. I&#x27;m not recommending you go out in the sun that long without reapplying, but the amount I put on my face seems to allow me to go out that long and I&#x27;m a REALLY white guy. When i get back in I still have to towel the leftover off my face to get teh white off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If not getting skin cancer is your main concern over looking &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; at the beach, or if keeping the oceans chemical free so the reefs don&#x27;t get destroyed, then this is the sunscreen for you.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would rub in better since it&#x27;s specifically for face, but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;ll just go back to making my own. Make sure to put it on about 30 minutes before you are out in the sun or you&#x27;ll get burned if you burn easily.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst sun stick I&#x27;ve ever used. I have two kids (7 and 5). I live in sunny Southern California. Sun screen is a daily essential. I&#x27;ve tried almost all the children sun screen. This product smells awful, like plastic. My kids hate the smell. In addition, it&#x27;s really hard to work on face. You have to pull and push to spread the product on the skin. When I tried to spread it on my kid&#x27;s face, the stick broke into pieces. The worst part is that, after applying it on the face, my kids look like white ghosts, like they are ready to go to a Halloween party. I purchased a pack of three. I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m going to do with the other two unused ones.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works very well for our family with very light sensitive skin and I feel good about using it often without soaking our skin in chemicals. It has a very light almondy smell and doesn&#x27;t clog pores, but a little does go a long way with the face stick.</li>
            <li> it is really thick and sticky.  It does&#x27;t apply easily and must be rubbed in.  I don&#x27;t use it often because it is more work than it is worth</li>
            <li> To think. Doesn&#x27;t rub in and can&#x27;t get it off even after a shower.</li>
            <li> Such a shame because I LOVE the Badger brand and their dedication to safe products. Their regular sunblock is awesome! But this face stick smells bad, I&#x27;m not sure how I&#x27;m going to get my child to wear it this summer. She also said it stung her eye even though I didn&#x27;t get near her eye. Unfortunately I bought several.</li>
            <li> Works well. Reminds me of the colored zinc sticks from the 80s but it end up blending in fine. It is unscented, and it is, but the oils and waxes used have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m expecting, and my doctor recommended a more natural sunscreen. I found Badger on the EWG database, and thought I might try the stick variation for convienient everyday use. My biggest complaints:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs - No matter how much you&#x27;ve rubbed it in, once you start sweating, this stuff will run into your eyes. And it burns severe enough that had to go inside and rinse my eyes. No way I&#x27;d put this on a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves a film - I was never able to fully absorb the sunscreen, and it left an obvious film on my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not for sensitive skin - Everyone&#x27;s different, but it didn&#x27;t react well to my dry-prone skin. I had severe flakiness/redness, especially on my forehead and chin, after a week&#x27;s worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POINT-65 oz., not 65 oz. - There is a typo in the product title. This stick is only slightly bigger than a tube of lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frequent re-application - For optimum performance, Badger recommends you re-apply every hour and a half. A $9 tube lasted me only about two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stinks - It&#x27;s a minor issue, but worth mentioning. The stuff smells like a protein shake. That means when I put it on, I smell like a protein shake. People notice.</li>
            <li> I liked the high spf given that it is a natural product, it does show white, real white when you apply it, which could be less if you spread it evenly, but Then It might not offer so much protection if you do that. So, I only ue it for armas and hands, not face</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to use. My 3 year old \\&quot;paints\\&quot; her face and we can check how she did because it leaves a very slight white film where she has applied. It easily rubs in. Stick is easy to toss in a bag and go!</li>
