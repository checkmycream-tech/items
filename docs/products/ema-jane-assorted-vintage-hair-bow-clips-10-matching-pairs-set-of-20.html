            <li>The biggest pain is trying to keep track of them because they aren&#x27;t so easy to use interchangeably / don&#x27;t coordinate</li>
            <li>The alligator clips make it easy to also use these with a hair band.</li>

            <li>She has superfine hair and its always in her eyes.</li>
            <li>worth the money.. and will be buying more</li>
            <li>the colors are exactly as pictured, so you can combine them with many outfits.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for small heads and thinner hair.  </li>

            <li>They stay put fairly well and haven&#x27;t showed any signs of starting to come apart like the cheaper (made in China)</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind spending 20 dollars for 2/3rds of the bows, not bad.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s pretty easy to cover them, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered these bows two or three other times and they were great.</li>
            <li>These hair clips are beautiful but starts coming apart after some few months</li>
            <li>My daughter is 2 and they look great, but I don&#x27;t see us using it in few years.</li>
            <li>so it was nice to find reds, blues and yellow in these hair bows.</li>
            <li>They do stay in place fairly well, but they are a bit rough on a toddler head.</li>
            <li>they are cute and handy for my little girl to be fashionable!</li>
            <li>They are super cute, not too big and hold on well.</li>
            <li>She has very fine hair that all the standard barettes slip right out of.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just so cute, I never did return them, and I found a tutorial online for how to add grosgrain ribbon to protect the bare backs.  </li>
            <li>The colors are great &amp; I was so excited to have matching little bows for pig tails on my two year old.</li>
            <li>exactly as described.... and super fast shipping...</li>
            <li>They are made well, and very reasonably priced compared to others I&#x27;ve looked at.</li>
            <li>My niece really loves them, and everyone wants to know where I got them!!</li>
            <li>They are so cute and tiny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been awhile since I bought these for my kids, but I felt it was worth posting a review because I really do like these hair clips.</li>
            <li>Was really cute initially..</li>
            <li>therefore these clips were exactly what she needed to stay put.</li>
            <li>If she&#x27;d leave them in her hair, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d last well.</li>
            <li>It is only day one, but I was quite pleased with the bows.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>(I would have paid more for bigger!).</li>
            <li>They would slide easily into one of those open knit head bands for a bit of decor.</li>
            <li>These easily clip into a bit of their hair on their heads and are secure enough for me to take several pictures.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt seem to cause that much of concern.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thin hair and this is great.</li>
            <li>These clips stayed in her hair very well.</li>
            <li>My new puppy families love the pictures I take of their future puppy and always remark on the cute little bows.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>AND they stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair better than other ones we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews before placing my order because like so many others stated they don&#x27;t match whats in the picture and not worth the $20.&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the pairs 1 matches the picture.</li>
            <li>My two year old has very thin hair and these little clips stay put better than most bows that we own.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Little girls will Love these bows.</li>
            <li>I love to put little bows in their hair.</li>
            <li>Cute for little girls!</li>
            <li>I liked the colors a lot, but the clip was rather pointy and metallic, which means you have to be very careful when putting it on an active, moving toddler.</li>
            <li>would be fantastic for little baby girls too of course.</li>
            <li>I think the ribbons should come completely covered, but the picture on Amazon did show that they weren&#x27;t covered.  </li>
            <li>I have been using them to keep my 10 month old&#x27;s hair out of her face</li>
            <li>but my 4 year old loves to match with her sister</li>
            <li>Hands down a super product.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if you can use them on fine baby hair..</li>
            <li>This is critical for us because many of the other clips quickly slide off or down their hair until they are dangling at the end of a few strands of hair.</li>
            <li>My kids are both preschool age right now, and these hair bows STAY PUT but don&#x27;t usually snag their hair.</li>
            <li>These were pretty cute little bows for my girls, unfortunately they didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>

            <li> They would slide easily into one of those open knit head bands for a bit of decor.</li>
            <li> These easily clip into a bit of their hair on their heads and are secure enough for me to take several pictures.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt seem to cause that much of concern.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin hair and this is great.</li>
            <li> These clips stayed in her hair very well.</li>
            <li> My new puppy families love the pictures I take of their future puppy and always remark on the cute little bows.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> AND they stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair better than other ones we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before placing my order because like so many others stated they don&#x27;t match whats in the picture and not worth the $20.&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the pairs 1 matches the picture.</li>
            <li> My two year old has very thin hair and these little clips stay put better than most bows that we own.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Little girls will Love these bows.</li>
            <li> I love to put little bows in their hair.</li>
            <li> Cute for little girls!</li>
            <li> I liked the colors a lot, but the clip was rather pointy and metallic, which means you have to be very careful when putting it on an active, moving toddler.</li>
            <li> would be fantastic for little baby girls too of course.</li>
            <li> I think the ribbons should come completely covered, but the picture on Amazon did show that they weren&#x27;t covered.  </li>
            <li> I have been using them to keep my 10 month old&#x27;s hair out of her face</li>
            <li> but my 4 year old loves to match with her sister</li>
            <li> Hands down a super product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if you can use them on fine baby hair..</li>
            <li> This is critical for us because many of the other clips quickly slide off or down their hair until they are dangling at the end of a few strands of hair.</li>
            <li> My kids are both preschool age right now, and these hair bows STAY PUT but don&#x27;t usually snag their hair.</li>
            <li> These were pretty cute little bows for my girls, unfortunately they didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li> These are small enough that she doesn&#x27;t feel them as much</li>
            <li> I bought these for my toddler, they don&#x27;t open wide at all and can snap out of your fingers when applying.</li>
            <li> My 19 month old wears one everyday .</li>
            <li> so if one of the pair goes missing, it turns into an epic search.</li>
            <li> They are smaller bows, about 2 inches long, 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> I just wish they didn&#x27;t have such sharp teeth.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had very little hair the first year of her life; a few strands here and there.</li>
            <li> I wish they were a little bigger</li>
            <li> Also, the edges of the clips are jagged and somewhat sharp.</li>
            <li> but once again assorted not exactly as shown in images.</li>
            <li> They do have sharp teeth</li>
            <li> These are very cute bows but about 1/3 of them have broken, the bow came off or the barrettes have frayed badly.</li>
            <li> The colors are great..not dark as another review mentioned.  </li>
            <li> Not your average hair clip.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> is a little to extreme.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel the edges are very sharp either.  </li>
            <li> and they last at least a little while before she takes them out.</li>
            <li> They should be way less money</li>
            <li> I was looking for hair clips for my little girl.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s now 16 months (has loads of hair) and we&#x27;re still using them everyday.</li>
            <li> I hate using dog bows because they always use those tiny rubber bands and puppies don&#x27;t tolerate the rubber bands very well.</li>
            <li> the bows are sooo small.  </li>
            <li> I breed small toy breed dogs and when I take puppy pictures</li>
            <li> i was having a hard time finding a variety of bows for my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> It just gives you a peace of mind that it won&#x27;t hurt delicate scalps.</li>
            <li> If the bows are too late she takes them out immediately.</li>
            <li> This is particularly annoying to them because they want to play and not constantly be interrupted by clip malfunctions.</li>
            <li> and they have fallen apart unfortunately after about 6-8 months of infrequent use..</li>
            <li> These are a bit expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> How anyone can review this any lower is wrong.  </li>
            <li> These are terrible, the ribbons come of with the first wear and the metal clip are terrible quality.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also impossible for your child to pull out of her hair.  </li>

            <li> they look soo cute on my toddler:) now she has matching hair pins with all her dresses:)</li>
            <li> i was having a hard time finding a variety of bows for my granddaughter. These are varied, good quality, and very attractive.</li>
            <li> Cute for little girls! Look great.</li>
            <li> I am rewriting my review and giving these more stars.  They&#x27;re just so cute, I never did return them, and I found a tutorial online for how to add grosgrain ribbon to protect the bare backs.  I think the ribbons should come completely covered, but the picture on Amazon did show that they weren&#x27;t covered.  And it&#x27;s pretty easy to cover them, so all in all I&#x27;m glad I bought these and kept them.  The bird clips by Ema Jane ARE covered, and adorable also.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors of these bows, but they are falling apart and do not stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair very well. She is two and we use bows to keep her hair out of her eyes.</li>
            <li> cute in my toddler&#x27;s her</li>
            <li> I liked the colors a lot, but the clip was rather pointy and metallic, which means you have to be very careful when putting it on an active, moving toddler.</li>
            <li> these are the cutest clips I have bought yet. not that easy to put in but they stay put well.</li>
            <li> Little girls will Love these bows. The price is reasonable for what you get, which is  Good color selection, qood quality construction, just delightful.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to all!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my toddler, they don&#x27;t open wide at all and can snap out of your fingers when applying. Also, the edges of the clips are jagged and somewhat sharp. I thought the variety of colors was nice and the price not bad</li>
            <li> These bows are great! They have bright colors, which my daughter loves. They are easy to use, and stay in her hair (she has fine hair). I like the fact that there is ribbon on the edge closest to the scalp.</li>
            <li> Adorable . Just as shown . My 19 month old wears one everyday .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered these bows two or three other times and they were great. However this time around the bows aren&#x27;t glued to the clip as well because they keep coming apart. I still love the bows, I just have to glue them again.</li>
            <li> I love these bows!!!  They are so cute and tiny.  The perfect size for a toddler with pigtails!  Best ones we have found to date.</li>
            <li> Well-made. Easy to use. Nice price.</li>
            <li> I love these!  They stay in find toddler hair.</li>
            <li> The bows are very cute.</li>
            <li> Very cute and you get a lot for your money! I bought these as a Christmas gift for my niece and I know that my sister dresses her in &amp;#34;non-girly&amp;#34; colors so it was nice to find reds, blues and yellow in these hair bows.</li>
            <li> Love these hair clips. They are super cute, not too big and hold on well. Nice variety of colors and cute baby-appropriate designs. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very happy with these clips! They are the perfect size for my little one&#x27;s head, and because they are alligator clips,  they don&#x27;t slip out of her hair. They are made well, and very reasonably priced compared to others I&#x27;ve looked at.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I bought these for my kids, but I felt it was worth posting a review because I really do like these hair clips. My kids are both preschool age right now, and these hair bows STAY PUT but don&#x27;t usually snag their hair. This is critical for us because many of the other clips quickly slide off or down their hair until they are dangling at the end of a few strands of hair. This is particularly annoying to them because they want to play and not constantly be interrupted by clip malfunctions. I want clips that fit and add cute color to my girls&#x27; hair, and these fit the bill. The biggest pain is trying to keep track of them because they aren&#x27;t so easy to use interchangeably / don&#x27;t coordinate so if one of the pair goes missing, it turns into an epic search.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these pretty bows. They are as described and pictured.  They hold a lot of hair which was pleasantly surprising.</li>
            <li> Was really cute initially.. The clips then starting getting off the ribbons and they have fallen apart unfortunately after about 6-8 months of infrequent use..</li>
            <li> I am not sure if you can use them on fine baby hair..they have jagged teeth and metal arc. We bought some earlier these year from BabiesR us and Bundle monster they all are coated with grosgrain fabric. It just gives you a peace of mind that it won&#x27;t hurt delicate scalps. They are cute though but once again assorted not exactly as shown in images.</li>
            <li> I loved them and so did my Granddaughter.  Colors were very easy to coordinate.  Would get these again any time.</li>
            <li> Super cute and the colors are exactly as pictured, so you can combine them with many outfits. My toddler loves them.</li>
            <li> These were pretty cute little bows for my girls, unfortunately they didn&#x27;t hold up well.</li>
            <li> These are a bit expensive for what they are.</li>
            <li> Love these AND they stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair better than other ones we&#x27;ve tried. So adorable and love the variety!</li>
            <li> It was just perfect for my grandaughter.  She has superfine hair and its always in her eyes. At age 2 1/2 she won&#x27;t wear headbands, so these worked out well!</li>
            <li> These are terrible, the ribbons come of with the first wear and the metal clip are terrible quality. They should be way less money then what they are priced for. More like 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> Great hair clips for ponytails, but I would say they are toddler size. My daughter is 2 and they look great, but I don&#x27;t see us using it in few years.</li>
            <li> they are cute and handy for my little girl to be fashionable!</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before placing my order because like so many others stated they don&#x27;t match whats in the picture and not worth the $20.&lt;br /&gt;Out of all the pairs 1 matches the picture.</li>
            <li> These hair bows were perfect. My daughters hair is very fine therefore these clips were exactly what she needed to stay put.They do have sharp teeth but it doesnt seem to cause that much of concern.</li>
            <li> Hands down a super product. How anyone can review this any lower is wrong.  Beyond brite colors just as pictured...</li>
            <li> These are so very very cute! They do slip a little with the fine baby hair, but for the most part they work great! i bought some for friends too!</li>
            <li> These bows are adorable! The colors are great &amp; I was so excited to have matching little bows for pig tails on my two year old. They stay in hair great, however, if you have a kid that pulls bows out of their hair (like mine), you&#x27;ll find they don&#x27;t hold up that well. If she&#x27;d leave them in her hair, I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d last well. But she pulls them out &amp; I&#x27;ve had several of them fall apart after she wore them once or twice. It&#x27;s a bummer, because they&#x27;re so cute.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use these on a newborn&#x27;s head, but they are perfect for my toddler. She has very fine hair that all the standard barettes slip right out of.  These have tension and teeth - yes it&#x27;s jagged when open but it&#x27;s also impossible for your child to pull out of her hair.  I love these, they&#x27;re totally cute to clip onto pig tails too.</li>
            <li> These hair clips are beautiful but starts coming apart after some few months</li>
            <li> These are beautiful!  I just wish they didn&#x27;t have such sharp teeth.  They do stay in place fairly well, but they are a bit rough on a toddler head.</li>
            <li> It is only day one, but I was quite pleased with the bows.  The colors are great..not dark as another review mentioned.  My two year old has very thin hair and these little clips stay put better than most bows that we own.  I love that she can have matching piggies now.  I don&#x27;t feel the edges are very sharp either.  I cannot vow for the longevity of the bows at this time...but they look like they will hold up for a while.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these bows. They are just perfect for clipping back my 11 month old&#x27;s hair, and the assortment of colors means that she is never uncoordinated.  The bows are made of quality fabric and are so cute.  We get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 16mo old. If the bows are too late she takes them out immediately. These are small enough that she doesn&#x27;t feel them as much and they last at least a little while before she takes them out. Wish they had more color options.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thin hair and this is great.</li>
            <li> exactly as described.... and super fast shipping... worth the money.. and will be buying more</li>
            <li> WONDERFUL! My daughter had very little hair the first year of her life; a few strands here and there. These clips stayed in her hair very well. She&#x27;s now 16 months (has loads of hair) and we&#x27;re still using them everyday. Not to mention, they are VERY cute!</li>
            <li> Great colors! It was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not your average hair clip.  It&#x27;s got jagged teeth and the arc of the clip is a little to extreme.  Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This set is absolutely adorable!  I love that I can put matching bows in my daughters hair.  The clips are great as they have the alligator teeth and really stay in place.  The reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars, however, is b/c the bows are sooo small.  I wish they were a little bigger (I would have paid more for bigger!).</li>
            <li> Very cute and nicely made.  Quite pleased with the purchase :)</li>
            <li> So cute and made really well.</li>
            <li> These clips are super cute and don&#x27;t pull or snag on fine baby hair.  They stay put fairly well and haven&#x27;t showed any signs of starting to come apart like the cheaper (made in China) hair clips.  I have been using them to keep my 10 month old&#x27;s hair out of her face but my 4 year old loves to match with her sister so it&#x27;s perfect that there are two of each color!</li>
            <li> I was looking for hair clips for my little girl.  These are perfect for small heads and thinner hair.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome quality bows, perfect size for little girls!  My niece really loves them, and everyone wants to know where I got them!!</li>
            <li> My kids love these. They are adorable.</li>
            <li> High quality and stay in my 4 yo&#x27;s very fine hair.  Cute styles.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and bright vibrant colors and patterns. They look so much better in person than in the pictures. I personally use these in my dog&#x27;s hair for pictures. I breed small toy breed dogs and when I take puppy pictures I love to put little bows in their hair. I hate using dog bows because they always use those tiny rubber bands and puppies don&#x27;t tolerate the rubber bands very well. It pulls their hair and hurts them. These easily clip into a bit of their hair on their heads and are secure enough for me to take several pictures. My new puppy families love the pictures I take of their future puppy and always remark on the cute little bows.&lt;br /&gt;These would be fantastic for little baby girls too of course. The alligator clips make it easy to also use these with a hair band. They would slide easily into one of those open knit head bands for a bit of decor. They are smaller bows, about 2 inches long, 1 inch wide.</li>
            <li> Adds the perfect touch to all my daughter&#x27;s cute outfits.  She&#x27;s 6 months and these bow clips are a good size, keeps hair out of her face and eyes and adds color and spice to every outfit.  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> These are very cute bows but about 1/3 of them have broken, the bow came off or the barrettes have frayed badly. If you don&#x27;t mind spending 20 dollars for 2/3rds of the bows, not bad. Quality should be better for the price.</li>
            <li> Cute and sturdy. I used a couple of pairs as package decorations on granddaughter&#x27;s birthday presents. Would like same product in solid colors.</li>
