    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Really excellent product and the price can&#x27;t be beat!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it for my wife who tells me it is excellent.</li>
            <li>I have 4b hair, and this conditioner is excellent in conjunction with the clarifying conditioner as my &amp;#34;Shampoo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The temperature is perfect here</li>
            <li>I find relying on someone else to find and purchase items for me not to always be the best idea.</li>
            <li>It is a very good product at this price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Waterfall Mist is a great conditioner but not the best Suave bargain.</li>
            <li>I can see this beautiful rainforest type of place in my mind</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a great product...</li>
            <li>Thank you Suave for great products.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the great price, smell, and amount you get with each bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very nice.</li>
            <li>Great for cowashes and smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>It is a good value</li>
            <li>Smells good and give hair body.</li>
            <li>This is Curly Girl Friendly on a budget but with great, moisturizing results!</li>
            <li>Awesome price for the quality, this is true with all Suave Shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, good product for the price, but I would love a stronger scent.</li>
            <li>I like suave shampoo and conditioner because it gets my hair clean and it smells good, too.  </li>
            <li>My wife just brought home a bottle of this Suave Refreshing Waterfall Mist Shampoo.</li>
            <li>i love the smell too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m relaxing in just enough shade to make it perfect in every way.</li>
            <li>I love Suave products and have used them for years.</li>
            <li>so it should be better.</li>
            <li>Then, I&#x27;m thinking, okay, the waterfall branding exceeded my wildest dreams, but where is the mist?.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>make my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>My family love it.</li>
            <li>For this reason I would not repurchase this particular scent again even though I had a great experience with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite Suave is Everlasting Sunshine and Coconut, which work even more amazingly on my hair but come in larger sizing with more pleasant scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells a tad too strong and perfumy, and does remind me of waterfalls and springs.</li>
            <li>I wanted a cheap conditioner for this job.</li>
            <li>I like the scent, but it just needs to be stronger for me to 100% enjoy this</li>
            <li>I am natural and it does the good.</li>
            <li>I put a small amount of this conditioner in my hair and lather it in real good.</li>
            <li>So in the long run, this particular scent is not the best purchase for your money.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean with no residue.</li>
            <li>The shape of the bottle also is nice because it&#x27;s easy to hold onto and the cap is easy to open when your hands are</li>
            <li>smells good and leaves hair soft, everyone in the family uses it  and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I love most all suave naturals and then scent of this is totally fab.</li>
            <li>Sent is ok and lasts a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m bathing under a waterfall with beautiful scenery all around me, flowers, birds chirping, I&#x27;m next to a small mountain providing the hot tub like nature</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind paying the same price for less product and really like the scent, then this is a great buy for you.</li>
            <li>Then out of nowhere this beautiful long haired brunette that&#x27;s petite with little perky boobies and the nicest ass crack Ive ever seen.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Its fragrance is beautiful, smooth,is very soft very thick as consistence.</li>
            <li>It provides great slip, makes my hair soft and fluffy hours after drying, and my hair curls instantly, which lets me know my hair is moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The way the design of the flip-top cap is made, causes shampoo to spill all over the top of the bottle, dripping down the sides, and all over our shower walls.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I like suave products in general and I have bought this same conditioner at the store (and it was perfectly fine)</li>
            <li>You can find it in stores for as low as $0.85-$1, but it&#x27;s only available in 12 ounces, whereas Suave Coconut is $1.50 for 33 ounces.</li>
            <li>She takes my hand and pulls me over to the shallow end of the pond and pushes me to sit down, she now gets on top of me with her 100lb petite body and makes love to me.......</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than local stores, so buy them while you can!</li>
            <li>and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair feels soft and it even makes my hair appear healthier.</li>
            <li>It states natural as well (don&#x27;t know how natural)</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and moisturized which means a lot living in desert land.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a delayed action type thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Adds so much moisture to my dry curls.</li>
            <li>if you are looking for a different combination, or you are looking for simultaneous waterfall and mist, look elsewhere, as the mist action is quite delayed in regards to the waterfall action.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to get really aroused.</li>
            <li>It works better than all the expensive conditioners I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Price is a little high compared to buying in store.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when I received a bottle about half that size.  </li>
            <li> Now she is tongue bathing my neck and shoulders with a little bit of soft biting</li>
            <li> When Amazon overcharged this product, I found that it just doesn&#x27;t do the same as other hair products at that</li>
            <li> It is thicker and creamier than other Suave naturals.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize this was such a small bottle, though.  </li>
            <li> wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing that I would say is the scent is too weak.</li>
            <li> I usually get the &amp;#34;family size&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have thick curly coily AA</li>
            <li> mean, I bought it for over $5 a bottle and for $5 a bottle, the competitor is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She gets in the pond and swims over to me and gets behind me and starts massaging my head with Suave naturals conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> I WAS WRONG.  </li>
            <li> Then I snap out of it, take a cold shower and off to work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it congealed or something from cold or age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s conditioner, how bad could it be?</li>

            <li> My wife just brought home a bottle of this Suave Refreshing Waterfall Mist Shampoo. The way the design of the flip-top cap is made, causes shampoo to spill all over the top of the bottle, dripping down the sides, and all over our shower walls. Thanks a lot. Suave&#x27;s bottle design team is asleep at the switch! We will never buy this again.</li>

            <li> Awesome price for the quality, this is true with all Suave Shampoos and conditioners. I put a small amount of this conditioner in my hair and lather it in real good. Wait 30 to 60 seconds rinse and my hair is so soft. When I smell the fragrance of Waterfall mist it takes me off to another place Man. I can see this beautiful rainforest type of place in my mind it&#x27;s almost like another World it&#x27;s paradise. The temperature is perfect here and I&#x27;m bathing under a waterfall with beautiful scenery all around me, flowers, birds chirping, I&#x27;m next to a small mountain providing the hot tub like nature made pond I&#x27;m relaxing in just enough shade to make it perfect in every way. Then out of nowhere this beautiful long haired brunette that&#x27;s petite with little perky boobies and the nicest ass crack Ive ever seen. She gets in the pond and swims over to me and gets behind me and starts massaging my head with Suave naturals conditioner in it. I then rinse my head under the waterfall when she&#x27;s done. Now she is tongue bathing my neck and shoulders with a little bit of soft biting and I&#x27;m starting to get really aroused. She takes my hand and pulls me over to the shallow end of the pond and pushes me to sit down, she now gets on top of me with her 100lb petite body and makes love to me.......Then I snap out of it, take a cold shower and off to work I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great product...</li>
            <li> I love Suave products and have used them for years. I was tickled to find this. I find relying on someone else to find and purchase items for me not to always be the best idea. Thank you Suave for great products.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly coily AA hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells a tad too strong and perfumy, and does remind me of waterfalls and springs. It is thicker and creamier than other Suave naturals. It provides great slip, makes my hair soft and fluffy hours after drying, and my hair curls instantly, which lets me know my hair is moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterfall Mist is a great conditioner but not the best Suave bargain.

            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the great price, smell, and amount you get with each bottle. It states natural as well (don&#x27;t know how natural) so it should be better.</li>

            <li> I was worried that by going with the waterfall mist shampoo AND the waterfall mist conditioner I would be over-doing the waterfall and/or mist for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW. I WAS WRONG.  If I could swear I would.  Between these guys and the shower head, it literally feels like I am in a waterfall when I shower.  Then, I&#x27;m thinking, okay, the waterfall branding exceeded my wildest dreams, but where is the mist?.  Then, you step out of the shower and BAM! mist. all over the place.  It&#x27;s a delayed action type thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Equal parts waterfall and mist, so if you are looking for a different combination, or you are looking for simultaneous waterfall and mist, look elsewhere, as the mist action is quite delayed in regards to the waterfall action.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Great for cowashes and smells AMAZING! Adds so much moisture to my dry curls.</li>
            <li> love it. make my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product at this price. Its fragrance is beautiful, smooth,is very soft very thick as consistence.My family love it.</li>
            <li> No complaints about the product at all, same stuff you can buy at the store.  I didn&#x27;t realize this was such a small bottle, though.  I usually get the &amp;#34;family size&amp;#34; so I was surprised when I received a bottle about half that size.  Price is a little high compared to buying in store.</li>
