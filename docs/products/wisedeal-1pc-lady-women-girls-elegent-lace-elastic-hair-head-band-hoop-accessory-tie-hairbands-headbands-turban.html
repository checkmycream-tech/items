            <li>It honestly looked like a project that a kid tried to take on and sale at a craft show.</li>
            <li>it is nice</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good doesn&#x27;t roll off my head like most of them do</li>

            <li>I have it hanging on my mirror in my caar right now, always there when i need it to be lol</li>
            <li>a lot, the , the picture does not do a good job at showing that the material has a metallic effect to it, I was expecting a plan lace, but still nice and very pretty</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute and has a great price, BUT one of the sides holding the pretty material ripped!</li>
            <li>but is still very lovely and when worn is comfortable and holds in place</li>
            <li>Very cute and comfortable.</li>
            <li>beautiful lace headband, very sturdy</li>
            <li>Fits comfortably and is very stylish.  </li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>It looks lovely and elegant.</li>
            <li>It gives it a more uniform look.</li>
            <li>Seems to be the way for most if not all the headbands I&#x27;ve bought on amazon, made in China.</li>
            <li>I love this head band.</li>
            <li>/&gt;IT LOOKS KIND OF CHEAP</li>
            <li>, NOT WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE PICTURE MORE GOLD.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought three different type of headbands and this without a doubt was the best of them all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I tried many ways to make it work and you will always have part of the headband flapping up or out...</li>
            <li>So cute, but you can never wear it.</li>
            <li>Its a really cute headband, but</li>
            <li>Love this headband.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on it at work.</li>
            <li>a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li>It is actually better made then</li>
            <li>and I think my daughter will love it.</li>
            <li>WHERE...just pay more and get something better.</li>
            <li>But it did look cute when I wore it.</li>
            <li>Slides up and doesn&#x27;t stay on but looks cute</li>
            <li>I like it because it goes with so many outfits</li>
            <li>but the product is still cute</li>
            <li>in picture it even has more sparkle ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten many, many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>The headband is definitely cute</li>
            <li>It came in with a piece of lace that was on top of an out of style head band.</li>
            <li>Have been given many compliments.  </li>
            <li>but that was actually the perfect size for my head</li>
            <li>Elegant?</li>
            <li>Just like the picture, I love it.</li>
            <li>but she said she is waiting for the appropriate time to wear it.  </li>
            <li>I love this head band</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as cute in person</li>
            <li>the head band looks cute</li>
            <li>Gorgeous and so many compliments on the first day wearing it.</li>
            <li>Looks super cute on!</li>
            <li>Looks super cute!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have much success I wearing these kinds of headbands, but this fit nice, looked great and stayed in place</li>
            <li>The only thing i dislike is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my head that great, but its nice for the price and the goldish color compliments my skin</li>
            <li>It got to me faster than I had expected and its a beautiful !!</li>
            <li>Mine was very cute at first..</li>
            <li>It looks great with anything and is a perfect accent for long or short hair.</li>
            <li>but it will fit a adult great.</li>
            <li>mine is beautiful and going strong two years later!</li>
            <li>nice , very wide , made a great gift</li>
            <li>It stays on my head fine</li>
            <li>but if your crafty you can fix it easily.</li>
            <li>I thought I would have to be extremely gentle with it, but it is made of strong materials and assemble nicely.</li>
            <li>I was at an event on a humid day (and I have huge puffy hair)</li>
            <li>I thought it would be worth the risk, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li>Extremely cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Fit well and did not slide around the head or fall off.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap and fits akwardly.</li>
            <li>Cute, worth the price-</li>
            <li>This is kinda of cheap.</li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made, it feel apart while wearing it at work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I could of hot glued one together better</li>
            <li>This is my favorite headband - and was so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>My &amp;#34;one beauty&amp;#34; is daily becoming more and more scarce.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this project, many people add it.</li>
            <li>I got this for my sister and we like it so much we wish that it came in more colors.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>i do not recommend this to anyone and if you look at the stats from the other reviews it appears that 2 out of every 14 were generally happy with their purchase...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did come fairly quickly though,  </li>
            <li>quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li>The headband is very pretty -</li>
            <li>The lace itself is very pretty</li>
            <li>Very cute, off white color, stays on without a problem.</li>
            <li>It works on both of us and looks very pretty.</li>
            <li>I liked it but the first time I put it on one of the strings broke which was a bummer thankfully can still wear it so far</li>
            <li>And now it is one of my most frequently used accessories!</li>
            <li>Mine was exactly as pictured and really beautiful for a headband if it costs less than two dollars.</li>
            <li>Picture makes it look white, but I like the off-white color better than bright white anyway.</li>
            <li>It stays in place really well, which is important to me.</li>
            <li>but a few bobby pins and it works/ looks great.</li>
            <li>It was so worth the shipping</li>
            <li>It was really nice when it arrived; however, it only lasted about 5 wearings.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and worth it.</li>
            <li>this looks great on young teen for church or school</li>
            <li>This headband is really nice looking, but much smaller than that.</li>
            <li>but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li>For the money I paid,  it was worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty large and slides off easily.</li>
            <li>And it makes me feel more comfortable, knowing that people are seeing lace on top of my head instead of my pale scalp.</li>
            <li>similar ones are sold for $15+ in stores like anthropology and urban outfitters, definitely a good design and value been using it for almost a year!</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>otherwise it slips right off.</li>
            <li>The lace was soooo pretty, I really wanted this headband to fit.</li>
            <li>however it breaks very easily after wearing only a handful of times.</li>
            <li>it is more beige on top of black fabric, no biggie.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really what it showed you in the picture, but it&#x27;s still very cute.</li>
            <li>For the price, its not bad, just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>So excited for my new headband!</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t fit, much too large.</li>
            <li>I have very little left on top of my head, so I have been looking for attractive covers.  </li>
            <li>Very cheap headband and from the picture I was expecting it to be white</li>
            <li>It covers a bad hair day beautifully and can be worn for many hours without discomfort!</li>
            <li>I might buy another one ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is pretty and all that but not for me.</li>
            <li>You get what you pay for came apart first time wearing it</li>
            <li>Pretty, stays in place.  </li>
            <li>its so pretty in my hair.</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>mostly for smaller heads.</li>
            <li>I thought it was more white lace</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product and for the price ill be ordering some of the similar ones listed  :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>keep that in mind if you have a bigger dome. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I broke within the first day of wearing it.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with this hai accessory</li>
            <li>they looked so so pretty.</li>
            <li>the first one was already ripping at the seam(elastic) in the package before I even opened it.</li>
            <li>Elastic snapped within the first day of wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This headband broke after first use.</li>
            <li>The glue came undone on a hot day</li>
            <li>I will want to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>Came undone when I FIRST tried it on.</li>
            <li>It is also just as wide as it appears in the picture, which is nice.</li>
            <li>Fell apart first time it was worn.</li>
            <li>Shipping it back for an exchange cost more than the item.</li>
            <li>(I have a tiny pinhead, so I am sure it is just me...</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Broke the first time my daughter wore it.</li>
            <li>In the summer I just want to throw my hair in a ponytail its hot</li>
            <li>However, lace came off the fabric the FIRST time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li>Overall, an excellent product for such a low price.</li>
            <li>More of a gold color and this thing is big</li>
            <li>Broke the first night.</li>
            <li>It looks pretty much just like the picture.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be, however, after I folded it in half because it was a little large, it looked very nice!</li>
            <li>Its really large.</li>
            <li>It is not lace, but more of a golden thread stitched onto black toole.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it just comes from an Amazon warehouse in CA or something (other reviews were saying stuff about China).&lt;br /&gt;For about $7, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>One of the headbands looks fine, but the second one is coming apart</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a pretty headband, I highly recommend this and will order again myself.</li>
            <li>Very itchy material.</li>
            <li>Elastic is already really streatched after two wears.</li>
            <li>I had been really looking forward to this headband&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>This item was shipped quite fast, and arrived ahead of the estimated date.</li>
            <li>This is cute, but its a bit looser/bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li>, It has been really durable</li>
            <li>Waited for over a month for shipping only for it to be cheaply made and not the color advertised.</li>
            <li>The product I received was a much cheaper knock-off version of what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely feminine but can be worn in so many different variations to suit whatever mood or style.</li>
            <li>It is very small and much more appropriate for a young girl.</li>
            <li>While a pretty headband, it came in gold, not the white or cream pictured, and broke the very first time I wore it.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, the lace started coming loose from the elastic after the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li>) - I think it would look much better on someone with really dark hair.</li>
            <li>It looks so cute with an up-do or with hair down.  </li>
            <li>it came in black which is ok , all and all</li>
            <li>More of an ivory/cream color than white, but I actually prefer that.</li>
            <li>although it looks more of a white color in the picture, it is actually a silver color which makes it even prettier in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The fabric and materials are high quality.</li>
            <li>This headband is adorable, however it is way to big for my average sized head and just falls right out.</li>
            <li>Maybe if I bunch up my hair like the gal in the picture it will lay a little flatter and have a bit more surface area to lay on.  </li>
            <li>and although there was too much gold threading through the lace, it was easily gone once I washed it with a little bleach.</li>
            <li>BIG and not as tight on the elastic as i would have liked</li>
            <li>This headband is gorgeous, but was a little wide for my head.</li>
            <li>I received a red baby style headband with a huge red flower attached.</li>
            <li>But if your head was small enough to fit in the elastic it would actually be quite cute.</li>
            <li>Was just wearing it and not even touching it when I felt a small pop</li>
            <li>and I am an adult with a normal head.</li>
            <li>The product was pretty but it snapped in the second use.</li>
            <li>Two months later I received two headbands that look exactly alike.</li>
            <li>After I sewed it back, it was pretty, but doesn&#x27;t look like the pic.</li>
            <li>I like when my significant other wear this.</li>
            <li>This piece can be dressed up or dressed down to fit your look.</li>
            <li>All is well but be very careful with the sweet lace on sides.</li>
            <li>The lace was stitched over an almost clear webbing material (and yes, that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to make lace, espeicially when you have a machine doing it, you whiners.)</li>
            <li>When i purchased it, it was modeled by an adult.</li>
            <li>This came as pictured although it had gold sparkles like in the picture Julie posted, but this was shipped directly from China, so there is no quality control nor any guarantee</li>
            <li>It fits my adult head well.  </li>
            <li>The width is much shorter, and it is not lace like in the picture, but rather gold thread stitching on a net like fabric.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this for two years now and have worn it frequently.</li>
            <li>I can wear this and yesterday my 4 year old daughter wore it.</li>
            <li>The lace has ivory and gold tones, and there is a fine dark mesh layer underneath (which was not noticeable when I put it on, and my hair is very blonde) to reinforce the lace.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not really worth it on such a cheap item.</li>
            <li>Way to big for a normal sized head... have to fold in half...also slides EVERY</li>
            <li>The lace is also pretty wide,  maybe 2.5 inches</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new, bigger lace headband after the one I had before fell apart.</li>
            <li>Very stiff and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It took a little while to receive it, as it was shipped from overseas, but it was well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>Comfy, keeps my hair down and back, and pretty!</li>
            <li>I ended up having to tie a small knot in the back so it would fit.</li>
            <li>I glued the side back to the material BTW and sorta fixed it.</li>
            <li>It covers how thin my hair is on top.  </li>
            <li>The lace Is not as wide as expected and also the headband broke the very first day I wore it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think Amazon should allow products shipped from other countries.</li>
            <li>Wish the lace extended down a little further on each side, but overall, pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Actually, to contradict some of the other reviews the headband was actually quite pretty.</li>
            <li>when I put it on the back of it sticks up a little bit, it makes it look funny</li>
            <li>it is very wide, It goes about an inch from my hairline all the way to my pony tail if im wearing a high pony.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely comfortable to wear unlike other brands I have used in the past.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s good doesn&#x27;t roll off my head like most of them do</li>

            <li> I have it hanging on my mirror in my caar right now, always there when i need it to be lol</li>
            <li> a lot, the , the picture does not do a good job at showing that the material has a metallic effect to it, I was expecting a plan lace, but still nice and very pretty</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and has a great price, BUT one of the sides holding the pretty material ripped!</li>
            <li> but is still very lovely and when worn is comfortable and holds in place</li>

            <li> Fits comfortably and is very stylish.  </li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It looks lovely and elegant.</li>
            <li> It gives it a more uniform look.</li>
            <li> Seems to be the way for most if not all the headbands I&#x27;ve bought on amazon, made in China.</li>
            <li> I love this head band.</li>
            <li> /&gt;IT LOOKS KIND OF CHEAP</li>
            <li> , NOT WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE PICTURE MORE GOLD.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought three different type of headbands and this without a doubt was the best of them all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I tried many ways to make it work and you will always have part of the headband flapping up or out...</li>
            <li> So cute, but you can never wear it.</li>
            <li> Its a really cute headband, but</li>
            <li> Love this headband.</li>

            <li> It is actually better made then</li>
            <li> and I think my daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> WHERE...just pay more and get something better.</li>
            <li> But it did look cute when I wore it.</li>
            <li> Slides up and doesn&#x27;t stay on but looks cute</li>
            <li> I like it because it goes with so many outfits</li>
            <li> but the product is still cute</li>
            <li> in picture it even has more sparkle ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten many, many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> The headband is definitely cute</li>
            <li> It came in with a piece of lace that was on top of an out of style head band.</li>
            <li> Have been given many compliments.  </li>
            <li> but that was actually the perfect size for my head</li>
            <li> Elegant?</li>
            <li> Just like the picture, I love it.</li>
            <li> but she said she is waiting for the appropriate time to wear it.  </li>
            <li> I love this head band</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as cute in person</li>
            <li> the head band looks cute</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and so many compliments on the first day wearing it.</li>
            <li> Looks super cute on!</li>
            <li> Looks super cute!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much success I wearing these kinds of headbands, but this fit nice, looked great and stayed in place</li>
            <li> The only thing i dislike is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my head that great, but its nice for the price and the goldish color compliments my skin</li>
            <li> It got to me faster than I had expected and its a beautiful !!</li>
            <li> Mine was very cute at first..</li>
            <li> It looks great with anything and is a perfect accent for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> but it will fit a adult great.</li>
            <li> mine is beautiful and going strong two years later!</li>
            <li> nice , very wide , made a great gift</li>
            <li> It stays on my head fine</li>
            <li> but if your crafty you can fix it easily.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to be extremely gentle with it, but it is made of strong materials and assemble nicely.</li>
            <li> I was at an event on a humid day (and I have huge puffy hair)</li>
            <li> I thought it would be worth the risk, but now I&#x27;m not so sure.</li>
            <li> Extremely cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Fit well and did not slide around the head or fall off.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap and fits akwardly.</li>
            <li> Cute, worth the price-</li>
            <li> This is kinda of cheap.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made, it feel apart while wearing it at work.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I could of hot glued one together better</li>
            <li> This is my favorite headband - and was so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;one beauty&amp;#34; is daily becoming more and more scarce.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this project, many people add it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister and we like it so much we wish that it came in more colors.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> i do not recommend this to anyone and if you look at the stats from the other reviews it appears that 2 out of every 14 were generally happy with their purchase...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did come fairly quickly though,  </li>
            <li> quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> The headband is very pretty -</li>
            <li> The lace itself is very pretty</li>
            <li> Very cute, off white color, stays on without a problem.</li>
            <li> It works on both of us and looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> I liked it but the first time I put it on one of the strings broke which was a bummer thankfully can still wear it so far</li>
            <li> And now it is one of my most frequently used accessories!</li>
            <li> Mine was exactly as pictured and really beautiful for a headband if it costs less than two dollars.</li>
            <li> Picture makes it look white, but I like the off-white color better than bright white anyway.</li>
            <li> It stays in place really well, which is important to me.</li>
            <li> but a few bobby pins and it works/ looks great.</li>
            <li> It was so worth the shipping</li>
            <li> It was really nice when it arrived; however, it only lasted about 5 wearings.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and worth it.</li>
            <li> this looks great on young teen for church or school</li>
            <li> This headband is really nice looking, but much smaller than that.</li>
            <li> but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> For the money I paid,  it was worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty large and slides off easily.</li>
            <li> And it makes me feel more comfortable, knowing that people are seeing lace on top of my head instead of my pale scalp.</li>
            <li> similar ones are sold for $15+ in stores like anthropology and urban outfitters, definitely a good design and value been using it for almost a year!</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> otherwise it slips right off.</li>
            <li> The lace was soooo pretty, I really wanted this headband to fit.</li>
            <li> however it breaks very easily after wearing only a handful of times.</li>
            <li> it is more beige on top of black fabric, no biggie.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really what it showed you in the picture, but it&#x27;s still very cute.</li>
            <li> For the price, its not bad, just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> So excited for my new headband!</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t fit, much too large.</li>
            <li> I have very little left on top of my head, so I have been looking for attractive covers.  </li>
            <li> Very cheap headband and from the picture I was expecting it to be white</li>
            <li> It covers a bad hair day beautifully and can be worn for many hours without discomfort!</li>
            <li> I might buy another one ;)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is pretty and all that but not for me.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for came apart first time wearing it</li>
            <li> Pretty, stays in place.  </li>
            <li> its so pretty in my hair.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> mostly for smaller heads.</li>
            <li> I thought it was more white lace</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product and for the price ill be ordering some of the similar ones listed  :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> keep that in mind if you have a bigger dome. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li> I broke within the first day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with this hai accessory</li>
            <li> they looked so so pretty.</li>
            <li> the first one was already ripping at the seam(elastic) in the package before I even opened it.</li>
            <li> Elastic snapped within the first day of wearing it.  </li>
            <li> This headband broke after first use.</li>
            <li> The glue came undone on a hot day</li>
            <li> I will want to buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Came undone when I FIRST tried it on.</li>
            <li> It is also just as wide as it appears in the picture, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Fell apart first time it was worn.</li>
            <li> Shipping it back for an exchange cost more than the item.</li>
            <li> (I have a tiny pinhead, so I am sure it is just me...</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Broke the first time my daughter wore it.</li>
            <li> In the summer I just want to throw my hair in a ponytail its hot</li>
            <li> However, lace came off the fabric the FIRST time I tried to wear it.</li>
            <li> Overall, an excellent product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> More of a gold color and this thing is big</li>
            <li> Broke the first night.</li>
            <li> It looks pretty much just like the picture.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be, however, after I folded it in half because it was a little large, it looked very nice!</li>
            <li> Its really large.</li>
            <li> It is not lace, but more of a golden thread stitched onto black toole.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it just comes from an Amazon warehouse in CA or something (other reviews were saying stuff about China).&lt;br /&gt;For about $7, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> One of the headbands looks fine, but the second one is coming apart</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a pretty headband, I highly recommend this and will order again myself.</li>
            <li> Very itchy material.</li>
            <li> Elastic is already really streatched after two wears.</li>
            <li> I had been really looking forward to this headband&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quite fast, and arrived ahead of the estimated date.</li>
            <li> This is cute, but its a bit looser/bigger than I expected.  </li>
            <li> , It has been really durable</li>
            <li> Waited for over a month for shipping only for it to be cheaply made and not the color advertised.</li>
            <li> The product I received was a much cheaper knock-off version of what is shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely feminine but can be worn in so many different variations to suit whatever mood or style.</li>
            <li> It is very small and much more appropriate for a young girl.</li>
            <li> While a pretty headband, it came in gold, not the white or cream pictured, and broke the very first time I wore it.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, the lace started coming loose from the elastic after the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> ) - I think it would look much better on someone with really dark hair.</li>
            <li> It looks so cute with an up-do or with hair down.  </li>
            <li> it came in black which is ok , all and all</li>
            <li> More of an ivory/cream color than white, but I actually prefer that.</li>
            <li> although it looks more of a white color in the picture, it is actually a silver color which makes it even prettier in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The fabric and materials are high quality.</li>
            <li> This headband is adorable, however it is way to big for my average sized head and just falls right out.</li>
            <li> Maybe if I bunch up my hair like the gal in the picture it will lay a little flatter and have a bit more surface area to lay on.  </li>
            <li> and although there was too much gold threading through the lace, it was easily gone once I washed it with a little bleach.</li>
            <li> BIG and not as tight on the elastic as i would have liked</li>
            <li> This headband is gorgeous, but was a little wide for my head.</li>
            <li> I received a red baby style headband with a huge red flower attached.</li>
            <li> But if your head was small enough to fit in the elastic it would actually be quite cute.</li>
            <li> Was just wearing it and not even touching it when I felt a small pop</li>
            <li> and I am an adult with a normal head.</li>
            <li> The product was pretty but it snapped in the second use.</li>
            <li> Two months later I received two headbands that look exactly alike.</li>
            <li> After I sewed it back, it was pretty, but doesn&#x27;t look like the pic.</li>
            <li> I like when my significant other wear this.</li>
            <li> This piece can be dressed up or dressed down to fit your look.</li>
            <li> All is well but be very careful with the sweet lace on sides.</li>
            <li> The lace was stitched over an almost clear webbing material (and yes, that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to make lace, espeicially when you have a machine doing it, you whiners.)</li>
            <li> When i purchased it, it was modeled by an adult.</li>
            <li> This came as pictured although it had gold sparkles like in the picture Julie posted, but this was shipped directly from China, so there is no quality control nor any guarantee</li>
            <li> It fits my adult head well.  </li>
            <li> The width is much shorter, and it is not lace like in the picture, but rather gold thread stitching on a net like fabric.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for two years now and have worn it frequently.</li>
            <li> I can wear this and yesterday my 4 year old daughter wore it.</li>
            <li> The lace has ivory and gold tones, and there is a fine dark mesh layer underneath (which was not noticeable when I put it on, and my hair is very blonde) to reinforce the lace.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not really worth it on such a cheap item.</li>
            <li> Way to big for a normal sized head... have to fold in half...also slides EVERY</li>
            <li> The lace is also pretty wide,  maybe 2.5 inches</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new, bigger lace headband after the one I had before fell apart.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It took a little while to receive it, as it was shipped from overseas, but it was well worth the wait.  </li>
            <li> Comfy, keeps my hair down and back, and pretty!</li>
            <li> I ended up having to tie a small knot in the back so it would fit.</li>
            <li> I glued the side back to the material BTW and sorta fixed it.</li>
            <li> It covers how thin my hair is on top.  </li>
            <li> The lace Is not as wide as expected and also the headband broke the very first day I wore it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think Amazon should allow products shipped from other countries.</li>
            <li> Wish the lace extended down a little further on each side, but overall, pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Actually, to contradict some of the other reviews the headband was actually quite pretty.</li>
            <li> when I put it on the back of it sticks up a little bit, it makes it look funny</li>
            <li> it is very wide, It goes about an inch from my hairline all the way to my pony tail if im wearing a high pony.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely comfortable to wear unlike other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> then its the black elastic piece and where the two connect the material is bunched together and is round,black and kind of hard and pushes into my head and in the sample photos the black piece that connects the headband and the elastic</li>
            <li> It would be much cuter if it were about half as wide as it is.</li>
            <li> looks flat.</li>
            <li> Like it with my short and long wigs.</li>
            <li> Even though this picture shows a little girl wearing the headband it actually fits a adult head and it has a gold shimmer to it.</li>
            <li> It is wide enough to keep my crazy hair back, stylish enough I never feel frumpy throwing it on and running out the door, and I always get complements.</li>
            <li> It is a little itchy, but not too bad (and I&#x27;m usually sensitive to that kind of thing).</li>
            <li> i ordered a pretty lace ELASTIC headband and definatly recieved the wrong product,a cheap stiff black headband with a strip of lace glued to it was disappointed because i wanted the nice elastic headband shown in the pictures my order probably got mixed up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute but as soon as I wore it, it ripped :(</li>
            <li> Also took a long time to ship, and came from china.</li>
            <li> , i wished they made them in different.my headband is extra wide.</li>
            <li> It is quite wide and she has a smaller head, but she thinks it will work out.</li>
            <li> There is significantly less detailing, and it seems as if it will break if I stretch a little too much.</li>
            <li> Sad, but true - I&#x27;m losing my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly HIGH QUALITY, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  </li>
            <li> Pictured white, got black</li>
            <li> What arrived yesterday was not a white headband it was black and gold.</li>
            <li> Had to sew back the black elastic.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this is a black plastic hunk of junk with a piece of lace attached by glue.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a white lace but gold and does have some black backing to it...</li>
            <li> A little too big for my head</li>
            <li> It was a little to big</li>
            <li> just stands up a little in the back.</li>
            <li> I ordered two different headbands, one was a tan color and the other one was suppose to be black.</li>
            <li> I received the item almost two weeks before the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> Item was just as expected.  </li>
            <li> It did arrive quicker than expected, however, it looks nothing like the picture.</li>
            <li> the headband i recieved barely goes to my ears and the one in the photo goes way past the models ears.</li>
            <li> It was too wide</li>
            <li> Too small for my grandchild&#x27;s head - much less an adult.</li>
            <li> It is very wide, so I can only wear it a few ways.  </li>
            <li> Darker than expected!</li>
            <li> but the elastic was very fragile and broke fairly quickly :(</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t even glued down.</li>
            <li> I dress it up and down</li>
            <li> The black band is sturdy.</li>
            <li> The lace is non-stretch, gathered into black elastic pony tail holders.  </li>
            <li> The headband I got is black and gold and not at all like the picture.</li>
            <li> It is black mesh with gold tread sown in a pattern.</li>
            <li> elastic band is not to tight</li>
            <li> but new items shouldn&#x27;t fail this soon.</li>
            <li> fits a little tight.</li>
            <li> A little on the tight side so instead of a hair band</li>
            <li> so you get little &amp;#34;tents&amp;#34; of lace sticking up where it&#x27;s not flush with your head.</li>
            <li> but i just fold the sides in a little.</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to get here, a little while but understandable since its from japan or china.</li>
            <li> - It slides off a little (a bobby pin fixes that</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it there was a little girl on the pic</li>
            <li> The white piece is way smaller than in the picture making the head and hair seem awkward.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my 12 year old will not be wearing it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t slip even when I put it in my ultra-thick, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> t bobby pin, tape, glue, N.rig #thereifixedit rig, just a waste.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s on a wide thick head band with lace sewn around it.</li>
            <li> dont waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> I wasted money on this item and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> but I expected to wear it at least a couple times.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the other negative reviewers were thinking when they got this product</li>
            <li> I have a small head and it&#x27;s almost tight, so</li>
            <li> can break easily not too sturdy.</li>
            <li> A little small for my head.  </li>
            <li> My only real complaint about this item, and this could have just been my item, but it wasn&#x27;t a continuous piece of lace design...</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to tell from the description.  </li>
            <li> This is SMALL, made for a child.  </li>
            <li> Not cute at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my head is weirdly shaped or what, but I usually have to pin headbands in place to keep them from sliding back and off my head.</li>
            <li> (maybe their expectations were too high and they were disappointed?)</li>
            <li> Kinda glittery but subtle, lacey like the pic..  </li>
            <li> The lace is delicate but not so thin that your fingers will go thtu it or anything.</li>
            <li> those are not good statistics.</li>
            <li> But the way it&#x27;s sewn, the black elastic comes up just behind your ears and is both a) visible, and b) uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and the piece fell off, one side had broken from the elastic connector.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The headband does seem Like a piece of lace glued to a thin headband</li>
            <li> reviews say it looked like a kid made it, poorly made, broke quicktly etc.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive</li>
            <li> One could not wear as shown, at least without showing the ugly piece of elastic.  </li>
            <li> Where the elastic attaches to the lace it looks weird.</li>
            <li> Can be worn dressed up or worn casual.  </li>
            <li> Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Very poor product.</li>
            <li> there isn&#x27;t lead or something else dangerous in the materials.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t have worked well with my crazy curly hair (it would&#x27;ve smushed my hair too much).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really bad quality.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t wear it with my hair up.</li>
            <li> Brassy color was ugly too.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> So disappointed bought this for my daughter n went to put it on her head</li>
            <li> it snapped :(  </li>
            <li> It took forever to get to me and when it did I was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I will still wear it though, because I cannot find anything like this anywhere else, but I am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> i am very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> annoying</li>
            <li> would not buy this product very badly put together</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> im very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Who knows what awful working conditions the person who made it was employed in.</li>
            <li> Its is terrible looking plus its like make for a man not women.</li>
            <li> I never wear this though,it is scratchy and a horrible gold color.</li>
            <li> The quality work was terrible!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this is a beautiful headband, lacey yet sturdy. It looks great with anything and is a perfect accent for long or short hair. I might buy another one ;)</li>
            <li> The lace Is not as wide as expected and also the headband broke the very first day I wore it. Was just wearing it and not even touching it when I felt a small pop and the piece fell off, one side had broken from the elastic connector. I can possibly Sew it back together but new items shouldn&#x27;t fail this soon.</li>
            <li> Fits and doesn&#x27;t hurt my head.</li>
            <li> For the price,  I thought it was very cute and fit my head nicely.  I plan to buy another.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It is as the picture shows, for a youngin... When i purchased it, it was modeled by an adult. This is SMALL, made for a child.  It is pretty and all that but not for me.</li>
            <li> Mine was exactly as pictured and really beautiful for a headband if it costs less than two dollars.</li>
            <li> Delivey time one month plus. Do not buy as gift. Would not buy again. Delivery time is un acceptable.</li>
            <li> Super cute, my girls love this!!! The price was great, too.</li>
            <li> This item is completely different than photographed. The actual item is a thin, cheap piece of lace that is attached to an elastic. I did not listen to the prior reviews, and in this case I should have.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful headband. I thought I would have to be extremely gentle with it, but it is made of strong materials and assemble nicely.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think Amazon should allow products shipped from other countries. I wish I&#x27;d read the reviews. This came as pictured although it had gold sparkles like in the picture Julie posted, but this was shipped directly from China, so there is no quality control nor any guarantee there isn&#x27;t lead or something else dangerous in the materials. I thought it would be worth the risk, but now I&#x27;m not so sure. My recommendation is to skip on this and buy local. Who knows what awful working conditions the person who made it was employed in.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for came apart first time wearing it</li>
            <li> Very itchy material. fits a little tight.</li>
            <li> While a pretty headband, it came in gold, not the white or cream pictured, and broke the very first time I wore it.  Also took a long time to ship, and came from china.</li>
            <li> Broke same day. Took a month to receive it.</li>
            <li> It got to me faster than I had expected and its a beautiful !!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite headbands! I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it and it is so cute! It looks pretty much just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Pretty, stays in place.  Great product for the money</li>
            <li> This headband has great design. It looks lovely and elegant.</li>
            <li> The lace was soooo pretty, I really wanted this headband to fit. But the way it&#x27;s sewn, the black elastic comes up just behind your ears and is both a) visible, and b) uncomfortable. Not only that, the lace itself isn&#x27;t quite fitted right so you get little &amp;#34;tents&amp;#34; of lace sticking up where it&#x27;s not flush with your head.</li>
            <li> It is beautiful  and fits well but the lace is too short.</li>
            <li> its so pretty in my hair. it is very wide, It goes about an inch from my hairline all the way to my pony tail if im wearing a high pony. but i just fold the sides in a little. It gives it a more uniform look. I have it hanging on my mirror in my caar right now, always there when i need it to be lol</li>
            <li> I really liked the headband but it broke within an hour of wearing it!</li>
            <li> Broke the second time I wore it. Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Nice headband.  Broke after about a month of regular use.  Seems to be the way for most if not all the headbands I&#x27;ve bought on amazon, made in China.</li>
            <li> Way too big, it looked like one of those maid hats. I would not recommend it. And it falls off all the time.</li>
            <li> Elastic is already really streatched after two wears.</li>
            <li> It would be much cuter if it were about half as wide as it is. It arrived on time. Product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> good christmas gift i bought. very cute to wear. mostly for smaller heads.</li>
            <li> I thought it was more white lace but it&#x27;s got a gold tinge to it</li>
            <li> I love this head band. It&#x27;s completely feminine but can be worn in so many different variations to suit whatever mood or style. I would recommend this piece to anyone!</li>
            <li> It broke immediately! I will sew a ribbon onto each side and wear it that way, just to get some use out of it. I had been really looking forward to this headband&#x27;s arrival. I was at an event on a humid day (and I have huge puffy hair) when this thing snapped. Thank god I just so happened to have a scarf on, which I quickly repurposed into a headband, or I would have looked ridiculous. Boo.</li>
            <li> Shipped promptly. Doesn&#x27;t quite look like the picture. It is not lace, but more of a golden thread stitched onto black toole. The toole was not trimmed when I got it ( had to doctor it up with scissors). The black band is sturdy. For the price, its not bad, just don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> I USED IT MAYBE TWICE AND STILL NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT LOOKS KIND OF CHEAP, NOT WHAT LOOKS LIKE IN THE PICTURE MORE GOLD.</li>
            <li> Pictured white, got black</li>
            <li> The most beautiful headband I own!</li>
            <li> I received this headband but it was not what was in the ad picture. Extremely cheap and it took forever to finally arrive.</li>
            <li> A little small for my head.  :(</li>
            <li> great item for the price honestly. It has lasted me forever and i always get many compliments!! definitely buy.</li>
            <li> More of an ivory/cream color than white, but I actually prefer that. Wish the lace extended down a little further on each side, but overall, pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is wide enough to keep my crazy hair back, stylish enough I never feel frumpy throwing it on and running out the door, and I always get complements. It stays on my head fine and I am an adult with a normal head. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I received the item almost two weeks before the expected delivery date. However, when I received the headband, it was a totally different product than was pictured. I ordered a white, lacey looking headband. I received a red baby style headband with a huge red flower attached. Needless to say, my 12 year old will not be wearing it. I&#x27;m passing it along to one of my friends who has a baby girl. I&#x27;m not even going through the hassle of attempting a return for a $2 item.</li>
            <li> it came in black which is ok , all and all it does look like the picture. Gave it to my daughter</li>
            <li> It took 3 weeks to get here, a little while but understandable since its from japan or china. Very cute, fits well. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. quality at a high level, this seller quickly sent the goods, the idea is very original position</li>
            <li> I bought three different type of headbands and this without a doubt was the best of them all.&lt;br /&gt;The elastic band is not to tight</li>
            <li> I have a larger head then &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; but this is made for a bowling ball. I tried many ways to make it work and you will always have part of the headband flapping up or out... So cute, but you can never wear it.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved this and gets so many compliments on it. It was so worth the shipping wait r ime and was a great price</li>
            <li> The product was pretty but it snapped in the second use. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Its a really cute headband, but when I put it on the back of it sticks up a little bit, it makes it look funny but if your crafty you can fix it easily.</li>
            <li> Beautiful! Gave to my daughter as a gift and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Darker than expected!</li>
            <li> It took awhile to receive but that&#x27;s to be considered since it&#x27;s packaging was from hong kong. My only real complaint about this item, and this could have just been my item, but it wasn&#x27;t a continuous piece of lace design...it had a slit of blank space on one side, but then again or the price i wasnt expecting a masterpiece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not actual lace but sticking over a sheer fabric but is still very lovely and when worn is comfortable and holds in place&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m very happy with the product and for the price ill be ordering some of the similar ones listed  :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Love this headband. I get so many compliments on it at work. Very happy with  my purchace will buy again</li>
            <li> a gift for myself I love</li>
            <li> Even prettier in person. I have a small head and it&#x27;s almost tight, so keep that in mind if you have a bigger dome. :)</li>
            <li> very cute and beautiful</li>
            <li> Sad, but true - I&#x27;m losing my hair.  My &amp;#34;one beauty&amp;#34; is daily becoming more and more scarce.  I have very little left on top of my head, so I have been looking for attractive covers.  I thought for the price, I would try this headband.  I like it!  It covers how thin my hair is on top.  The lace is gold-shot embroidered.  However, the lace itself is *not* elastic, as I was expecting.  It was a little hard to tell from the description.  The lace is non-stretch, gathered into black elastic pony tail holders.  It fits my adult head well.  It&#x27;s comfortable.  And it makes me feel more comfortable, knowing that people are seeing lace on top of my head instead of my pale scalp.</li>
            <li> It was really nice when it arrived; however, it only lasted about 5 wearings.</li>
            <li> What arrived yesterday was not a white headband it was black and gold. It&#x27;s pretty and I&#x27;ll keep it especially for the price however I did not receive what I had purchased.</li>
            <li> Its is terrible looking plus its like make for a man not women. Its really large.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous and so many compliments on the first day wearing it. Fit well and did not slide around the head or fall off.</li>
            <li> For cheaper headband, it is great quality and super cute! I really love it!</li>
            <li> I broke within the first day of wearing it. They did replace it however that one broke as well.</li>
            <li> Nice hair accessory for the price. It is actually better made then I thouhjt it would be. Holds hair in place and fits snugly for a ckthejoker headband. The lace is delicate but not so thin that your fingers will go thtu it or anything. Overall I am pleased with this hai accessory</li>
            <li> Very nice material and design. similar ones are sold for $15+ in stores like anthropology and urban outfitters, definitely a good design and value been using it for almost a year!</li>
            <li> Looks cheap and fits akwardly.</li>
            <li> most loved great hair band pretty.</li>
            <li> Good quality but took a month to get</li>
            <li> The headband I got is black and gold and not at all like the picture. It&#x27;s also pretty large and slides off easily. I would have returned it but it&#x27;s not really worth it on such a cheap item.</li>
            <li> It broke ,would not buy again ..the headband broke shortly after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Picture makes it look white, but I like the off-white color better than bright white anyway. Very comfortable and very sturdy. Didn&#x27;t slip even when I put it in my ultra-thick, heavy hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my sister and we like it so much we wish that it came in more colors.  It&#x27;s not exactly HIGH QUALITY, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It looks so cute with an up-do or with hair down.  I will be watching for more colors and patterns!</li>
            <li> I bought 2. they looked so so pretty. the first one was already ripping at the seam(elastic) in the package before I even opened it. the second snapped as I began to pull it over my head.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to fix it, sew i,t bobby pin, tape, glue, N.rig #thereifixedit rig, just a waste. hassle to return. annoying</li>
            <li> Wore it maybe 2 times and it fell apart from the seam</li>
            <li> Not so nice in person</li>
            <li> Elastic snapped within the first day of wearing it.  Brassy color was ugly too. Would give 0 stars if possible</li>
            <li> just a piece of lace attached to a ponytail rubber band. Too small for my grandchild&#x27;s head - much less an adult.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  This headband was actually prettier in person.  Great buy and I think my daughter will love it.</li>
            <li> Way to big for a normal sized head... have to fold in half...also slides EVERY WHERE...just pay more and get something better. Not cute at all</li>
            <li> Mine was very cute at first.. But when I put it on it broke immediately.</li>
            <li> This headband broke after first use.</li>
            <li> The glue came undone on a hot day so I ended up having stuff in my hair. But it did look cute when I wore it.</li>
            <li> Looks super cute on! Kinda glittery but subtle, lacey like the pic..  I never wear headbands and this one looks great.  Inexpensive and worth it. It does take a while to ship</li>
            <li> Beautiful and comfortable. I would certainly recommend this project, many people add it. Very beautiful, but cute</li>
            <li> This hair band looks handmade! The quality is excellent.I will want to buy more in the future.The fabric and materials are high quality.Great seller!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be, however, after I folded it in half because it was a little large, it looked very nice! And now it is one of my most frequently used accessories! I really like it</li>
            <li> Broke the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Slides up and doesn&#x27;t stay on but looks cute</li>
            <li> I like it because it goes with so many outfits - It slides off a little (a bobby pin fixes that) - I think it would look much better on someone with really dark hair.</li>
            <li> Even though this picture shows a little girl wearing the headband it actually fits a adult head and it has a gold shimmer to it. I really love it , its beautiful and you cant beat the price!</li>
            <li> The product arrived well ahead of schedule, and looks just like the picture. Very cute and comfortable.The lace has ivory and gold tones, and there is a fine dark mesh layer underneath (which was not noticeable when I put it on, and my hair is very blonde) to reinforce the lace.</li>
            <li> beautiful lace headband, very sturdy, i wished they made them in different.my headband is extra wide. love this products fits great over wigs</li>
            <li> Love the hairpiece and looks great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute and has a great price, BUT one of the sides holding the pretty material ripped! All is well but be very careful with the sweet lace on sides. I glued the side back to the material BTW and sorta fixed it.</li>
            <li> A little too big for my head</li>
            <li> So disappointed bought this for my daughter n went to put it on her head n it snapped :(  it also was bent up n i couldnt get the crease n wrinkles out of it. Very poor product. Wouldnt recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Item was just as expected.  Fits comfortably and is very stylish.  I keep getting compliments on it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Came undone when I FIRST tried it on. Had to sew back the black elastic. Other than that it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> The product is not at all what the picture looks like, it&#x27;s not on an elastic band it&#x27;s on a wide thick head band with lace sewn around it. The shipping took awhile it ships from China but the product is still cute and I plan on wearing it.</li>
            <li> This headband is wonderful the lace is beautiful it&#x27;s looks just how it does in picture it even has more sparkle ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ†</li>
            <li> Cute, worth the price- but the elastic was very fragile and broke fairly quickly :(</li>
            <li> Love it. Looks super cute!</li>
            <li> This is kinda of cheap. It wasn&#x27;t expensive so it is no big deal. I never wear this though,it is scratchy and a horrible gold color. It does not stay on your head well either.</li>
            <li> very nice has become a part of her wardrobe recommend for all ages this looks great on young teen for church or school</li>
            <li> It took a little while to receive it, as it was shipped from overseas, but it was well worth the wait.  I&#x27;ve gotten many, many compliments on it.  It is very wide, so I can only wear it a few ways.  But I love it.</li>
            <li> i ordered a pretty lace ELASTIC headband and definatly recieved the wrong product,a cheap stiff black headband with a strip of lace glued to it was disappointed because i wanted the nice elastic headband shown in the pictures my order probably got mixed up</li>
            <li> It did arrive quicker than expected, however, it looks nothing like the picture. It is black mesh with gold tread sown in a pattern. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> this is a short piece of lace attached to unattractive elastic.  One could not wear as shown, at least without showing the ugly piece of elastic.  The lace part is not elastic and did not cover to the point where my hair could cover the back/elastic part.</li>
            <li> This is the second purchase i&#x27;ve made on amazon now where the product was nothing like how the picture looks. im very disappointed. the headband i recieved barely goes to my ears and the one in the photo goes way past the models ears. then its the black elastic piece and where the two connect the material is bunched together and is round,black and kind of hard and pushes into my head and in the sample photos the black piece that connects the headband and the elastic looks flat. i am very unhappy with this purchase. i do not recommend this to anyone and if you look at the stats from the other reviews it appears that 2 out of every 14 were generally happy with their purchase...those are not good statistics. dont waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> The headband is definitely cute but when i got it there were several places where threads were coming off. It seemed like they were just tied off ends but i didn&#x27;t want to take the chance. I was going to return it but a friend ended up keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;The headband does seem Like a piece of lace glued to a thin headband but the headband blends in with brown/dark hair. The lace is also pretty wide,  maybe 2.5 inches so it wouldn&#x27;t have worked well with my crazy curly hair (it would&#x27;ve smushed my hair too much).&lt;br /&gt;It did come fairly quickly though,  maybe a couple days- I&#x27;m pretty sure it just comes from an Amazon warehouse in CA or something (other reviews were saying stuff about China).&lt;br /&gt;For about $7, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cute but as soon as I wore it, it ripped :(</li>
            <li> I ordered two different headbands, one was a tan color and the other one was suppose to be black. Two months later I received two headbands that look exactly alike. One of the headbands looks fine, but the second one is coming apart and I haven&#x27;t even tried it on yet. Really bad quality.</li>
            <li> This item was shipped quite fast, and arrived ahead of the estimated date. The headband is very pretty - although it looks more of a white color in the picture, it is actually a silver color which makes it even prettier in my opinion. It is also just as wide as it appears in the picture, which is nice. If you are looking for a pretty headband, I highly recommend this and will order again myself.</li>
            <li> Fell apart first time it was worn. Shipping it back for an exchange cost more than the item. You get what you pay for I suppose.</li>
            <li> This is cute, but its a bit looser/bigger than I expected.  I ended up having to tie a small knot in the back so it would fit.</li>
            <li> Arrived early, which was great, it fits perfectly. It&#x27;s completely comfortable to wear unlike other brands I have used in the past. however it breaks very easily after wearing only a handful of times. I may consider buying from them again</li>
            <li> This headband is gorgeous, but was a little wide for my head. (I have a tiny pinhead, so I am sure it is just me... lol)  Maybe if I bunch up my hair like the gal in the picture it will lay a little flatter and have a bit more surface area to lay on.  Still liked it though, I&#x27;m keeping it!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> It took over two weeks to receive and when it finally came in it wasn&#x27;t what the picture had shown. I was expecting it to be just like the picture. It came in with a piece of lace that was on top of an out of style head band. It wasn&#x27;t even glued down. Very cheaply made. It honestly looked like a project that a kid tried to take on and sale at a craft show. I wasted money on this item and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Actually, to contradict some of the other reviews the headband was actually quite pretty. Yes it is not totally functional with the elastic, but I am hoping to refashion the piece of lace on to something else. But if your head was small enough to fit in the elastic it would actually be quite cute. The lace itself is very pretty</li>
            <li> It took forever to get to me and when it did I was so disappointed. I thought i bought a beautiful lace headband, what i received was an elastic head band that was cheaply designed to resemble lace. I did not get what i purchased but it will cost me more to return it!</li>
            <li> It was too wide so it popped out at the back on my head so I have to fold it.</li>
            <li> Very stiff and cheaply made.  Broke the first time my daughter wore it.</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made, it feel apart while wearing it at work.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product very badly put together</li>
            <li> It was good , i liked it !</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have much success I wearing these kinds of headbands, but this fit nice, looked great and stayed in place</li>
            <li> Maybe my head is really big, but I think the picture might be a child. This headband is really nice looking, but much smaller than that. It stays in place really well, which is important to me. I don&#x27;t know if my head is weirdly shaped or what, but I usually have to pin headbands in place to keep them from sliding back and off my head. This one stayed right at the front, which was wonderful. It is a little itchy, but not too bad (and I&#x27;m usually sensitive to that kind of thing).</li>
            <li> Very adorable headband.  Can be worn dressed up or worn casual.  Have been given many compliments.  Can&#x27;t beat the price either.  Totally recommend to everyone.  Took a bit to come but well worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It was a little to big but that was actually the perfect size for my head, It has been really durable</li>
            <li> The only thing i dislike is that it doesn&#x27;t fit my head that great, but its nice for the price and the goldish color compliments my skin</li>
            <li> This product broke only after the second time I put it on. Good thing it was inexpensive. Not a good buy!</li>
            <li> Great product great price</li>
            <li> This band looks good on. Like it with my short and long wigs.</li>
            <li> Came in different color!  The quality work was terrible!  I could of hot glued one together better then the one I received #</li>
            <li> I was not expecting metal hairpieces underneath of this hair band. I didn&#x27;t like them; it snagged and ripped my hair. And it should also be noted that this is probably not something to be named lady / womens hair accessories. It is very small and much more appropriate for a young girl.</li>
            <li> Waited for over a month for shipping only for it to be cheaply made and not the color advertised. Would not buy again. Good thing it was cheap.</li>
            <li> Beautiful piece, wear it most of the week and get nothing get hit compliments on it. For the money I paid,  it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought it there was a little girl on the pic but it will fit a adult great. In the summer I just want to throw my hair in a ponytail its hot and I don&#x27;t want it in my face but with this I could pull it back enough with elegance</li>
            <li> it is nice and I do like it a lot, the , the picture does not do a good job at showing that the material has a metallic effect to it, I was expecting a plan lace, but still nice and very pretty</li>
            <li> Was prompt in delivery, but broke on one side as soon as I put it on.  After I sewed it back, it was pretty, but doesn&#x27;t look like the pic.</li>
            <li> The product I received was a much cheaper knock-off version of what is shown in the picture. The width is much shorter, and it is not lace like in the picture, but rather gold thread stitching on a net like fabric. There is significantly less detailing, and it seems as if it will break if I stretch a little too much. I will still wear it though, because I cannot find anything like this anywhere else, but I am thoroughly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Got it earlier than it said it would. It&#x27;s not really what it showed you in the picture, but it&#x27;s still very cute. Too bad I can&#x27;t wear it with my hair up.</li>
            <li> Very cheap headband and from the picture I was expecting it to be white but it was gold.</li>
            <li> Instead of off white it is more beige on top of black fabric, no biggie. However, lace came off the fabric the FIRST time I tried to wear it. Trash, I&#x27;m asking for a refund. I knew it would be low quality but I expected to wear it at least a couple times.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even look like the picture. Its definitely not white. Where the elastic attaches to the lace it looks weird. Also, it doesn&#x27;t fit, much too large.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. The only thing that stays on my head.</li>
            <li> Comfy, keeps my hair down and back, and pretty!</li>
            <li> This headband is adorable, however it is way to big for my average sized head and just falls right out.</li>
            <li> Cheap, the lace started coming loose from the elastic after the first time I wore it.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper.  It covers a bad hair day beautifully and can be worn for many hours without discomfort!</li>
            <li> What I received in the mail is NOT what is advertised in this picture and NOT what is described as an &amp;#34;Elastic head band&amp;#34;.  Elegant? You must be joking!! Simply put, this is a black plastic hunk of junk with a piece of lace attached by glue. Cheaply made poorly constructed NOT anything like the picture resembles. Sending it back to China is out the question. BUYERS BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> It broke even before I tried it on ):</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new, bigger lace headband after the one I had before fell apart. Let me tell you, this thing is amazing. I have no idea what the other negative reviewers were thinking when they got this product (maybe their expectations were too high and they were disappointed?) But the headband I got was amazing. The lace was stitched over an almost clear webbing material (and yes, that&#x27;s how you&#x27;re supposed to make lace, espeicially when you have a machine doing it, you whiners.) and although there was too much gold threading through the lace, it was easily gone once I washed it with a little bleach. The elastic also has no problem going over my head. Overall, an excellent product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite headband - and was so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t look exactly like the picture. It isn&#x27;t a white lace but gold and does have some black backing to it...but it works great with my brunette hair! I&#x27;ve had this for two years now and have worn it frequently. It is still in perfect condition. I&#x27;d buy over and over again!&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews say it looked like a kid made it, poorly made, broke quicktly etc. I tried to cancel my order I was so scared. But I guess I don&#x27;t understand...mine is beautiful and going strong two years later!</li>
            <li> but not the same look as on the website..&lt;br /&gt;its BIG and not as tight on the elastic as i would have liked&lt;br /&gt;but its different</li>
            <li> Just like the picture, I love it. This piece can be dressed up or dressed down to fit your look.</li>
            <li> nice , very wide , made a great gift</li>
            <li> The white piece is way smaller than in the picture making the head and hair seem awkward.</li>
            <li> Very cute, off white color, stays on without a problem.</li>
            <li> More of a gold color and this thing is big</li>
            <li> I had this sent as a gift.  The recipient has not worn it yet but she said she is waiting for the appropriate time to wear it.  It is quite wide and she has a smaller head, but she thinks it will work out.</li>
            <li> I love this head band I wear it everywear I dress it up and down just works great with everything</li>
            <li> Wish that we could order these in different sizes because my head is quite a bit larger than my fellow women, and I knew that when ordering this piece. I will be reconstructing it to fit me perfectly. So excited for my new headband!</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as cute in person</li>
            <li> beautiful design. just stands up a little in the back. but a few bobby pins and it works/ looks great.</li>
            <li> I can wear this and yesterday my 4 year old daughter wore it. It works on both of us and looks very pretty.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good doesn&#x27;t roll off my head like most of them do</li>
            <li> I like when my significant other wear this.</li>
            <li> Very cute headband to wear, I think, as pictured when hair is up!  It&#x27;s very nice quality and cute!! Just as pictured!</li>
            <li> I liked it but the first time I put it on one of the strings broke which was a bummer thankfully can still wear it so far</li>
            <li> Fits nicely; good quality</li>
            <li> A little on the tight side so instead of a hair band I have to wear it as a head band in order to keep it on... otherwise it slips right off.</li>
            <li> Broke the first night. Band is glued on not sewn.</li>
            <li> still have not recieved my headband... dissapointed .... the head band looks cute but Im going to have to update my feedback whenever i get it...</li>
            <li> This product looks different rom the picture and its smaller than on picture... It is also needed to be treated with care can break easily not too sturdy.</li>
