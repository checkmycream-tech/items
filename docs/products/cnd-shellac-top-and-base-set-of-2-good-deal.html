            <li>what I have learned for the best outcome is to make sure you coat the top edge of your nail to seal the edge!</li>
            <li>Shellac is amazing I used on my work, is the best , but this bottles are tinny and I  not so happy with the size but is fine because I now it work really good,,</li>
            <li>You need great bottom and top coat to have great looking nails.  </li>
            <li>Good Deal.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do my own nails at home and this has been a great tool.</li>

            <li>This set was a good deal, and a good substitute for gel.</li>
            <li>these work perfectly along with a shellac nail curing light.</li>
            <li>I bought this and it works good just like they use a salon, you pick your color and use this coat over it works good.</li>
            <li>This was a good deal,and you need both to do the shellac manicure.  </li>

            <li>These are a good price for the set of two.</li>
            <li>good deal- use it with the CND UV Lamp</li>

            <li>box was smashed, but product was good</li>
            <li>No issues, good quality.</li>
            <li>Good quality and can tell the difference when comparing to cheaper polish lines.</li>
            <li>but I get a good week out of it.</li>
            <li>are good quality, came sealed and unopened.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been loving my &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I just started doing my own shellac nails</li>
            <li>I do my own Shellac manicures at my home.</li>
            <li>I like doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research on line as far as what would be my best options for good looking nails.</li>
            <li>, I realized I really liked the outcome of Shellac nails.</li>
            <li>After doing my own gel nails for years, I became allergic to the brand I was using.</li>
            <li>I liked the brushes in the bottles and the consistency of the product.  </li>
            <li>However I was able to find some good tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a nice cuticle oil (or any oil) on your cuticles after painting and curing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used a gel or shellac of any kind before.</li>
            <li>I ordered the gel polish &amp;#34;candy lover&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve saved so mush money doing my own..  already paid for itself</li>
            <li>I already knew I liked it as my beautician had used it on my nails.  </li>
            <li>so I could do my own shellac nails at home.  </li>
            <li>Start doing your own Nails, don&#x27;t pay to get them done.  </li>
            <li>I got the order so fast I am a very happy customer and will order again.</li>
            <li>Adore doing my own Shellac at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started doing my own manicure to save money and even purchased my own heat lamp.</li>
            <li>I now can save a ton of money by doing my own shellac.  </li>
            <li>I use the CND line and do my own nails, could not be happier.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly and produces a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li>Received this product quickly and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and dries very nice</li>
            <li>Once you clean your nails with alcohol and get off all the tackiness they look great.</li>
            <li>After the 10 months it wasn&#x27;t working as well, so I ordered a new set, and PERFECT!!  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to do and have had good results with any CND product.</li>
            <li>Lasts a week , comes off very easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to remove and apply</li>
            <li>very strong.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li>- they peeled off very easily.  </li>
            <li>I found it very easy to do.  </li>
            <li>I guess I have to say 7 more words or more to get this to go!</li>
            <li>This is what professional nail salons use, so I went with these products, am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This brand is by far the best brand I have found yet.</li>
            <li>I love doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful for natural nails.</li>
            <li>The thing I like best is that my nails were soft &amp; flaky</li>
            <li>Very excited to own these,  can&#x27;t buy them in the store.  </li>
            <li>I am just a regular person, getting great results from a great product and saving a fortune over what I was spending at the salon.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I bought my own light and the product to do my own nails.</li>
            <li>Love being able to do my own shellac and save tons of money.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to all the women who wants to have beautiful nails.</li>
            <li>Great colour, great coverage, works much better than the generic brands out there.  </li>
            <li>First time ordering shellac and this was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li>I just finished my first shellac manicure at home with these two products and it went great.</li>
            <li>no they look fine!</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and the product worked PERFECT!!</li>
            <li>This is so much better than the gel formula I was using.</li>
            <li>I bought CND because I knew it was a top brand.</li>
            <li>I can still use my gel nail polish colours, but use the bottom and top shellac products.</li>
            <li>It takes a time or two to get proficient at the process, but I like the hours and prices better here (at home).</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I started poking around the net and found CND had the best reviews when it came to UV gel nails.</li>
            <li>All I can find is how safe it is &amp; how it has no formaldehyde in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>But I love it.</li>
            <li>I was able to peel this off and</li>
            <li>and I love the cnd product line.</li>
            <li>The bundle buy was much more affordable then buying separately.</li>
            <li>I just wish they would be more competitive with their pricing.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the CND Shellac products.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to order because I love the product.  </li>
            <li>If my nails didn&#x27;t grow out I wouldn&#x27;t have to do again for a month.. :)</li>
            <li>Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac!</li>

            <li>After finding out I had an allergy to gel, the shellac turned out to be the only alternative I knew of and the best.</li>
            <li>I love it.this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li>My nail polish can stay on without chipping for 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>Love CND.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy being able to do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>They make the nail more durable and stronger.  </li>
            <li>I wil be getting more of this from this site.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s just say, I fell in love, by the time</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li>Never have I had this problem, be sure you look where this comes from, I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>it was better than Gel</li>
            <li>but that is okay,</li>
            <li>I just ordered the CND top and basecoat, one color coat, and the UV curing lamp.</li>
            <li>, then I put the top coat on</li>
            <li>You have to have these and buying the two together is a great deal, much cheaper this way.  </li>
            <li>Fast service and great product.</li>
            <li>The sticky-ness helps the polish stick better.  </li>
            <li>I do not like this top coat.</li>
            <li>Love to be able to do it myself.</li>
            <li>I love the CND shellac polishes.  </li>
            <li>It makes the nails stronger and more durable than color alone.  </li>
            <li>These are really inexpensive but work great.</li>
            <li>If you want a manicure to last for 2 weeks this is the best set of products to achieve this goal.</li>
            <li>I have been using CND for a year now and truely love it.</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love these two items.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll also eliminate the pin-head air bubbles by going with a top coat that spreads easier during application and while curing.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t have to make any more appointments for this.</li>
            <li>Make sure that she has</li>
            <li>You can even plug the bulbs in for her to make yourself feel a bit more manly after purchasing nail accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shellac is definitely the best gel nail products out!</li>
            <li>but maybe I need better practice?</li>
            <li>These two bottles are still going and I ordered more for when they run out.</li>
            <li>This is the best and i need more of it actually...</li>
            <li>My favorite gel.</li>
            <li>Then I add one more layer of the CND top coat to seal it in.</li>
            <li>It all stays on for a week or more chip-free.</li>
            <li>that I know and they love it .</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and very strong.  </li>
            <li>The top coat/base coat combo work great and not hard to remove.</li>
            <li>Really great customer service - had an issue with the top coat and they shipped me out a new one immediately free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price, and works really well with my UV</li>
            <li>Great deal, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>This product worked fantastic, no chipping or peeling for over 2 weeks, My nails look great and they are much stronger.</li>
            <li>Easy to take off, just make sure as in everything else that you read instructions.</li>
            <li>Nothing special this product seems to lift very easily</li>
            <li>Just the top coat will work fine.</li>
            <li>A lot of instructions say to use 99% isopropyl alcohol on the top coat, but i used 91% since that&#x27;s all i could find and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>All cnd products have been great so far.  </li>
            <li>Shipped safely and securely.</li>
            <li>The bottom coat is ok it gose on smooth.</li>

            <li>I am having lots of fun and saving money doing my own nails.</li>
            <li>Good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li>I like how these go on together, they last a good amount of time and unlike gel, I cannot peel them off and that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li>Have used other products - this definately the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use and stay on until I want to take them off.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, and easy to take off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use at home.</li>
            <li>easy to work with.  </li>
            <li>They go on easily, need a UV lamp to set.  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and nails</li>
            <li>Easy to use and remove.  </li>

            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I can use my regular polish with it and it is beautiful.</li>
            <li>very easy to apply and last a good while.</li>
            <li>It has worked out fine.</li>
            <li>Came on time and worked fine</li>
            <li>It cured easily under my UV light.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It worked just fine.</li>
            <li>First attempt turned out fine, and I am sure with practice I will get better.  </li>
            <li>This worked fine with my OPI laquer polish and the Royal nail lamp.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>The upgrade backrest work fine.</li>
            <li>Received my order quickly however wasn&#x27;t pleased with the product .</li>
            <li>This product is tremendous!  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, easy to use and much thinner than gel.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t bother with the pink because I am very fair complected.)  </li>
            <li>Polish flows on smooth and looks good as a clear coat without colored polish.</li>
            <li>By far the best gel I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>I justified by buy in that</li>
            <li>I found a blog while searching that reported how safe it is because it sits on your nails and isn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>It genuinely stays chip-free for 14 days and is wayyyy shinier than any nail polish you can purchase in the store or from a salon.  </li>
            <li>My friend had just a CND Shellac light from her mom for Christmas</li>
            <li>I put them in the UV light for literally 15 minutes (each hand).  </li>
            <li>CND Shellac products are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Great if you are just starting out with Shellac nails.</li>
            <li>You will need to use a UV light for these to work correctly.</li>
            <li>and, this nail polish tended to shrink under the light.  </li>
            <li>and I just buff it lightly and start over.  </li>
            <li>These nail polishes are fantastic .  </li>
            <li>I used the UV light and followed the instructions on the box.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t make a smooth brush stroke anymore.</li>
            <li>This polish  is a great addition to making your nail color last longer.  </li>
            <li>You do need a UV light nail dryer to use this.</li>
            <li>Stays tacky, even after 9-12 minutes under the light</li>
            <li>2 Weeks of chipped free nails for her and 2 weeks of no requests for opinions of chipped nails to which I always have to respond with \\&quot;</li>
            <li>But overall a great product</li>
            <li>or how does this compare to gel using LED light?</li>
            <li>I recently bought this whole line, my clients are very happy with the outcome of their nails!</li>
            <li>I love this shellac more than gel polish, and it really does come off with no damage to your nails</li>
            <li>so far so good.  </li>
            <li>so 6 days is a good run as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>You ABSOLUTELY need the UV nail dryer!!!  </li>
            <li>and stays on for ~2 weeks .... very nice to not have to keep dealing with nail polish several times each week.</li>
            <li>I got a UV light for Christmas and was excited to try the Shellac system.  </li>
            <li>The supplies can be a little pricey (light, base/top coat, color, etc) and it takes a time or two to perfect the technique, but at $20+ per Shellac manicure at a salon, it quickly pays itself off.</li>
            <li>Very nice products,the bottle are glasses,i love them very much！also good quality ，but just too small bottle,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would most certainly recommend and would buy again!</li>
            <li>Removal is super easy.  </li>
            <li>Very fast service and will order more</li>
            <li>but she was excited.  </li>
            <li>,just buy it,it is  worth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I get to keep up my manicure.  </li>
            <li>am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The top coat is a bit gloopy with my first use- even after shaking it for one minute.</li>
            <li>it tells me that the top coat has to be cured first , with their UV lamp...</li>
            <li>The products work great and my nail polish stays on for a long period of time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re having trouble make the system work for you there are very good instructions available on the Internet that can help.</li>
            <li>Everything seems new and they apply nicely.  </li>
            <li>This item shipped very, very fast, they came in orginial packaging and they work perfectly with my other shellac producst!</li>
            <li>This shellac stays on and I forget to use gloves all the time when I clean, garden, weed, work with my horses, etc.</li>
            <li>Good quality product, must be applied in thin coats, but once you master it, it makes great manicures.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, and hardens quickly in the UV lamp.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is that easy to get nails that look like they came fresh out of a salon without having ANY beauty school or knowledge.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t bother using the special shellac polish colors, I use whatever polish</li>
            <li>This is what I do: prep nails (I don&#x27;t use the special nail prep</li>
            <li>then after that using alcohol and their special sponge, remove the inhibitor...</li>
            <li>Odd, because all other shellacs I ordered (about 20) were in good to perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I did use the LED light and it works good never lasts as long as it says</li>
            <li>Since then, I have purchased the products to use at home, and the result is not as good as the salon, but I think I don&#x27;t give it enough time to cure.</li>
            <li>had some good luck with the sandwich technique of regular nail polish - if you have patience.</li>
            <li>She loves the colors and says it is a quality product, so it must be true.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much</li>
            <li>there are many tips on the reviews of the royal nail dryer, which is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Good base and top coat ,works excellent together.</li>
            <li>an overall good deal for the set of 2.</li>
            <li>The top coat is very shiny and stays that way for about 10 days.</li>
            <li>I did them by myself and even beauticians thought they looked nice and professionally done.</li>
            <li>Lasts for a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Then add your regular polish and your good to go!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>CND is the best gel polish on the market  - some of the others are too thick and they peel off.</li>
            <li>Good price for two bottles of essential shellac items</li>
            <li>Two hours later...the top coat was VERY STICKY...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m consistanly getting a full two weeks of ware out of each application.  </li>
            <li>This product is necessary if you want shellac nails to look good.  </li>
            <li>I am a licensed professional and I do my own manicures at home,.</li>
            <li>The top coat is very durable.</li>
            <li>Good products, necessary to the process for shellacking my nails.  </li>
            <li>CND have good products that last on my nails for about two weeks!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford to have shellac nails done professionally, however, I&#x27;ve been able to do them easily at home with this product.  </li>
            <li>Once I get my light, we&#x27;ll find out if they work right</li>
            <li>Highly recommend ..... goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The following week, I was cooking quite a bit, since we celebrated Passover and Easter the same weekend, and my nails stayed perfect.  </li>
            <li>The first time it was fine.  </li>
            <li>But just starting out with the Royal Nail equipment, I wanted to give it the best possible chance.  </li>
            <li>I also have used incoco white nail polish tip strips for the PERFECT at home french.</li>
            <li>Without that the polish starts to chip from the end of your nail too quickly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t chip as quickly.</li>
            <li>CND is much more expensive, but it does give excellent results.  </li>
            <li>and they quickly responded stating that they would refund me as soon as they received the package.</li>
            <li>came quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li>and it came quick.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, legit products.</li>
            <li>Provides a quick at-home manicure</li>
            <li>My nails look shiny but natural and the shelac is more comfortable than gel nails.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used them several times &amp; have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>The new bottles were much better than what I received in this duo.</li>
            <li>I read some of the previous reviews- one of which gave directions (great directions by the way), and decided to buy these.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li>This company mails quickly and after you purchase the initial set of all the products you need to gel your own nails, you quickly will re-coop that money rather than spending $30.00 every time you go to the salon.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li>after googling that problem, i found out my mistakes and hopefully, all will be well for my 2nd experiment after i receive my light for myself for christmas!!</li>
            <li>Personally, I will stick with CND over the competitor since they hold up so much better!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too!</li>
            <li>First use and my polish is lifting within 4 days!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li>I use the entire system and my nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li>they go on smooth and cure very shiny.</li>
            <li>Still I really like the CND Shellac for wear time and for smooth application.  </li>
            <li>but it went fast because of the cheap ass bottle</li>
            <li>I initially bought this because of an amazing shellac manicure I got in CT, while visiting my In-laws.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble applying them and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>Arrived before expected good deal</li>
            <li>I give myself a manicure about every 10 days, but it&#x27;s sooo worth</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This time the top coat appears to be old.  </li>
            <li>They work perfectly along with the white tip polish and pink tinted polish.</li>
            <li>of all the brands out there, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am one of those that like fresh polish on my nails.</li>
            <li>I went back and forth on deciding to buy the products to do my own nails at home</li>
            <li>nails look healthy, natural, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li>I have already absorbed costs for lamp and polish...</li>
            <li>My nails look better than they have since I stopped having them professionally done.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>It IS a good deal to get both, if youre not interested in using color, these would be all you would need along with the lights and alcohol to finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a long time and love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands and none are as good as CND.  </li>
            <li>Soak for 10-15 mins and the polish just scrapes right off.</li>
            <li>i needed to watch a youtube tutorial to get it completely right</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>Price was right and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>Nice long wearing over 14 days .</li>
            <li>If you do your own nails, these are great base and top coats.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different brand &amp;#34;shallec&amp;#34; products and I find that CND Shellac lends best result and finish.</li>
            <li>The 2 for 1 is pretty good for these, as they are really expensive on their own.</li>
            <li>I have been using the CND Shellac system for a year now and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use all my new nail stuff</li>
            <li>What the add didn&#x27;t say was that you had to use a UV light to set the shellac ( at 149.00) and use a special sponge that has a plastic back ( don&#x27;t know what that</li>
            <li>My eyes are really sensitive too light now</li>
            <li>Goes on like regular polish and is so much better than gels.</li>
            <li>I wanted to spend the money I would have paid for the big size on purchasing one more Shellac color.</li>
            <li>Came fast!</li>
            <li>Exactly what you need when doing yourself shellac manicure/Pedicures.</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed, TY</li>
            <li>Used it the product for the first time this week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to order more.</li>
            <li>I will more than likely buy these again.</li>
            <li>The shellac top and base coat were fresh and look great!  </li>
            <li>This set is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>Both coats came in their boxes and where exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li>but I do like the fact that I can wear them much longer!  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than regular polish.</li>
            <li>This purchase has started chipping before the first week was complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush won&#x27;t come out and won&#x27;t go back in, and the top comes apart.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford that every two weeks, but I could afford a system that paid for itself in the first couple uses.</li>
            <li>Have been shellacking my nails for 2 years now and first time I have ordered from this company.</li>
            <li>All they need to do now is come out with a red sparkly color like &amp;#34;ruby pumps&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m all set :-)</li>
            <li>Just be aware.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I finally decided on CND.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and used regular polish then the shellac top coat.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This last much better than any store bought shellac.</li>
            <li>I actually watched it :)</li>
            <li>but it is still much better than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>The product exactly how described.</li>
            <li>It was my first time ever using shellac</li>
            <li>I got through everything, the last step was putting on the top coat.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve been able to keep on longer than a day without it chipping.</li>
            <li>Only lasts a week for me but that says more about my nails than it does about the product.</li>
            <li>With the better back rest I would rate the kayak</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>This is not just any regular top coat...</li>
            <li>I purchased this set to compliment the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer that I purchased for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li>She has to have said \\&quot;I love my nails\\&quot; every 5 minutes for the last 48 hours.</li>
            <li>Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer</li>
            <li>Only top and bottom coat I will use with the gels.</li>
            <li>It is okay, not the final product as in the salon</li>
            <li>the key is to make sure nails are cleaned with alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to have the set in the regular size.</li>
            <li>It works great and it last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Works much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the market and lasts the full two weeks.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find such a good deal on shellac top and base coat!</li>
            <li>If you use a LED light you should give it a little more time than you do some of the gel products</li>
            <li>The top coat was BONE DRY, the brush still soft because it had never been filled.</li>
            <li>This is the best shellac nail polish base and top coat on the market.</li>
            <li>the best for base and top.  </li>
            <li>Perfect base and top coat for your at home gel manicure.</li>
            <li>This is one of the brands my salon uses and quite frankly, I felt this base and top coat were the best.</li>
            <li>Wonderful products...needed for base and top coats of CND gels...great stuff.</li>
            <li>This base and top coat worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I purchased this CND Shellac Top and Base &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; and it was a great deal!  </li>
            <li>Consistency of the top coat is quite thick which leaves bubbles on top.</li>
            <li>All coats should be nice and thin with nothing on the cuticle and make sure you swipe the ends.  </li>
            <li>get that it is a great concept dry nails immediately &amp; lasts a long time but at what cost to your health.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that after you are done applying there is NO dry time like with normal polish.</li>
            <li>I was very nervous when using these products for the first time but they delivered as promised.  </li>
            <li>The shellac products are great, I totally agree with the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>this product is much better then OPI, that product does not stay on a long time, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Having sellers willing to sell to non-professionals is very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff it seals your polish and has a nice shine, and the base coat does a nice job protecting your nails</li>
            <li>This works with every gel and shellac I own, nice coverage on base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>After I painted my nails, I let them dry and then put on the top coat.  </li>
            <li>They do sell a bigger size which I what I recommend because you will easily go through these bottles in no time at all.</li>
            <li>If I ever need replacement I will certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li>to soak it off (using pure acetone) though.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use and extremely durable.  </li>
            <li>Great for peeling and weak nails ...</li>
            <li>Look awesome by having the dryer hidden somewhere else or save it until she starts thinking about how she can cut a few corners to afford a UV Dryer.</li>
            <li>I got a Sephora UV light last Christmas and loved how long the color last</li>
            <li>The base &amp; top coats are great with color, or alone for a natural look but still leaving your nails strong.</li>
            <li>Good buy for the base and top coats, which you tend to run out of quickly since you use them more than regular colors.  </li>
            <li>If you are an avid CND Shellac user, I would highly recommend this set.  </li>
            <li>look like they were freshly painted for nearly two whole weeks.</li>
            <li>Really shiny and never chip or break.</li>
            <li>The soak off removal is so much faster than the gel.</li>
            <li>Just try to apply it as smooth as possible.  </li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t use that much product.  </li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I always use CND products and my polish stays on for almost 3 weeks -- until my nails grow out too much.</li>
            <li>Work very well.</li>
            <li>I also want to make it known I put this product as well as the nail product on very sparingly.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very doable</li>
            <li>Continue to buy these products and really like the durability of CND Shellac for my manicure.  </li>
            <li>I continued to monitor the package and after it was confirmed back to their location, I watched my bank account for the return.</li>
            <li>I use it so much, I&#x27;ll order another set soon.</li>
            <li>I believe I received a defective product or one that is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>These are very satisfactory products</li>
            <li>I ordered the whole shellac setup on amazon.</li>
            <li>The product came on time and was very well packed</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than going to a salon</li>
            <li>High glossy shine!</li>
            <li>Having said that, I have very brittle peeling nails</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is fast and saves money when you do it your self.</li>
            <li>I received them in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  </li>
            <li>and I really like this brand.</li>
            <li>They were shipped in a very timely manor, as well.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>The CND top coat leaves a seriously wet looking shine.  </li>
            <li>I of course being a modern woman...</li>
            <li>but really how much can you rave about a product that just does its job.</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>Items shipped fast.</li>
            <li>The trick is to cure clear coat and cure TWO layers of the regular nail polish coat then the top coat.</li>
            <li>I love that this comes as a set of 2, as you obviously need both to do a complete manicure.</li>
            <li>They give you are really good bond and finish that keeps the color on for at least a week without a scratch.</li>
            <li>Using a regular nail polish on top, I found, not only makes the polish chip free for at least a week, but it also helps my nails grow to amazing new lengths that I couldn&#x27;t get to before.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It lasts for a little over two weeks, no chipping, when you purchase this brand in a color, it is VERY true to what you see on the bottle!</li>
            <li>Over time, I started collecting polishes from other companies, mostly Gelish.</li>
            <li>It works much better than any other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited that there is finally a product I can do at home that will hold up on my nails through work!</li>
            <li>If you are just investigating the Shellac process, you will quickly realize that these are the two staples of the Shellac process and would be hard pressed to find a better price.  </li>
            <li>I Instantly ordered the Top and Base coat, now just saving to get some good CND colors :)</li>
            <li>Love the strength and mirror shine that they give may nails without being super thick.</li>
            <li>Would continue using as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>The shellac it an awesome system and the base and top coats are essential.  </li>
            <li>and I was finally able to sit down and give myself a manicure.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The polish took forever to dry even using the light.</li>
            <li>I rated 4 stars because my top coat bottle doesn&#x27;t close all the way, its odd.</li>
            <li>Will try again and make sure that I put enough of the product on the next time.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands at all different prices.</li>
            <li>but the main thing is</li>
            <li>The CND Shellac Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\&quot; is a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li>The coatings are only lasting a day or two at most.</li>
            <li>I use the top and bottom coats alot, I only change color about every ten days.</li>
            <li>If high end spas use this brand that says something.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the CND line of polishes.</li>
            <li>I clean my hands all day long and they keep on shining.</li>
            <li>My right hand has begun chipping on the end that may be because I did not seal the tips a bit harder since I am right handed.</li>
            <li>To begin with I didn&#x27;t know if I could get it to turn out like when I had it done professionally since everyone told me I had to have a certain type of lamp to go with this product</li>
            <li>This set is hard to come by on Amazon, so I was thrilled that it was not thick and unusable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not giving up but will definitely need to go to a professional to have nails done for a special event.</li>
            <li>Works great even when you do things wrong........</li>
            <li>All you need is a small amount should last a good while.</li>
            <li>The top coat was pretty thick</li>
            <li>but now I am satisfied and don&#x27;t feel guilty if I want to change the color more often than I could afford to do if I went to a professional.</li>
            <li>Love shellac, but buying this \\&quot;set of two\\&quot; was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li>When I opened the top coat box it was leaking and was also missing a brush.</li>
            <li>so far the base and top coat did the job, happy with these items.</li>
            <li>Appears to do the job, just need to make sure that you have full coverage and apply a thin coat</li>
            <li>Good but not great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not returning these because it would be more trouble than just throwing it away and going to a salon and purchase a new set.  </li>
            <li>The black nail polish looks great once dried but peels off within hours</li>
            <li>I have tried other lines, but this is the BEST top and base coat.  </li>
            <li>The base and top coats work awesome with other brands of polishes.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I am a blackjack dealer and regular nail polish just chips right off my nails in a matter of minutes from working with the blackjack chips.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply thin coats Be sure to use UV light to dry will dry to a hard and shiny finish and will last a good 2 weeks</li>
            <li>They were as I expected and haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li>I have about 9 and am always looking for new colors to come out</li>
            <li>I live in Canada and I order it from Amazon and have it delivered in US.</li>
            <li>She used it with her new lamp and still stands by this claim.</li>
            <li>and when I should by a new one.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between Gel and Shellac, I would recommend Shellac, The Gel, you need to scrape off before you start a new set.</li>
            <li>and when I should by a new one.</li>
            <li>If you are trying to decide between Gel and Shellac, I would recommend Shellac, The Gel, you need to scrape off before you start a new set.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without shellac.</li>
            <li>The entire reason I use the UV light is to make the color last.</li>
            <li>using a regular nail polish on top, I find that the polish also dries alot faster meaning you need to work faster to spread it to an even coat on you nail, so that might be troublesome for some who go carefully along.</li>
            <li>professional quality, works really well, is easy to apply, not strong smelling and lasts for 2 weeks with the gel polish.</li>
            <li>Easy  and long lasting!</li>
            <li>It contains less product and costs more than other brands, but it is worth it if you are looking for quality vs. quantity.</li>
            <li>The CND Shellac completely revitalized my UV gel nail polish!</li>
            <li>I will most likely buy from a different seller in the future.</li>
            <li>Have only one color in shellac and it looks so pretty and shiny.</li>
            <li>Works okay, but the bottles are definitely small.</li>
            <li>so I will never waste time scraping and buffing again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same thing I was paying $20 every two weeks at the salon to get.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for the past 2 years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>No more smudged toes for me can&#x27;t wait to do my nails :)</li>
            <li>I usually use spf15 cream on my hands and wear uv gloves to be sure.  </li>
            <li>Last two weeks ;)</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my Shellac Top and base coat.</li>
            <li>The boxes were a little dented but the product inside was completely fine.</li>
            <li>Small bottles last about a year when doing my nails regularly, so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li>Unlike the first purchase that had the correct fluid consistency, this time the top coat is thick and comes out like molasses.  </li>
            <li>I love CND base and top coat for no chip!</li>
            <li>Top coat was a little thick, otherwise both products are fine.</li>
            <li>I wish the price was lower and shipping was free on items that weigh so little.  </li>
            <li>It provides the support I need for my natural nails.</li>
            <li>I use a UV lamp to set the Shellace on my natural nails.</li>
            <li>and my manicure is totally complete with no drying time.</li>
            <li>old mothers</li>
            <li>the nail polish stays put and my nails do not turn white which can happen from too much use.</li>
            <li>&amp; I had to throw out the old because these do seem to age and not work as well after about 6 months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t take the old shellac &#x27;off&#x27;</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s working for me, and it thickens the tip as it grows out and gives a bit of additional strength.  </li>
            <li>Yes, occasionally, one of the tips peels off, but it doesn&#x27;t damage my nail much</li>
            <li>BUT You won&#x27;t need to apply much I will last weeks</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not getting the 2 weeks wear time</li>
            <li>If the product gets old, it gets gummy.</li>
            <li>but so far I like the CND brand</li>
            <li>I found this seller, sent an e-mail and was pleasantly surprised by the help that was given.</li>
            <li>I never tried to get a professional shellac manicure</li>
            <li>As well getting it off was a complete nighmare</li>
            <li>I must have received old product.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to be a professional.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to be a professional.</li>
            <li>Just used to replace one of my nails after having a manicure 2 weeks ago, bought everything to do a complete manicure and as yet have not done it,</li>
            <li>I decided I did not want to put the shellac on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I just want natural color.</li>
            <li>it does tend to lift every once in a while near the tip of the nail even though i tap the edges of the nail as recommended.  </li>
            <li>It lasts and offers for versility with nail shades.</li>
            <li>The only con is that this does not provide as much strength to my nails as gel does.</li>
            <li>Since using the shellac my nails are much stronger &amp; are all the same length.</li>
            <li>The Shellac gives me the nice thin coat I expect to get</li>
            <li>I bought the CND Shellac Top and Base Set hoping I could do my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I did notice the brush getting a little stiff but in the end the finish was just as good as the one I had done at the salon for $35.</li>
            <li>A base and top coat is necessary and these are the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34;, easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>These two make your nails look really pretty for a very long time.</li>
            <li>1-2 coats of regular nail polish (I use Revlon quick dry).</li>
            <li>Base is great - removes cleanly without nail damage, a real advantage over other gels.</li>
            <li>Top coat brush is a little long but works.</li>
            <li>Also my bottles seem to have dried out pretty fast</li>
            <li>I have had mine for almost a year now and have used both pretty regularly and still have some left.</li>
            <li>I have had mine for almost a year now and have used both pretty regularly and still have some left.</li>
            <li>The top coat seems a little thick, but so did the first one I bought, so this may be normal.  </li>
            <li>Recommend to all ladies that like a high gloss shine that will last.  </li>
            <li>but instead just buff it down slightly and put the new on top.  </li>
            <li>However, this is the only shellac brand that I like and stays strong and doesn&#x27;t peel of a few days after application.</li>
            <li>Still, even though it is a little goopy...it still works fine overall.</li>
            <li>Also, use an LED light - not a regular UV light like CND actually unfortunately recommends.  </li>
            <li>but this is my first time using gel polish so this may be expected.</li>
            <li>I use the base coat, cure with uv lamp, add my own regular nail color, then use the top coat and cure again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to nail polish, but since purchasing this product I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s very important to use a base and top coat every time you polish your nails.  </li>
            <li>I really think I will try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li>They do what they say they should the top coat makes this tick shiny wet finish that fills in all ridges and uneven spots on the nails</li>
            <li>it &amp;#34;bounces&amp;#34; back to smooth in a few seconds</li>
            <li>Love Shellac products and buying base and top coat in a set makes sense for the usage.</li>
            <li>I love the CND base and top coat Gel polish.  </li>
            <li>I love the CND brand for base and top coats.  </li>
            <li>I love CND products, including these two base and top coats.</li>
            <li>The base and top coat shellac are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It may be old or was not stored properly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I purchased the CND Shellac Top and Base &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; when I purchased my 54 Watt Royal Nails Professional UV Light Gel and Acrilic Nail Dryer.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly it does&#x27;nt clump up or get thick or runny.</li>
            <li>Please be sure to use a thin coat.  </li>
            <li>Polish was so thick it would not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I now use the base coat, top coat, cure it and THEN regular polish on top.</li>
            <li>day nail color, high shine and zero dry time.  </li>
            <li>It made my nails so strong, and it the top and base coat lasted for two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Of course the shellac or gelish in general does not last over 3 months, but my base and top coat lasted me about 10 good months of poilishing just my nails about every 2 weeks all year round.  </li>
            <li>While the top coat is fine, the base coat bottle is defective.  </li>
            <li>Bought it thinking that I could use it directly on my nails, but alas you have to have a special machine to make it dry on your nails and the machine cost too much.  </li>
            <li>Stays on much longer than other gels.</li>
            <li>I really hope that my bottle was the only bottle that was empty</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of doing my own nails, but it gets expensive buying these individually.</li>
            <li>It does not dry well even under the lamp</li>
            <li>This base coat and top coat work tremendously well, and are required for the complete system.</li>
            <li>I had my first shellac manicure a few months ago</li>
            <li>I want paired with the special base and top coat</li>
            <li>I like IBD polish just as much for half the price and twice the amount of polish.</li>
            <li>They are thin and easy on without being &#x27;gloopy&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I find the same is true with the colored polishes, Gelish are thick and tricky to apply and Shellac are thinner and easier to apply/cure.  </li>
            <li>These are a bit thick, but the product is super quality.  </li>
            <li>For my natural nails my manicure last long the bottle are smaller</li>
            <li>The brushes for the shellac were junk, half of the brush is missing, so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li>The only down side was how the top coat got so thick and goopy and ran out before the bottom coat bottle.</li>
            <li>The base coat protects your nails and the top coat hardens so quick after curing.....</li>
            <li>(my first try is pretty thick but no smudges!!).  </li>
            <li>Typically I apply the base coat, two coats of my favorite nail polish then seal with the Shellac top coat.</li>

            <li> Easy to apply and excellent results.</li>
            <li> Great seller, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> what I have learned for the best outcome is to make sure you coat the top edge of your nail to seal the edge!</li>
            <li> Shellac is amazing I used on my work, is the best , but this bottles are tinny and I  not so happy with the size but is fine because I now it work really good,,</li>
            <li> You need great bottom and top coat to have great looking nails.  </li>
            <li> Good Deal.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do my own nails at home and this has been a great tool.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish out there if you&#x27;re using a light.</li>
            <li> good quality.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple of times before my nails looked as good as the salon</li>
            <li> This set was a good deal, and a good substitute for gel.</li>
            <li> these work perfectly along with a shellac nail curing light.</li>
            <li> I bought this and it works good just like they use a salon, you pick your color and use this coat over it works good.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal,and you need both to do the shellac manicure.  </li>
            <li> It is a good deal when buying together.  </li>
            <li> They are good.</li>
            <li> These are a good price for the set of two.</li>
            <li> good deal- use it with the CND UV Lamp</li>
            <li> And a good price as a combo.</li>
            <li> box was smashed, but product was good</li>
            <li> No issues, good quality.</li>
            <li> Good quality and can tell the difference when comparing to cheaper polish lines.</li>
            <li> but I get a good week out of it.</li>
            <li> are good quality, came sealed and unopened.</li>
            <li> Great deal on the set, good service from the seller, and I love the brand too.</li>
            <li> And it turned out super shiny and perfect.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been loving my &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just started doing my own shellac nails</li>
            <li> I do my own Shellac manicures at my home.</li>
            <li> I like doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on line as far as what would be my best options for good looking nails.</li>
            <li> , I realized I really liked the outcome of Shellac nails.</li>
            <li> After doing my own gel nails for years, I became allergic to the brand I was using.</li>
            <li> I liked the brushes in the bottles and the consistency of the product.  </li>
            <li> However I was able to find some good tutorials on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a nice cuticle oil (or any oil) on your cuticles after painting and curing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never used a gel or shellac of any kind before.</li>
            <li> I ordered the gel polish &amp;#34;candy lover&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve saved so mush money doing my own..  already paid for itself</li>
            <li> I already knew I liked it as my beautician had used it on my nails.  </li>
            <li> so I could do my own shellac nails at home.  </li>
            <li> Start doing your own Nails, don&#x27;t pay to get them done.  </li>

            <li> Adore doing my own Shellac at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started doing my own manicure to save money and even purchased my own heat lamp.</li>
            <li> I now can save a ton of money by doing my own shellac.  </li>
            <li> I use the CND line and do my own nails, could not be happier.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly and produces a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and dries very nice</li>
            <li> Once you clean your nails with alcohol and get off all the tackiness they look great.</li>
            <li> After the 10 months it wasn&#x27;t working as well, so I ordered a new set, and PERFECT!!  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to do and have had good results with any CND product.</li>
            <li> Lasts a week , comes off very easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to remove and apply</li>
            <li> very strong.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> - they peeled off very easily.  </li>
            <li> I found it very easy to do.  </li>
            <li> I guess I have to say 7 more words or more to get this to go!</li>
            <li> This is what professional nail salons use, so I went with these products, am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This brand is by far the best brand I have found yet.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for natural nails.</li>
            <li> The thing I like best is that my nails were soft &amp; flaky</li>
            <li> Very excited to own these,  can&#x27;t buy them in the store.  </li>
            <li> I am just a regular person, getting great results from a great product and saving a fortune over what I was spending at the salon.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I bought my own light and the product to do my own nails.</li>
            <li> Love being able to do my own shellac and save tons of money.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to all the women who wants to have beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> Great colour, great coverage, works much better than the generic brands out there.  </li>
            <li> First time ordering shellac and this was a great purchase.  </li>
            <li> I just finished my first shellac manicure at home with these two products and it went great.</li>
            <li> no they look fine!</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and the product worked PERFECT!!</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the gel formula I was using.</li>
            <li> I bought CND because I knew it was a top brand.</li>
            <li> I can still use my gel nail polish colours, but use the bottom and top shellac products.</li>
            <li> It takes a time or two to get proficient at the process, but I like the hours and prices better here (at home).</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I started poking around the net and found CND had the best reviews when it came to UV gel nails.</li>
            <li> All I can find is how safe it is &amp; how it has no formaldehyde in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> But I love it.</li>
            <li> I was able to peel this off and</li>
            <li> and I love the cnd product line.</li>
            <li> The bundle buy was much more affordable then buying separately.</li>
            <li> I just wish they would be more competitive with their pricing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the CND Shellac products.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to order because I love the product.  </li>
            <li> If my nails didn&#x27;t grow out I wouldn&#x27;t have to do again for a month.. :)</li>
            <li> Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac!</li>
            <li> love getting &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; manicure with &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; price and convenience.</li>
            <li> when you are doing your own gel manicures, it is important to have quality product.  </li>

            <li> I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Love the way this goes on, stays on and looks.</li>

            <li> okay..</li>
            <li> She introduced me to shellac, and I love it for my manicures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting better though..</li>

            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You better check your stock and refresh it to make sure you won&#x27;t have any returns.  </li>
            <li> After finding out I had an allergy to gel, the shellac turned out to be the only alternative I knew of and the best.</li>
            <li> I love it.this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO GLAD</li>
            <li> My nail polish can stay on without chipping for 2 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> Love CND.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy being able to do my own nails at home.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> They make the nail more durable and stronger.  </li>
            <li> I wil be getting more of this from this site.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s just say, I fell in love, by the time</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be okay.</li>
            <li> Never have I had this problem, be sure you look where this comes from, I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> it was better than Gel</li>
            <li> but that is okay,</li>
            <li> I just ordered the CND top and basecoat, one color coat, and the UV curing lamp.</li>
            <li> , then I put the top coat on</li>
            <li> You have to have these and buying the two together is a great deal, much cheaper this way.  </li>
            <li> Fast service and great product.</li>
            <li> The sticky-ness helps the polish stick better.  </li>
            <li> I do not like this top coat.</li>
            <li> Love to be able to do it myself.</li>
            <li> I love the CND shellac polishes.  </li>
            <li> It makes the nails stronger and more durable than color alone.  </li>
            <li> These are really inexpensive but work great.</li>
            <li> If you want a manicure to last for 2 weeks this is the best set of products to achieve this goal.</li>
            <li> I have been using CND for a year now and truely love it.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love these two items.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also eliminate the pin-head air bubbles by going with a top coat that spreads easier during application and while curing.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have to make any more appointments for this.</li>
            <li> Make sure that she has</li>
            <li> You can even plug the bulbs in for her to make yourself feel a bit more manly after purchasing nail accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shellac is definitely the best gel nail products out!</li>
            <li> but maybe I need better practice?</li>
            <li> These two bottles are still going and I ordered more for when they run out.</li>
            <li> This is the best and i need more of it actually...</li>
            <li> My favorite gel.</li>
            <li> Then I add one more layer of the CND top coat to seal it in.</li>
            <li> It all stays on for a week or more chip-free.</li>
            <li> that I know and they love it .</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and very strong.  </li>
            <li> The top coat/base coat combo work great and not hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Really great customer service - had an issue with the top coat and they shipped me out a new one immediately free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price, and works really well with my UV</li>
            <li> Great deal, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This product worked fantastic, no chipping or peeling for over 2 weeks, My nails look great and they are much stronger.</li>
            <li> Easy to take off, just make sure as in everything else that you read instructions.</li>
            <li> Nothing special this product seems to lift very easily</li>
            <li> Just the top coat will work fine.</li>
            <li> A lot of instructions say to use 99% isopropyl alcohol on the top coat, but i used 91% since that&#x27;s all i could find and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> All cnd products have been great so far.  </li>
            <li> Shipped safely and securely.</li>
            <li> The bottom coat is ok it gose on smooth.</li>
            <li> I was very glad to get this at such good prices.</li>

            <li> Good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li> I like how these go on together, they last a good amount of time and unlike gel, I cannot peel them off and that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> Have used other products - this definately the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use and stay on until I want to take them off.</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, and easy to take off.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use at home.</li>
            <li> easy to work with.  </li>
            <li> They go on easily, need a UV lamp to set.  </li>
            <li> but it is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and nails</li>
            <li> Easy to use and remove.  </li>

            <li> very easy to apply and last a good while.</li>
            <li> It has worked out fine.</li>
            <li> Came on time and worked fine</li>
            <li> It cured easily under my UV light.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easily and smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It worked just fine.</li>
            <li> First attempt turned out fine, and I am sure with practice I will get better.  </li>
            <li> This worked fine with my OPI laquer polish and the Royal nail lamp.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> The upgrade backrest work fine.</li>
            <li> Received my order quickly however wasn&#x27;t pleased with the product .</li>
            <li> This product is tremendous!  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product, easy to use and much thinner than gel.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t bother with the pink because I am very fair complected.)  </li>
            <li> Polish flows on smooth and looks good as a clear coat without colored polish.</li>
            <li> By far the best gel I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I justified by buy in that</li>
            <li> I found a blog while searching that reported how safe it is because it sits on your nails and isn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> It genuinely stays chip-free for 14 days and is wayyyy shinier than any nail polish you can purchase in the store or from a salon.  </li>
            <li> My friend had just a CND Shellac light from her mom for Christmas</li>
            <li> I put them in the UV light for literally 15 minutes (each hand).  </li>
            <li> CND Shellac products are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Great if you are just starting out with Shellac nails.</li>
            <li> You will need to use a UV light for these to work correctly.</li>
            <li> and, this nail polish tended to shrink under the light.  </li>
            <li> and I just buff it lightly and start over.  </li>
            <li> These nail polishes are fantastic .  </li>
            <li> I used the UV light and followed the instructions on the box.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t make a smooth brush stroke anymore.</li>
            <li> This polish  is a great addition to making your nail color last longer.  </li>
            <li> You do need a UV light nail dryer to use this.</li>
            <li> Stays tacky, even after 9-12 minutes under the light</li>
            <li> 2 Weeks of chipped free nails for her and 2 weeks of no requests for opinions of chipped nails to which I always have to respond with \\&quot;</li>
            <li> But overall a great product</li>
            <li> or how does this compare to gel using LED light?</li>
            <li> I recently bought this whole line, my clients are very happy with the outcome of their nails!</li>
            <li> I love this shellac more than gel polish, and it really does come off with no damage to your nails</li>
            <li> so far so good.  </li>
            <li> so 6 days is a good run as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> You ABSOLUTELY need the UV nail dryer!!!  </li>
            <li> and stays on for ~2 weeks .... very nice to not have to keep dealing with nail polish several times each week.</li>
            <li> I got a UV light for Christmas and was excited to try the Shellac system.  </li>
            <li> The supplies can be a little pricey (light, base/top coat, color, etc) and it takes a time or two to perfect the technique, but at $20+ per Shellac manicure at a salon, it quickly pays itself off.</li>
            <li> Very nice products,the bottle are glasses,i love them very much！also good quality ，but just too small bottle,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would most certainly recommend and would buy again!</li>
            <li> Removal is super easy.  </li>
            <li> Very fast service and will order more</li>
            <li> but she was excited.  </li>
            <li> ,just buy it,it is  worth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I get to keep up my manicure.  </li>
            <li> am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The top coat is a bit gloopy with my first use- even after shaking it for one minute.</li>
            <li> it tells me that the top coat has to be cured first , with their UV lamp...</li>
            <li> The products work great and my nail polish stays on for a long period of time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re having trouble make the system work for you there are very good instructions available on the Internet that can help.</li>
            <li> Everything seems new and they apply nicely.  </li>
            <li> This item shipped very, very fast, they came in orginial packaging and they work perfectly with my other shellac producst!</li>
            <li> This shellac stays on and I forget to use gloves all the time when I clean, garden, weed, work with my horses, etc.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, must be applied in thin coats, but once you master it, it makes great manicures.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, and hardens quickly in the UV lamp.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is that easy to get nails that look like they came fresh out of a salon without having ANY beauty school or knowledge.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother using the special shellac polish colors, I use whatever polish</li>
            <li> This is what I do: prep nails (I don&#x27;t use the special nail prep</li>
            <li> then after that using alcohol and their special sponge, remove the inhibitor...</li>
            <li> Odd, because all other shellacs I ordered (about 20) were in good to perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I did use the LED light and it works good never lasts as long as it says</li>
            <li> Since then, I have purchased the products to use at home, and the result is not as good as the salon, but I think I don&#x27;t give it enough time to cure.</li>
            <li> had some good luck with the sandwich technique of regular nail polish - if you have patience.</li>
            <li> She loves the colors and says it is a quality product, so it must be true.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much</li>
            <li> there are many tips on the reviews of the royal nail dryer, which is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Good base and top coat ,works excellent together.</li>
            <li> an overall good deal for the set of 2.</li>
            <li> The top coat is very shiny and stays that way for about 10 days.</li>
            <li> I did them by myself and even beauticians thought they looked nice and professionally done.</li>
            <li> Lasts for a full two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Then add your regular polish and your good to go!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> CND is the best gel polish on the market  - some of the others are too thick and they peel off.</li>
            <li> Good price for two bottles of essential shellac items</li>
            <li> Two hours later...the top coat was VERY STICKY...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m consistanly getting a full two weeks of ware out of each application.  </li>
            <li> This product is necessary if you want shellac nails to look good.  </li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and I do my own manicures at home,.</li>
            <li> The top coat is very durable.</li>
            <li> Good products, necessary to the process for shellacking my nails.  </li>
            <li> CND have good products that last on my nails for about two weeks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford to have shellac nails done professionally, however, I&#x27;ve been able to do them easily at home with this product.  </li>
            <li> Once I get my light, we&#x27;ll find out if they work right</li>
            <li> Highly recommend ..... goes on very smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The following week, I was cooking quite a bit, since we celebrated Passover and Easter the same weekend, and my nails stayed perfect.  </li>
            <li> The first time it was fine.  </li>
            <li> But just starting out with the Royal Nail equipment, I wanted to give it the best possible chance.  </li>
            <li> I also have used incoco white nail polish tip strips for the PERFECT at home french.</li>
            <li> Without that the polish starts to chip from the end of your nail too quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t chip as quickly.</li>
            <li> CND is much more expensive, but it does give excellent results.  </li>
            <li> and they quickly responded stating that they would refund me as soon as they received the package.</li>
            <li> came quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li> and it came quick.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, legit products.</li>
            <li> Provides a quick at-home manicure</li>
            <li> My nails look shiny but natural and the shelac is more comfortable than gel nails.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and efficient.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used them several times &amp; have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> The new bottles were much better than what I received in this duo.</li>
            <li> I read some of the previous reviews- one of which gave directions (great directions by the way), and decided to buy these.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, easy to apply and use.</li>
            <li> This company mails quickly and after you purchase the initial set of all the products you need to gel your own nails, you quickly will re-coop that money rather than spending $30.00 every time you go to the salon.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> after googling that problem, i found out my mistakes and hopefully, all will be well for my 2nd experiment after i receive my light for myself for christmas!!</li>
            <li> Personally, I will stick with CND over the competitor since they hold up so much better!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too!</li>
            <li> First use and my polish is lifting within 4 days!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> I use the entire system and my nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li> they go on smooth and cure very shiny.</li>
            <li> Still I really like the CND Shellac for wear time and for smooth application.  </li>
            <li> but it went fast because of the cheap ass bottle</li>
            <li> I initially bought this because of an amazing shellac manicure I got in CT, while visiting my In-laws.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble applying them and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected good deal</li>
            <li> I give myself a manicure about every 10 days, but it&#x27;s sooo worth</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This time the top coat appears to be old.  </li>
            <li> They work perfectly along with the white tip polish and pink tinted polish.</li>
            <li> of all the brands out there, this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am one of those that like fresh polish on my nails.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth on deciding to buy the products to do my own nails at home</li>
            <li> nails look healthy, natural, just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I have already absorbed costs for lamp and polish...</li>
            <li> My nails look better than they have since I stopped having them professionally done.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> It IS a good deal to get both, if youre not interested in using color, these would be all you would need along with the lights and alcohol to finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time and love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and none are as good as CND.  </li>
            <li> Soak for 10-15 mins and the polish just scrapes right off.</li>
            <li> i needed to watch a youtube tutorial to get it completely right</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> Price was right and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Nice long wearing over 14 days .</li>
            <li> If you do your own nails, these are great base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brand &amp;#34;shallec&amp;#34; products and I find that CND Shellac lends best result and finish.</li>
            <li> The 2 for 1 is pretty good for these, as they are really expensive on their own.</li>
            <li> I have been using the CND Shellac system for a year now and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use all my new nail stuff</li>
            <li> What the add didn&#x27;t say was that you had to use a UV light to set the shellac ( at 149.00) and use a special sponge that has a plastic back ( don&#x27;t know what that</li>
            <li> My eyes are really sensitive too light now</li>
            <li> Goes on like regular polish and is so much better than gels.</li>
            <li> I wanted to spend the money I would have paid for the big size on purchasing one more Shellac color.</li>
            <li> Came fast!</li>
            <li> Exactly what you need when doing yourself shellac manicure/Pedicures.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed, TY</li>
            <li> Used it the product for the first time this week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to order more.</li>
            <li> I will more than likely buy these again.</li>
            <li> The shellac top and base coat were fresh and look great!  </li>
            <li> This set is exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> Both coats came in their boxes and where exactly as advertized.</li>
            <li> but I do like the fact that I can wear them much longer!  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than regular polish.</li>
            <li> This purchase has started chipping before the first week was complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush won&#x27;t come out and won&#x27;t go back in, and the top comes apart.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford that every two weeks, but I could afford a system that paid for itself in the first couple uses.</li>
            <li> Have been shellacking my nails for 2 years now and first time I have ordered from this company.</li>
            <li> All they need to do now is come out with a red sparkly color like &amp;#34;ruby pumps&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m all set :-)</li>
            <li> Just be aware.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I finally decided on CND.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and used regular polish then the shellac top coat.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This last much better than any store bought shellac.</li>
            <li> I actually watched it :)</li>
            <li> but it is still much better than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li> The product exactly how described.</li>
            <li> It was my first time ever using shellac</li>
            <li> I got through everything, the last step was putting on the top coat.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve been able to keep on longer than a day without it chipping.</li>
            <li> Only lasts a week for me but that says more about my nails than it does about the product.</li>
            <li> With the better back rest I would rate the kayak</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is not just any regular top coat...</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to compliment the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer that I purchased for my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> She has to have said \\&quot;I love my nails\\&quot; every 5 minutes for the last 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer</li>
            <li> Only top and bottom coat I will use with the gels.</li>
            <li> It is okay, not the final product as in the salon</li>
            <li> the key is to make sure nails are cleaned with alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to have the set in the regular size.</li>
            <li> It works great and it last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Works much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the market and lasts the full two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to find such a good deal on shellac top and base coat!</li>
            <li> If you use a LED light you should give it a little more time than you do some of the gel products</li>
            <li> The top coat was BONE DRY, the brush still soft because it had never been filled.</li>
            <li> This is the best shellac nail polish base and top coat on the market.</li>
            <li> the best for base and top.  </li>
            <li> Perfect base and top coat for your at home gel manicure.</li>
            <li> This is one of the brands my salon uses and quite frankly, I felt this base and top coat were the best.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products...needed for base and top coats of CND gels...great stuff.</li>
            <li> This base and top coat worked wonderfully!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this CND Shellac Top and Base &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; and it was a great deal!  </li>
            <li> Consistency of the top coat is quite thick which leaves bubbles on top.</li>
            <li> All coats should be nice and thin with nothing on the cuticle and make sure you swipe the ends.  </li>
            <li> get that it is a great concept dry nails immediately &amp; lasts a long time but at what cost to your health.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that after you are done applying there is NO dry time like with normal polish.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous when using these products for the first time but they delivered as promised.  </li>
            <li> The shellac products are great, I totally agree with the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> this product is much better then OPI, that product does not stay on a long time, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Having sellers willing to sell to non-professionals is very much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff it seals your polish and has a nice shine, and the base coat does a nice job protecting your nails</li>
            <li> This works with every gel and shellac I own, nice coverage on base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> After I painted my nails, I let them dry and then put on the top coat.  </li>
            <li> They do sell a bigger size which I what I recommend because you will easily go through these bottles in no time at all.</li>
            <li> If I ever need replacement I will certainly buy this product again.</li>
            <li> to soak it off (using pure acetone) though.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use and extremely durable.  </li>
            <li> Great for peeling and weak nails ...</li>
            <li> Look awesome by having the dryer hidden somewhere else or save it until she starts thinking about how she can cut a few corners to afford a UV Dryer.</li>
            <li> I got a Sephora UV light last Christmas and loved how long the color last</li>
            <li> The base &amp; top coats are great with color, or alone for a natural look but still leaving your nails strong.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the base and top coats, which you tend to run out of quickly since you use them more than regular colors.  </li>
            <li> If you are an avid CND Shellac user, I would highly recommend this set.  </li>
            <li> look like they were freshly painted for nearly two whole weeks.</li>
            <li> Really shiny and never chip or break.</li>
            <li> The soak off removal is so much faster than the gel.</li>
            <li> Just try to apply it as smooth as possible.  </li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use that much product.  </li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I always use CND products and my polish stays on for almost 3 weeks -- until my nails grow out too much.</li>
            <li> Work very well.</li>
            <li> I also want to make it known I put this product as well as the nail product on very sparingly.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very doable</li>
            <li> Continue to buy these products and really like the durability of CND Shellac for my manicure.  </li>
            <li> I continued to monitor the package and after it was confirmed back to their location, I watched my bank account for the return.</li>
            <li> I use it so much, I&#x27;ll order another set soon.</li>
            <li> I believe I received a defective product or one that is not the real thing.</li>
            <li> These are very satisfactory products</li>
            <li> I ordered the whole shellac setup on amazon.</li>
            <li> The product came on time and was very well packed</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than going to a salon</li>
            <li> High glossy shine!</li>
            <li> Having said that, I have very brittle peeling nails</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It is fast and saves money when you do it your self.</li>
            <li> I received them in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  </li>
            <li> and I really like this brand.</li>
            <li> They were shipped in a very timely manor, as well.</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> The CND top coat leaves a seriously wet looking shine.  </li>
            <li> I of course being a modern woman...</li>
            <li> but really how much can you rave about a product that just does its job.</li>
            <li> Got here fast.</li>
            <li> Items shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The trick is to cure clear coat and cure TWO layers of the regular nail polish coat then the top coat.</li>
            <li> I love that this comes as a set of 2, as you obviously need both to do a complete manicure.</li>
            <li> They give you are really good bond and finish that keeps the color on for at least a week without a scratch.</li>
            <li> Using a regular nail polish on top, I found, not only makes the polish chip free for at least a week, but it also helps my nails grow to amazing new lengths that I couldn&#x27;t get to before.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It lasts for a little over two weeks, no chipping, when you purchase this brand in a color, it is VERY true to what you see on the bottle!</li>
            <li> Over time, I started collecting polishes from other companies, mostly Gelish.</li>
            <li> It works much better than any other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited that there is finally a product I can do at home that will hold up on my nails through work!</li>
            <li> If you are just investigating the Shellac process, you will quickly realize that these are the two staples of the Shellac process and would be hard pressed to find a better price.  </li>
            <li> I Instantly ordered the Top and Base coat, now just saving to get some good CND colors :)</li>
            <li> Love the strength and mirror shine that they give may nails without being super thick.</li>
            <li> Would continue using as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> The shellac it an awesome system and the base and top coats are essential.  </li>
            <li> and I was finally able to sit down and give myself a manicure.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The polish took forever to dry even using the light.</li>
            <li> I rated 4 stars because my top coat bottle doesn&#x27;t close all the way, its odd.</li>
            <li> Will try again and make sure that I put enough of the product on the next time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands at all different prices.</li>
            <li> but the main thing is</li>
            <li> The CND Shellac Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\&quot; is a GREAT deal.</li>
            <li> The coatings are only lasting a day or two at most.</li>
            <li> I use the top and bottom coats alot, I only change color about every ten days.</li>
            <li> If high end spas use this brand that says something.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the CND line of polishes.</li>
            <li> I clean my hands all day long and they keep on shining.</li>
            <li> My right hand has begun chipping on the end that may be because I did not seal the tips a bit harder since I am right handed.</li>
            <li> To begin with I didn&#x27;t know if I could get it to turn out like when I had it done professionally since everyone told me I had to have a certain type of lamp to go with this product</li>
            <li> This set is hard to come by on Amazon, so I was thrilled that it was not thick and unusable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving up but will definitely need to go to a professional to have nails done for a special event.</li>
            <li> Works great even when you do things wrong........</li>
            <li> All you need is a small amount should last a good while.</li>
            <li> The top coat was pretty thick</li>
            <li> but now I am satisfied and don&#x27;t feel guilty if I want to change the color more often than I could afford to do if I went to a professional.</li>
            <li> Love shellac, but buying this \\&quot;set of two\\&quot; was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> When I opened the top coat box it was leaking and was also missing a brush.</li>
            <li> so far the base and top coat did the job, happy with these items.</li>
            <li> Appears to do the job, just need to make sure that you have full coverage and apply a thin coat</li>
            <li> Good but not great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not returning these because it would be more trouble than just throwing it away and going to a salon and purchase a new set.  </li>
            <li> The black nail polish looks great once dried but peels off within hours</li>
            <li> I have tried other lines, but this is the BEST top and base coat.  </li>
            <li> The base and top coats work awesome with other brands of polishes.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I am a blackjack dealer and regular nail polish just chips right off my nails in a matter of minutes from working with the blackjack chips.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply thin coats Be sure to use UV light to dry will dry to a hard and shiny finish and will last a good 2 weeks</li>
            <li> They were as I expected and haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I am not disappointed at all.  </li>
            <li> I have about 9 and am always looking for new colors to come out</li>
            <li> I live in Canada and I order it from Amazon and have it delivered in US.</li>
            <li> She used it with her new lamp and still stands by this claim.</li>
            <li> and when I should by a new one.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between Gel and Shellac, I would recommend Shellac, The Gel, you need to scrape off before you start a new set.</li>
            <li> and when I should by a new one.</li>
            <li> If you are trying to decide between Gel and Shellac, I would recommend Shellac, The Gel, you need to scrape off before you start a new set.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without shellac.</li>
            <li> The entire reason I use the UV light is to make the color last.</li>
            <li> using a regular nail polish on top, I find that the polish also dries alot faster meaning you need to work faster to spread it to an even coat on you nail, so that might be troublesome for some who go carefully along.</li>
            <li> professional quality, works really well, is easy to apply, not strong smelling and lasts for 2 weeks with the gel polish.</li>
            <li> Easy  and long lasting!</li>
            <li> It contains less product and costs more than other brands, but it is worth it if you are looking for quality vs. quantity.</li>
            <li> The CND Shellac completely revitalized my UV gel nail polish!</li>
            <li> I will most likely buy from a different seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Have only one color in shellac and it looks so pretty and shiny.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but the bottles are definitely small.</li>
            <li> so I will never waste time scraping and buffing again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same thing I was paying $20 every two weeks at the salon to get.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> No more smudged toes for me can&#x27;t wait to do my nails :)</li>
            <li> I usually use spf15 cream on my hands and wear uv gloves to be sure.  </li>
            <li> Last two weeks ;)</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Shellac Top and base coat.</li>
            <li> The boxes were a little dented but the product inside was completely fine.</li>
            <li> Small bottles last about a year when doing my nails regularly, so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Unlike the first purchase that had the correct fluid consistency, this time the top coat is thick and comes out like molasses.  </li>
            <li> I love CND base and top coat for no chip!</li>
            <li> Top coat was a little thick, otherwise both products are fine.</li>
            <li> I wish the price was lower and shipping was free on items that weigh so little.  </li>
            <li> It provides the support I need for my natural nails.</li>
            <li> I use a UV lamp to set the Shellace on my natural nails.</li>
            <li> and my manicure is totally complete with no drying time.</li>
            <li> old mothers</li>
            <li> the nail polish stays put and my nails do not turn white which can happen from too much use.</li>
            <li> &amp; I had to throw out the old because these do seem to age and not work as well after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t take the old shellac &#x27;off&#x27;</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working for me, and it thickens the tip as it grows out and gives a bit of additional strength.  </li>
            <li> Yes, occasionally, one of the tips peels off, but it doesn&#x27;t damage my nail much</li>
            <li> BUT You won&#x27;t need to apply much I will last weeks</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not getting the 2 weeks wear time</li>
            <li> If the product gets old, it gets gummy.</li>
            <li> but so far I like the CND brand</li>
            <li> I found this seller, sent an e-mail and was pleasantly surprised by the help that was given.</li>
            <li> I never tried to get a professional shellac manicure</li>
            <li> As well getting it off was a complete nighmare</li>
            <li> I must have received old product.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to be a professional.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to be a professional.</li>
            <li> Just used to replace one of my nails after having a manicure 2 weeks ago, bought everything to do a complete manicure and as yet have not done it,</li>
            <li> I decided I did not want to put the shellac on my natural nails.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I just want natural color.</li>
            <li> it does tend to lift every once in a while near the tip of the nail even though i tap the edges of the nail as recommended.  </li>
            <li> It lasts and offers for versility with nail shades.</li>
            <li> The only con is that this does not provide as much strength to my nails as gel does.</li>
            <li> Since using the shellac my nails are much stronger &amp; are all the same length.</li>
            <li> The Shellac gives me the nice thin coat I expect to get</li>
            <li> I bought the CND Shellac Top and Base Set hoping I could do my own nails.  </li>
            <li> I did notice the brush getting a little stiff but in the end the finish was just as good as the one I had done at the salon for $35.</li>
            <li> A base and top coat is necessary and these are the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34;, easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> These two make your nails look really pretty for a very long time.</li>
            <li> 1-2 coats of regular nail polish (I use Revlon quick dry).</li>
            <li> Base is great - removes cleanly without nail damage, a real advantage over other gels.</li>
            <li> Top coat brush is a little long but works.</li>
            <li> Also my bottles seem to have dried out pretty fast</li>
            <li> I have had mine for almost a year now and have used both pretty regularly and still have some left.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for almost a year now and have used both pretty regularly and still have some left.</li>
            <li> The top coat seems a little thick, but so did the first one I bought, so this may be normal.  </li>
            <li> Recommend to all ladies that like a high gloss shine that will last.  </li>
            <li> but instead just buff it down slightly and put the new on top.  </li>
            <li> However, this is the only shellac brand that I like and stays strong and doesn&#x27;t peel of a few days after application.</li>
            <li> Still, even though it is a little goopy...it still works fine overall.</li>
            <li> Also, use an LED light - not a regular UV light like CND actually unfortunately recommends.  </li>
            <li> but this is my first time using gel polish so this may be expected.</li>
            <li> I use the base coat, cure with uv lamp, add my own regular nail color, then use the top coat and cure again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to nail polish, but since purchasing this product I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s very important to use a base and top coat every time you polish your nails.  </li>
            <li> I really think I will try a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> They do what they say they should the top coat makes this tick shiny wet finish that fills in all ridges and uneven spots on the nails</li>
            <li> it &amp;#34;bounces&amp;#34; back to smooth in a few seconds</li>
            <li> Love Shellac products and buying base and top coat in a set makes sense for the usage.</li>
            <li> I love the CND base and top coat Gel polish.  </li>
            <li> I love the CND brand for base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> I love CND products, including these two base and top coats.</li>
            <li> The base and top coat shellac are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> It may be old or was not stored properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I purchased the CND Shellac Top and Base &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; when I purchased my 54 Watt Royal Nails Professional UV Light Gel and Acrilic Nail Dryer.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly it does&#x27;nt clump up or get thick or runny.</li>
            <li> Please be sure to use a thin coat.  </li>
            <li> Polish was so thick it would not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I now use the base coat, top coat, cure it and THEN regular polish on top.</li>
            <li> day nail color, high shine and zero dry time.  </li>
            <li> It made my nails so strong, and it the top and base coat lasted for two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Of course the shellac or gelish in general does not last over 3 months, but my base and top coat lasted me about 10 good months of poilishing just my nails about every 2 weeks all year round.  </li>
            <li> While the top coat is fine, the base coat bottle is defective.  </li>
            <li> Bought it thinking that I could use it directly on my nails, but alas you have to have a special machine to make it dry on your nails and the machine cost too much.  </li>
            <li> Stays on much longer than other gels.</li>
            <li> I really hope that my bottle was the only bottle that was empty</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of doing my own nails, but it gets expensive buying these individually.</li>
            <li> It does not dry well even under the lamp</li>
            <li> This base coat and top coat work tremendously well, and are required for the complete system.</li>
            <li> I had my first shellac manicure a few months ago</li>
            <li> I want paired with the special base and top coat</li>
            <li> I like IBD polish just as much for half the price and twice the amount of polish.</li>
            <li> They are thin and easy on without being &#x27;gloopy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I find the same is true with the colored polishes, Gelish are thick and tricky to apply and Shellac are thinner and easier to apply/cure.  </li>
            <li> These are a bit thick, but the product is super quality.  </li>
            <li> For my natural nails my manicure last long the bottle are smaller</li>
            <li> The brushes for the shellac were junk, half of the brush is missing, so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li> The only down side was how the top coat got so thick and goopy and ran out before the bottom coat bottle.</li>
            <li> The base coat protects your nails and the top coat hardens so quick after curing.....</li>
            <li> (my first try is pretty thick but no smudges!!).  </li>
            <li> Typically I apply the base coat, two coats of my favorite nail polish then seal with the Shellac top coat.</li>
            <li> Can I just start off by saying, I planned on using this for the traditional: base coat, nail polish coat and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;However, not every Shellac color I liked, nor did I want to have to tediously remove my whole nail</li>
            <li> I use the CND top and base and have various colors in other brands and it all mixes and binds fine.</li>
            <li> You can purchase gel base and top coats in drugstores for less cost, and they may work fine.</li>
            <li> Make sure to take off all old nail polish before applying a new base coat.</li>
            <li> Make sure to take off all old nail polish before applying a new base coat.</li>
            <li> The key is smooth thin applications and plenty of dry time in between.</li>
            <li> While using the first batch, my manicure would last at least two weeks without showing signs of chipping or pealing.  </li>
            <li> First, apply base coat, (cure), then add top coat (cure), use alchol to get off stickyness.</li>
            <li> The base coat is fine, but the top coat is a little goopy.</li>
            <li> There was dry polish on the outside of the bottle like it had been spilled over the outside edge.  </li>
            <li> The only minus is the product would not dry without the UV hand dryer which I did not have at home, so I will have to purchase that also.</li>
            <li> I think the base coat is amazing!</li>
            <li> Last 10-14 days as long as I don&#x27;t abuse my hands.</li>
            <li> Plus last so long.</li>
            <li> It also did not last as long.  </li>
            <li> My nails are very short after having long nails for years.</li>
            <li> The shellac nails don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the gel nails</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel they last as long.</li>
            <li> Each bottle last a long time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I have tried other top brands, but they all pale in comparison with CND top and base gel nail polish.</li>
            <li> They are not anywhere near as hard as gels or acrylics and my nails are soft.</li>
            <li> It works really well and last for the two weeks unless you use your hands a lot doing hard work.  </li>
            <li> The top coat is to thick and is hard to use.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look fake like Acrylic, but they look real like your real nails.</li>
            <li> 10 minutes later I&#x27;m walking around with a completely dry pedicure.  </li>
            <li> Wish you would make a two pack of each base and top since I go thru so much of it with each manicure</li>
            <li> otherwise it will be a little soft and not adhere as well as you expect.  </li>
            <li> Was a little worried it might be old or knockoff</li>
            <li> I was extremely unhappy when I went to paint on the top coat</li>
            <li> the bottles are smaller than I expected but I can understand that because of the polish thickening up.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional nail tech.  </li>
            <li> This does not stay on as long as the gels (2 wks vs up to 3)</li>
            <li> 2 wks is still a long time.  </li>
            <li> The photo shows four bottles, and this is labeled as a top and base coat &amp;#34;set of two&amp;#34; - which clearly sounds like you are getting a two sets for a total of four polishes.  </li>
            <li> The Base and To Coat was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The only problems I have with this is that the outside is black</li>
            <li> The only problems I have with this is that the outside is black</li>
            <li> I use the base coat, Cream Puff for the white tips, and the top coat - that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> The only base coat &amp; top coat I use!</li>
            <li> My order was also processed 3 times I received 1 order that I kept the other two were sent back to them</li>
            <li> and I guess I should have because it did not last any longer than any other nail polish I have used.  </li>
            <li> Give her these first and play the dumb guy \\&quot;Oh</li>
            <li> It was hard to achieve a thin coat with this top</li>
            <li> although no nail polish tends to stay on me for very long</li>
            <li> I notice the polish last far longer and is shinny for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> About 1/3 of the base coat was gone and I haven&#x27;t been able to get the stickiness completely off the bottle.  </li>
            <li> With the OPI top and base, my polish stays on for nearly two weeks.  </li>
            <li> If your skin is at all sensitive and you can&#x27;t use acrylic, gel or any other products without breaking out into itchy little bumps, this one won&#x27;t work for you either.  </li>
            <li> The base coat has a clear short brush and the top coat has a longer black bristled brush.</li>
            <li> This is my first shellac, and I must say I&#x27;m addicted.  </li>
            <li> Goes a little bit too fast, but the bottles are small.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t last as long as I would hope, a little thicker than I think they should be.</li>
            <li> The coats dry down to thin hard shellac coats that I love.</li>
            <li> The gold label is not the same color as previous bottles I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I always had an extra set of these products on hand to replace previous bottles when they are gone.</li>
            <li> It spreads thinly and smoothly like an ordinary nail polish, does not shrink or become clumpy dries up in 2 minutes using a 36 watts UV dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(That&#x27;s half the size of a regular polish)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, they felt dry, a little sticky, and when I woke up lint and dust were stuck to all of my  nails.  </li>
            <li> When using this as a base and top coat my nails last twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that when the base coat needs replaced, you may as well replace the top coat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to only give a 3 * rating as I&#x27;m not certain if it is the base and top coat or the nail dryer; however, it takes forever to dry taking me hours to get my nails somewhat dry.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to walk around being careful not to touch any time.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Product works as expected once instructions are followed.</li>
            <li> Both were what I expected and I have had not problems with either product.</li>
            <li> I really like the Shellac brand for ONE reason: they are so thin.  </li>
            <li> this helps!be troublesome for some who go carefully along.</li>
            <li> All together I spent about what it would cost me to have the salon do my nails 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> Came delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> Were what I expected.</li>
            <li> I used to get my nails polished with this base and top coat and color of course and it would last 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The top and base coats last about three weeks on my nail.</li>
            <li> Buy ONE brand of base, color and top coat, or you will have problems with chipping and wear, because the chemicals are different and they don&#x27;t work together.  </li>
            <li> And then I switched to a different base and top coat.  </li>
            <li> I order this CND Shellac Top &amp; Base Coat the same day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of gel and/or shelac base and top coats...</li>
            <li> I was looking for Shellac base &amp; top coat at a relatively inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li> This is actually just two polishes - one top and one base - and they can be found for cheaper is bought separately.  </li>
            <li> I use the base coat, UV lamp, top coat, UV lamp, wipe the sticky stuff off with alcohol, and then apply my regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done at least 20 manicures and the bottles are still at least half full.</li>
            <li> I know that they need to be dark and black so that the product isn&#x27;t ruined with light/sunlight, but still I wanted to mention my only quip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know that they need to be dark and black so that the product isn&#x27;t ruined with light/sunlight, but still I wanted to mention my only quip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The base and top coats work SO well, are extremely shiny, and for me personally last about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> This base and top coat lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This base and top coat lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> No more countless hours and dollars with the nail technician.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> I bought the set to bundle with other CND colors that I purchased.</li>
            <li> I use other gel polishes.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand to other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it will hold up as well as 100% shellac all the way through - but it works well enough for at home.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use any other Gel polish.</li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED OTHER UV PRODUCTS AND NONE COMPARE WITH CND.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stay on like other products.  </li>
            <li> You may be hesitant due to the price</li>
            <li> The formula does have a stronger odor than other brands while applying and does not give the shine of my other brand</li>
            <li> Works well with other gel brands including gellish with no problems.</li>
            <li> However, I ordered this online along with two other items.  </li>
            <li> Now I have to find out what other colors it comes in.</li>
            <li> Have been using with my other CND products for over two months now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> All the other girls at work are swearing by this stuff, and saying it holds up just as well as acrylic.</li>
            <li> I tried these out using directions from other reviews.</li>
            <li> The base coat is thin but top coat seems much thicker.</li>
            <li> Base and top coat formulas get very sticky and become difficult to use after a few months of being left on tee shelf.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase, my nails got very soft and broke off.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this item was a little expensive until I looked at other products and</li>
            <li> This set is cheaper than all other base - top sets.</li>
            <li> After drying, it&#x27;s a little wet to the touch, but</li>
            <li> Buying this duo saves on average about $10.  </li>
            <li> I had not used my card for at least 6 months prior to these purchases</li>
            <li> I am just an average gal.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get it done again but having this manicure done in the salon was just to expensive.  </li>
            <li> I like this base and top coat.</li>
            <li> I felt like the base and top coat that came with this kit had lost its umph.</li>
            <li> Top coat and base coat for the use of CND shellac.  </li>
            <li> I use CND Shellac Top and Base all the time.</li>
            <li> For durability I prefer CND Top and Base.</li>
            <li> The CND Shellac Top and Base coat for nails was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 cnd shellac polishes with the base and top coat for myself for christmas.  </li>
            <li> but when I got them I realized that this is probably not a great buy as far as price is concerned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Shellac and Gelish top and base coat.  </li>
            <li> The base coat had no issues and was pleased with that bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried the sandwich technique (which is when you use the base coat, non-shellac nail polish color and then the top coat), which worked sometimes, but it has the tendency to bunch up when the coats weren&#x27;t done properly/sealed.</li>
            <li> As the description says, it is a base and top coat that you need for the shellac manicure.</li>
            <li> Also, I just used the base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Already made once my shellac nails with the Top and Base of CND.</li>
            <li> After months I gave up and ordered the OPI top and base -</li>
            <li> I wonder if anyone has found any difference between  this and the UV base and top coat?  </li>
            <li> It takes hours to harden both the base and the top coat.  </li>
            <li> I tried the larger size before but it got too thick before I finished it.</li>
            <li> Along with the top and base coat , I brought the polish and curing lamp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CND Shellac top, base, &amp; polish for about a month now.</li>
            <li> It saves her time and money as these coats would be $30 dollars per visit at the nail salon down the block from her house.</li>
            <li> I am experimenting a little with other gel brands for color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they outshine the competition (pun Intended!)</li>
            <li> these can be used with other brands polish???thank you!</li>
            <li> I opted for this one because it was less money</li>
            <li> and i think i am half way through.</li>
            <li> Had previously been opened.  </li>
            <li> but on the plus side it is less damaging on the nail than the gels.  </li>
            <li> but this base and top coat has lasted longer than the other cheaper gel formulas I had used in the past.  </li>
            <li> My nails always peel and flake but as long as I paint them with shellac every 2 weeks they stay hard as rocks.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> Product was not full.  </li>
            <li> There was not a full 2 weeks of wear, In fact I was luck to get 2 days of wear before the product started to lift from my nail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now finally getting some length to my otherwise weak and wimpy nails ...</li>
            <li> so you can save a little money.</li>
            <li> or so I bitting to polish off a little at a time.</li>
            <li> And at the end of the process I just used a little non acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li> YES its still supposed to be a little tacky after curing(instructions say 10, but i do 30).  </li>
            <li> Wound up being usable only for about 3 manicures, then got so bad I had to toss them and buy new ones (bought them separately from another distributor).</li>
            <li> I had horrible wrinking of the white with the UV light.  </li>
            <li> Seems they should have been packed in a small box with the lids securely tightened instead of a padded envelope :(</li>
            <li> When applied with a thin color between, the manicure can last 3+weeks.</li>
            <li> Only a thin coat is needed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Waste of $30.</li>
            <li> the only thing i was not happy with was the seller.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, I&#x27;m just out the money because Amazon considers them hazardous waste and won&#x27;t take a return on them.</li>
            <li> The base coat was tacky and made the first layer of color dry gloppy.</li>
            <li> I find that using this as a base, this makes my nails strong and hard to break.</li>
            <li> The back rests are less than useless.</li>
            <li> Both the top and base coats were very thick and gummy and dried on the brush.</li>
            <li> Peels off after a few days not pleased with this product for the price I paid wont get it again.</li>
            <li> The top coat now has little goop balls in there where the polish has congealed, it&#x27;s VERY annoying.</li>
            <li> I just wish that its removable is less complex than the existing practice.</li>
            <li> I like the cnd version of the top and base coat but please please follow the direction when they say a thin coat</li>
            <li> If ever it gets a little dull from soaps/hand lotions, etc.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow....  </li>
            <li> they mean it please don&#x27;t over due it because the shellac will be too thick after you are finish.</li>
            <li> They usually breal and split and crack and cause me severe pain on my nail tips.</li>
            <li> I use gel polish and this is Shellac so not sure if that is the problem???  </li>
            <li> The bottles are really small for $30 dollars.</li>
            <li> I read the information and knew these would be small bottles</li>
            <li> but the bottle are too small.</li>
            <li> Usually lasts between 10 to 14 days.</li>
            <li> It work well but its too small</li>
            <li> IF you&#x27;re not sure how to do this you should look at a YouTube tutorial, there are plenty out there.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive to do this regularly at the salon</li>
            <li> With the shellac, I just file down the cuticle area and rub with alcohol and you are ready for your base coat.</li>
            <li> With the shellac, I just file down the cuticle area and rub with alcohol and you are ready for your base coat.</li>
            <li> I only received the base nail polish, not a double pack and paid over 30 bucks basically for one item.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this top and base coat</li>
            <li> I have tried other gel base coats and this one is by far the easiest to remove.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are negative reviews for this.</li>
            <li> The Gelish base and top coat that I have are very thick and its hard to get a thin coat.  </li>
            <li> I got.&lt;br /&gt;I want to know why it is so hard to find the ingredients in this product?</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your nails hard, but keeps them flexible.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hard on my nails and have to wash my hands and use sanitizer all the time because of my job in healthcare</li>
            <li> that is hard too</li>
            <li> After about 12 uses the base coat still works fine though it can do this weird thing where immediately after you put it on, it starts spreading and makes gaps.</li>
            <li> Thick coats spill over the side of your nail, dry, and are impossible to file down.  </li>
            <li> My nails have grown like crazy and I actually have to file them.</li>
            <li> I split the cost with a friend and we&#x27;ve done our nails at least once a month each</li>
            <li> But at least it&#x27;s still liquid.  </li>
            <li> Stays shiney and lasts at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> The Shellac I used two time and it started to get really thick and stringy.</li>
            <li> I ordered arrived leaking and is too thick to use.  </li>
            <li> I prefer a formula that isn&#x27;t quite as thick.  </li>
            <li> but it worked perfectly so no more worries!</li>
            <li> &quot; \\&quot;What do you mean you can&#x27;t just use these on their own\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Thick coats become full of bubbles while they cure and are just terrible.  </li>
            <li> I cannot give it any less than a 5 star because it would be unfair.  </li>
            <li> Little difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> Take my word I learned the hard way!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave nails brittle or weak.</li>
            <li> Bottles are small but, for this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> Have had no issue with it damaging my nails and much less expensive than going to a salon!</li>
            <li> Not happy with this set.</li>
            <li> My nails also get damaged and broken at work.</li>
            <li> , I just wash them, press back my cuticles, shape nails, etc.), paint base coat, cure for two minutes</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s frustrating that I cannot use my stuff.</li>
            <li> you lose a very thin layer of your nail and after a while you will notice your nails start to thin and break all the time.&lt;br /&gt;as</li>
            <li> After using this one I threw my other base coats in the trash</li>
            <li> Customer service is rude, unpleasant, and unwilling to help with any issue.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just doing it wrong</li>
            <li> The product is fake, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as stated.</li>
            <li> I know I was unable to find it anywhere else at this price.</li>
            <li> I ordered my product and received the wrong thing</li>
            <li> Buy CND or expect poor results!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using these products, but I&#x27;m not anymore.</li>
            <li> something&#x27;s wrong with the bottles lid</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to do something about my nails after years of abuse with the fake nails.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Did nails every two weeks and the two hottles lasted a year without getting unable to use.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You have to apply very thin layer and brush off excess or any visible bubbles before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure what the problem was with base coat.</li>
            <li> My bad</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel bad either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try the cheaper versions of this from out of country, you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Base coat.</li>
            <li> Base coat again.</li>
            <li> I put on the base coat, put it in a UV lamp I bought as well, for like 10 minutes (each hand).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend getting the base coat, I never used that.</li>
            <li> Another bottle of shellac base coat</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend if you want the Shellac nails, but hate the salon price.</li>

            <li> The base coat didn&#x27;t seem to bind well to my nail.  </li>
            <li> and they have looked like crap for weeks</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using Shellac colors without their base and topcoat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I got mine from a bad batch!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My skin broke out and my fingers and cuticles looked horrible for 3 weeks afterwards.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is so much better than the gel formula I was using.</li>
            <li> I bought CND because I knew it was a top brand. While I like the quality and the lasting ability for wear, the bottles are TINY for the price. I like IBD polish just as much for half the price and twice the amount of polish. When these bottles run out I will switch to IBD.</li>
            <li> I like this base and top coat. It goes on smoothly it does&#x27;nt clump up or get thick or runny. It prepares the color application very nicely. It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> No more countless hours and dollars with the nail technician. It provides the support I need for my natural nails. They look great.&lt;br /&gt;Downside. Remove can damage your nail.</li>
            <li> This is a very good brand of gel. I recently bought this whole line, my clients are very happy with the outcome of their nails!</li>
            <li> Trying my own gel/shellac nails at home. After further reading, I realized the shellac is easier to remove. I can still use my gel nail polish colours, but use the bottom and top shellac products. Works great. It takes a time or two to get proficient at the process, but I like the hours and prices better here (at home).</li>
            <li> Its a very very good product. My friend did manicure in my hand and she use shellac. Really shiny and never chip or break. I love it</li>
            <li> The brushes for the shellac were junk, half of the brush is missing, so the nail polish doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gelish nail polish for about a year and decided to try the CND Shellac. The soak off removal is so much faster than the gel. It runs about the same price as Gelish. I&#x27;ve also found that if I want to do nail art I don&#x27;t have any problem with the art layer bleeding as I did with gel.</li>
            <li> I got a Sephora UV light last Christmas and loved how long the color last but as time went on I noticed that color that would last three weeks was now only going three days without chipping. The entire reason I use the UV light is to make the color last. I felt like the base and top coat that came with this kit had lost its umph. I started poking around the net and found CND had the best reviews when it came to UV gel nails. While $30 seemed like a lot to spend on two bottles I justified by buy in that that was only one trip to the nail salon. The CND Shellac completely revitalized my UV gel nail polish! It now stays on three weeks without a chip! Money well spent! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Good Deal. Lasts quite a while. Helps shellac or gel last up to 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I purchased after watching nail tech put this on me.  I paid $35 a pop for each gel srt, now I&#x27;m getting about 20+ nail treatmenthis in both bottles combined.  Wouldn&#x27;t change it for the world.</li>
            <li> Love Shellac products and buying base and top coat in a set makes sense for the usage.</li>
            <li> Nice long wearing over 14 days .</li>
            <li> This polish is wonderful, it stays on very wll all week without chipping.</li>
            <li> You can purchase gel base and top coats in drugstores for less cost, and they may work fine. But just starting out with the Royal Nail equipment, I wanted to give it the best possible chance.  This is what professional nail salons use, so I went with these products, am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do my own nails at home and this has been a great tool. I use a UV lamp to set the Shellace on my natural nails. Typically I apply the base coat, two coats of my favorite nail polish then seal with the Shellac top coat. Voila...under 10 minutes and my manicure is totally complete with no drying time. I love it!</li>
            <li> These are a bit thick, but the product is super quality.  Just try to apply it as smooth as possible.  When applied with a thin color between, the manicure can last 3+weeks.</li>
            <li> I finally figured out my eyelid swelling is coming from the CND shellac manicure I got.&lt;br /&gt;I want to know why it is so hard to find the ingredients in this product? I found a blog while searching that reported how safe it is because it sits on your nails and isn&#x27;t absorbed into your skin. Well what the heck does that mean?&lt;br /&gt;Also I might add that I am a licensed cosmetologist who works at a hair &amp; nail salon. So Yes the proper procedure was followed.&lt;br /&gt;I asked the manager what the ingredients were, she didn&#x27;t know. All I can find is how safe it is &amp; how it has no formaldehyde in it.&lt;br /&gt;I get that it is a great concept dry nails immediately &amp; lasts a long time but at what cost to your health.&lt;br /&gt;My vision has been effected from it as well. My eyes are really sensitive too light now &amp; I was &amp; still am getting migraines from it. So beware</li>
            <li> Top coat and base coat for the use of CND shellac.  You must have these products to make the color products work.  CND brand is the best.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this item was a little expensive until I looked at other products and the price is about the same. the bottles are smaller than I expected but I can understand that because of the polish thickening up. My nails have grown like crazy and I actually have to file them. They usually breal and split and crack and cause me severe pain on my nail tips. I did my 93 yr. old mothers and she is thrilled with them she has the same problem with spliting and cracking and chipping. I am going to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish out there if you&#x27;re using a light. Goes on like regular polish and is so much better than gels.</li>
            <li> I boughed them year ago, it doesn&#x27;t work for me or I&#x27;m just doing it wrong</li>
            <li> CND shellac is a great product. My nails always peel and flake but as long as I paint them with shellac every 2 weeks they stay hard as rocks. My favorite part is that after you are done applying there is NO dry time like with normal polish. You don&#x27;t have to walk around being careful not to touch any time.  LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> These two products have been great!  I can&#x27;t afford to have shellac nails done professionally, however, I&#x27;ve been able to do them easily at home with this product.  The price for the two pack was a great deal!  I&#x27;m now finally getting some length to my otherwise weak and wimpy nails ... love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was told this would last 2 weeks-it did. Actually it stayed on longer. I had to work getting it off with the acetone. Which was a pain. But I love it. It stays looking nice for two weeks. No chips. Very durable. It is waaay better than polish!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> I bought the set to bundle with other CND colors that I purchased. I have a set already from the CND Starter Kit. This is a great price for what you get. I was debating between this set of two and the larger set. I opted for this one because it was less money and I have short nails so I don&#x27;t use that much product.  I wanted to spend the money I would have paid for the big size on purchasing one more Shellac color. The delivery was fast. It has a 5-7 day arrival window and I received it in 3. I will go for the larger two pack when I run out of this product.</li>
            <li> I love the CND base and top coat Gel polish.  Polish flows on smooth and looks good as a clear coat without colored polish.</li>
            <li> I used to get my nails polished with this base and top coat and color of course and it would last 2 weeks. I purchased this and it fell off the very next day. I was able to peel this off and if you know anything about gel polish, the next day is the bottom of the barrel in terms of length of wear. I&#x27;m wondering if I got mine from a bad batch! Anyhow, I&#x27;m not looking to repurchase!</li>
            <li> I had a manicure recently where they used the CND gel.  The following week, I was cooking quite a bit, since we celebrated Passover and Easter the same weekend, and my nails stayed perfect.  Since then, I have purchased the products to use at home, and the result is not as good as the salon, but I think I don&#x27;t give it enough time to cure.</li>
            <li> fast delivery ,great product!  thank you</li>
            <li> I use CND Shellac Top and Base all the time. Even hen I use other gel polishes. I notice the polish last far longer and is shinny for at least two weeks. For durability I prefer CND Top and Base.</li>
            <li> I always use CND products and my polish stays on for almost 3 weeks -- until my nails grow out too much.</li>
            <li> Work very well. I&#x27;ve been loving my &amp;#34;shellac&amp;#34; nails. They are thin and easy on without being &#x27;gloopy&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I just started doing my own shellac nails and I love the cnd product line. These are easy to use and stay on until I want to take them off. The bundle buy was much more affordable then buying separately. I will definitely buy these again when I run out.</li>
            <li> The Base and To Coat was a good deal.  I plan to make a purchase again only in a larger size because I do my nails every two to three weeks.  These products help your color stay on longer.</li>
            <li> CND is the best shellac polish in my opinion.  Lasts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hesitant to only give a 3 * rating as I&#x27;m not certain if it is the base and top coat or the nail dryer; however, it takes forever to dry taking me hours to get my nails somewhat dry.  Then, it smudges!  I also want to make it known I put this product as well as the nail product on very sparingly.  I use gel polish and this is Shellac so not sure if that is the problem???  I&#x27;m not giving up but will definitely need to go to a professional to have nails done for a special event.</li>
            <li> I prefer this brand to other brands. I just wish they would be more competitive with their pricing.</li>
            <li> All cnd products have been great so far.  I have about 9 and am always looking for new colors to come out</li>
            <li> Conditions my nails and makes my polish last 2-3 weeks without chips.</li>
            <li> Came fast! Love this product!</li>
            <li> professional quality, works really well, is easy to apply, not strong smelling and lasts for 2 weeks with the gel polish.</li>
            <li> clumpy,thick,hard to use</li>
            <li> Good product! Good deal!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Got gelish and don&#x27;t care for it at all!</li>
            <li> I love the CND Shellac products.  I wish the price was lower and shipping was free on items that weigh so little.  I will continue to order because I love the product.  It came fast, wrapped well, not damaged and good quality so I give them 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Purchased these two items as a set for use when shellacking my nails.  Both of them appear to be of great quality and were a great price!</li>
            <li> good quality. fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, its all I will use for home shellac manicures. It IS a good deal to get both, if youre not interested in using color, these would be all you would need along with the lights and alcohol to finish!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would most certainly recommend and would buy again!</li>
            <li> Great for summer toes!</li>
            <li> The CND Shellac Top and Base coat for nails was just what I was looking for. I have used this product for a long time and love it!</li>
            <li> These two make your nails look really pretty for a very long time. Goes on smooth and dries very nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a total shellac newbie. I got this because it was an amazon deal with my royal nails UV lamp. I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase - In 3 manicures it will have paid for itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some good luck with the sandwich technique of regular nail polish - if you have patience. I buffed and prepped my nails and cuticle. Ph bond. Base coat. Cure 10 secs. 1-2 coats of regular nail polish (I use Revlon quick dry). Base coat again. Cure 10 secs. Then two coats of shellac, cure 2 mins each and wipe with alcohol after each prep. The key is smooth thin applications and plenty of dry time in between. I&#x27;m not sure if it will hold up as well as 100% shellac all the way through - but it works well enough for at home. I think with practice it&#x27;s very doable (my first try is pretty thick but no smudges!!).  I also have used incoco white nail polish tip strips for the PERFECT at home french.</li>
            <li> Exactly what you need when doing yourself shellac manicure/Pedicures. The base coat protects your nails and the top coat hardens so quick after curing..... you can wash your dishes ASAP! If my nails didn&#x27;t grow out I wouldn&#x27;t have to do again for a month.. :)</li>
            <li> Shellac Gel Polish works beautifully with the UV machine. Only a thin coat is needed. Dries quickly and produces a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> Shellac is a wonderful product and a must-try for nail fanatics. It genuinely stays chip-free for 14 days and is wayyyy shinier than any nail polish you can purchase in the store or from a salon.  Shellac is also wonderful because you can paint over it with regular nail polish and then remove the polish with non-acetone remover without damaging the Shellac! I do my own Shellac manicures at my home. The supplies can be a little pricey (light, base/top coat, color, etc) and it takes a time or two to perfect the technique, but at $20+ per Shellac manicure at a salon, it quickly pays itself off. I would truly recommend Shellac to any woman!!</li>
            <li> The top and base coats last about three weeks on my nail. Happy with this product. Would buy this brand .</li>
            <li> i do my nails every 2-3 weeks and these 2 bottles have lasted a year and i think i am half way through. a great investment. the nail polish stays put and my nails do not turn white which can happen from too much use. just remember not to scratch the paint off but to use the nail polish remove to remove it otherwise everytime you scratch the nail polish off you lose a very thin layer of your nail and after a while you will notice your nails start to thin and break all the time.&lt;br /&gt;as the time goes by and the product becomes thicker I decided to drop a couple of drops of nail polish remover in them to dilute them and make them easier to use (this happened after about 7-8 months) and now I think they probably have another 5 months of life. amazing product.</li>
            <li> My friend had just a CND Shellac light from her mom for Christmas so I got her these so of course she could do her nails and mine too.</li>
            <li> These are great with the uv dryer.  I combine gels and shellacs with no problem.  Please be sure to use a thin coat.  Thick coats spill over the side of your nail, dry, and are impossible to file down.  Also remember to polish under the tip of your nail to make a seal all around the tip.  Without that the polish starts to chip from the end of your nail too quickly.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t use any other Gel polish. Doesn&#x27;t ruin your nails.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect.  I live in Canada and I order it from Amazon and have it delivered in US. I recommend this to all the women who wants to have beautiful nails.</li>
            <li> You need the UV hand dryer in order to use this product.  I have to purchase one.  I had my nails done on a cruise and they used this product. It made my nails so strong, and it the top and base coat lasted for two weeks.  I was told by the cruise nail technician that you could not buy this product anywhere, but I found it at Amazon.  Great work Amazon.  The only minus is the product would not dry without the UV hand dryer which I did not have at home, so I will have to purchase that also.</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed, TY</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this is a star if I had the option. The company making this product is a joke. Customer service is rude, unpleasant, and unwilling to help with any issue. The product is fake, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as stated. Don&#x27;t waste your time and look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Received the product on time as listed. Used it the product for the first time this week. All you need is a small amount should last a good while. The top coat was pretty thick but this is my first time using gel polish so this may be expected. I polished my nails last Saturday and they still look great.well my left hand does. My right hand has begun chipping on the end that may be because I did not seal the tips a bit harder since I am right handed. Will try again and make sure that I put enough of the product on the next time. Will post a photo later.</li>
            <li> great product&#x3D;same  brand &amp; bottle size &amp;look that the salon I went to uses. Great product. love getting &amp;#34;salon&amp;#34; manicure with &amp;#34;at home&amp;#34; price and convenience.</li>
            <li> The shellac works great and came just as pictured. The boxes were a little dented but the product inside was completely fine. I use the CND top and base and have various colors in other brands and it all mixes and binds fine. Works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it but she was excited.  She loves the colors and says it is a quality product, so it must be true.</li>
            <li> arrived ahead of time. but the machine i ordered is not the best one as it turned out... so back to regular nailpolish</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no pro when it comes to nail polish, but since purchasing this product I&#x27;ve learned it&#x27;s very important to use a base and top coat every time you polish your nails.  It helps protect the polish and gives your nails a finished look.  I&#x27;m definitely going to order more.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous when using these products for the first time but they delivered as promised.  I had no trouble applying them and am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Always good quality and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product worked fantastic, no chipping or peeling for over 2 weeks, My nails look great and they are much stronger. AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Buying this duo saves on average about $10.  If you are an avid CND Shellac user, I would highly recommend this set.  You need both items to properly perform the Shellac process.  If you are just investigating the Shellac process, you will quickly realize that these are the two staples of the Shellac process and would be hard pressed to find a better price.  I know I was unable to find it anywhere else at this price.</li>
            <li> Received this product quickly and it works beautifully.  It was a great price also.  This set is hard to come by on Amazon, so I was thrilled that it was not thick and unusable.</li>
            <li> when you are doing your own gel manicures, it is important to have quality product.  I have tried other lines, but this is the BEST top and base coat.  Don&#x27;t chip as quickly.</li>
            <li> THIS IS MY THIRD SET OF CND BASE/TOP COAT  SHELLAC SET. I TRUY BELIEVE THAT CND MAKE THE BEST UV PRODUCTS. I HAVE TRIED OTHER UV PRODUCTS AND NONE COMPARE WITH CND. BELLA RYAN</li>
            <li> I put on the base coat, put it in a UV lamp I bought as well, for like 10 minutes (each hand).  My nails were still sticky.  I tried air drying them for another 10 minutes before painting them.  After I painted my nails, I let them dry and then put on the top coat.  I put them in the UV light for literally 15 minutes (each hand).  They were still sticky.  I tried using a fan, air drying, everything my nails were still sticky.  So, I just sat there for literally an hour waiting on my nails to try.  Finally, they felt dry, a little sticky, and when I woke up lint and dust were stuck to all of my  nails.  What a nightmare.  I have no idea what they use at the nail shop but this did not work.  $30 I can&#x27;t get back.</li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow....  CND Shellac products are fantastic.  I use the base coat, Cream Puff for the white tips, and the top coat - that&#x27;s it! (I don&#x27;t bother with the pink because I am very fair complected.)  Also, use an LED light - not a regular UV light like CND actually unfortunately recommends.  I had horrible wrinking of the white with the UV light.  I am not a professional nail tech.  I am just a regular person, getting great results from a great product and saving a fortune over what I was spending at the salon.  Also, I have used both CND and Gelish products - CND wears longer for me.  Some salons try to mix the products - you can NOT do that!!  I think they do it on purpose to get you to come back faster!!  Buy ONE brand of base, color and top coat, or you will have problems with chipping and wear, because the chemicals are different and they don&#x27;t work together.  CND is the brand for me!!</li>
            <li> My wife swears by this brand as being the best. She used it with her new lamp and still stands by this claim. Recommended for all!</li>
            <li> Works great even when you do things wrong........just be aware that these are the small bottles.  Great if you are just starting out with Shellac nails.</li>
            <li> Great deal on the set, good service from the seller, and I love the brand too.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the longevity of it on my nails. Last 10-14 days as long as I don&#x27;t abuse my hands.</li>
            <li> The pair of polishes had a problem. The base coat was tacky and made the first layer of color dry gloppy. The top coat performed great. Not sure what the problem was with base coat.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product!! Shipping was super fast and the product worked PERFECT!! I can now do at home shellac manicures...thank you!!</li>
            <li> You need these two polishes if you use the Shellac system. They do sell a bigger size which I what I recommend because you will easily go through these bottles in no time at all.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for the size and brand.  I love it!  I will more than likely buy these again.</li>
            <li> The shellac products are great, I totally agree with the other reviewers.  However these weren&#x27;t shipped properly because the package came leaking all over the place and it is STICKY STUFF! About 1/3 of the base coat was gone and I haven&#x27;t been able to get the stickiness completely off the bottle.  Seems they should have been packed in a small box with the lids securely tightened instead of a padded envelope :(</li>
            <li> Love the product. Wish you would make a two pack of each base and top since I go thru so much of it with each manicure</li>
            <li> Love the Shellac manicures.  Will continue to buy &amp; use this product.  I purchased this product over a year ago &amp; I had to throw out the old because these do seem to age and not work as well after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Continue to buy these products and really like the durability of CND Shellac for my manicure.  Small bottles last about a year when doing my nails regularly, so this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> My initial experience doing gel nails at home was with CND shellac.  Over time, I started collecting polishes from other companies, mostly Gelish. (I do love sparkles!)  And then I switched to a different base and top coat.  They simply did not work as well as CND.  CND is much more expensive, but it does give excellent results.  I get a beautiful shiny finish that lasts a good 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised and on time.</li>
            <li> this product is much better then OPI, that product does not stay on a long time, I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I am a nurse and this nail polish does not come off with the alcohol based sanitizer that we use. I clean my hands all day long and they keep on shining.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have been using these with non-Shellac brands of gel polish and it still works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This UV cured gel nail polish is a great product.  It stays on for 2 weeks!  CND Vinylux is also a great alternative if you don&#x27;t have a UV lamp.</li>
            <li> The Shellac I used two time and it started to get really thick and stringy. The bottles are really small for $30 dollars. don&#x27;t waste your money!!! My order was also processed 3 times I received 1 order that I kept the other two were sent back to them and my money was never refunded... Don&#x27;t buy from this company</li>
            <li> I ordered my product and received the wrong thing so I sent it back. When I mailed it back, I paid to track my product. It took longer than necessary to reach the seller so I sent them an email advising them that it was on its way back and they quickly responded stating that they would refund me as soon as they received the package. I continued to monitor the package and after it was confirmed back to their location, I watched my bank account for the return. I didn&#x27;t see it after about 10 days after they had received the package so I sent an email. I didn&#x27;t get a response so I sent 2 more. I still haven&#x27;t heard back from them and I have not been refunded either. I am now without the product I wanted and I haven&#x27;t received a refund. These people are crooks, don&#x27;t order from them!</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t stay on like other products.  Very disappointed.  It peels off in just 1 week.  Not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> It has worked out fine. I am glad I ordered 2 sets.</li>
            <li> Bought it thinking that I could use it directly on my nails, but alas you have to have a special machine to make it dry on your nails and the machine cost too much.  So I gave it to a beauty salon that has a machine.  Shouldn&#x27;t have bought it!</li>
            <li> Great deal, can&#x27;t live without it. Shipped safely and securely.</li>
            <li> If you do your own nails, these are great base and top coats.  You will need to use a UV light for these to work correctly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  Stays on much longer than other gels.</li>
            <li> The shellac top and base coat were fresh and look great!  Coupled with the UV dryer, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the CND Shellac Nail System.  The polish stays on your nails for two weeks, and stays shiny.  This base coat and top coat work tremendously well, and are required for the complete system.</li>
            <li> Using this with the CND Shellac color and the CND lamp I have salon nails in minutes at home for a fraction of the salon price.  I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> Great shipping and no hassle. Frat product. No complaints. Would definitely buy again and would recommend to anyone. Uv much better than led</li>
            <li> Great colour, great coverage, works much better than the generic brands out there.  There is only one Shellac brand.  Buy CND or expect poor results!</li>
            <li> Product was not full.  Had previously been opened.  There was dry polish on the outside of the bottle like it had been spilled over the outside edge.  Polish was so thick it would not go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great brand and perfect product for shelllac/gel nails.</li>
            <li> I have never bought this type of product before. My daughter got it for Easter. It works just how we thought it should!</li>
            <li> Its an expensive product, but I&#x27;ve used it so many times. I split the cost with a friend and we&#x27;ve done our nails at least once a month each and we still have product left. I have already ordered more</li>
            <li> works well with the gel nail polish that I bought, smells better that the BMC top coat I bought.</li>
            <li> This set is exactly as described.  They are easy to use, and easy to take off.  I love this brand.</li>
            <li> Easy  and long lasting! Beautiful and I love it so much I&#x27;ll only buy cnd products ever again my fave</li>
            <li> I love this shellac more than gel polish, and it really does come off with no damage to your nails</li>
            <li> These are awesome but, I wish they were cheaper...I paid about $15 for each bottle</li>
            <li> The base coat is fine, but the top coat is a little goopy. It may be old or was not stored properly. Still, even though it is a little goopy...it still works fine overall. I will most likely buy from a different seller in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product-great value!! Love the way this goes on, stays on and looks. Definitely saves a lot of money from going to the salon!</li>
            <li> Great product, it works great with all colors of shellac polish.  Using this with the dryer has saved me 100&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I order this CND Shellac Top &amp; Base Coat the same day I order the Shellac CND UV Lamp. I received this product but I DID NOT RECEIVED THE CND UV LAMP!</li>
            <li> This is the best shellac nail polish base and top coat on the market. This is the only brand that I use. It can last up to 3 weeks. I have tried many different brands at all different prices. You may be hesitant due to the price but well worth it.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 cnd shellac polishes with the base and top coat for myself for christmas.  i also bought the royal nail uv lamp dryer and they all worked well together.  plus, i also bought the royal nail uv protected glove.  so far so good.  there are many tips on the reviews of the royal nail dryer, which is very helpful.  and, this nail polish tended to shrink under the light.  after googling that problem, i found out my mistakes and hopefully, all will be well for my 2nd experiment after i receive my light for myself for christmas!!</li>
            <li> Good base and top coat ,works excellent together. Lasts a week , comes off very easily. Doesn&#x27;t make your nails hard, but keeps them flexible.</li>
            <li> First time ordering shellac and this was a great purchase.  I will be ordering more when this runs out.  Good Deal!</li>
            <li> This works with every gel and shellac I own, nice coverage on base and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;Because I use it so much, I&#x27;ll order another set soon.</li>
            <li> If high end spas use this brand that says something.  They will all tell you this is the # 1 brand to use.</li>
            <li> came quickly and as advertised</li>
            <li> I will not use anything else but CND Shellac. I have been using this for over 4 months and my nails are beautiful. This shellac stays on and I forget to use gloves all the time when I clean, garden, weed, work with my horses, etc. and they still stay on.</li>
            <li> I believe I received a defective product or one that is not the real thing. The gold label is not the same color as previous bottles I have purchased. I contacted the seller over a week ago and I have not heard a word from them.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Last over a week but the main thing is I seldom  have to my soak my mails to get off.  Just find a corner&lt;br /&gt;and lift off.  Polish last longer.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected good deal</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this product!</li>
            <li> I like how these go on together, they last a good amount of time and unlike gel, I cannot peel them off and that&#x27;s a plus! The only down side was how the top coat got so thick and goopy and ran out before the bottom coat bottle. But overall, I will order these again.</li>
            <li> love these.  they go on smooth and cure very shiny. I will continue to use them in the future, They work perfectly with Blusky colors so you can save a little money.</li>
            <li> I love CND.  It was great that this came in a set and it came quick.  No problems whatsoever. Try it.</li>
            <li> I no longer go to a beauty salon for manicure&#x27;s every two weeks!  Freedom and beauty!  I now &#x27;choose&#x27; to go every 2-3 months for &#x27;pampering&#x27; instead of for &#x27;maintenance&#x27;.  I love the freedom!  I love the way the polish feels and looks.  I don&#x27;t take the old shellac &#x27;off&#x27; but instead just buff it down slightly and put the new on top.  So far, it&#x27;s working for me, and it thickens the tip as it grows out and gives a bit of additional strength.  Yes, occasionally, one of the tips peels off, but it doesn&#x27;t damage my nail much and I just buff it lightly and start over.  Hope this helps....It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;wear&#x27; quite as well as I had hoped.  I give myself a manicure about every 10 days, but it&#x27;s sooo worth it not to have to adhere to an appointment schedule every two weeks!</li>
            <li> This is a great!!! For my natural nails my manicure last long the bottle are smaller then the regular nail polish BUT You won&#x27;t need to apply much I will last weeks</li>
            <li> I ordered these about a month ago and the products work great.  I will stay with the CND line because I know it works</li>
            <li> I read the information and knew these would be small bottles but when I got them I realized that this is probably not a great buy as far as price is concerned.  Still I really like the CND Shellac for wear time and for smooth application.  If you use a LED light you should give it a little more time than you do some of the gel products otherwise it will be a little soft and not adhere as well as you expect.  In any case, it is still cheaper than going to a salon. It took me a couple of times before my nails looked as good as the salon but now I am satisfied and don&#x27;t feel guilty if I want to change the color more often than I could afford to do if I went to a professional.</li>
            <li> The CND Shellac Top and Base \\&quot;Set of 2\\&quot; is a GREAT deal. Buying both of the items that you need you can&#x27;t beat the price. Both coats came in their boxes and where exactly as advertized. If I ever need replacement I will certainly buy this product again. Would recommend to anyone looking to make the switch to the gel color system. The best one out there!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using these products, but I&#x27;m not anymore. I can use these with my regular polish and it doesn&#x27;t chip.</li>
            <li> CND is the only gel line that seems to work well for me. I can get about 6 days out of this polish. I can never get two weeks like they claim but I&#x27;m hard on my nails and have to wash my hands and use sanitizer all the time because of my job in healthcare so 6 days is a good run as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> used it once seems okay.. but the bottle are too small. jury still out on the how well it will hold up</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of doing my own nails, but it gets expensive buying these individually. I&#x27;ve found that when the base coat needs replaced, you may as well replace the top coat!</li>
            <li> Very nice products,the bottle are glasses,i love them very much！also good quality ，but just too small bottle,haha.love it&#x60;if you like this,just buy it,it is  worth!</li>
            <li> If your skin is at all sensitive and you can&#x27;t use acrylic, gel or any other products without breaking out into itchy little bumps, this one won&#x27;t work for you either.  My skin broke out and my fingers and cuticles looked horrible for 3 weeks afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get these to work with some of my regular polish as others have said they have done.  So far, I&#x27;m not getting the 2 weeks wear time some so they get.  I will keep experiment with different cure times, etc.</li>
            <li> Nothing special this product seems to lift very easily</li>
            <li> an overall good deal for the set of 2. although no nail polish tends to stay on me for very long</li>
            <li> I am a Grandma who has a daughter who is a nail technician. She introduced me to shellac, and I love it for my manicures. The polish stays on for two weeks which is great. Eventually I bought my own light and the product to do my own nails. I found it easy to do and have had good results with any CND product. Don&#x27;t try the cheaper versions of this from out of country, you will be disappointed. Take my word I learned the hard way!</li>
            <li> They spill out of the bottle something&#x27;s wrong with the bottles lid but the product it self was great but it went fast because of the cheap ass bottle</li>
            <li> CND product. Works as expected. Top coat was a little thick, otherwise both products are fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but this base and top coat has lasted longer than the other cheaper gel formulas I had used in the past.  I was having problems getting them to even last a week before the entire gel coat would peel off.  I&#x27;ve had this set on for over a week with no chips or peeled nails.  The formula does have a stronger odor than other brands while applying and does not give the shine of my other brand but I do like the fact that I can wear them much longer!  Personally, I will stick with CND over the competitor since they hold up so much better!</li>
            <li> Another works as it should. Have only one color in shellac and it looks so pretty and shiny. Plus last so long. I could get 2-3 weeks but I&#x27;m trying to stop biting my nails and find after a week or so I bitting to polish off a little at a time. I&#x27;m getting better though..</li>
            <li> this was an excellent deal.  Who doesn&#x27;t need both of these if you are using the CND polish system.  Great value for your money</li>
            <li> These are very satisfactory products and I have reordered with no problem.  I always had an extra set of these products on hand to replace previous bottles when they are gone.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than regular polish. I have someone come to the house and do my nails. I ordered the whole shellac setup on amazon. What a convenience!</li>
            <li> Work great, quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Just what I had used in salon, but they no longer want to carry it, so I&#x27;m doing my nails myself &amp; saving $25.00+ every 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Perfect product for at-home shellac manis.  Super easy to use and extremely durable.  Bought with a CND color set of 6 colors...</li>
            <li> I was very happy to find such a good deal on shellac top and base coat! I have no complaints with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works great and it last a very long time. Not to mention the great deal.</li>
            <li> The top coat/base coat combo work great and not hard to remove. These are a must for doing gel manicures at home!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this set our nail are beautiful shinny and growing ...You do need a UV lamp to cure and Alcohol to wipe of sticky</li>
            <li> LOVELY!!!!!!!! i could not afford going to the nail salon anymore.  I love this product. I wish i could afford all the colors</li>
            <li> Love Love Love. Beautiful nails with great shine. Don&#x27;t leave nails brittle or weak. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work at all for me. They are not anywhere near as hard as gels or acrylics and my nails are soft. The coatings are only lasting a day or two at most. Worst of all, I&#x27;m just out the money because Amazon considers them hazardous waste and won&#x27;t take a return on them.</li>
            <li> Same results as at the salon.</li>
            <li> Love being able to do my own shellac and save tons of money.</li>
            <li> Base is great - removes cleanly without nail damage, a real advantage over other gels. Top coat brush is a little long but works. Both are self-leveling. Good products!</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this purchase, my nails got very soft and broke off. I would not recommend this produce to anyone.</li>
            <li> i am happy with cnd shellac is is helping to strengthen  my nails ,it looks good with no polish will reorder</li>
            <li> If the product gets old, it gets gummy.</li>
            <li> Glad I tried this pair, great buy.</li>
            <li> You have to have these 2 to make you shellac product work.  They are a must have.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get these to cure correctly, even with the correct dryer.  Would not recommend.  I can&#x27;t get rid of these. Waste of $30.</li>
            <li> The bottom coat is ok it gose on smooth. The top coat is to thick and is hard to use.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product from amazon.  The first time it was fine.  This time the top coat appears to be old.  Unlike the first purchase that had the correct fluid consistency, this time the top coat is thick and comes out like molasses.  It also did not last as long.  While using the first batch, my manicure would last at least two weeks without showing signs of chipping or pealing.  This purchase has started chipping before the first week was complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You better check your stock and refresh it to make sure you won&#x27;t have any returns.  I&#x27;m not returning these because it would be more trouble than just throwing it away and going to a salon and purchase a new set.  I just used amazon for the convenience.  Well, this time the project shot that theory to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noel Carman</li>
            <li> Product does not work with my UV lamp.</li>
            <li> Excellent products!  I am a home self-user.....what I have learned for the best outcome is to make sure you coat the top edge of your nail to seal the edge!</li>
            <li> I was very glad to get this at such good prices. To begin with I didn&#x27;t know if I could get it to turn out like when I had it done professionally since everyone told me I had to have a certain type of lamp to go with this product but as it turned out I actually could use the lamp I bought at WalMart.....paid for itself in two uses!!!!!</li>
            <li> Works okay, but the bottles are definitely small. Also my bottles seem to have dried out pretty fast (the liquid became goopy) I&#x27;m not sure if they were just old, or thats how it normally works...</li>
            <li> I like doing my own nails. I save money Shellac is a great product for gel nails and the nail salon uses this same product and make a fortune off it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for a while and I am very satisfied with it.  Would continue using as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> This set was a good deal, and a good substitute for gel. After finding out I had an allergy to gel, the shellac turned out to be the only alternative I knew of and the best. I love it.this is my second perches im so happy with the product and the deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of gel and/or shelac base and top coats...this brand is the BEST on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will now be trying their colors.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! My manicure last up to 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO GLAD I found these!!! Easy to use at home. I don&#x27;t go to the salon any more! Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love the CND brand for base and top coats.  I am experimenting a little with other gel brands for color but so far I like the CND brand the best for base and top.  It seems they are easier to remove and protect my gel/shellac manicures well.  Usually lasts between 10 to 14 days.</li>
            <li> It work well but its too small</li>
            <li> Purchased because I decided to start doing my gel nails at home rather than pay a salon, A base and top coat is necessary and these are the &amp;#34;trick&amp;#34;, easy to apply and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes a little bit too fast, but the bottles are small. I don&#x27;t recommend getting the base coat, I never used that. Just the top coat will work fine.</li>
            <li> I like these products. My nails are very short after having long nails for years. The shellac helps to keep my nails stronger so they seem to be growing. The top coat is very shiny and stays that way for about 10 days. Once you clean your nails with alcohol and get off all the tackiness they look great.</li>
            <li> these work perfectly along with a shellac nail curing light. I don&#x27;t bother using the special shellac polish colors, I use whatever polish I want paired with the special base and top coat and I&#x27;m set. My nail polish can stay on without chipping for 2 weeks or more. Make sure to follow the directions though!</li>
            <li> The only base coat &amp; top coat I use!</li>
            <li> works great but is drying to my nails</li>
            <li> I bought this and it works good just like they use a salon, you pick your color and use this coat over it works good.</li>
            <li> Great product. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> CND is the only way to go when it comes to Shellac polish. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but they outshine the competition (pun Intended!)</li>
            <li> Perfect base and top coat for your at home gel manicure. This is one of the brands my salon uses and quite frankly, I felt this base and top coat were the best. Works well with other gel brands including gellish with no problems. The bottles also last... I&#x27;ve done at least 20 manicures and the bottles are still at least half full. Great product and easy to use at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different brand &amp;#34;shallec&amp;#34; products and I find that CND Shellac lends best result and finish. It contains less product and costs more than other brands, but it is worth it if you are looking for quality vs. quantity.</li>
            <li> I have tried other gel base coats and this one is by far the easiest to remove.  Soak for 10-15 mins and the polish just scrapes right off. After using this one I threw my other base coats in the trash so I will never waste time scraping and buffing again!</li>
            <li> best shellac ever. no comparison</li>
            <li> The polish took forever to dry even using the light. It took about 45minutes to take it off. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided it was time to do something about my nails after years of abuse with the fake nails. I did them by myself and even beauticians thought they looked nice and professionally done. I did a lot of research on line as far as what would be my best options for good looking nails. The one name that kept coming up was CND. I made the accident of purchasing \\&quot;Nail Shellac Gel\\&quot; from e-bay. (This was my mother&#x27;s day gift from my hubby), well it took forever to get here and not what I was looking for. I found this seller, sent an e-mail and was pleasantly surprised by the help that was given. I Instantly ordered the Top and Base coat, now just saving to get some good CND colors :)</li>
            <li> Stays tacky forever,despite following instructions to the letter. I would NEVER recommend it...waste of money!</li>
            <li> However, I ordered this online along with two other items.  From one of the three items ordered, my credit card was compromised and within one day had 6 charges on my account that I did not make.  I had not used my card for at least 6 months prior to these purchases so I know it was because one of the three items.</li>
            <li> This is A very good product, Works as stated, I would recommend this product. very easy to apply and last a good while.</li>
            <li> Love CND. Very easy to remove and apply</li>
            <li> Given as a gift. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great for peeling and weak nails ... very strong. and stays on for ~2 weeks .... very nice to not have to keep dealing with nail polish several times each week.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly what it&#x27;s supposed too!</li>
            <li> Came on time and worked fine</li>
            <li> I never tried to get a professional shellac manicure and I guess I should have because it did not last any longer than any other nail polish I have used.  As well getting it off was a complete nighmare and I purchased all the recommended things to take the polish off.  Again.... what a nightmare for nothing.....</li>
            <li> Product works as expected once instructions are followed. Bottles are small but, for this price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This was a good deal,and you need both to do the shellac manicure.  The product came on time and was very well packed I didn&#x27;t have any problems with shipping.  It works really well and last for the two weeks unless you use your hands a lot doing hard work.  I wash mine all the time with my job and garden and it last the two weeks for me.  It is very easy to use as well.</li>
            <li> Received the products as indicated they would come.  Both were what I expected and I have had not problems with either product.</li>
            <li> I must have received old product. Both the top and base coats were very thick and gummy and dried on the brush. Wound up being usable only for about 3 manicures, then got so bad I had to toss them and buy new ones (bought them separately from another distributor). The new bottles were much better than what I received in this duo. Love shellac, but buying this \\&quot;set of two\\&quot; was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> It is a good deal when buying together.  I really enjoy being able to do my own nails at home.  Having sellers willing to sell to non-professionals is very much appreciated.  If you&#x27;re having trouble make the system work for you there are very good instructions available on the Internet that can help.</li>
            <li> I would buy the bigger bottles next time. Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I was looking for Shellac base &amp; top coat at a relatively inexpensive price.  Found this deal for a 2-fer and I jumped on it.  The product is what it is!  Quick shipping, legit products.</li>
            <li> Worked great and was a good deal! Was a little worried it might be old or knockoff but it worked perfectly so no more worries!</li>
            <li> Good buy for the base and top coats, which you tend to run out of quickly since you use them more than regular colors.  So much cheaper than going to a salon yet you get the same, lasting, shiny look!</li>
            <li> I like the durability of shellac products. I just wish that its removable is less complex than the existing practice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used both the Shellac and Gelish top and base coat.  I really like the Shellac brand for ONE reason: they are so thin.  The Gelish base and top coat that I have are very thick and its hard to get a thin coat.  Thick coats become full of bubbles while they cure and are just terrible.  The Shellac gives me the nice thin coat I expect to get and I love it.  I find the same is true with the colored polishes, Gelish are thick and tricky to apply and Shellac are thinner and easier to apply/cure.  I&#x27;ll only buy Shellac from now on....</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Lasts for a full two weeks.  It works much better than any other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products...needed for base and top coats of CND gels...great stuff.</li>
            <li> While the top coat is fine, the base coat bottle is defective.  The brush won&#x27;t come out and won&#x27;t go back in, and the top comes apart.  I have to use needle-nosed pliers to use it.  But at least it&#x27;s still liquid.  Another bottle of shellac base coat I ordered arrived leaking and is too thick to use.  Odd, because all other shellacs I ordered (about 20) were in good to perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Wonderful products!!!</li>
            <li> Works great. No nail damage.</li>
            <li> easy to work with.  i would def order form this shipper again.  The item came as specified in description ..</li>
            <li> I just finished my first shellac manicure at home with these two products and it went great. i am loving my shiny nails!</li>
            <li> CND is the best brand.  I never hesitate to purchase this brand.  It holds up well and always looks great.</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are fantastic .  They go on easily, need a UV lamp to set.  They make the nail more durable and stronger.  A wonderful product.  I wil be getting more of this from this site.</li>
            <li> i receive it in very good conditions</li>
            <li> Received my order quickly however wasn&#x27;t pleased with the product . When I opened the top coat box it was leaking and was also missing a brush. I have order thus product before but have never received it in this conduction. The base coat had no issues and was pleased with that bottle. Will definitely not purchase through this seller again.</li>
            <li> use them constantly!!</li>
            <li> You need great bottom and top coat to have great looking nails.  These products provided that.  They go on in one coat, don&#x27;t run or leave ridges.  After the drying process my nails looked like they were done in a salon.  Product as described, great quality.</li>
            <li> I use these to give myself a French manicure that lasts for two weeks. They work perfectly along with the white tip polish and pink tinted polish.</li>
            <li> i needed to watch a youtube tutorial to get it completely right but it is easy to use.  I love using it!!</li>
            <li> I love CND products, including these two base and top coats. Great quality , it lasts almost 3 weeks and looks great.</li>
            <li> I have tried other top brands, but they all pale in comparison with CND top and base gel nail polish. It spreads thinly and smoothly like an ordinary nail polish, does not shrink or become clumpy dries up in 2 minutes using a 36 watts UV dryer. My nails shine up until it peels off after almost 2 weeks. Truly impressive. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> These were a gift a couple Christmas&#x27;s ago when I got the lamp as well. They are good. They don&#x27;t last as long as I would hope, a little thicker than I think they should be. I used them and even bought a second time but don&#x27;t know that I myself would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this because of an amazing shellac manicure I got in CT, while visiting my In-laws. I had never had one before, but my MIL swore by them.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say, I fell in love, by the time I left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After coming home, I realized I really liked the outcome of Shellac nails. The look, the strength, the color for weeks. What&#x27;s not to like..? Oh wait, yes there&#x27;s this big thing called, price. Oh goodness no. Anywhere from $40+ tip. I couldn&#x27;t afford that every two weeks, but I could afford a system that paid for itself in the first couple uses. I ordered this set because I needed both, for the Shellac manicure.&lt;br /&gt; Can I just start off by saying, I planned on using this for the traditional: base coat, nail polish coat and top coat.&lt;br /&gt;However, not every Shellac color I liked, nor did I want to have to tediously remove my whole nail set just to change the color. I now use the base coat, top coat, cure it and THEN regular polish on top. That&#x27;s right. I tried the sandwich technique (which is when you use the base coat, non-shellac nail polish color and then the top coat), which worked sometimes, but it has the tendency to bunch up when the coats weren&#x27;t done properly/sealed. I stopped doing the sandwich way and did it my way. First, apply base coat, (cure), then add top coat (cure), use alchol to get off stickyness. Then add your regular polish and your good to go!&lt;br /&gt; I find that using this as a base, this makes my nails strong and hard to break. They don&#x27;t look fake like Acrylic, but they look real like your real nails. The coats dry down to thin hard shellac coats that I love. Using a regular nail polish on top, I found, not only makes the polish chip free for at least a week, but it also helps my nails grow to amazing new lengths that I couldn&#x27;t get to before.&lt;br /&gt;When using a regular nail polish on top, I find that the polish also dries alot faster meaning you need to work faster to spread it to an even coat on you nail, so that might be troublesome for some who go carefully along. This base and top coat lasts a very long time. I have had mine for almost a year now and have used both pretty regularly and still have some left. The only problems I have with this is that the outside is black so I can&#x27;t see how much is left and when I should by a new one. I know that they need to be dark and black so that the product isn&#x27;t ruined with light/sunlight, but still I wanted to mention my only quip.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend if you want the Shellac nails, but hate the salon price. You don&#x27;t need to be a professional. Just do your research and read the reviews and you&#x27;ll be okay. I haven&#x27;t had any problems and like I said I have been doing this for about a year now. If you are trying to decide between Gel and Shellac, I would recommend Shellac, The Gel, you need to scrape off before you start a new set. With the shellac, I just file down the cuticle area and rub with alcohol and you are ready for your base coat. Make sure to take off all old nail polish before applying a new base coat. Also shake well. It helps with the overall application.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!be troublesome for some who go carefully along. This base and top coat lasts a very long time.

            <li> CND is the best gel polish on the market  - some of the others are too thick and they peel off.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without shellac.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and nails look like they were freshly painted for nearly two whole weeks. Have used other products - this definately the best.</li>
            <li> After doing my own gel nails for years, I became allergic to the brand I was using. I was devastated!  Then I discovered this brand which touts itself as hypoallergenic.  I didn&#x27;t necessarily believe it, but decided to try.  I received my CND products just this week.  Did my nails last night.  Voila!  NO SWELLING or ITCHING!  I&#x27;m so excited I get to keep up my manicure.  In addition, this stuff is great!  It cured easily under my UV light.  My nails look and feel great.  I liked the brushes in the bottles and the consistency of the product.  It goes on easily and smoothly.  Now I have to find out what other colors it comes in.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this set. Have been shellacking my nails for 2 years now and first time I have ordered from this company. First use and my polish is lifting within 4 days! Never have I had this problem, be sure you look where this comes from, I didn&#x27;t and now I can&#x27;t use it. My bad</li>
            <li> Love it! High glossy shine!</li>
            <li> use these all the time also.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to use with regular nail polish. It makes the regular nail polish stay on for a week plus. The trick is to cure clear coat and cure TWO layers of the regular nail polish coat then the top coat. It lasts for a week+. I am VERY satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great deal for the set! Have been using with my other CND products for over two months now and have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Just used to replace one of my nails after having a manicure 2 weeks ago, bought everything to do a complete manicure and as yet have not done it, so far the base and top coat did the job, happy with these items.</li>
            <li> As the description says, it is a base and top coat that you need for the shellac manicure. The base coat is thin but top coat seems much thicker. Both do their jobs.</li>
            <li> it was better than Gel</li>
            <li> of all the brands out there, this is by far my favorite.  I like that I do not have to scuff my nails before applying.  This does not stay on as long as the gels (2 wks vs up to 3) but that is okay, by 2 wks I&#x27;m changing my polish anyway.  I am one of those that like fresh polish on my nails. 2 wks is still a long time.  All they need to do now is come out with a red sparkly color like &amp;#34;ruby pumps&amp;#34; and I&#x27;m all set :-)</li>
            <li> these can be used with other brands polish???thank you!</li>
            <li> great product and a must for shellac</li>
            <li> The shellac it an awesome system and the base and top coats are essential.  These are a good price for the set of two.</li>
            <li> I am just an average gal. I have no experience with this product. However I was able to find some good tutorials on YouTube. I JUST did my nails and they turned out great!! I didn&#x27;t use the bonding stuff that is recommend. And at the end of the process I just used a little non acetone polish remover. It worked just fine. You ABSOLUTELY need the UV nail dryer!!!  Also, I just used the base and top coat. No color. And it turned out super shiny and perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. After drying, it&#x27;s a little wet to the touch, but after applying the nail polish remover or alcohol at the end,Its perfect. stays on 12-14 days.&lt;br /&gt;I am not disappointed. I am perfectly happy with this product. It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, must be applied in thin coats, but once you master it, it makes great manicures. A must have.</li>
            <li> I only received the base nail polish, not a double pack and paid over 30 bucks basically for one item. Just be aware.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. It never chips. It is on untill I take it off.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I love that this comes as a set of 2, as you obviously need both to do a complete manicure. This was a great value, and works wonderfully. It goes on smooth, and hardens quickly in the UV lamp. Provides a quick at-home manicure</li>
            <li> I just ordered the CND top and basecoat, one color coat, and the UV curing lamp. All together I spent about what it would cost me to have the salon do my nails 2-3 times. Anyway, I am a blackjack dealer and regular nail polish just chips right off my nails in a matter of minutes from working with the blackjack chips. My nails also get damaged and broken at work. All the other girls at work are swearing by this stuff, and saying it holds up just as well as acrylic. I&#x27;m excited that there is finally a product I can do at home that will hold up on my nails through work! I can&#x27;t wait to get the products and will update my review once I see how it works out!</li>
            <li> I went back and forth on deciding to buy the products to do my own nails at home and I am glad I finally decided on CND. The base and top coats work SO well, are extremely shiny, and for me personally last about a week and a half. Having said that, I have very brittle peeling nails so I would imagine it would last longer if my nails were healthier. This is what I do: prep nails (I don&#x27;t use the special nail prep, I just wash them, press back my cuticles, shape nails, etc.), paint base coat, cure for two minutes, I then do two layers of a CND polish and I cure each layer 2 minutes, then I put the top coat on and I cure for 3 minutes. I then wipe nails with a regular ol alcohol from walmart and I use a washcloth with the alcohol. Done within maybe 20 minutes? Its great. I would suggest using a nice cuticle oil (or any oil) on your cuticles after painting and curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I rated 4 stars because my top coat bottle doesn&#x27;t close all the way, its odd.</li>
            <li> The base coat didn&#x27;t seem to bind well to my nail.  There was not a full 2 weeks of wear, In fact I was luck to get 2 days of wear before the product started to lift from my nail.  I really think I will try a different brand next time. I used the UV light and followed the instructions on the box.</li>
            <li> If you want your manicure to last with hand washing this will help you. You will save a lot money because a salon cost $40 a set</li>
            <li> First attempt turned out fine, and I am sure with practice I will get better.  This worked fine with my OPI laquer polish and the Royal nail lamp.  I did notice the brush getting a little stiff but in the end the finish was just as good as the one I had done at the salon for $35. I will save a lot of money doing this myself at home.</li>
            <li> I got a UV light for Christmas and was excited to try the Shellac system.  This base and top coat worked wonderfully!  I will never go back to regular polish again!</li>
            <li> You have to have these and buying the two together is a great deal, much cheaper this way.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast service and great product. Thanks. This product is easy to use and has great colors. It is fast and saves money when you do it your self.</li>
            <li> I have never used a gel or shellac of any kind before. This was incredibly easy to use, and works wonderfully. No funky smell, not sticky... I will definitely be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the Deal... This set is cheaper than all other base - top sets. But you must know that they are each 0.25 oz.&lt;br /&gt;(That&#x27;s half the size of a regular polish)&lt;br /&gt;Keeping that in mind, They work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Price was right and delivery was prompt. I have been using the CND Shellac system for a year now and like it very much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this CND Shellac Top and Base &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; and it was a great deal!  I received them in a very prompt and timely manner from this seller.  They were as I expected and haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I am not disappointed at all.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I had my first shellac manicure a few months ago and i got HOOKED.  I really wanted to get it done again but having this manicure done in the salon was just to expensive.  So I started looking into doing it at home.  IF you&#x27;re not sure how to do this you should look at a YouTube tutorial, there are plenty out there.  Make sure you have a UV light.  For those of you wondering ... YES its still supposed to be a little tacky after curing(instructions say 10, but i do 30).  The sticky-ness helps the polish stick better.  I used this for the first time today and used regular polish then the shellac top coat.  A lot of instructions say to use 99% isopropyl alcohol on the top coat, but i used 91% since that&#x27;s all i could find and it worked just fine. My nails look great!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Shellac is amazing I used on my work, is the best , but this bottles are tinny and I  not so happy with the size but is fine because I now it work really good,,</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and a must for great nails. So nice to do nails at home and save lots of money!</li>
            <li> LOVE this brand! I use the entire system and my nails have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Very excited to own these,  can&#x27;t buy them in the store.  Once I get my light, we&#x27;ll find out if they work right</li>
            <li> now I do my on manicures I ordered the gel polish &amp;#34;candy lover&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve saved so mush money doing my own..  already paid for itself</li>
            <li> Great product and value!</li>
            <li> I think the base coat is amazing! I have been doing shellac for a while now and I really like this brand. Something to notice though, the brushes are different. The base coat has a clear short brush and the top coat has a longer black bristled brush. I do not like this top coat. I am wondering if they are all like this. The top coat is a bit gloopy with my first use- even after shaking it for one minute. It was hard to achieve a thin coat with this top coat- so I don&#x27;t think I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and excellent results.</li>
            <li> It does not dry well even under the lamp</li>
            <li> Consistency of the top coat is quite thick which leaves bubbles on top. You have to apply very thin layer and brush off excess or any visible bubbles before curing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cured under LED lamps as well.</li>
            <li> Love to be able to do it myself. It works great and it saves me a lot of money!. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> I purchased the CND Shellac Top and Base &amp;#34;Set of 2&amp;#34; when I purchased my 54 Watt Royal Nails Professional UV Light Gel and Acrilic Nail Dryer.  It was a very good purchase in both price and quality.  It is a must have in a household of multiple women.</li>
            <li> I did not even use them.  I cannot give it any less than a 5 star because it would be unfair.  I decided I did not want to put the shellac on my natural nails.  So I gave them to a shelter for women along with clothes.  I&#x27;m sure someone will be happy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a must have and I always try to purchase as a duo. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it seals your polish and has a nice shine, and the base coat does a nice job protecting your nails</li>
            <li> Works as stated.  I love the CND shellac polishes.  I&#x27;m going to try it without colored polish, but haven&#x27;t tried it yet.  Sometimes I just want natural color.</li>
            <li> After about 12 uses the base coat still works fine though it can do this weird thing where immediately after you put it on, it starts spreading and makes gaps. The top coat now has little goop balls in there where the polish has congealed, it&#x27;s VERY annoying. The brush strands have started sticking together too so it doesn&#x27;t make a smooth brush stroke anymore.</li>
            <li> The black nail polish looks great once dried but peels off within hours</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and easy.</li>
            <li> good deal- use it with the CND UV Lamp</li>
            <li> Everything is working great.</li>
            <li> This last much better than any store bought shellac.</li>
            <li> my wife loves all the CDC products</li>
            <li> Came delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> work great for my home shellac setup</li>
            <li> They do what they say they should the top coat makes this tick shiny wet finish that fills in all ridges and uneven spots on the nails and it&#x27;s like when you scratch it it &amp;#34;bounces&amp;#34; back to smooth in a few seconds I actually watched it :)</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about the CND shellac is the length of time it takes for it to cure under the UV lights. However, this is the only shellac brand that I like and stays strong and doesn&#x27;t peel of a few days after application.</li>
            <li> I already knew I liked it as my beautician had used it on my nails.  My nails look shiny but natural and the shelac is more comfortable than gel nails.</li>
            <li> Do your research about this product before investing. It&#x27;s great if you never want to take the polish off....that is hard too</li>
            <li> the only thing i was not happy with was the seller.  it took over two days before my order was even processed.  i ordered something from amazon three days later and both my orders came the same day.  that was unacceptable to me  the producet itself is satisfactory.  it is not as durable as the ibd gel that i have used for over a year but it is still much better than regular nail polish.  it does tend to lift every once in a while near the tip of the nail even though i tap the edges of the nail as recommended.  but on the plus side it is less damaging on the nail than the gels.  i like that you soak off the product as opposed to filing with the gel</li>
            <li> Both items came in great condition just as advertised.  Everything seems new and they apply nicely.  The top coat seems a little thick, but so did the first one I bought, so this may be normal.  Just what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Recommend to all ladies that like a high gloss shine that will last.  Easy to use and remove.  Will buy again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same thing I was paying $20 every two weeks at the salon to get. Now I can keep my nails done for 1/15 the cost!</li>
            <li> This brand is by far the best brand I have found yet. It lasts for a little over two weeks, no chipping, when you purchase this brand in a color, it is VERY true to what you see on the bottle! The price for purchasing in a bundle from this vendor was very fair and under in-store price, plus shipping was free. They were shipped in a very timely manor, as well. Great seller, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> it does stay on for 2 weeks plus. nails look healthy, natural, just the way I like it. love it!</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast. The product exactly how described. Already made once my shellac nails with the Top and Base of CND. Best quality. Thank you</li>
            <li> And a good price as a combo. Did nails every two weeks and the two hottles lasted a year without getting unable to use.</li>
            <li> When using this as a base and top coat my nails last twice as long.  I use the Gelish between it looks great.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love doing my own nails. This product is tremendous!  I have purchased the majority of polish, summer and winter colors. I have already absorbed costs for lamp and polish...</li>
            <li> This polish  is a great addition to making your nail color last longer.  It makes the nails stronger and more durable than color alone.  Needs a UV lamp to cure.</li>
            <li> I bought these for use with CND shellac COLORS.  I have used them several times &amp; have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> Bought this polish set so I could do my own shellac nails at home.  This works great.  I use the base coat, cure with uv lamp, add my own regular nail color, then use the top coat and cure again.  It lasts and offers for versility with nail shades. Also easy to remove.  Have had no issue with it damaging my nails and much less expensive than going to a salon!</li>
            <li> I would not order these products again. The shellac nails don&#x27;t last nearly as long as the gel nails</li>
            <li> Peels off after a few days not pleased with this product for the price I paid wont get it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are negative reviews for this. I tried these out using directions from other reviews. It was my first time ever using shellac and they came out beautiful. Very happy!</li>
            <li> These are really inexpensive but work great. They were a great find, est to use and very quick...a lot easier than regular nail polish.</li>
            <li> Awesome products!!! Just like the salon!</li>
            <li> The product was expired, so disapponted. It also looked tampered with.</li>
            <li> I am still learning, but my nails usually last about ten days.  I am having lots of fun and saving money doing my own nails. Watched a couple of tubule videos to see how it works. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> I give this one star for one reason, I haven&#x27;t even gotten to try it out yet! I had my boyfriend order this for me for christmas. I was so excited to use all my new nail stuff and I was finally able to sit down and give myself a manicure. I got through everything, the last step was putting on the top coat. I was extremely unhappy when I went to paint on the top coat and there was NOTHING in the bottle. The top coat was BONE DRY, the brush still soft because it had never been filled. I know that this was obviously a factory mistake but I&#x27;m still waiting to do my nails and they have looked like crap for weeks and it&#x27;s frustrating that I cannot use my stuff. I really hope that my bottle was the only bottle that was empty and I hope they send me a replacement bottle ASAP!</li>
            <li> If you want a manicure to last for 2 weeks this is the best set of products to achieve this goal.</li>
            <li> Love it! Buy it! Start doing your own Nails, don&#x27;t pay to get them done.  I&#x27;m a beginner and all I needed was Youtube videos!</li>
            <li> I have been using CND for a year now and truely love it. Very fast service and will order more</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 years and absolutely love it.  It wears well, lasts for the two weeks as it states it will.  The shipping was quick and efficient.  Would definitely purchase this in the future.</li>
            <li> I use the top and bottom coats alot, I only change color about every ten days. They hold up great protect the nails and I love this product. I got the order so fast I am a very happy customer and will order again.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve been able to keep on longer than a day without it chipping. It lasts for weeks if i let it and it&#x27;s super shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> The photo shows four bottles, and this is labeled as a top and base coat &amp;#34;set of two&amp;#34; - which clearly sounds like you are getting a two sets for a total of four polishes.  This is actually just two polishes - one top and one base - and they can be found for cheaper is bought separately.  I was not impressed with this top and base coat - they peeled off very easily.  After months I gave up and ordered the OPI top and base - and it is SO MUCH BETTER!  With the OPI top and base, my polish stays on for nearly two weeks.  Definitely do not get this.</li>
            <li> I bought this shellac without having any prior knowledge of how to use shellac. I read some of the previous reviews- one of which gave directions (great directions by the way), and decided to buy these. I followed the directions and walla! This polish works so well!. I can use my regular polish with it and it is beautiful. People ask me all the time how I afford to always have my nails done, and I told them that I bough these and do it myself. They were stunned. It is that easy to get nails that look like they came fresh out of a salon without having ANY beauty school or knowledge.</li>
            <li> Really great customer service - had an issue with the top coat and they shipped me out a new one immediately free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, great price, and works really well with my UV lamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I love CND base and top coat for no chip! Works great with all the no-chip gel/shellac polish brands not just CND. Stays shiney and lasts at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This was my first time to do gel polish at home and this stuff is amazing!!! So easy to use and very strong.  The nail salon used this and that&#x27;s why I bought it.  Very pleased. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again. Shellac lasts two weeks and is a total lifesaver. Good price for two bottles of essential shellac items</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too expensive to do this regularly at the salon and this is my GO TO product.  Only lasts a week for me but that says more about my nails than it does about the product.</li>
            <li> The base and top coat shellac are fantastic!  Of course the shellac or gelish in general does not last over 3 months, but my base and top coat lasted me about 10 good months of poilishing just my nails about every 2 weeks all year round.  After the 10 months it wasn&#x27;t working as well, so I ordered a new set, and PERFECT!!  all over again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful for natural nails. You do need a UV light nail dryer to use this. It takes about 10 min. to soak it off (using pure acetone) though.</li>
            <li> The kayak is excellent.  The back rests are less than useless. The upgrade backrest work fine. With the better back rest I would rate the kayak atleast a 9.5 out of 10</li>
            <li> Love these two items.  I purchased these, two CND colors and the Epica UV nail dryer for what three Salon gel manicures would have cost. The CND top coat leaves a seriously wet looking shine.  If ever it gets a little dull from soaps/hand lotions, etc.  A simple wipe with alcohol brings back the lustre.  Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very easy to use, last a long time.  Easy to remove, does not clump up or become stringy like others</li>
            <li> I bought the CND Shellac Top and Base Set hoping I could do my own nails.  It was just as advertised an I love it.  Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Good quality, fast delivery</li>
            <li> Saw an add in Instyle .  The add said 14+ day nail color, high shine and zero dry time.  What the add didn&#x27;t say was that you had to use a UV light to set the shellac ( at 149.00) and use a special sponge that has a plastic back ( don&#x27;t know what that costs)..I of course being a modern woman...didn&#x27;t read the directions.  Two hours later...the top coat was VERY STICKY...ok...look at the directions...it tells me that the top coat has to be cured first , with their UV lamp...then after that using alcohol and their special sponge, remove the inhibitor...This is not just any regular top coat...please don&#x27;t buy it thinking it is...it might be wonderful...if you have a nail salon at home.</li>
            <li> Went back to gel nails. Works better!</li>
            <li> Stays tacky, even after 9-12 minutes under the light</li>
            <li> box was smashed, but product was good</li>
            <li> Love this product. Quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Good but not great.  Base and top coat formulas get very sticky and become difficult to use after a few months of being left on tee shelf.  I prefer a formula that isn&#x27;t quite as thick.  You&#x27;ll also eliminate the pin-head air bubbles by going with a top coat that spreads easier during application and while curing.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my Shellac Top and base coat. Manicure came out beautifully. Love the strength and mirror shine that they give may nails without being super thick. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Appears to do the job, just need to make sure that you have full coverage and apply a thin coat</li>
            <li> I just finished using this on my toes.  10 minutes later I&#x27;m walking around with a completely dry pedicure.  I found it simple to use cured with the cnd lamp and using shellac color.  No more smudged toes for me can&#x27;t wait to do my nails :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this set to compliment the Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer that I purchased for my girlfriend. She has to have said \\&quot;I love my nails\\&quot; every 5 minutes for the last 48 hours. It saves her time and money as these coats would be $30 dollars per visit at the nail salon down the block from her house. She doesn&#x27;t have to make any more appointments for this. 2 Weeks of chipped free nails for her and 2 weeks of no requests for opinions of chipped nails to which I always have to respond with \\&quot; no they look fine! \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys if you&#x27;re looking to make her smile:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Make sure that she has a UV Dryer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) If she doesn&#x27;t have a UV Dryer buy: Thermal Spa 49135 Professional U/V Gel Light Nail Dryer it works great. You can even plug the bulbs in for her to make yourself feel a bit more manly after purchasing nail accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Give her these first and play the dumb guy \\&quot;Oh I didn&#x27;t know you needed a UV Dryer! Can I tan with one of those\\&quot; \\&quot;What do you mean you can&#x27;t just use these on their own\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Look awesome by having the dryer hidden somewhere else or save it until she starts thinking about how she can cut a few corners to afford a UV Dryer.</li>
            <li> No issues, good quality. I purchased this in a bundle with a 36 watt UV curing lamp. Both work great!</li>
            <li> Adore doing my own Shellac at home. Saves time and money. Highly recommend the CND line of polishes. Good quality and can tell the difference when comparing to cheaper polish lines.</li>
            <li> Just like the headline says but really how much can you rave about a product that just does its job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend ..... goes on very smoothly.  I&#x27;ve started doing my own manicure to save money and even purchased my own heat lamp. Great investment.</li>
            <li> Now I can take this with me and not worry about salons that only carry gel polish. This shallac is the best of the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and none are as good as CND.  The wear is the best.  I&#x27;m consistanly getting a full two weeks of ware out of each application.  Very nice indeed.</li>
            <li> GREAT value and awesome product! Shellac is definitely the best gel nail products out!</li>
            <li> This product is necessary if you want shellac nails to look good.  Product works well and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Only top and bottom coat I will use with the gels. Best out there.</li>
            <li> The base &amp; top coats are great with color, or alone for a natural look but still leaving your nails strong. Durable! I&#x27;m sold &amp; will only do Shellac from now on!!</li>
            <li> I like the cnd version of the top and base coat but please please follow the direction when they say a thin coat they mean it please don&#x27;t over due it because the shellac will be too thick after you are finish. But overall a great product</li>
            <li> It is okay, not the final product as in the salon but maybe I need better practice? All in all I am content.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 9 months ago.  I found it very easy to do.  the key is to make sure nails are cleaned with alcohol.  I have oily nailbeds so I also use the Gelish bonder with this.  All coats should be nice and thin with nothing on the cuticle and make sure you swipe the ends.  It stays on for 10 days to three weeks depending how meticulous you are.  I usually use spf15 cream on my hands and wear uv gloves to be sure.  I cure the bottom coat 2 min and the rest of them for 3.  then wipe off with alcohol.  Beautiful.  These two bottles are still going and I ordered more for when they run out. I have used Harmony Gelish colors in between as well.  They have great colors but I don&#x27;t feel they last as long. they tend to peel off which I don&#x27;t think is very healthy for the nail.  I wonder if anyone has found any difference between  this and the UV base and top coat?  or how does this compare to gel using LED light?</li>
            <li> Received product in a timely manner, well priced and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great with the Shellac.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, easy to use and much thinner than gel. The only con is that this does not provide as much strength to my nails as gel does.</li>
            <li> This item shipped very, very fast, they came in orginial packaging and they work perfectly with my other shellac producst!</li>
            <li> I am a licensed professional and I do my own manicures at home,. can&#x27;t beat these products. The top coat is very durable.</li>
            <li> Love it great product. The only gel I can use because I am allergic to gelish. Last two weeks ;)</li>
            <li> I did use the LED light and it works good never lasts as long as it says but I get a good week out of it.</li>
            <li> Great set.  Works much better than other brands I&#x27;ve tried in the market and lasts the full two weeks.  Easy to remove when you follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, easy to apply and use. The products work great and my nail polish stays on for a long period of time</li>
            <li> Good products, necessary to the process for shellacking my nails.  CND have good products that last on my nails for about two weeks!</li>
            <li> Got here fast. Will order again.</li>
            <li> It takes hours to harden both the base and the top coat.  The UV lamp does not cure/harden the shellac.</li>
            <li> This is my first shellac, and I must say I&#x27;m addicted.  The base and top coats work awesome with other brands of polishes.  Removal is super easy.  You can do the soaking, but I just peel them off.  They come off in one piece without damaging my nails.  I now can save a ton of money by doing my own shellac.  It&#x27;s totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I tried the larger size before but it got too thick before I finished it. I&#x27;m glad to have the set in the regular size.</li>
            <li> This is the best and i need more of it actually...</li>
            <li> My sister does nails, and won&#x27;T take money from me, so I bought her these. Loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t feel bad either.</li>
            <li> Items shipped fast. Were what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several bottles of this product and it works like a charm.  I would recommend it to anyone.  excellent</li>
            <li> Great polish and work well together. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal buying the pair together!! Def will buy the double pack again once I need to refill.</li>
            <li> My favorite gel. I use the base coat, UV lamp, top coat, UV lamp, wipe the sticky stuff off with alcohol, and then apply my regular nail polish. Then I add one more layer of the CND top coat to seal it in. It all stays on for a week or more chip-free. It doesn&#x27;t damage my nails when I remove it with acetone. By far the best gel I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> I use the CND line and do my own nails, could not be happier. This company mails quickly and after you purchase the initial set of all the products you need to gel your own nails, you quickly will re-coop that money rather than spending $30.00 every time you go to the salon. Each bottle last a long time. I do use both of these products and a colored one. Easy to take off, just make sure as in everything else that you read instructions.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to go to the nail shop for shellac. I have done every one&#x27;s hand that I know and they love it . Along with the top and base coat , I brought the polish and curing lamp. I just love it! Not to mention all the money I will save do it myself.</li>
            <li> Long lasting. Won&#x27;t chip. Easy to use with at home system.  Easy to apply. Looks beautiful. Little difficult to take off.</li>
            <li> Used with the &amp;#34;Thermal Spa&amp;#34; and Shellac polish and they worked well..  Only lasted on nails 5-6 days but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I heard they were the best of shellac products. They need to be applied properly.&lt;br /&gt;They are good quality, came sealed and unopened. Recommend</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine using Shellac colors without their base and topcoat. A no-brainer. I guess I have to say 7 more words or more to get this to go!</li>
            <li> The 2 for 1 is pretty good for these, as they are really expensive on their own. They give you are really good bond and finish that keeps the color on for at least a week without a scratch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a manicurist..my price for two was always the price for one!! Excellent..hope this offer happens again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used CND Shellac top, base, &amp; polish for about a month now. My nails look better than they have since I stopped having them professionally done. The polish doesn&#x27;t chip &amp; stays shiny for two weeks. The thing I like best is that my nails were soft &amp; flaky I could never grow them out. Since using the shellac my nails are much stronger &amp; are all the same length. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Be sure to apply thin coats Be sure to use UV light to dry will dry to a hard and shiny finish and will last a good 2 weeks</li>
