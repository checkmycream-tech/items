            <li>Thanks for making my Mom happy!</li>
            <li>I was so happy to receive my lipstick quickly from a dealer who was still carrying this product.  </li>
            <li>Best color of pink and many compliments!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon site.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad it is still in production.  </li>
            <li>Why would they take such a wonderful color and product off the market.</li>
            <li>I love this color and receive</li>
            <li>and I have used it for so many years and couldn&#x27;t find for a couple of years.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Glides on so wonderfully and lasts a very long time before you need to reapply.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for those who do not like a really dark or really light lipstick.</li>
            <li>The product came as ordered and was fine</li>
            <li>however it was the correct item and worked just fine.</li>
            <li>Mom was happy to have her shade of lipstick back.</li>
            <li>This is a great product from Cover Girl and something I used for a number of years, since the 80&#x27;s actually.</li>
            <li>The price is right and can&#x27;t beat the staying power!  </li>
            <li>I now have 5 full tubes of this shade, 505.</li>
            <li>I was so lucky</li>
            <li>The transaction was quick and easy, and all the information provided was very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thanks CoverGirl!!</li>
            <li>and I think it would look really cute on a young girl.</li>
            <li>It is a beauty, whether you are blonde, brunette, red or grey. :D</li>
            <li>I love Iceblue Pink...</li>
            <li>Such a smooth and long-lasting lipstick.</li>
            <li>However, they discontinued the product and many of use ( regular users) were not able to find a suitable replacement in the Cover Girl line of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful shade of pink but much too pink for an old lady like me.  </li>
            <li>I hope this lipstick will be available for a very long time.  </li>
            <li>, it makes my lips feel very soft.  </li>
            <li>Not to light and not to dark.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this color in any of the local stores anymore, so I consistently buy it online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very pretty pink though</li>

            <li> Just what I expected and have used for years.&lt;br /&gt;Sorry  I can not find it in my local drug store.</li>
            <li> Best color of pink and many compliments!!</li>
            <li> Good price! LOVE this nail polish!! Beautiful color and it stays on for quite a while!  It is hard to find in the stores so I was happy to find it on-line!</li>
            <li> A really great color. Not to light and not to dark. Perfect for those who do not like a really dark or really light lipstick.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful shade of pink but much too pink for an old lady like me.  I like the smoothness of the lipstick, it makes my lips feel very soft.  The only reason I rated it with 3 stars is because of the color.  My bad; I needed to get a darker shade.</li>
            <li> This is the best shade for me.  I get compliments all the time time.  I&#x27;m so glad I was able to find it on Amazon site.  The texture of the lipstick is not sticky and lasts.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this shade and brand for my Mom, since Covergirl stopped putting it on the shelves in stores. Mom was happy to have her shade of lipstick back. Very happy with the color and who makes it, and that it could be found on Amazon. Thanks for making my Mom happy!</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere and here it was. Thank you.</li>
            <li> My grandmother has loved this color for years.  I&#x27;m just glad it is still in production.  Seems like everything she likes goes out of style!  Phew.  Thanks CoverGirl!!</li>
            <li> Great product, excellent shipping, thank you</li>
            <li> Been wearing this for years. It not only is the perfect shade for me, it is the perfect texture. So sorry, it has been discontinued. I now have 5 full tubes of this shade, 505.

            <li> Why would they take such a wonderful color and product off the market. I was so lucky&lt;br /&gt;to have found the product at Amazon.com I ordered 5 tubes. I love this color and receive&lt;br /&gt;a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Just a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this color!  The price is right and can&#x27;t beat the staying power!  Will continue to buy.  Great brand!  Always reliable.</li>
            <li> It is my favourite  colour and I have used it for so many years and couldn&#x27;t find for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Why cover girl does not have this on the shelf is beyond me. The greatest color ever. Always great with a tan and in a picture!! Wake up cover girl!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this color in any of the local stores anymore, so I consistently buy it online. Great spring and summer color, and for fall and winter I just add a slightly darker shade underneath. Such a smooth and long-lasting lipstick. Love it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s frosted. I don&#x27;t think frosted lipstick looks good on women my age, 53. It&#x27;s a very pretty pink though and I think it would look really cute on a young girl.</li>
