            <li>Happy customer here!</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>Great product, no oxybenzone.</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find this product today at Wal-Mart..</li>
            <li>Happy to report .....</li>
            <li>great coverage.  </li>
            <li>great protection and no chemicals.</li>
            <li>Both my baby and I use this and it works great.</li>
            <li>the job with great coverage.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no smell, which is good, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her skin or</li>
            <li>I just wouldn&#x27;t use this sunscreen on myself or anyone I loved.</li>
            <li>It is imperative that I use a good, broad-spectrum sunscreen every day.</li>
            <li>keep your babies sunburn free with this great product!</li>
            <li>Not greasy, good performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a skin irritant as many have experienced with deodorants (and yes, the aluminum can enter the skin just as they do with deodorants).</li>
            <li>We love this sunscreen for our teenagers faces!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good moms are looking for better sunscreens.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good value, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the most part, it felt nice, but I ended up looking albino in pictures.</li>
            <li>I have very fair, highly reactive skin.  </li>
            <li>Love this - use it all the time.  </li>
            <li>I kept the bottle and use it in a pinch (more on me, but even on the baby, I figure it&#x27;s better than nothing).</li>
            <li>I wish i would have done more reviewing before i bought this product.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most baby lotions are like that since they are so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you are concerned with chemicals in other sunscreens, this is the best and most affordable sunscreen I have found.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this on our 15 month old, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job and if you are planning on spending a lot of time in the sun, I would recommend this sunscreen lotion to you...especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Banana Boat is always good for protecting against the sun, but this is also gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Grandson&#x27;s skin is easily irritated by lotions and sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Not as easy to apply as the spray kind, but worth having chemical free.</li>
            <li>this was recommended by my sister and it works super fantastic!</li>
            <li>Great for sports, especially water sports,</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen that I&#x27;ve been using daily, all over my body, to prevent burning and freckling.</li>
            <li>There ARE some good \\&quot;natural sunscreen\\&quot; out there.</li>
            <li>I usually use another brand of sunscreen on my face but Banana Boat&#x27;s all Natural sunscreen for babies is a great substitute and great on my hands all the time.</li>
            <li>This is actually good, because you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it and where you still need to get - especially with a squirmy toddler.  </li>
            <li>have noticed that dirt tends to stick to her more where I apply the sun screen, but since she needs a bath every night anyway, I don&#x27;t worry about this much.</li>
            <li>We were out from about 11:30 to 2:30, full sun and in FL.  </li>
            <li>Aluminum in excess (we are all getting too much aluminum as it is) is in NO way safe for kids to be smeared with.</li>
            <li>And, no bad stuff inside.  </li>
            <li>Not completely chemical free, but better than most and works well.</li>
            <li>Glad Amazon carries this which is great as it is often hard to find at the store.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for adults with similar skin tone as myself and are searching for a very effective, yet safer sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li>I am buying a more since my 1.5 year old,</li>
            <li>No parabens or phthalates which is rare in a sunscreen for some reason.  </li>
            <li>When I applied it to my skin I noticed that it kind of leaves a white film no matter how much you rub it in.</li>
            <li>The longer it was on the more red</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen he is able to use still (we have been using it since he was a baby</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using these products today out in the sun and being in and out of the pool I think they do exactly what they say they do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural and papa free sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>where exactly does it say it is \\&quot;chemical-free\\&quot;?</li>
            <li>do wish that the Zinc Oxide percentage was a bit higher</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s 4%), so I&#x27;ve been trying to find a sunscreen with a higher percentage.</li>
            <li>It does blend in and become less noticeable over time, while still being effective.  </li>
            <li>Rated very high by a consumer research group;.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be gentle since it is chemical-free and has zinc oxide/titanium oxide.</li>
            <li>The marketing is REALLY well done though.</li>
            <li>really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced as well!I don&#x27;t recommend rubbing it on your eyeballs...</li>
            <li>I use it both on my toddler and my 5 month old when they are going to be outside for more than an hour.  </li>
            <li>It went on thick and lasted a good 3-4 hours without reapplying.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product at a local drugstore.</li>
            <li>But I am almost completely white and need more protection than the average person, so this may not be as important if you don&#x27;t have my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not very greasy, and it spreads fairly easily.</li>
            <li>It is very white on their skin right after use, but it eventually absorbs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a little more \\&quot;rubbing in\\&quot;, but I knew that when I bought it.</li>
            <li>I bought at another location but wanted to warn those of you like me who can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreens, thinking this is natural or gentle.</li>
            <li>We forgot our sunscreen on a trip to New Orleans, so I bought this to protect my baby.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t like new.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable with broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li>lotion has the same smell, look and feel as the first one.</li>
            <li>Used it yesterday for a trip to the zoo and no bad reactions like other reviews have said.  </li>
            <li>Like, super ghostly white, but this stuff still had a white cast on my skin.</li>
            <li>me offer some food for thought if you are considering a higher-priced natural sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>My kids have extremely sensitive skin with eczema.</li>
            <li>I like that this product is made with natural ingredients..</li>
            <li>But if you don&#x27;t care about chemicals and you do care about whiteness, maybe try La Roche Posay for face (doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes as much) and regular Coopertone, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through 4 or 5 sunscreens this summer already, trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t cause my 2 year old to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>They were all baby sunscreens, natural, or for sensitive skin, but all caused a reaction.</li>
            <li>Something sticky on it near the logo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bee using Banana Boat Natural Reflect Baby Sunscreen for about a year.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m an adult.  </li>
            <li>It works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>There are other higher rated natural sunscreens available, but I find that if I spend $20 on a small tube of sunscreen I will be wincing as I apply the appropriate amount (which means I am not able to get the benefits).  </li>
            <li>Where I live, the UV Index regularly reaches 11 in the summer</li>
            <li>This product is thick and works as a barrier, so it doesn&#x27;t really rub in all the way right away.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s SUPER white and doesn&#x27;t rub in (it&#x27;s not really supposed to since it&#x27;s a physical block subscreen).  </li>
            <li>This is the only sunblock my 6 year old can use</li>
            <li>Overall, they classify the health risk as low, but some of the ingredients apparently pose a risk of organ system toxicity.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any so-called \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; active ingredients that a lot of people are sensitive to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it originally doesn&#x27;t have it, but other new lotion products usually have it.  </li>
            <li> I started using it on my 2 year old son and noticed after a few uses that he would only turn red where i would apply to product,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tough to rub on but worth it for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> well though: \\&quot;features naturally sourced mineral sunscreen actives and zinc oxide\\&quot; and \\&quot;without the use of harsh chemical sunscreens\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s nano particles or not because they don&#x27;t bother stating it (which leads me to believe it is - especially since they use alumina and silica which are oft used to coat zinc and titanium nanoparticles).</li>
            <li> The smell is not very strong, and after a few minutes, it dissipates, so I don&#x27;t really have to worry about being stinky all day.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m slightly concerned with how old it is :/</li>
            <li> My daughter with eczema has no problems with reactions like she did with other sunblocks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the only sunblock my 6 year old can use but I guess they quit making it. I ordered it off here but I&#x27;m slightly concerned with how old it is :/</li>
            <li> If you are concerned with chemicals in other sunscreens, this is the best and most affordable sunscreen I have found.  I use it both on my toddler and my 5 month old when they are going to be outside for more than an hour.  It is very white on their skin right after use, but it eventually absorbs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me offer some food for thought if you are considering a higher-priced natural sunscreen.  There are other higher rated natural sunscreens available, but I find that if I spend $20 on a small tube of sunscreen I will be wincing as I apply the appropriate amount (which means I am not able to get the benefits).  This tube is affordable enough (on subscribe and save) to where I do not find myself applying less than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> Incredibly thick product similar in consistency to Vaseline.  You can be it stays put!  Seems to work well and provide excellent protection.</li>
            <li> Love this - use it all the time.  In fact I ordered another tube.  Rated very high by a consumer research group;.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be gentle since it is chemical-free and has zinc oxide/titanium oxide. WRONG! I still broke out into an itchy rash where I applied. Stick with Vanicream or Suntegrity. I bought at another location but wanted to warn those of you like me who can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreens, thinking this is natural or gentle.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is great!  Used it yesterday for a trip to the zoo and no bad reactions like other reviews have said.  It actaully worked wonderfully.  No sunburns here after 3 hours at the zoo!  I also like that is well reviewed by EWG,  It scores a 3 out of 10.  (lowest and best is a 1)  [...]  I am buying a more since my 1.5 year old, my husband and I all use it.</li>
            <li> My kids have extremely sensitive skin with eczema. This is the only sunscreen product they do not complain about stinging or burning their skin. An added bonus: it does not burn if it runs into the eyes while sweating. The consistency is thick and pasty so it&#x27;s a little harder to apply. It does work well to prevent sunburn.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this product at a local drugstore. I have very fair, highly reactive skin.  This product was excellent. It has a thick consistency, whitish in color, however that fades as it absorbs into your skin. No discernable scent or offensive odor, and not greasy. I would highly recommend for adults with similar skin tone as myself and are searching for a very effective, yet safer sunscreen product.  p.s  I also use on my face, no reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> We forgot our sunscreen on a trip to New Orleans, so I bought this to protect my baby.  On the plus side, it worked great--not a hint of color after several days in the sun!  On the down side, I discovered after I got home that it was given a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;moderate hazard&amp;#34; rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Guide to Sunscreens. Overall, they classify the health risk as low, but some of the ingredients apparently pose a risk of organ system toxicity. I kept the bottle and use it in a pinch (more on me, but even on the baby, I figure it&#x27;s better than nothing).</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this on our 15 month old, and it&#x27;s been great.  This product is thick and works as a barrier, so it doesn&#x27;t really rub in all the way right away.  This is actually good, because you can see where you&#x27;ve applied it and where you still need to get - especially with a squirmy toddler.  It does blend in and become less noticeable over time, while still being effective.  It lasts for a while, even when she rubs her face or is playing with water.  There&#x27;s no smell, which is good, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her skin or eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that dirt tends to stick to her more where I apply the sun screen, but since she needs a bath every night anyway, I don&#x27;t worry about this much.</li>
            <li> I usually use another brand of sunscreen on my face but Banana Boat&#x27;s all Natural sunscreen for babies is a great substitute and great on my hands all the time.</li>
            <li> Great deal!  We love this sunscreen for our teenagers faces! And, you can&#x27;t beat the Amazon prices.  Banana Boat is always good for protecting against the sun, but this is also gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen worked perfectly on our 2-year-old grandson. It went on easily, no stinging of the eyes, and shielded him from the sun. His cheeks were a little pink after three days outdoors. Otherwise, no sign of sun coloring. I like that this product is made with natural ingredients..</li>
            <li> Great product, no oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> I wish i would have done more reviewing before i bought this product. I started using it on my 2 year old son and noticed after a few uses that he would only turn red where i would apply to product, no where else. The longer it was on the more red he would become. I then put the product on myself and it burns! Neither I nor my son have any allergies or sensitivities and after visiting their facebook page i see we aren&#x27;t the only ones this is happening to. Please do some research before purchasing. I have tossed out my bottle and will not be purchasing anymore banana boat products.</li>
            <li> I *think* it blocks UVA/UVB e&lt;br /&gt;rays, but it&#x27;s SUPER white and doesn&#x27;t rub in (it&#x27;s not really supposed to since it&#x27;s a physical block subscreen).  It&#x27;s like putting white glue on your face (color-wise).  I&#x27;ve used it on my neck and upper chest (can&#x27;t spell that. . . ) where i don&#x27;t care that it&#x27;s so white.  But if you don&#x27;t care about chemicals and you do care about whiteness, maybe try La Roche Posay for face (doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes as much) and regular Coopertone, etc. for your body.</li>
            <li> Grandson&#x27;s skin is easily irritated by lotions and sunscreens.  This is the only sunscreen he is able to use still (we have been using it since he was a baby and he just turned 5).  It is a great product and protects him from the sun like a champ!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does not burn my baby&#x27;s eyes and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in return for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has the same smell, look and feel as the first one. When I applied it to my skin I noticed that it kind of leaves a white film no matter how much you rub it in. After a couple of minutes it goes away. Most baby lotions are like that since they are so thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using these products today out in the sun and being in and out of the pool I think they do exactly what they say they do. No tan, no sunburn for me or my daughter. It went on thick and lasted a good 3-4 hours without reapplying. It did a great job and if you are planning on spending a lot of time in the sun, I would recommend this sunscreen lotion to you...especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product today at Wal-Mart..( I used the \\&quot;kids\\&quot; version).  I&#x27;ve been looking for an all natural and papa free sunscreen.  I&#x27;ve been looking on-line and was so confused and overwhelmed.  I hope this is it.  I applied this about 15 minutes before going in the sun...to my two kids and myself.  It was a bit hard to rub in and it leaves a whitish tint to the skin.  However, it worked well.  We were out from about 11:30 to 2:30, full sun and in FL.  Happy to report .....great coverage.  Not as easy to apply as the spray kind, but worth having chemical free.</li>
            <li> This stuff broke me out with a rash that was really quite vicious. I had to go in to and get an injection of hydrocortisone and some prescriptions form the local doctor while on vacation. It totally sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great for sports, especially water sports, but I do have to warn -  it is quite thick</li>
            <li> Not completely chemical free, but better than most and works well. No break outs. Very affordable with broad spectrum coverage.</li>
            <li> I understand that this is probably a case by case basis and you have to find what works for you, but this one works for us!! I&#x27;ve been through 4 or 5 sunscreens this summer already, trying to find one that doesn&#x27;t cause my 2 year old to break out in a rash. They were all baby sunscreens, natural, or for sensitive skin, but all caused a reaction. After a lot of research, I landed on this one. Yes, it takes a little more \\&quot;rubbing in\\&quot;, but I knew that when I bought it. We apply it in the morning and it&#x27;s reapplied at daycare, no sunburn, no rash! Happy customer here!</li>
            <li> great protection and no chemicals. This also does not cause my skin to breakout</li>
            <li> where exactly does it say it is \\&quot;chemical-free\\&quot;? (It doesn&#x27;t). They do word it well though: \\&quot;features naturally sourced mineral sunscreen actives and zinc oxide\\&quot; and \\&quot;without the use of harsh chemical sunscreens\\&quot; but that&#x27;s speaking of what they are calling the \\&quot;actives\\&quot; \\&quot;sunscreens\\&quot;, i.e. the zinc, titanium... It&#x27;s not claiming to have no chemicals, because it does. Also it&#x27;s not biodegradable. It&#x27;s not reef-safe. I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s nano particles or not because they don&#x27;t bother stating it (which leads me to believe it is - especially since they use alumina and silica which are oft used to coat zinc and titanium nanoparticles). Alumina separated from its source,processed &#x3D; aluminum oxide). Aluminum in excess (we are all getting too much aluminum as it is) is in NO way safe for kids to be smeared with. It&#x27;s also a skin irritant as many have experienced with deodorants (and yes, the aluminum can enter the skin just as they do with deodorants). The marketing is REALLY well done though. I just wouldn&#x27;t use this sunscreen on myself or anyone I loved. It&#x27;s good moms are looking for better sunscreens. There ARE some good \\&quot;natural sunscreen\\&quot; out there.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen that I&#x27;ve been using daily, all over my body, to prevent burning and freckling. I do not use it on my face, as I already have a facial sunscreen. It is imperative that I use a good, broad-spectrum sunscreen every day. Where I live, the UV Index regularly reaches 11 in the summer months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this stuff. The smell is not very strong, and after a few minutes, it dissipates, so I don&#x27;t really have to worry about being stinky all day. It is not very greasy, and it spreads fairly easily. After it dries, it doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes, and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger on them. It doesn&#x27;t have any so-called \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; active ingredients that a lot of people are sensitive to, it&#x27;s a good value, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that the Zinc Oxide percentage was a bit higher (It&#x27;s 4%), so I&#x27;ve been trying to find a sunscreen with a higher percentage. But I am almost completely white and need more protection than the average person, so this may not be as important if you don&#x27;t have my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, I&#x27;m still giving this a 5/5.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like new.  1. It doesn&#x27;t have the silver cap. I&#x27;m not sure it originally doesn&#x27;t have it, but other new lotion products usually have it.  2. Something sticky on it near the logo. It seems like someone attached a sticker and took it off later.  3. Smells like a chemical glue.  I want to return it.</li>
            <li> keep your babies sunburn free with this great product! this was recommended by my sister and it works super fantastic!</li>
            <li> Both my baby and I use this and it works great. It&#x27;s a little tough to rub on but worth it for the natural ingredients. Reasonably priced as well!I don&#x27;t recommend rubbing it on your eyeballs...that&#x27;s what sunglasses are for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white. Like, super ghostly white, but this stuff still had a white cast on my skin. For the most part, it felt nice, but I ended up looking albino in pictures.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bee using Banana Boat Natural Reflect Baby Sunscreen for about a year.  Had a little 1st stage skin cancer and I&#x27;m an adult.  This sunscreen&lt;br /&gt;does the job with great coverage.  And, no bad stuff inside.  No parabens or phthalates which is rare in a sunscreen for some reason.  Glad Amazon carries this which is great as it is often hard to find at the store.  It has everything it should and nothing it shouldn&#x27;t.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and doesn&#x27;t irritate my son&#x27;s sensitive skin. I keep one in my car, my husband&#x27;s car and at home.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Stays on well.  My daughter with eczema has no problems with reactions like she did with other sunblocks.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, good performance.</li>
