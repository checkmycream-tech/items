            <li>Love these curlers.</li>
            <li>I love these \\&quot;not so curlformer \\&quot; curlformers</li>
            <li>Love using these, Not the easiest to sleep on, and tends to pull on my scalp when I roll over, so I suggest using the blow dryer, or use during the day instead.  </li>
            <li>I dare not say that they might be even better then the curlformers</li>
            <li>really works well, not to comfy to lay on but that will not stop the beautiful curls I enjoy from them</li>
            <li>Material seems pretty good-</li>
            <li>Easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure if they are left over night or for a good hour or so, the curls are a lot more defined.</li>
            <li>20 was perfect for my average thickness.  </li>
            <li>I put them in damp hair before bed and wake up to beautiful, bouncy curls that last for two days!  </li>
            <li>Best Used when hair is Dry!!!!</li>
            <li>but I still think they will work fine.  </li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m a new natural my hair texture isn&#x27;t to where I wanted to be , so I didn&#x27;t get the best curl on all my hair</li>
            <li>Smooth silky curls without the damage from heat styling.  </li>
            <li>Love this curlfomers, worth the money, but i do not recommend putting  them in before bed.</li>

            <li>Taking them off is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Tried them for the first time today.</li>
            <li>Was really excited to see results but ended up not using.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve used the original curlformers and they broke on me in the first 2 months!</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a full set of just the pink curlers.  </li>
            <li>By the second day, they&#x27;re more Hollywood looking; by the third day, it looks like nice, beachy waves.  </li>
            <li>oh well ;-)</li>
            <li>These do exactly what they say they&#x27;ll do.  </li>
            <li>Was looking for a quick alternative to curlformers for my natural medium length 4b/4c hair-</li>
            <li>So I had to comb it very well before using the hook.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the orange color and the curls</li>
            <li>They look they should work well, but it was just too much work to put them all in.</li>
            <li>I must say I am highly surprised and satisfied with my recent order.</li>
            <li>but I know once my hair is even textured this product will be my new go to styler</li>
            <li>I dont have curlformers, but I imagine they do the same thing, but at a MUCH cheaper price!</li>
            <li>I also ordered his long and narrow ones and am in love with them just as much as these ones.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavey and frizzy</li>
            <li>Definitely better than a curler that will damage delicate hair like mine.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft.  </li>
            <li>Going on 5 yrs natural but</li>
            <li>I hate using heat since I use color, so these are perfect in my mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li>The result is bouncy, vibrant curls which lasts for days!Will definitely order again from this seller-</li>
            <li>This product is so easy for spiral curls, I had a little trouble at first, but I discovered that it&#x27;s easier when my hair is wet or damp and conditioned.</li>

            <li> This product is so easy for spiral curls, I had a little trouble at first, but I discovered that it&#x27;s easier when my hair is wet or damp and conditioned.</li>
            <li> these were in mail for a long time, coming from China.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, and I bought the long hurlers.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t get to leave them in as long as I wanted,</li>
            <li> I Iike these curlformers the only thing I don&#x27;t like was the fact that some of the ends where closed</li>
            <li> I suggest if you have really thick hair to get 2 sets, if you put too much on wand it wont pull thru.</li>
            <li> I could have gotten the shorter ones, these are very long</li>
            <li> I did not put it on wet hair, but on dry hair with mousse.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse natural hair</li>
            <li> I like them, I got the results I expected, but there is not instructions, then you have to get it in youtube.</li>
            <li> they arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I guess they usually sell packs of ten</li>
            <li> Because the hook has to slide all the way down your hair, and my hair is long, it got tangled a few times.</li>
            <li> plastic but thick enough to perform what it says it will.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s less tangling and pulling.</li>
            <li> and oh my goodness...soft bouncy little bo peep curls.</li>
            <li> I ordered 40 rollers so 4 rods to set my hair with which makes the process a little quicker yahhhhhh!</li>
            <li> I was running a little late for work</li>
            <li> However, I had to make the partings so small that it took 3 kits</li>
            <li> I used with wet hair and leave in conditioner and slept in them (little uncomfortable)</li>
            <li> I was trying to do it quicker, so I used thick strands.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, order two.</li>
            <li> Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, now if I lose one, I have a back up.</li>
            <li> They were dirty.</li>
            <li> They were just in bad condition.</li>
            <li> Highly disappointed.</li>

            <li> Wonderful curls Had to learn how to use it it did not have any instruction on how to use it I have to figure out how to use the wand and the Curler need instructions with it</li>
            <li> these were in mail for a long time, coming from China. The quality is good, no rips or tears. I received two hooks. I put these in my hair the same night I received the package. I have long hair, and I bought the long hurlers. I was trying to do it quicker, so I used thick strands. Because the hook has to slide all the way down your hair, and my hair is long, it got tangled a few times. So I had to comb it very well before using the hook. When using thinner strands there&#x27;s less tangling and pulling. It took me about an hour just to put all my hair into the curlers. That&#x27;s why i only give it 3 stars. It requires a lot of time. Taking them off is easy and quick. The hair looks great. Curls look like relaxed beachy waves. I did not put it on wet hair, but on dry hair with mousse.</li>
            <li> So great! The price was unbelievably good, the quality was good and they shipped it right away! If you have thick hair, order two. With such a great price, why not?!</li>
            <li> I love these curly formers. Easy to use and store. I create curls on my hair with out any help. (thumbs up)</li>
            <li> I dont have curlformers, but I imagine they do the same thing, but at a MUCH cheaper price! I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I received them yesterday and was not expecting them until Nov. 24.  I could have gotten the shorter ones, these are very long but I still think they will work fine.  I can&#x27;t wait to try them maybe tonight.  I just love all the tutorials and how their hair comes out I&#x27;m excited!!!</li>
            <li> Love these curlers. Smooth silky curls without the damage from heat styling.  I only wish I had the option of a larger curler for a softer effect. But these are great! My hair is naturally wavey and frizzy so it needs a bit of encouragement to look nice. Curls hold all day without product and if I use a stying spray I can even wear them the next day too. It would be nice to have a full set of just the pink curlers.  I don&#x27;t really like the orange color and the curls come out the same but oh well ;-)</li>
            <li> really works well, not to comfy to lay on but that will not stop the beautiful curls I enjoy from them</li>
            <li> Love this curlfomers, worth the money, but i do not recommend putting  them in before bed. Only problem is made in china.</li>
            <li> I love these \\&quot;not so curlformer \\&quot; curlformers lol . I installed them and let them set over night and woke up with curls . Because I&#x27;m a new natural my hair texture isn&#x27;t to where I wanted to be , so I didn&#x27;t get the best curl on all my hair but I know once my hair is even textured this product will be my new go to styler</li>
            <li> Love using these, Not the easiest to sleep on, and tends to pull on my scalp when I roll over, so I suggest using the blow dryer, or use during the day instead.  My hair could use the shorter ones, so I am going to order them also.</li>
            <li> Love them!&lt;br /&gt;Tried them for the first time today. This product is so easy for spiral curls, I had a little trouble at first, but I discovered that it&#x27;s easier when my hair is wet or damp and conditioned. I was running a little late for work so I didn&#x27;t get to leave them in as long as I wanted, but I&#x27;m sure if they are left over night or for a good hour or so, the curls are a lot more defined. Definitely better than a curler that will damage delicate hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Great product, good quality, amazing price. I guess they usually sell packs of ten so it came with two packs of ten each with too wands. Not that that&#x27;s a bad thing, now if I lose one, I have a back up.</li>
            <li> Best Used when hair is Dry!!!!</li>
            <li> Installed correctly but for thinner hair, will not remain in.  Was really excited to see results but ended up not using.</li>
            <li> My hair is about 15-16&amp;#34; from root and these were perfect.  I used with wet hair and leave in conditioner and slept in them (little uncomfortable) and oh my goodness...soft bouncy little bo peep curls. My hair was so soft.  I separated curls and shaped with hair spray.  20 was perfect for my average thickness.  I suggest if you have really thick hair to get 2 sets, if you put too much on wand it wont pull thru.</li>
            <li> I like them, I got the results I expected, but there is not instructions, then you have to get it in youtube. At the beginning they are not easy&lt;br /&gt;to handle.</li>
            <li> I Iike these curlformers the only thing I don&#x27;t like was the fact that some of the ends where closed i got to force it to open.</li>
            <li> They were dirty. Didn&#x27;t know it would be used. Highly disappointed. Seemed like it was given away because it was worn and teared. They were just in bad condition.</li>
            <li> They did what they were suppose to. Just buy a good wrap lotion.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse natural hair and I was looking forward to using these.  However, I had to make the partings so small that it took 3 kits and it took forever to do, and it hurt trying to pull my hair through these.  They look they should work well, but it was just too much work to put them all in.</li>
            <li> These were so easy to use and my daughter&#x27;s curls were beautiful!  I would recommend them to anyone .  Fantastic price &amp; they arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Hello! Was definitely sceptical about purchasing these rollers initially because they were coming from China..I must say I am highly surprised and satisfied with my recent order. Ordered product on July 23rd and they arrived on the 31st! Was looking for a quick alternative to curlformers for my natural medium length 4b/4c hair- Going on 5 yrs natural but bc&#x27;d again just in October of 2012, so coming up on 2 yrs refreshed again 😊. The products are def comparable to curlformers and work like a charm. I dare not say that they might be even better then the curlformers😁- I&#x27;ve used the original curlformers and they broke on me in the first 2 months! So let&#x27;s see how these hold up! Material seems pretty good- plastic but thick enough to perform what it says it will. Plus, one hook is supplied with every 10 rollers- I ordered 40 rollers so 4 rods to set my hair with which makes the process a little quicker yahhhhhh! Lol.. The result is bouncy, vibrant curls which lasts for days!Will definitely order again from this seller- I also ordered his long and narrow ones and am in love with them just as much as these ones. I will repost my review under that specific product also.Hope this was helpful!</li>
            <li> These do exactly what they say they&#x27;ll do.  I put them in damp hair before bed and wake up to beautiful, bouncy curls that last for two days!  By the second day, they&#x27;re more Hollywood looking; by the third day, it looks like nice, beachy waves.  Great way to get 3 days of style out of zero effort if you have normal-to-dry hair!  I hate using heat since I use color, so these are perfect in my mid-back length hair.</li>
