            <li>Tried the shampoo and wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am happy with the functionality of the product and I would have to give the cap design an A+ for ease of use!  </li>
            <li>The scent is great as is the scent of the shower gels and the two together work perfectly...</li>
            <li>Now let&#x27;s see if Axe can market this without the incredibly offensive, immature ad campaigns.</li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>so he was happy to know we can it via amazon.</li>
            <li>great shampoo....</li>
            <li>So, after we each tried it once, we converted it to a body wash and are quite happy using it in that capacity.     </li>
            <li>it works great and smells great.</li>
            <li>As a shampoo, I noticed my hair smelled great all day.</li>
            <li>While it may not produce the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; of Teatree, this shampoo smells great</li>

            <li>This is a great shampoo for men.</li>
            <li>Great smell??</li>
            <li>and I smelled good and had a great experience with it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now go get it. :P</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant and not-overpowering</li>
            <li>And it does do a good job.  </li>
            <li>Good shampoo</li>
            <li>No wonder this product is so good.</li>
            <li>Although I thought it smelled good out of the bottle, I could not smell it on his hair, even immediately after he used it.  </li>
            <li>I guess it smells good.  </li>
            <li>Another good thing is that you can find it anywhere.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that his hair looks really good.  </li>
            <li>He loved it and said the scent was \\&quot;manly.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The packaging/bottle itself is a great size, has a pop-up top button push feature and fits nicely on a bath shelf or in a shower caddy.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo, 12-Ounce Bottle&#x27; is a great smell, good performing product.  </li>
            <li>A man likes to be himself to keep his own hair the way he likes it.</li>
            <li>Nicely sized bottle.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice like</li>
            <li>Pro: nice scent, not tacky or overpowering.</li>
            <li>I must say after he used the shampoo his beard puffed up really nicely.  </li>
            <li>It succeeds both as a shampoo AND a body wash, in my view - clean and fresh smelling, it did the trick for my five-minute showers - perfectly.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair super clean without stripping your hair, smells fantastic, looks beautiful and is packaged perfectly!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if Axe products will get you ultra-hot women like the commercials suggest but the one thing they will do is get you clean!!  </li>
            <li>so it must be pretty good!</li>
            <li>Scent is pleasant, bottle design was well thought out for easy use and the shampoo does a good job of cleaning the hair while still washing out cleanly.</li>
            <li>Most people know that professionals reccommend changing shampoos ever so often as using one product for a prolonged period of time will leave its own \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of build up.</li>
            <li>Like a lot of people I find a lot of Axe&#x27;s scents to be overpowering, however, I was pleasantly suprised at how mild this shampoo was.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and masculine without being overpowering or too deodorant-like.  </li>
            <li>It does have a wonderful, nice clean scent and he said it made his hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>I do love this scent.  </li>
            <li>this is a sure hit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A cute marketing gimmick.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But at $5 or more per bottle, I rate it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>We absolutely LOVE the scent.     </li>
            <li>: I forgot to mention that I love the \\&quot;pop top\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This item is okay</li>
            <li>and he enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li>I love there stuff</li>
            <li>and I love the way my hair turned out.  </li>
            <li>What more can one ask of a shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can attest that it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent of the product is not overpowering, but it is not something that I find particulary appealing.  </li>
            <li>Basically, sex sells, and this product is sure to sell as well.</li>
            <li>It will, however, make your hair clean and it will smell amazing.</li>
            <li>A great product that I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - this shampoo smells great and works well for normal to somewhat oily hair.</li>
            <li>shampoo itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent was quite pleasing, not too strong like most men&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>VERY FULL BODY LOOK</li>
            <li>Nothing like a man with a soft beard that is great to snuggle with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great lather, great smell, just hard to get out.</li>
            <li>Axe Primed Just Clean shampoo will probably get ordered by me again since I enjoyed the smell</li>
            <li>So, not only did I wash my hair with this wonderful product, I had to wash other areas (lol)</li>
            <li>On the positive side, the shampoo does not have an overpowering scent; it effectively cleans my hair; I do not need a cream rinse when using this</li>
            <li>But some people like to waste money I guess, and if you are one of these people, this shampoo might be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li>for smell, I have noticed when I put this on in the shower that it has a light coconut smell to it.</li>
            <li>the Unilever-manufactured brand is available in a line of deodorant bodysprays, deodorant and anti-perspirant sticks, shower gels and hair care products.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, the deep blue color of this shampoo is reall good if you&#x27;ve got any light-colored highlights as it keeps them looking nice and bright and keeps them from getting an orange tint.  </li>
            <li>Flags\\&quot;, which was a collection of nine fragrances purportedly taken from nine Western cultures, like Sweden, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, etc....</li>
            <li>B001G7PTSO Redken For Men Go Clean Shampoo, 10-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li>just gets your hair clean...</li>
            <li>it gets your hair clean, and it smells manly too.  </li>
            <li>When I opened the bottle I actually had to smell it twice because I was expecting to be overpowered but was instead greeted with a rather pleasant, clean aroma.  </li>
            <li>Just Clean Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;AXE De-Glue Shampoo+Scrub features rock crystals and removes product build-up</li>
            <li>++ The Pros +++&lt;br /&gt;+ Rinses clean, no residue&lt;br</li>
            <li>it be nice if Madison Ave. was as adventurous as it was back then?</li>
            <li>(I can attest to this myself) and gets his hair clean.</li>
            <li>A REFRESHINGLY CLEAN FEELING FOR THE SCALP.</li>
            <li>So trying a new product for a while and then going back to your own preferred brand is a good idea for effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Hubby said that this is a product he will most certainly use again.</li>
            <li>It does a good job and has left my hair clean.  </li>
            <li>and I have used it also so that I may write a fair and objective review.  </li>
            <li>Good overall product,</li>
            <li>so I use it up quickly...</li>
            <li>I take really quick showers</li>
            <li>However, once you start to use it, the color fades out quickly and it does not seem to stain anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very manly and not too strong.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in your hair, provides plenty of lather, but other than that there is nothing special about it, there is no tingling sensation or anything like that.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and snaps shut tightly, meaning that it is great for the gym bag or overnight case.</li>
            <li>When I first got the bottle of Axe Just Clean shampoo</li>
            <li>It seems to be fairly concentrated, you don&#x27;t need much, and it may be a little stronger detergent than what I am used to (what ever my adorable bride buys).  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat more viscous than other shampoos but did not make my hair smell good or add new depth to it.</li>
            <li>If you need an electric blue shampoo that smells good and has a very highly engineered cap, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li>Why can&#x27;t more brands have the classy smell of Brut, CanoÃª or Aqua De Silva?</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T GET EXCITED ABOUT SHAMPOOS,HOWEVER THIS ONE WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too overpowering and just right.  </li>
            <li>It certainly appears to get my hair clean, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special beyond that.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a cost-effective shampoo that will get you clean and ready for the day</li>
            <li>alright, he felt more strongly that it made his hair very dry</li>
            <li>I was looking for a shampoo that gave my hear a good, deep down clean!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve come to like Axe pretty well.  </li>
            <li>;-) )</li>
            <li>that have been haunting drug store retail shelves since Sun Ray opened its first branch.</li>
            <li>My favorite personal part about this shampoo is the scent.</li>
            <li>There are no pheromones listed in the ingredients; so unfortunately if you are a man with no personality, you&#x27;re still pretty much screwed - unless you are very, very attractive or have lots of money, in which case you could probably use horse shampoo and still attract the females.</li>
            <li>Its bright neon blue color looks as if it would glow under black light if I had one in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo states clearly that it is a product manufactured for males.</li>
            <li>Much to my clear satisfaction, Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo worked like a dream.     </li>
            <li>, This Shampoo is no different and it gets hair clean which it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li>If they would have designed the bottle as the kind you can leave upside down</li>
            <li>Easy pop-open cover, with a tiny spout</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks and not a single person of either sex has said anything to me about my hair, how great it smells, etc.</li>
            <li>I have always been curious about the Axe products, because of their sexy ads.  </li>
            <li>That made things much easier.</li>
            <li>in fact, I use it for my whole body instead of soap</li>
            <li>just be careful guys about getting it into some places where best not to (I learned), or you will burn like crazy when peeing, only thing I dislike about using like soap...just a word to the wise....</li>
            <li>It is a very convenient design.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>My wife seems to like it though, so that is all that really matters.  </li>
            <li>I really like the way my husband&#x27;s hair smells when he uses this product.</li>
            <li>LOL     Long story short, I went out of town with the above shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was easy on my hair and didn&#x27;t make it frizzy, even after I blowed it dry.</li>
            <li>Not only did my hubby like the scent, the clean feeling of his hair and beard</li>
            <li>The only drawback he has noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some shampoos, but it does rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue on the hair.</li>
            <li>So, having previously experienced some the of Axe product line (typically the body wash stuff), I was curious to see what the shampoo was like.</li>
            <li>If not, that&#x27;s ok because Unilever has plenty of other less sexy hair products for you to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I think of it, this has a different scent then any other male shampoo out there, and I guarantee that your special lady will love it!</li>
            <li>Thicker than most shampoos, which means you use less.</li>
            <li>It is a deep sea blue with flecks of silver and it smells wonderfully fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>Mainly I like the scent</li>
            <li>Seems to do a decent job cleaning hair.    </li>
            <li>I bought this with Axe Pure Soft conditioner</li>
            <li>would certainly have no trouble recommending this product.</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick lather</li>
            <li>It has a very nice but not overpowering scent that is slightly musky and slightly spicy.</li>
            <li>My husband also liked the scent, but he said that his hair was sqeaky clean after using it(maybe just a little too harsh of a shampoo?).</li>
            <li>and they were actually distinct from each other, and NONE of them smelled like the archetypical, cheap, American cologne....</li>
            <li>The Axe Just Clean has a very masculine \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent that perks you up a little first thing in the morning, I like it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking around for a new shampoo to use, you would do well to try this one out.</li>
            <li>My husband totally loves this shampoo and it is no longer available locally</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to it with my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>the bright side, the shampoo is pretty thick, so a dime sized application was enough for my short hair.</li>
            <li>I go to the gym daily, and swim a lot, so my hair can get pretty stringy.  </li>
            <li>So far this product has done the job!</li>
            <li>and it left my face feeling super clean without any harsh drying effects.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up really thick and rich and does a fantastic job of totally cleansing hair, even if you happen to use a lot of spiking product, gel, or pomade.   </li>
            <li>gimmicky packaging with novelty flip-top that detaches easily from product.</li>
            <li>(does not dry out my hair); and the cap is very well designed (press a button and it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many varieties/scents of Axe, and this one is one of the most ordinary, \\&quot;least special\\&quot;, unmemorable of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li>This is a very thick blue colored shampoo and it does not require much to really do a good job of cleaning my hair.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this shampoo for my teenage son, but found its overpowering scent too much for my sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>Anti-Dandruff Shampoo+Conditioner offers zinc-based dandruff control</li>
            <li>Just Soft Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;AXE</li>
            <li>The scent is masculine, yes, but not so over powering that</li>
            <li>I felt self conscious using it.</li>
            <li>Miss the old formula.</li>
            <li>and the ladies do like the soft hair as it turns out...</li>
            <li>I got this for my son who is 12 years old.  </li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin and sometimes some fragrances in soaps cause him to have a skin flare up</li>
            <li>but so far this hasn&#x27;t happened with this</li>
            <li>The manufacturer&#x27;s strange marketing slogan doesn&#x27;t do anything positive to the marketability of this product.</li>
            <li>Big enough to hold a good amount of shampoo, but not so big as to hard to pickup while in the bath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The high price makes it lesser of a value to me</li>
            <li>This is definitely formulated for men and targets normal to oily hair that has not been permed or dyed.     </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to mess with various products to get clean and get out among the busy in life.</li>
            <li>asked him if he felt it left his hair clean, and he said yes, but a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a bit strong but 12 year old boys usually smell pretty bad most of the time</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, of course, AXE and Unilever have just recently launched their new hair care line of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products especially for men including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but he also like the way the bottle was so much easier to use than that of other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>The extra money apparently pays for the \\&quot;girl approved\\&quot; marketing campaign and the fancy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyhow, Axe is a bit more expensive than some products that you can buy in the supermarket, but a decent value when you consider how long a bottle will last you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>B001G7PM3G American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo for Men, Normal to Dry, 15.2-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It is very dry once you apply this stuff, but once the conditioner is on, it makes it so soft</li>
            <li>The bottle is slick with it&#x27;s gradient color from a dark electric blue to dark blue, I also found the shape easy to hold onto, which is important in slick shower conditions.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nicely sized bottle.</li>
            <li> It smells so nice like</li>
            <li> Pro: nice scent, not tacky or overpowering.</li>
            <li> I must say after he used the shampoo his beard puffed up really nicely.  </li>
            <li> It succeeds both as a shampoo AND a body wash, in my view - clean and fresh smelling, it did the trick for my five-minute showers - perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair super clean without stripping your hair, smells fantastic, looks beautiful and is packaged perfectly!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Axe products will get you ultra-hot women like the commercials suggest but the one thing they will do is get you clean!!  </li>
            <li> so it must be pretty good!</li>
            <li> Scent is pleasant, bottle design was well thought out for easy use and the shampoo does a good job of cleaning the hair while still washing out cleanly.</li>
            <li> Most people know that professionals reccommend changing shampoos ever so often as using one product for a prolonged period of time will leave its own \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of build up.</li>
            <li> Like a lot of people I find a lot of Axe&#x27;s scents to be overpowering, however, I was pleasantly suprised at how mild this shampoo was.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant and masculine without being overpowering or too deodorant-like.  </li>
            <li> It does have a wonderful, nice clean scent and he said it made his hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I do love this scent.  </li>
            <li> this is a sure hit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A cute marketing gimmick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But at $5 or more per bottle, I rate it 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> We absolutely LOVE the scent.     </li>
            <li> : I forgot to mention that I love the \\&quot;pop top\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This item is okay</li>
            <li> and he enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> I love there stuff</li>
            <li> and I love the way my hair turned out.  </li>
            <li> What more can one ask of a shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can attest that it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent of the product is not overpowering, but it is not something that I find particulary appealing.  </li>
            <li> Basically, sex sells, and this product is sure to sell as well.</li>
            <li> It will, however, make your hair clean and it will smell amazing.</li>
            <li> A great product that I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - this shampoo smells great and works well for normal to somewhat oily hair.</li>
            <li> shampoo itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent was quite pleasing, not too strong like most men&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> VERY FULL BODY LOOK</li>
            <li> Nothing like a man with a soft beard that is great to snuggle with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great lather, great smell, just hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Axe Primed Just Clean shampoo will probably get ordered by me again since I enjoyed the smell</li>
            <li> So, not only did I wash my hair with this wonderful product, I had to wash other areas (lol)</li>
            <li> On the positive side, the shampoo does not have an overpowering scent; it effectively cleans my hair; I do not need a cream rinse when using this</li>
            <li> But some people like to waste money I guess, and if you are one of these people, this shampoo might be perfect for you.  </li>
            <li> for smell, I have noticed when I put this on in the shower that it has a light coconut smell to it.</li>
            <li> the Unilever-manufactured brand is available in a line of deodorant bodysprays, deodorant and anti-perspirant sticks, shower gels and hair care products.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, the deep blue color of this shampoo is reall good if you&#x27;ve got any light-colored highlights as it keeps them looking nice and bright and keeps them from getting an orange tint.  </li>
            <li> Flags\\&quot;, which was a collection of nine fragrances purportedly taken from nine Western cultures, like Sweden, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, etc....</li>
            <li> B001G7PTSO Redken For Men Go Clean Shampoo, 10-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;8.</li>
            <li> just gets your hair clean...</li>
            <li> it gets your hair clean, and it smells manly too.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I actually had to smell it twice because I was expecting to be overpowered but was instead greeted with a rather pleasant, clean aroma.  </li>
            <li> Just Clean Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;AXE De-Glue Shampoo+Scrub features rock crystals and removes product build-up</li>
            <li> ++ The Pros +++&lt;br /&gt;+ Rinses clean, no residue&lt;br</li>
            <li> it be nice if Madison Ave. was as adventurous as it was back then?</li>
            <li> (I can attest to this myself) and gets his hair clean.</li>
            <li> A REFRESHINGLY CLEAN FEELING FOR THE SCALP.</li>
            <li> So trying a new product for a while and then going back to your own preferred brand is a good idea for effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Hubby said that this is a product he will most certainly use again.</li>
            <li> It does a good job and has left my hair clean.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it also so that I may write a fair and objective review.  </li>
            <li> Good overall product,</li>
            <li> so I use it up quickly...</li>
            <li> I take really quick showers</li>
            <li> However, once you start to use it, the color fades out quickly and it does not seem to stain anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very manly and not too strong.  </li>
            <li> It feels good in your hair, provides plenty of lather, but other than that there is nothing special about it, there is no tingling sensation or anything like that.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and snaps shut tightly, meaning that it is great for the gym bag or overnight case.</li>
            <li> When I first got the bottle of Axe Just Clean shampoo</li>
            <li> It seems to be fairly concentrated, you don&#x27;t need much, and it may be a little stronger detergent than what I am used to (what ever my adorable bride buys).  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat more viscous than other shampoos but did not make my hair smell good or add new depth to it.</li>
            <li> If you need an electric blue shampoo that smells good and has a very highly engineered cap, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t more brands have the classy smell of Brut, CanoÃª or Aqua De Silva?</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T GET EXCITED ABOUT SHAMPOOS,HOWEVER THIS ONE WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too overpowering and just right.  </li>
            <li> It certainly appears to get my hair clean, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special beyond that.  </li>
            <li> you are looking for a cost-effective shampoo that will get you clean and ready for the day</li>
            <li> alright, he felt more strongly that it made his hair very dry</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that gave my hear a good, deep down clean!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve come to like Axe pretty well.  </li>
            <li> ;-) )</li>
            <li> that have been haunting drug store retail shelves since Sun Ray opened its first branch.</li>
            <li> My favorite personal part about this shampoo is the scent.</li>
            <li> There are no pheromones listed in the ingredients; so unfortunately if you are a man with no personality, you&#x27;re still pretty much screwed - unless you are very, very attractive or have lots of money, in which case you could probably use horse shampoo and still attract the females.</li>
            <li> Its bright neon blue color looks as if it would glow under black light if I had one in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo states clearly that it is a product manufactured for males.</li>
            <li> Much to my clear satisfaction, Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo worked like a dream.     </li>
            <li> , This Shampoo is no different and it gets hair clean which it is supposed to do!</li>
            <li> If they would have designed the bottle as the kind you can leave upside down</li>
            <li> Easy pop-open cover, with a tiny spout</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks and not a single person of either sex has said anything to me about my hair, how great it smells, etc.</li>
            <li> I have always been curious about the Axe products, because of their sexy ads.  </li>
            <li> That made things much easier.</li>
            <li> in fact, I use it for my whole body instead of soap</li>
            <li> just be careful guys about getting it into some places where best not to (I learned), or you will burn like crazy when peeing, only thing I dislike about using like soap...just a word to the wise....</li>
            <li> It is a very convenient design.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> My wife seems to like it though, so that is all that really matters.  </li>
            <li> I really like the way my husband&#x27;s hair smells when he uses this product.</li>
            <li> LOL     Long story short, I went out of town with the above shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was easy on my hair and didn&#x27;t make it frizzy, even after I blowed it dry.</li>
            <li> Not only did my hubby like the scent, the clean feeling of his hair and beard</li>
            <li> The only drawback he has noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some shampoos, but it does rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> So, having previously experienced some the of Axe product line (typically the body wash stuff), I was curious to see what the shampoo was like.</li>
            <li> If not, that&#x27;s ok because Unilever has plenty of other less sexy hair products for you to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I think of it, this has a different scent then any other male shampoo out there, and I guarantee that your special lady will love it!</li>
            <li> Thicker than most shampoos, which means you use less.</li>
            <li> It is a deep sea blue with flecks of silver and it smells wonderfully fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> Mainly I like the scent</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent job cleaning hair.    </li>
            <li> I bought this with Axe Pure Soft conditioner</li>
            <li> would certainly have no trouble recommending this product.</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick lather</li>
            <li> It has a very nice but not overpowering scent that is slightly musky and slightly spicy.</li>
            <li> My husband also liked the scent, but he said that his hair was sqeaky clean after using it(maybe just a little too harsh of a shampoo?).</li>
            <li> and they were actually distinct from each other, and NONE of them smelled like the archetypical, cheap, American cologne....</li>
            <li> The Axe Just Clean has a very masculine \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent that perks you up a little first thing in the morning, I like it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking around for a new shampoo to use, you would do well to try this one out.</li>
            <li> My husband totally loves this shampoo and it is no longer available locally</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to it with my very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> the bright side, the shampoo is pretty thick, so a dime sized application was enough for my short hair.</li>
            <li> I go to the gym daily, and swim a lot, so my hair can get pretty stringy.  </li>
            <li> So far this product has done the job!</li>
            <li> and it left my face feeling super clean without any harsh drying effects.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up really thick and rich and does a fantastic job of totally cleansing hair, even if you happen to use a lot of spiking product, gel, or pomade.   </li>
            <li> gimmicky packaging with novelty flip-top that detaches easily from product.</li>
            <li> (does not dry out my hair); and the cap is very well designed (press a button and it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many varieties/scents of Axe, and this one is one of the most ordinary, \\&quot;least special\\&quot;, unmemorable of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.    </li>
            <li> This is a very thick blue colored shampoo and it does not require much to really do a good job of cleaning my hair.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo for my teenage son, but found its overpowering scent too much for my sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> Anti-Dandruff Shampoo+Conditioner offers zinc-based dandruff control</li>
            <li> Just Soft Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;AXE</li>
            <li> The scent is masculine, yes, but not so over powering that</li>
            <li> I felt self conscious using it.</li>
            <li> Miss the old formula.</li>
            <li> and the ladies do like the soft hair as it turns out...</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is 12 years old.  </li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin and sometimes some fragrances in soaps cause him to have a skin flare up</li>
            <li> but so far this hasn&#x27;t happened with this</li>
            <li> The manufacturer&#x27;s strange marketing slogan doesn&#x27;t do anything positive to the marketability of this product.</li>
            <li> Big enough to hold a good amount of shampoo, but not so big as to hard to pickup while in the bath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The high price makes it lesser of a value to me</li>
            <li> This is definitely formulated for men and targets normal to oily hair that has not been permed or dyed.     </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to mess with various products to get clean and get out among the busy in life.</li>
            <li> asked him if he felt it left his hair clean, and he said yes, but a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a bit strong but 12 year old boys usually smell pretty bad most of the time</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, of course, AXE and Unilever have just recently launched their new hair care line of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products especially for men including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he also like the way the bottle was so much easier to use than that of other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The extra money apparently pays for the \\&quot;girl approved\\&quot; marketing campaign and the fancy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyhow, Axe is a bit more expensive than some products that you can buy in the supermarket, but a decent value when you consider how long a bottle will last you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> B001G7PM3G American Crew Daily Moisturizing Shampoo for Men, Normal to Dry, 15.2-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It is very dry once you apply this stuff, but once the conditioner is on, it makes it so soft</li>
            <li> The bottle is slick with it&#x27;s gradient color from a dark electric blue to dark blue, I also found the shape easy to hold onto, which is important in slick shower conditions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the negative side of things, the color of the shampoo does make you wonder when you first go to use it if it will dye your skin blue!  </li>
            <li> I was having a tough time opening the bottle, It was not until a few days later that I realized that there was button you push on the front which releases the top.</li>
            <li> And it will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s fragrance joins the ranks of Old Spice, British Sterling, English Leather and half a zillion OTHER brands of mens&#x27; colognes/shaving creams/</li>
            <li> If you buy this, make sure you get Axe Just Soft conditioner to go along with it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> And it last a long time you only have to use a little</li>
            <li> But once I am done and my hair dry, the smell cannot be detected.  </li>
            <li> In our family the hair tends to be dry and some of us have chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does intend to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> B001EWF24M American Crew Active Shampoo for Men, Citrus Mint, 8.45-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]]&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> No comparable conditioner product, which means that any scent from Axe product is long-gone by the time hair care is completed (to date, not one person has uttered a single comment about my hair.</li>
            <li> What I did not know was that it might be the only thing between me being smelly and dirty and clean and man smelling.</li>
            <li> I remember there was a cologne collection a few decades back called \\&quot;Nine</li>
            <li> This is a blue colored shampoo with little or no significant smell.</li>
            <li> In fact, after I smelled my husband after using this shampoo, I went and got him some other Axe products.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is unlike any other I have every tried.  </li>
            <li> other thing that I like about Axe is the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews though.</li>
            <li> shampoo itself comes out with the consistency of Aunt Jemima syrup that has been sitting in a cold refrigerator for awhile, in other words, thick and gooey, but that&#x27;s part of what makes the shampoo worthwhile.</li>
            <li> B001EWF34Q Matrix Men Active Control</li>
            <li> like some reviewers say, it&#x27;s about average.  </li>
            <li> I typically use my shampoo as both a hair cleanser AND a body wash, no matter what it says on the label.</li>
            <li> Messy</li>
            <li> a messy, just-out-of-bed look&lt;br /&gt;AXE</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, and it isn&#x27;t terribly over bearing</li>
            <li> Were I rating this as an ordinary shampoo at $1 a bottle</li>
            <li> He has used it for the past week</li>
            <li> I am not really sure about that.</li>
            <li> Look Putty gives hair hold without the hard crunch of gel&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very thick, you have to shake it a lot to get shampoo out after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I do give it 2 stars for being thick and luxurious, but I would not choose to buy it separately.  </li>
            <li> For your hair, no better product in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I could smell him coming - and that was not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smell is weak and reminds me of coconuts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is very thick and concentrated</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a mediocre shampoo.</li>
            <li> Then I saw the sexist, male-demeaning \\&quot;girl-approved hair\\&quot; ads on TV and was a bit shocked that a company could air something so insulting and get no negative response for it.</li>
            <li> What is wrong with this society!?</li>
            <li> I really hate it when a product doesnt work as the ads intend it to.</li>

            <li> My husband totally loves this shampoo and it is no longer available locally so he was happy to know we can it via amazon.</li>
            <li> This is a blue colored shampoo with little or no significant smell. It is somewhat more viscous than other shampoos but did not make my hair smell good or add new depth to it. The manufacturer&#x27;s strange marketing slogan doesn&#x27;t do anything positive to the marketability of this product. It says on the bottle \\&quot;Get girl approved hair.\\&quot; Direction: \\&quot;Wash, attract, repeat.\\&quot;  Why would a man want a girl approved hair? A man likes to be himself to keep his own hair the way he likes it. I think this is just another shampoo added to an already crowded market that does not stand out distinctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.

            <li> I got this for my husband to try.  I have always been curious about the Axe products, because of their sexy ads.  I do love this scent.  In fact, after I smelled my husband after using this shampoo, I went and got him some other Axe products.

That made things much easier. The bottle is slick with it&#x27;s gradient color from a dark electric blue to dark blue, I also found the shape easy to hold onto, which is important in slick shower conditions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself comes out with the consistency of Aunt Jemima syrup that has been sitting in a cold refrigerator for awhile, in other words, thick and gooey, but that&#x27;s part of what makes the shampoo worthwhile. Its bright neon blue color looks as if it would glow under black light if I had one in my bathroom. The Axe Just Clean has a very masculine \\&quot;woodsy\\&quot; scent that perks you up a little first thing in the morning, I like it. It feels good in your hair, provides plenty of lather, but other than that there is nothing special about it, there is no tingling sensation or anything like that. The package itself states \\&quot;Simplicity For Your Head\\&quot;, although I&#x27;m still waiting to see if I have \\&quot;Girl Approved Hair\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if Axe products will get you ultra-hot women like the commercials suggest but the one thing they will do is get you clean!!  The &#x27;Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo, 12-Ounce Bottle&#x27; is a great smell, good performing product.  I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to it with my very sensitive skin and I smelled good and had a great experience with it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a cost-effective shampoo that will get you clean and ready for the day this is a sure hit!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> At 56 years of age I do not need \\&quot;girl approved\\&quot; hair. Nevertheless, I have been using this shampoo for a few weeks and not a single person of either sex has said anything to me about my hair, how great it smells, etc. So I think all this \\&quot;girl approved\\&quot; nonsense is just that - nonsense. A cute marketing gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo itself is pretty good. I have oily hair and must wash it daily. This is a very thick blue colored shampoo and it does not require much to really do a good job of cleaning my hair.  And it does do a good job.  But with regular shampoos (e.g., VO5) costing $1 per bottle, I have difficulty understanding why anyone would pay $5 for a bottle of this shampoo.  But some people like to waste money I guess, and if you are one of these people, this shampoo might be perfect for you.  The extra money apparently pays for the \\&quot;girl approved\\&quot; marketing campaign and the fancy bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for smell, I have noticed when I put this on in the shower that it has a light coconut smell to it. But once I am done and my hair dry, the smell cannot be detected.  And I consider it the purpose of cologne, not shampoo, to provide a pleasing body odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is 3 stars. Good shampoo and it does the job well on my oily hair. Thicker than most shampoos, which means you use less. The girl approved nonsense is just marketing hype. Smell is weak and reminds me of coconuts.  Were I rating this as an ordinary shampoo at $1 a bottle I would give it 5 stars. But at $5 or more per bottle, I rate it 3 stars.  The high price makes it lesser of a value to me</li>
            <li> great shampoo....no fancy perfumes etc. added...just gets your hair clean...in fact, I use it for my whole body instead of soap so I use it up quickly...therefore ordering online in bulk is cheapest way to do that.  just be careful guys about getting it into some places where best not to (I learned), or you will burn like crazy when peeing, only thing I dislike about using like soap...just a word to the wise....For your hair, no better product in my opinion!</li>
            <li> This is definitely formulated for men and targets normal to oily hair that has not been permed or dyed.     In our family the hair tends to be dry and some of us have chemically treated hair. So, after we each tried it once, we converted it to a body wash and are quite happy using it in that capacity.     We absolutely LOVE the scent.     ETA: I forgot to mention that I love the \\&quot;pop top\\&quot;. You press a button on the side of the cap and it pops open. It is a very convenient design.</li>
            <li> This is a  trick shampoo with a  pearlescent Harley Electric Blue color and does the job- it gets your hair clean, and it smells manly too.  I finally put my finger on it, the scent is a cross between sea breeze and pin- it&#x27;s very manly and not too strong.  It does a good job and has left my hair clean.  It seems to be fairly concentrated, you don&#x27;t need much, and it may be a little stronger detergent than what I am used to (what ever my adorable bride buys).  She wont use it because her hair is colored and its too \\&quot;harsh\\&quot; for colored hair she says.  I actually like its invigorating scent while I&#x27;m showering.  If you need an electric blue shampoo that smells good and has a very highly engineered cap, then this product is for you.</li>
            <li> I typically use my shampoo as both a hair cleanser AND a body wash, no matter what it says on the label. I take really quick showers and I don&#x27;t want to mess with various products to get clean and get out among the busy in life. So, having previously experienced some the of Axe product line (typically the body wash stuff), I was curious to see what the shampoo was like. Well, BINGO! It succeeds both as a shampoo AND a body wash, in my view - clean and fresh smelling, it did the trick for my five-minute showers - perfectly. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Like a lot of people I find a lot of Axe&#x27;s scents to be overpowering, however, I was pleasantly suprised at how mild this shampoo was.  When I opened the bottle I actually had to smell it twice because I was expecting to be overpowered but was instead greeted with a rather pleasant, clean aroma.  It certainly appears to get my hair clean, but it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special beyond that.  It&#x27;s shampoo, that&#x27;s all I expect.  I&#x27;d give it another star if you swear by Axe products and I&#x27;d take one away if you are on the opposite side of the spectrum.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo it works great and smells great. And it last a long time you only have to use a little this is a great buy!!!!</li>
            <li> This item is okay but I am not to big on the smell...</li>
            <li> Axe Primed \\&quot;Just Clean\\&quot; Shampoo - the name says it all!  This product leaves your hair super clean without stripping your hair, smells fantastic, looks beautiful and is packaged perfectly!  I got this shampoo for my husband to use and I have used it also so that I may write a fair and objective review.  The packaging/bottle itself is a great size, has a pop-up top button push feature and fits nicely on a bath shelf or in a shower caddy.  The look of this shampoo is awesome!  It is a deep sea blue with flecks of silver and it smells wonderfully fresh and clean.  The scent is not too overpowering and just right.  I also cleansed my face with the shampoo to see how it would handle the oil on my skin and it left my face feeling super clean without any harsh drying effects.  No wonder this product is so good. AXE- the Unilever-manufactured brand is available in a line of deodorant bodysprays, deodorant and anti-perspirant sticks, shower gels and hair care products. Axe is the No. 1 male Anti-Perspirant Deodorant brand and shower gel in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, of course, AXE and Unilever have just recently launched their new hair care line of shampoos, conditioners, and styling products especially for men including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AXE Just Clean Shampoo&lt;br /&gt;AXE De-Glue Shampoo+Scrub features rock crystals and removes product build-up&lt;br /&gt;AXE De-Poof Shampoo features a hydrating Kukui blend&lt;br /&gt;AXE Anti-Dandruff Shampoo+Conditioner offers zinc-based dandruff control&lt;br /&gt;AXE 2 in 1 Shampoo+Conditioner combines cleansing and conditioning&lt;br /&gt;AXE Just Soft Conditioner&lt;br /&gt;AXE Messy Look Paste gives hair a messy, just-out-of-bed look&lt;br /&gt;AXE Spiked-Up Look Putty gives hair hold without the hard crunch of gel&lt;br /&gt;AXE Clean-Cut Look Pomade gives guys polished look without appearing wet&lt;br /&gt;AXE Shaggy Look Cream gives longer manes an easygoing look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the AXE line of products!

            <li> Got this product for my husband to try. We had to both chuckle when we saw on the back of the bottle \\&quot;For girl approved hair\\&quot; After using it he came out of the shower and asked if I \\&quot;approved\\&quot;. It does have a wonderful, nice clean scent and he said it made his hair feel really soft. Most people know that professionals reccommend changing shampoos ever so often as using one product for a prolonged period of time will leave its own \\&quot;brand\\&quot; of build up. So trying a new product for a while and then going back to your own preferred brand is a good idea for effectiveness. Axe Primed Just Clean shampoo will probably get ordered by me again since I enjoyed the smell and he enjoyed the results.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is unlike any other I have every tried.  It&#x27;s is very thick and concentrated so you only need a tiny dollop in your palm.  It lathers up really thick and rich and does a fantastic job of totally cleansing hair, even if you happen to use a lot of spiking product, gel, or pomade.   The scent is very pleasant and masculine without being overpowering or too deodorant-like.  As an added bonus, the deep blue color of this shampoo is reall good if you&#x27;ve got any light-colored highlights as it keeps them looking nice and bright and keeps them from getting an orange tint.  A great product that I would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Axe for a while now.  I go to the gym daily, and swim a lot, so my hair can get pretty stringy.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of shampoo and I&#x27;ve come to like Axe pretty well.  Mainly I like the scent, it reminds me of pine cones.  Anyhow, Axe is a bit more expensive than some products that you can buy in the supermarket, but a decent value when you consider how long a bottle will last you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing that I like about Axe is the bottle.  It is sturdy and snaps shut tightly, meaning that it is great for the gym bag or overnight case.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many varieties/scents of Axe, and this one is one of the most ordinary, \\&quot;least special\\&quot;, unmemorable of the ones I&#x27;ve tried.    I do give it 2 stars for being thick and luxurious, but I would not choose to buy it separately.  I got mine in a gift pack.</li>
            <li> Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo states clearly that it is a product manufactured for males. That didn&#x27;t stop me from getting it because, well frankly, I wanted to smell it.     And yes. It smells divine. I figured I would try it out on myself and make my husband use it as well as my stepson. What I did not know was that it might be the only thing between me being smelly and dirty and clean and man smelling. LOL     Long story short, I went out of town with the above shampoo. I forgot to bring soap. So, not only did I wash my hair with this wonderful product, I had to wash other areas (lol) as well. Much to my clear satisfaction, Axe Primed Just Clean Shampoo worked like a dream.     As a shampoo, I noticed my hair smelled great all day. It was easy on my hair and didn&#x27;t make it frizzy, even after I blowed it dry. The scent is masculine, yes, but not so over powering that I felt self conscious using it. After all, it did save me from being totally stinky while on vacation!     I would recommend this shampoo to any and all users!     ***Natalie S. for Amazon Vine***</li>
            <li> +++ The Pros +++&lt;br /&gt;+ Rinses clean, no residue&lt;br /&gt;+ Scent is pleasant and not-overpowering&lt;br /&gt;+ \\&quot;pearlescent\\&quot; bluish liquid color (am I using shampoo or car paint here? ;-) )&lt;br /&gt;+ Easy pop-open cover, with a tiny spout (minimizes on residue)&lt;br /&gt;+ Nicely sized bottle. Big enough to hold a good amount of shampoo, but not so big as to hard to pickup while in the bath&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- The Cons ---&lt;br /&gt;- Product describes an \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; feeling to the shampoo. To me, \\&quot;invigorating\\&quot; is using something like a Teatree like shampoo where you can actually feel a tingling sensation. No such invigoration here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Final Comments&lt;br /&gt;Good price on a quality shampoo. Scent is pleasant, bottle design was well thought out for easy use and the shampoo does a good job of cleaning the hair while still washing out cleanly.</li>
            <li> My husband used this shampoo and was impressed with it at all.  Although he felt it cleaned his hair alright, he felt more strongly that it made his hair very dry (\\&quot;like a haystack\\&quot; is how he put it).  Although I thought it smelled good out of the bottle, I could not smell it on his hair, even immediately after he used it.  For a product like this I definitely thought the scent would (and shoul) stick around longer than opening the bottle.    We would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use just about everything AXE has! I love there stuff, This Shampoo is no different and it gets hair clean which it is supposed to do! The scent is great as is the scent of the shower gels and the two together work perfectly...Yup I am an AXE addict for life! Buy it, its great!</li>
            <li> If you have ever used those shampoos that come with the Gift Packs when you buy cologne, this is probably very similar to that stuff.  It has a nice smell, and it isn&#x27;t terribly over bearing like some reviewers say, it&#x27;s about average.  I bought this with Axe Pure Soft conditioner and I love the way my hair turned out.  It is very dry once you apply this stuff, but once the conditioner is on, it makes it so soft you won&#x27;t believe.  It smells so nice like a regular well groomed man should smell.  If you buy this, make sure you get Axe Just Soft conditioner to go along with it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered this shampoo for my teenage son, but found its overpowering scent too much for my sensitive nose.  I could smell him coming - and that was not a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked him if he felt it left his hair clean, and he said yes, but a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would not recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> #4711, this is not. Why is it all mainstream mens&#x27; toiletries smell the same, like some musky, oily male version of \\&quot;Evening in Paris\\&quot;? This stuff&#x27;s fragrance joins the ranks of Old Spice, British Sterling, English Leather and half a zillion OTHER brands of mens&#x27; colognes/shaving creams/after shaves/shampoos, etc. that have been haunting drug store retail shelves since Sun Ray opened its first branch. Why can&#x27;t more brands have the classy smell of Brut, CanoÃª or Aqua De Silva? I remember there was a cologne collection a few decades back called \\&quot;Nine Flags\\&quot;, which was a collection of nine fragrances purportedly taken from nine Western cultures, like Sweden, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, etc....and they were actually distinct from each other, and NONE of them smelled like the archetypical, cheap, American cologne....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if Madison Ave. was as adventurous as it was back then? Yeah...it would!</li>
            <li> Pro: nice scent, not tacky or overpowering. Seems to do a decent job cleaning hair.    Con: gimmicky packaging with novelty flip-top that detaches easily from product. No comparable conditioner product, which means that any scent from Axe product is long-gone by the time hair care is completed (to date, not one person has uttered a single comment about my hair. Even my wife hasn&#x27;t noticed it. And scent is Axe&#x27;s sole selling point!).    I like the product, but just as a basic men&#x27;s shampoo. Don&#x27;t expect anything beyond the norm. Now let&#x27;s see if Axe can market this without the incredibly offensive, immature ad campaigns.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve changed it. almost like it has conditioner in it. Miss the old formula.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for my husband. As someone who is a bit of a shampoo snob, opting only to use Teatree shampoo, he was reluctant to use this product. While it may not produce the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; of Teatree, this shampoo smells great (I can attest to this myself) and gets his hair clean. What more can one ask of a shampoo?&lt;br /&gt;I would certainly have no trouble recommending this product.</li>
            <li> No filler. no bs.  I guess it smells good.  and the ladies do like the soft hair as it turns out...</li>
            <li> Great that it doesn&#x27;t include a conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo that gave my hear a good, deep down clean! So far this product has done the job!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for men. It has a nice thick lather and I like the blue color to it :p. My favorite personal part about this shampoo is the scent. Now that I think of it, this has a different scent then any other male shampoo out there, and I guarantee that your special lady will love it! Another good thing is that you can find it anywhere. Now go get it. :P</li>
            <li> arrived promptly and as promised</li>
            <li> I got this for my son who is 12 years old.  He has used it for the past week and I have to say that his hair looks really good.  The fragrance is a bit strong but 12 year old boys usually smell pretty bad most of the time so this is an improvement.  My son has sensitive skin and sometimes some fragrances in soaps cause him to have a skin flare up but so far this hasn&#x27;t happened with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thinks he&#x27;s hoping to be like the guy on the commercial (with all the women chasing after him).  I can attest that it hasn&#x27;t happened yet. :)</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T GET EXCITED ABOUT SHAMPOOS,HOWEVER THIS ONE WORKS VERY WELL FOR ME. VERY FULL BODY LOOK AFTER I USED IT PLUS A REFRESHINGLY CLEAN FEELING FOR THE SCALP. WILL DEFINITELY PURCHASE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> Tried the shampoo and wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed. It&#x27;s just a mediocre shampoo. Then I saw the sexist, male-demeaning \\&quot;girl-approved hair\\&quot; ads on TV and was a bit shocked that a company could air something so insulting and get no negative response for it. If an ad showed men searching out and attacking a woman in such a way, it would be off the air in a moment. What is wrong with this society!? Last time I spend my money on Unilever products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for just over a month.  On the positive side, the shampoo does not have an overpowering scent; it effectively cleans my hair; I do not need a cream rinse when using this (does not dry out my hair); and the cap is very well designed (press a button and it springs open).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the negative side of things, the color of the shampoo does make you wonder when you first go to use it if it will dye your skin blue!  This has to be the deepest blue color that I have seen in any product.  However, once you start to use it, the color fades out quickly and it does not seem to stain anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the product is not overpowering, but it is not something that I find particulary appealing.  My wife seems to like it though, so that is all that really matters.  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am happy with the functionality of the product and I would have to give the cap design an A+ for ease of use!  Now, if they would only get rid of all of the color agent in it!</li>
            <li> I got this through the vine program and gave it to my son.  He loved it and said the scent was \\&quot;manly.\\&quot;  He actually wanted me to go buy him some at the store so it must be pretty good!</li>
            <li> Not only did my hubby like the scent, the clean feeling of his hair and beard but he also like the way the bottle was so much easier to use than that of other shampoos.  I must say after he used the shampoo his beard puffed up really nicely.  Nothing like a man with a soft beard that is great to snuggle with.&lt;br /&gt;The scent was quite pleasing, not too strong like most men&#x27;s products.  Hubby said that this is a product he will most certainly use again.</li>
            <li> Contrary to Axe&#x27;s primary marketing strategy, this product will not attract women to you with some sort of secret ingredient. It will, however, make your hair clean and it will smell amazing. There are no pheromones listed in the ingredients; so unfortunately if you are a man with no personality, you&#x27;re still pretty much screwed - unless you are very, very attractive or have lots of money, in which case you could probably use horse shampoo and still attract the females. Basically, sex sells, and this product is sure to sell as well. If not, that&#x27;s ok because Unilever has plenty of other less sexy hair products for you to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - this shampoo smells great and works well for normal to somewhat oily hair. If you are looking around for a new shampoo to use, you would do well to try this one out.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this product is the bottle. The shampoo is very thick, you have to shake it a lot to get shampoo out after just a few uses.  If they would have designed the bottle as the kind you can leave upside down I would have given it 5 stars. Great lather, great smell, just hard to get out.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my husband&#x27;s hair smells when he uses this product. It has a very nice but not overpowering scent that is slightly musky and slightly spicy. The only drawback he has noticed is that it doesn&#x27;t lather as well as some shampoos, but it does rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t leave any filmy residue on the hair. Good overall product, but with this scent, it is definitely made for a man.</li>
            <li> I really hate it when a product doesnt work as the ads intend it to. Great smell?? I am not really sure about that. You have to technically stick your nose inside the shampoo bottle to smell the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, the shampoo is pretty thick, so a dime sized application was enough for my short hair. And it will last you a long time. I agree with the other reviews though. The shampoo does intend to dry your hair.</li>
