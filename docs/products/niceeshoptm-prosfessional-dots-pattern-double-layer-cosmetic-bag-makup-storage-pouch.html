            <li> I Received the bag early. It was a little smaller then I excepted otherwise it was good and works well for traveling</li>
            <li> NOT AS LOOKS IN PICTURE. PRODUCT COMES FLATTENED OUT. I THOUGHT IT WAS A HARD SHELL TYPE OF CABOODLE, BUT STILL IS A NICE PRODUCT. ZJUST NOT AS EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> Alot smaller that it appears!</li>
            <li> Cute. As pictured. I haven&#x27;t used the one purchased for myself yet but I did give one as a Christmas gift. I haven&#x27;t heard anything bad this far.</li>
            <li> Much smaller than I though it would be but other than that it is fine, and fun colors :) So far seems like good quality.</li>
            <li> much smaller than i expected</li>
            <li> This is perfect! I have a big caboodle, and it&#x27;s hard to travel with. This is perfect to fit in my suitcase! I love that it has 2 compartments, and a section for the brushes.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Works great except zipper alittle hard sometime</li>
            <li> For the price it was good.</li>
            <li> Came earlier than expected and exactly as described. Would define ty purchase from seller again.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it. Went well her decor in her room</li>
            <li> It is not black inside, it is cream color. Also, it arrived later than I expected.</li>
            <li> Ordered this bag in black and pink, but got black and beige instead. It is a gift, but I will keep it. Too much trouble to send back.</li>
            <li> Good item good price . Works for our needs</li>
            <li> It is much smaller that the pictures lead you to believe.  Always make sure to read the measurements in the descriptions.  My wife still uses it daily for her essentials, but only because her nicer one started to fall apart.  I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad product, just small.  Would probably be perfect as a toiletry bag or for a little girl just starting on makeup however.</li>
            <li> Awesome purchase I absolutely Love my traveling cosmetic bag!!!!I&lt;br /&gt;I can quickly grab it n go if I&#x27;m running late, I can fit a lot of brushes in the top compartment and in the bottom even more spacious can fit all ur daily makeup. Great Purchase</li>

            <li> This is such a cute bag.  I put most of my high end designer makeup in it, and it&#x27;s been my constant companion. The zipper has been tried and tested constantly, and I have no complaints about it.  The color is amazing, and the bonus mirror on the inside is cute.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these to take over for my previous method for storing my makeup (a cardboard box). These are not only perfectly sized, but they function great! I love the color, it is vibrant and the item is well made. I found these bags a GREAT value for the price.</li>
            <li> It came from China but came very quickly! Due to packaging it&#x27;s mashed down but I stuffed with socks for about a week then filled with makeup and it&#x27;s perfect. Satiney finish, nice pockets for brushes, and 2 separate layers with their own zippers. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price! I ordered 1 from this company and 1 from another and they&#x27;re exactly the same. Nice size also</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of cometics. Very convenient.</li>
            <li> Has lot of space, got a lot of my makeup products organized in it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big and not too small!!! I like it and can&#x27;t wait to travel with it. I put my bathroom stuff in it not make up.</li>
            <li> the uses for these cases are endless!I use one to keep my pills in.It has an upper and lower compartment,and youd be supprised how much you can store in it</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> cheap and really nice.</li>
            <li> Not as big as I expected, I have way more makeup than I thought.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of makeup, but I like to have an organized place to keep my things.  I use thins in a drawer and it fits very well.</li>
            <li> Great quality for a small makeup bag, I was able to fit a dozen nail polish, four Mascaras and one eye shadow quad in this bag</li>
            <li> I really thought i was buying a bag that was just a little larger but i can make due with it</li>
            <li> This bag was very nice, it took a long time to get though.</li>
