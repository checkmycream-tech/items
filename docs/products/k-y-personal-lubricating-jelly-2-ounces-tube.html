            <li>Thats where this comes in so handy and to be honest</li>
            <li>a lot and the pack of 4 is a super good buy</li>
            <li>The 2oz sizes would make it easy to slip one into luggage, which is nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the product and when you add the quick shipping and price, you can&#x27;t ask for any better.  </li>
            <li>The liquid is better.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s not super sticky or gross afterwards, washes away clean.</li>
            <li>but it also means that it does not dry up quickly,and so if your concerned about it drying up then dont be .</li>

    <ol>
            <li> what&#x27;s not to like about it??</li>
            <li> This is just too sticky. The liquid is better.</li>
            <li> All four tubes expire in fourteen weeks... I&#x27;d have to be a porn star to use all it&lt;br /&gt;before Jan 1st  2014</li>
            <li> So my husband and I got several toys to have some fun with and spice up the marriage. We needed some &amp;#34;lube&amp;#34; so we just went with the good ol&#x27; KY.  I thought it had a nice feel about it, but I can see how it gets a bit sticky after awhile.  Overall though, it did the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope it helps, and hope you all have as much fun with this as we did!! :-)</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot and the pack of 4 is a super good buy, I recommend it with no problem!</li>
            <li> Well, you know .. works great!</li>
            <li> Nice liquidy and washed quickly.  Won&#x27;t sting vagina.  Slippery.  Nice effect.  Washes off in seconds.  Truly a different product.  No smell.  Not greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really put anything in this review that others haven&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s KY, it&#x27;s been around for years for a reason: it works.  The 2oz sizes would make it easy to slip one into luggage, which is nice.  Great product.</li>
            <li> A lot of times when your too tired , your body just doesnt lubricate itself how it should. Thats where this comes in so handy and to be honest i have tried a few different ones and there is nothing out there like KY. It feels a little more sticky but in a slippery way, as in its thicker than the others but it also means that it does not dry up quickly,and so if your concerned about it drying up then dont be . Have used it in long sessions (45 min to an hour) and no problems what soever. Even if you do feel lit getting a little dry, just another drop and everything goes back to normal, for me the sensation this provides is also just different. Everything just feels better.</li>
            <li> I started on medication that makes me drier than a dessert and this works wonders for the drying out and it&#x27;s not super sticky or gross afterwards, washes away clean. Sex is more pleasurable now.</li>
            <li> Slide in and out smoothly ;)</li>
            <li> Lousy product. Sticky. Fast delivery. AS advertised and described in listing. Color is correct. Size is appropriate. Easy to handle. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Everything OK.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You</li>
            <li> The K-Y Jelly works great, and the value of the 4 pack is great. It also saves me an embarrassing trip to Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> i was in and out like a jelly fish.....stuff works i tell ya. Picking up my lady and its on like donkey kong. lol</li>
            <li> Not good for self lubrication</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the product and when you add the quick shipping and price, you can&#x27;t ask for any better.  I read in a previous review a complaint about the product expiration date being only 4 months out.  One of the 4 of mine were and the others were even farther out but what the heck!  Considering the price and the fact that you didn&#x27;t have to buy it in the store (me being a little embarrassed to buy such things especially when you have teenagers as cashiers :)), it is well worth your money.</li>
