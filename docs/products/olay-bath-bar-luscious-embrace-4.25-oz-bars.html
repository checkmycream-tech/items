            <li> I am stockpiling this discontinued soap, I just love it!  I haven&#x27;t been able to find a substitute.  So happy there are still some available. I wish Procter and Gamble would bring it back!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because it describes the level of satisfaction that I experienced with this soap.  The scent is lasting and it messages the boy. The scent is beautiful.  The only con is that it is so soft that it uses up easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have used for about a year. I had trouble finding it in the store, so luckily I found it on amazon.  It is very moisturizing, and smells great.  I hope I will be able to continue to find it on amazon.</li>

            <li> I thought there will be 8 counts of bars, 4ct in each pack, how come I only received 1 pack of Olay luscious embrace?</li>
            <li> This Olay body bar is the very best soap I have ever used.  It has a heavenly smell and the texture of the bar is not too hard&lt;br /&gt;which makes it much easier to use.  I hope it stays around forever.  I cannot find this soap in my city so ordering it from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon makes it perfect.</li>
            <li> One thing that &amp;#34;rubbed off&amp;#34; from my divorce was this dang soap! It smells great. Leaves my skin clean &amp; without dryness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they keep making this &amp; the other varieties forever.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product but as I stated in a note to Amazon, I only received one pack.  Since I did not receive a response I thought maybe a posting would get Amazon&#x27;s attention.  Thanks</li>

            <li> This soap is wonderful. I&#x27;ve been buying it from local stores for a while but suddenly I can&#x27;t find it anywhere, so I&#x27;m happy I can order it online. But the description is misleading - it says total of 8 bars and I received only 4. On the other hand it says - 4ct - 2 pack. Amazon - please fix the description. You are not getting what you have been promised.</li>
