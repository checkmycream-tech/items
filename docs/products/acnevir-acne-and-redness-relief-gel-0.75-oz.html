            <li>However it is a great spot treatment and shrinks your pimples and brings them closer to the surface.</li>
            <li>so I gave it a chance; and I am so happy I did.</li>
            <li>It works AMAZINGLY well and AND doesn&#x27;t bleach your sheets or clothes like acne medicine with benzoyl peroxide does!    </li>

            <li>This is amazing I struggle with acne</li>
            <li>For the price this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the best.</li>
            <li>I decided  to take matters into  my own hands.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also effective at treatment for pimples, which is an added bonus I didn&#x27;t expect.&lt;br /&gt;Try</li>
            <li>The kind of acne</li>
            <li>Came quick and is working great</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon Acnevir in the supermarket I am impressed with this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I have found it to be more effective than anything else.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found a product that really helps!</li>
            <li>Better than Murad and that used to be king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When using this I noticed my face would break out alot more.</li>
            <li>I tried Acnevir on a whim because I found a coupon in the newspaper for it, but I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>This product is Phenomenal.</li>
            <li>1)It&#x27;s almost odorless, unlike the Clearasil, which has a more noticeable sulfur smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many forms of it over the years and never has it done anything.</li>
            <li>I was sure I saw milligrams on the package, so I looked again.</li>
            <li>This gel Does help with some redness and acne but won&#x27;t completely clear the acne up just on its own.. feels good on your face and isn&#x27;t too drying</li>
            <li>I am definitely happy with the results so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s primary mode of effectiveness has to do with it&#x27;s ingredients being on the acidic side of the pH scale, which is healthy for skin and acts to pH balance skin after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Its worth trying, and I do recommend it to everyone who wants beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>first of all, super fast and excellent service from the shipper</li>
            <li>Then one day I read the fine print on the label.    </li>
            <li>this works fine on my blemishes that I get here and there around the face.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of acne before using this product and now my face is almost blemish free.</li>
            <li>I believe everyone would enjoy this product so I am recommending buying it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m cheap</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to finally have found something that works on my skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it super fabulous though.</li>
            <li>It has salicylic acid, which works the best for my skin, and can sometimes be hard to find in acne products.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s continuing to use it twice daily and is pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear, unlike Clearasil which has a tint that can look really orange on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I have almost nothing left on my chin, and the best part is, its only been a week!</li>
            <li>I didn’t need to make any huge changes to my diet as I was already eating pretty healthy, but I did start to drink more than 8 glasses of water a day and ever since I made those changes along with using Acnevir, I noticed an enormous difference!</li>
            <li>They are strong that it&#x27;ll make your eyes teary if you apply too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does dry your skin out a bit, so I would recommend getting a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the try.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing if you ask me, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best acne topical you can buy without a prescription.</li>
            <li>The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover work!</li>
            <li>/&gt;this product itself is ok, it seems to reduce redness and helps reduce the duration of a pimple a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>For the price, it worked 10x better than the prescription that I had to pay double for.</li>
            <li>Overall, Acnevir is okay.</li>
            <li>A 3x dilution means 1/1000 dilution of Salicylic acid is in the product, as opposed to a 1-2% solution in more traditional products.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Just be ready for the overwhelming odor of hot sulfur when you open your dryer.</li>
            <li>It keeps the monster zits from really forming a white head so they get more cystic looking.</li>
            <li>My skin is not totally clear yet, but I think it will keep getting better.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really help with my redness of my acne.</li>
            <li>and I put it on my whole face at night.</li>
            <li>THIS REALLY HELPS WITH REDNESS.</li>
            <li>I really  recommend these products.</li>
            <li>Since the price was so reasonable and the redness was my biggest issue, I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life, migrating from my forehead to chin</li>
            <li>i am not really quite sure if this helps or not..</li>
            <li>Nothing really working for me that well.</li>
            <li>the whole cycle would start over again.</li>
            <li>I use CeraVe PM formula, and that works really well for me.</li>
            <li>This stuff works okay, but certainly no miracle.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I wear less make-up now.</li>
            <li>I then got up the courage to look in the mirror, and almost cried when I saw that my previously bright red, rough marks were now very pale pink and smooth :3</li>
            <li>Homeopathic medicine is pure placebo as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but within 24 hours of using Acnevir, my face appeared healthier.  </li>
            <li>wasted my money on this for sure.</li>
            <li>I am 57, female,  have mild adult acne, rosacea, oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I am having a huge problem with acne &amp; my skin does not respond well at all to other acne treatments.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin is very sensitive, and I have not had an adverse reaction to</li>
            <li>I will probably try a couple of other products, and if I don&#x27;t find something I like better, I will come back to Acnevir as it is an acceptable alternative to the Clearasil.</li>
            <li>It also smells a bit because of the sulphur, but in my book that&#x27;s a small price to pay for clear skin and better self-confidence.</li>
            <li>Nutrogena rapid clear, its called stubborn  acne  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 24 yr old.</li>
            <li>I bought the Acnevir Acne &amp; Redness Relief Gel for my 27 yr old grandaughter and she has used as directed.</li>
            <li>and my acne is almost  completely  gone.</li>
            <li>For years I used Clearasil&#x27;s Adult Care (sulfur + resorcinol, no benzoyl peroxide) to keep my breakouts under control.</li>
            <li>It just does not work as well as the Clearasil Adult Care.</li>
            <li>25 year old woman here-</li>
            <li>I recommend anyone to give this a try even if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything.</li>
            <li>I get cystic acne, and this stuff got rid of budding cysts overnight.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried Clearasil facial marks wash and mask for 4 months which cleared up most of it, but I still had a few stubborn areas that wouldn’t go away.</li>
            <li>I just put the first application of Acnevir on last night and I noticed this morning the swelling of my acne has went down significantly and some finally came to a head.</li>
            <li>I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  </li>
            <li>He has breakouts and periods where his face is pretty clear, so I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s the Acnevir or just a period in which his skin is clear anyway.  </li>
            <li>Previously used this product when I became pregnant and my skin was breaking out a lot.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be when they&#x27;re dry though.</li>
            <li>Finally something clear that works on adult acne.</li>
            <li>This product is about the only thing that has ever helped clear up my skin when I break out.</li>
            <li>I had moments where they would almost clear up only to get infected and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been three days since I started applying Acnevir three times daily and my face is almost clear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only attacked my adult onset acne with a vengeance,  </li>
            <li>My main problem is the big red spots on my face left over from picking at my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a gel form and you need to be careful of when you apply it since it does not absorb into the skin very well and may leave a white flaky residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have normal break outs on my chin at times, and this has no affect one way or the other.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad; it helps a little, but if you have less sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t mind Clearsil Adult Care&#x27;s odd color and odor, I would recommend using that instead.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have adult acne, but lately my face has gotten noticeably bumpy.  </li>

            <li> My main problem is the big red spots on my face left over from picking at my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a gel form and you need to be careful of when you apply it since it does not absorb into the skin very well and may leave a white flaky residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have normal break outs on my chin at times, and this has no affect one way or the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad; it helps a little, but if you have less sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t mind Clearsil Adult Care&#x27;s odd color and odor, I would recommend using that instead.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have adult acne, but lately my face has gotten noticeably bumpy.  </li>
            <li> Both sides were clearing up at about the same rate, the acnevir side actually clearing up slightly later - possibly because it was slightly stickier on that side.    </li>
            <li> I have spent thousands of dollars on different acne treatments.</li>
            <li> They sting a bit too, but who cares as long as it does the job?</li>
            <li> It helps aleviate all rosea/acne on my forehead as long as I use it once a day after a shower and rub it into my skin thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This acne treatment is different than other acne treatments.</li>
            <li> Use with caution if you don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling \\&quot;gassy.\\&quot; Or wash your sheets separately and don&#x27;t dry them with your clothes.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the Acnevir because it has the same active ingredients as the Clearasil (although Clearasil does not have salicylic acid in it).</li>
            <li> I have been using a small amount day &amp; night for 2 days now &amp; my acne has almost completely disappeared.     </li>
            <li> As someone with sensitive skin who also gets small hives, I can say that those are also invisible.  </li>
            <li> It took down the redness and irritation on my face, and seemed to decrease my breakouts in the one week that I used it regularly.</li>
            <li> It seems costly but the tube lasts forever because you only need a little bit for the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that not all acne is the same so it may take you a little longer to get rid of them, just be patient.</li>
            <li> My entire face seems less red and less bumpy, and as I said previously, the change came within 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I use Acnevir everyday after washing my face, as a toner, and then follow up with moisturizer, and it has 100% totally cleared up my face.  </li>
            <li> not strong enough for night use, for that i use mario badescu drying lotion which is the bomb</li>
            <li> This little tube goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I wait a few minutes until it&#x27;s completely dry</li>
            <li> in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> &amp; after applying my face felt tight &amp; dryed out.</li>
            <li> This works well for me without being harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a topical antibiotic gel that just made things worse.</li>
            <li> So I gave this a try on one side for a few weeks</li>
            <li> dried me out and burned my face.</li>
            <li> BUT... after only using a thin layer on my face for a few nights my pillowcases and sheets smelled like sulfur.</li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re being washed with regular detergent, and I think the odor is gone from one of the pairs, the other pair still has a faint odor.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything from the most expensive to the least expensive and this is is it!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had acne my entire life, and it&#x27;s almost as bad now in middle age.</li>
            <li> My wife is also studying to become an aesthetician and uses it when she has small breakouts.</li>
            <li> I saw this treatment &amp; wanted to try it because it had sulfur in it, which was something that has worked well for me in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and started getting horrible acne that made me feel like I was back in high school</li>
            <li> but hard as hell to wash off.</li>
            <li> Sorry but complete fail here.</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer around the troubled spot before I go to bed and almost 95% of the time, they have been gone flat (healed) .</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated with deep, painful adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the difference, I recommend it for anyone who has the same problem I did, nasty looking red bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I mean, sulfur smells like sulfur!  </li>
            <li> Everything my dermatologist prescribed  made my ace worse.</li>
            <li> For instance I dapped around forehead and thin layers on both of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> have noticed a dramatic improvement in existing breakouts, redness, etc.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy.</li>
            <li> Very weak and diluted gel.</li>
            <li> The faint smell of sulfur took of bit of getting used to</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 10+ years of using that product, my skin began to have a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Boy was I mad when I tried this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne since a teenager</li>
            <li> I have tried every prescription and non-prescription product on the market, including antibiotics for one particularly bad episode.  </li>
            <li> So bad that when two pairs of my pants were put in the dryer with them AFTER the sheets were washed they came out reeking of sulfur.</li>
            <li> It is SO soothing on painful acne, probably from the sulfur which is used a lot in face masks.  </li>
            <li> I had was those annoying bumps that wouldn’t come to head; they would just sit there for weeks or months.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really help with my redness of my acne. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. The Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover work!</li>
            <li> Hands down the best acne topical you can buy without a prescription. Better than Murad and that used to be king.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearasil and the rest are jokers compared to Acnevir.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had bad acne since a teenager I&#x27;m a 24 yr old. Male with oily skin type. This product is about the only thing that has ever helped clear up my skin when I break out. My wife is also studying to become an aesthetician and uses it when she has small breakouts. It&#x27;s really the best. This little tube goes a long way!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was hoping it would help my redness out aswell. I have very sensitive skin. When using this I noticed my face would break out alot more. &amp; after applying my face felt tight &amp; dryed out. Now i&#x27;m currently using Eucerin products &amp; it works wonders!</li>
            <li> first of all, super fast and excellent service from the shipper&lt;br /&gt;this product itself is ok, it seems to reduce redness and helps reduce the duration of a pimple a tiny bit. I didn&#x27;t find it super fabulous though.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and am prone to acne because of it. I&#x27;ve been using Acnevir for about 3 weeks and am very impressed with the results. I had a lot of acne before using this product and now my face is almost blemish free. The amount of redness from the rosacea has been noticeably reduced. I apply it to my skin at bedtime after washing my face. I wait a few minutes until it&#x27;s completely dry then I apply a moisturizer. I am so happy I found a product that really helps!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and I&#x27;ve had acne my entire life, and it&#x27;s almost as bad now in middle age. But this stuff works! I apply it twice a day, and if I go a day or two without it, I start to break out again. If they ever stop making this product, I&#x27;ll cry a thousand tears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and started getting horrible acne that made me feel like I was back in high school so I researched acne spot treatments and found this gel. It works AMAZINGLY well and AND doesn&#x27;t bleach your sheets or clothes like acne medicine with benzoyl peroxide does!    It seems costly but the tube lasts forever because you only need a little bit for the spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought the Acnevir Acne &amp; Redness Relief Gel for my 27 yr old grandaughter and she has used as directed. It did not help in any way. She still has reddness and Acne on her cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> This is amazing I struggle with acne and I put it on my whole face at night. I notice total improvement in 2 weeks! For the price this stuff is amazing I have spent thousands of dollars on different acne treatments. You have to try this it really works!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 33 and have been suffering with acne since middle school. I have tried every prescription and non-prescription product on the market, including antibiotics for one particularly bad episode.  I have been using a retinoid for years to help control it and even that isn&#x27;t working anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon Acnevir in the supermarket I am impressed with this product so far.  It is SO soothing on painful acne, probably from the sulfur which is used a lot in face masks.  Which, yes...doesn&#x27;t smell awesome.  I mean, sulfur smells like sulfur!  But it&#x27;s only noticeable within about 6 inches of my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a dramatic improvement in existing breakouts, redness, etc. in less than a week.  I don&#x27;t know yet how well it will prevent future ones, but I am going to keep using it.  I&#x27;ll alternate it with my retinoid throughout the week.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but within 24 hours of using Acnevir, my face appeared healthier.  I don&#x27;t really have adult acne, but lately my face has gotten noticeably bumpy.  I tried Acnevir on a whim because I found a coupon in the newspaper for it, but I am extremely pleased with the results.  My entire face seems less red and less bumpy, and as I said previously, the change came within 24 hours.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Who would you recommend this product to? I believe everyone would enjoy this product so I am recommending buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 1 year now and I love it!  The faint smell of sulfur took of bit of getting used to but now I just don&#x27;t use it if I&#x27;m going out and going to be around people.</li>
            <li> I am 57, female,  have mild adult acne, rosacea, oily skin.  This works well for me without being harsh on skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff works okay, but certainly no miracle.</li>
            <li> I have had facial redness all my life. I read the reviews and decided to try this to my surprise i seen a difference in two uses.THIS REALLY HELPS WITH REDNESS.</li>
            <li> I was having a first time ever bout with adult acne and between this and investing in a clarisonic, my skin has cleared up completely and now only experience an occasional pimple.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I get so frustrated with deep, painful adult acne.  I&#x27;ve tried creams and medicine and everything short of the dermatologist (I&#x27;m cheap and I don&#x27;t need the bill).  I use Acnevir everyday after washing my face, as a toner, and then follow up with moisturizer, and it has 100% totally cleared up my face.  My husband uses it on his back and it has helped there too.  It&#x27;s primary mode of effectiveness has to do with it&#x27;s ingredients being on the acidic side of the pH scale, which is healthy for skin and acts to pH balance skin after cleansing.  It also inhibits bacteria growth that clogs pores.  This stuff works on acne in all its stages...</li>
            <li> This product is Phenomenal. I was suffering from an acne flare up, nothing was working. Everything my dermatologist prescribed  made my ace worse. I decided  to take matters into  my own hands. I began using a face wash by Nutrogena rapid clear, its called stubborn  acne  wash  along with Acnevir. I used both products  three times a day it&#x27;s only  my second  day  and my acne is almost  completely  gone. I really  recommend these products. Both can be found at Walmart I hope  this helps someone...</li>
            <li> This gel Does help with some redness and acne but won&#x27;t completely clear the acne up just on its own.. feels good on your face and isn&#x27;t too drying</li>
            <li> I am having a huge problem with acne &amp; my skin does not respond well at all to other acne treatments. My dermatologist gave me a topical antibiotic gel that just made things worse. I saw this treatment &amp; wanted to try it because it had sulfur in it, which was something that has worked well for me in the past. I have been using a small amount day &amp; night for 2 days now &amp; my acne has almost completely disappeared.     For the price, it worked 10x better than the prescription that I had to pay double for. It is really an awesome product.</li>
            <li> For years I used Clearasil&#x27;s Adult Care (sulfur + resorcinol, no benzoyl peroxide) to keep my breakouts under control. I have found it to be more effective than anything else. Unfortunately, after 10+ years of using that product, my skin began to have a bad reaction to it. It still keeps the acne under control, but now, for some reason, it gives me an itchy, eczema-like rash. So I decided to try the Acnevir because it has the same active ingredients as the Clearasil (although Clearasil does not have salicylic acid in it). I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now.    Pros: 1)It&#x27;s almost odorless, unlike the Clearasil, which has a more noticeable sulfur smell. 2) It&#x27;s clear, unlike Clearasil which has a tint that can look really orange on my fair skin. 3) It does not irritate my skin in any way.    Con: It just does not work as well as the Clearasil Adult Care. It&#x27;s not bad; it helps a little, but if you have less sensitive skin, and you don&#x27;t mind Clearsil Adult Care&#x27;s odd color and odor, I would recommend using that instead.    Overall, Acnevir is okay. I will probably try a couple of other products, and if I don&#x27;t find something I like better, I will come back to Acnevir as it is an acceptable alternative to the Clearasil.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product today and I&#x27;m already amazed by my results.  My main problem is the big red spots on my face left over from picking at my breakouts.  While at Walgreens today, I saw this product for $6 that advertised reducing redness.  Since the price was so reasonable and the redness was my biggest issue, I decided to give it a try.  After a few hours of having it on, I was feeling my face and the texture of it was much smoother.  I then got up the courage to look in the mirror, and almost cried when I saw that my previously bright red, rough marks were now very pale pink and smooth :3 I&#x27;m so happy to finally have found something that works on my skin.</li>
            <li> My son used this for several weeks. It is like putting nothing on your face. Homeopathic medicine is pure placebo as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I&#x27;ve tried many forms of it over the years and never has it done anything. A 3x dilution means 1/1000 dilution of Salicylic acid is in the product, as opposed to a 1-2% solution in more traditional products. Sorry but complete fail here.</li>
            <li> This acne treatment is different than other acne treatments. It comes in a gel form and you need to be careful of when you apply it since it does not absorb into the skin very well and may leave a white flaky residue on the skin. However it is a great spot treatment and shrinks your pimples and brings them closer to the surface.</li>
            <li> Boy was I mad when I tried this. Every now and then I get stress breakouts, so I was looking for something to try out. So I gave this a try on one side for a few weeks so I could compare to see if it cleared up or not. No difference. Both sides were clearing up at about the same rate, the acnevir side actually clearing up slightly later - possibly because it was slightly stickier on that side.    Then one day I read the fine print on the label.    \\&quot;Homeopathic Medicine\\&quot;    Sonofa-- I was sure I saw milligrams on the package, so I looked again. 3x, 1x, these are dilutions! To translate from homeopathese, thank you wikipedia ( [...]) the ingredients are thus:  0.01% Resourcinol  0.001% Salicylic Acid  0.1% Sulfur</li>
            <li> wasted my money on this for sure.</li>
            <li> Very weak and diluted gel. Try Acnomel instead.</li>
            <li> Previously used this product when I became pregnant and my skin was breaking out a lot.  I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it in the store.  It has salicylic acid, which works the best for my skin, and can sometimes be hard to find in acne products.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this on amazon but have to share! I&#x27;ve had acne my whole life, migrating from my forehead to chin once I hit adulthood.  I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. All the proactiv types, and 3 different redness reducers, including the one from proactiv. This is the ONLY thing that has ever worked for me, I&#x27;m just 2 days I can see the redness going away. As someone with sensitive skin who also gets small hives, I can say that those are also invisible.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference, I recommend it for anyone who has the same problem I did, nasty looking red bumps all over my face.  It&#x27;s also effective at treatment for pimples, which is an added bonus I didn&#x27;t expect.&lt;br /&gt;Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> i am not really quite sure if this helps or not..but i use it anyway daily on my pimples, underneath my makeup. not strong enough for night use, for that i use mario badescu drying lotion which is the bomb but hard as hell to wash off.</li>
            <li> It keeps the monster zits from really forming a white head so they get more cystic looking. I think it does keep them from coming somewhat. Nothing really working for me that well.</li>
            <li> I found this at my local walgreens for around $7-8. I was using bye bye blemish stuff from as seen on TV. I wish I could have found this earlier cause this works fine on my blemishes that I get here and there around the face. I put a thin layer around the troubled spot before I go to bed and almost 95% of the time, they have been gone flat (healed) . They are strong that it&#x27;ll make your eyes teary if you apply too much. For instance I dapped around forehead and thin layers on both of my cheeks. They sting a bit too, but who cares as long as it does the job? It&#x27;s totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> 25 year old woman here- I started to get acne around my jawline, chin and cheeks as well as my back and shoulders (all of the places I’ve never had it before!). I had moments where they would almost clear up only to get infected and the whole cycle would start over again. I’ve tried Clearasil facial marks wash and mask for 4 months which cleared up most of it, but I still had a few stubborn areas that wouldn’t go away. I just put the first application of Acnevir on last night and I noticed this morning the swelling of my acne has went down significantly and some finally came to a head. The kind of acne I had was those annoying bumps that wouldn’t come to head; they would just sit there for weeks or months. I recommend anyone to give this a try even if you have sensitive skin. Keep in mind that not all acne is the same so it may take you a little longer to get rid of them, just be patient. I didn’t need to make any huge changes to my diet as I was already eating pretty healthy, but I did start to drink more than 8 glasses of water a day and ever since I made those changes along with using Acnevir, I noticed an enormous difference!</li>
            <li> This product is terrific at removing the red color from blemishes.</li>
            <li> dried me out and burned my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually helps a lot. It took down the redness and irritation on my face, and seemed to decrease my breakouts in the one week that I used it regularly. BUT, and this is a big BUT... after only using a thin layer on my face for a few nights my pillowcases and sheets smelled like sulfur. So bad that when two pairs of my pants were put in the dryer with them AFTER the sheets were washed they came out reeking of sulfur. I&#x27;ve now soaked my pants in an entire bottle of woolite oxy fabric and upholstery cleaner/odor remover for 12 hours, and two boxes of baking soda for another 10 hours. Now they&#x27;re being washed with regular detergent, and I think the odor is gone from one of the pairs, the other pair still has a faint odor. The real test will be when they&#x27;re dry though. Use with caution if you don&#x27;t want to walk around smelling \\&quot;gassy.\\&quot; Or wash your sheets separately and don&#x27;t dry them with your clothes. Just be ready for the overwhelming odor of hot sulfur when you open your dryer.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to do anything.  I have normal break outs on my chin at times, and this has no affect one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you!  This is the best product for acne, blackeheads, whiteheads any type of acne.  I have tried everything from the most expensive to the least expensive and this is is it!  I am done looking.  I have found my product.  I urge anyone to not hesitate and give this a try.  It doesnt hurt to try and at the price of $7.00.  Worth the try.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It helps aleviate all rosea/acne on my forehead as long as I use it once a day after a shower and rub it into my skin thoroughly. I&#x27;ve been using this for about a year and wouldn&#x27;t do without it. I can go a couple days without using this before the symptoms return but I just use this consistantly every night to prevent that from happening. One tube will last a couple months if you&#x27;re conservative.  I used to use a sulphur only cream but switched to this since it has Salicylic Acid which helps prevent pimples as well as redness.</li>
            <li> gets rid of zits in like a day with no burning or redness</li>
            <li> hi. I buy your item one mounth ago but i did not reseve it yeat. so I want to know what is the problem, or whean i will get it. please reanswer me as soon as you can abaut the deliver details. alex bekauri</li>
            <li> Finally something clear that works on adult acne. Repeated purchases.</li>
            <li> My son has used this for a couple of weeks, and it does seem to reduce the redness of acne.  He has breakouts and periods where his face is pretty clear, so I&#x27;m not certain if it&#x27;s the Acnevir or just a period in which his skin is clear anyway.  I suspect it&#x27;s the Acnevir, and he thinks so, too.  He&#x27;s continuing to use it twice daily and is pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve struggled with adult acne for years, and I feel like I&#x27;ve tried everything. I even saw a dermatologist who prescribed four different topical treatments and an oral antibiotic, none of which worked. I bought Acnevir a week ago, and I definitely see a difference in my skin. I get cystic acne, and this stuff got rid of budding cysts overnight. My skin is not totally clear yet, but I think it will keep getting better. I am definitely happy with the results so far! Also, my skin is very sensitive, and I have not had an adverse reaction to Acnevir.&lt;br /&gt;It does dry your skin out a bit, so I would recommend getting a good moisturizer. I use CeraVe PM formula, and that works really well for me. It also smells a bit because of the sulphur, but in my book that&#x27;s a small price to pay for clear skin and better self-confidence.</li>
            <li> I had several breakouts on my chin and Ive tried everything; Noxzema, Clearasil Ultra, even Proactive. I went to walgreens to buy a 3 step acne system and instead saw Acnevir and decided to try it. It was amazing! My breakouts and redness left. I have almost nothing left on my chin, and the best part is, its only been a week! ;) I love this product because I wear less make-up now. Its worth trying, and I do recommend it to everyone who wants beautiful skin. &lt;3!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only attacked my adult onset acne with a vengeance,  but my skin is brighter, tighter and finer in texture.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been breaking out like crazy. At 25, I thought this problem would have been over years ago. I have tried everything... from the most expensive to homemade products and nothing worked. I read the reviews on Acnevir so I gave it a chance; and I am so happy I did. It&#x27;s been three days since I started applying Acnevir three times daily and my face is almost clear. Pretty amazing if you ask me, especially for the price. I definitely recommend Acnevir!!</li>
            <li> Came quick and is working great</li>
