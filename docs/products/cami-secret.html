    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>These are great!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>AND it provides excellent coverage!</li>
            <li>it went perfectly with out looking weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great when needed !!</li>
            <li>Good product!</li>
            <li>The concept is great</li>
            <li>The ones I have with snaps work great.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>I loved them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good replacement of cami&#x27;s in summer season.</li>
            <li>Very good product, light weight and comfy.</li>
            <li>It was just what I needed to give away as a stylish gift for teens who wanted to cover up and look great.</li>
            <li>They look nice, and have good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for those shirts that just aren&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>Nice idea, though.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I will make my own before I make this mistake again.  </li>
            <li>This product although a nice idea in theory</li>
            <li>Thought I would have to make my own</li>
            <li>I our my daughter own.</li>
            <li>Also not as nice a material as my others</li>
            <li>but honestly that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
            <li>She said these are great and more comfortable than having to wear layers.</li>
            <li>so it works fine and gives a good coverage.</li>
            <li>one was great, one ripped on first day of use!</li>
            <li>I gave it to my 12 year old daughter and it fits her perfectly, she weighs about 90 lbs and is 5&#x27;4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It looks really nice with whatever top</li>
            <li>And the seam on the edge had better be almost nonexistent, too.  </li>
            <li>A crafty person would do better to make their own version of this product but for those of us who don&#x27;t care to sew (or can&#x27;t) this will do.</li>
            <li>I will not buy any more.  </li>
            <li>Would be better if it was made out of heavier material, like tee shirt material.</li>
            <li>Adjustable snaps would work much better.</li>
            <li>so I had to order more.</li>
            <li>The elastic across the top made it so that, even if she bent over, she would still be well covered.</li>
            <li>Way better than sewing.</li>
            <li>that is much better...</li>
            <li>Works for most of what my wardrobe needs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but now they don&#x27;t have it, those are so much better.</li>
            <li>This would be better suited for prepubescent girls, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The lowest it can go is higher than most camis, so it doesn&#x27;t look good under every shirt or dress.</li>
            <li>What a shame to have such a perfect product and ruin it with cheap ways of getting by.</li>
            <li>Easy to use .</li>
            <li>The snaps easily attach to your bra straps and eliminate the cleavage problem.</li>
            <li>However it covers just fine at the bottom of your bra staps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine a bra today that it would fit on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but it does do what you&#x27;re aiming for.</li>
            <li>I could not keep it secure all day.  </li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t fit around the strap and close securely.  </li>
            <li>Also, they look cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Very nice if you don&#x27;t want to expose all with today&#x27;s low cut fashions .</li>
            <li>This is not even close to the original ones.  </li>
            <li>I had a set of the original ones with the three snap positions.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying a real camisole.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even have these clipped for a full minute before I had to take them off.</li>
            <li>This is a nice purchase for those of us who don&#x27;t care for super low tops and blouses, but at the same time don&#x27;t always want to wear a tank or another shirt underneath what you&#x27;re already wearing (that can make it really hot on a warm day!).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, no one seems to have the original version.  </li>
            <li>That never happened with the older, original product.  </li>
            <li>It is a cute top but it does not fit correctly.</li>
            <li>In most cases wearing a regular cami is a better and more reliable option, but for a hot day when you don&#x27;t want to wear another layer of clothing cami secret is better.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made....stitching is crooked.  </li>
            <li>Smaller than I thought, but it is okay.</li>
            <li>most clothes are so low cut, it could use these in every color</li>
            <li>broke the first time she wore them.</li>
            <li>had a different set before that was much better.  </li>
            <li>alot of summer tops require a tank under them , but this works better w/o the extra layer !</li>
            <li>I have to agree with all the negative reviews --- these are not the good kind, these are the low quality version.  </li>
            <li>I have placed  pieces of material on different articles of clothing for many years</li>
            <li>I am a new teacher this year and some of the blouses I own are a bit too low cut for school</li>
            <li>I certainly would.</li>
            <li>The idea for cami secret is great, but in application there are some quirks.</li>
            <li>It can ride up and flip out of your shirt, looking more like bib if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>so I know rhey will be very well received</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell this isn&#x27;t a whole camisole.  </li>
            <li>this really works.  </li>
            <li>the product is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sag or move from it&#x27;s place much.</li>
            <li>Said it didn&#x27;t shift up and loss like a real cami under her clothes</li>
            <li>Comes way to high (almost to my collar bone!</li>
            <li>It is straight gold.</li>
            <li>VERY UN-HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li>fits all because they are most certainly not.</li>
            <li>Wish I had it years ago, I love it, and wish they had other colors.</li>
            <li>I ordered the classic set.  </li>
            <li>They are not as long as the original snap type.  </li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t fit around my wide strap sports bras.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m heavy up top and even dresses and tops</li>
            <li>I am not fond of wearing cami&#x27;s, but needed to cover up cleavage for a new job.  </li>
            <li>The package says you can move it up or down for more coverage, but you can&#x27;t really move it up because it&#x27;ll slide right down.</li>
            <li>you are anything over a size 0/1 DO NOT waste your money on this!  </li>
            <li>These were great except they don&#x27;t work too well on a thick strapped bra since the clips aren&#x27;t wide enough.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an actual elastic with a real button.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving it especially when I saw it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it needs at least one more snap to help keep it in place-if your a crafts/sewing person you could just add it and have no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The closure is actually an old GARTER closure, like what was used 50 years ago to keep stockings hooked to a girdle or garter belt.  </li>
            <li>These are not the good ones and difficult to snap.</li>
            <li>but these are plain cheap which should be sold a the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li>The packaging shows tucking the flap into the underside of the bra, but there is barely enough length to tuck it into the top of the bra and the fabric is so narrow that it pulls the bra straps together and the lace curls because it&#x27;s stretched too much.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit my 15 year old daughter who is small across the chest area.  </li>
            <li>She had previously purchased some Cami Secret items from the store and it had metal snaps and elastic, which worked great.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes,  but the clips are to small to fit over the straps of any bra</li>
            <li>a little flemsey but worth the price.</li>
            <li>the snaps are cheap and do not work on thick straps.  </li>
            <li>I wish I had listened to the reviews, but I really needed the black one.</li>

            <li> I had such high hopes,  but the clips are to small to fit over the straps of any bra</li>
            <li> a little flemsey but worth the price.</li>
            <li> the snaps are cheap and do not work on thick straps.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had listened to the reviews, but I really needed the black one.</li>
            <li> It is almost half the size of my old one and barely stretches across to clasp to my bra straps.</li>
            <li> However, she was disappointed with this product, as the quality is not as good as the ones she got from the store.</li>
            <li> Could not get it to fit on my bra completly useless if you are larger chested woman.</li>
            <li> It is considerably too small in the shoulders and upper arms.</li>
            <li> In summary, Cami secret is worth buying but don&#x27;t ditch your camis yet.</li>
            <li> Hate these ones, loved the ones that had snaps</li>
            <li> I had not tried the new package yet and needed to use the black one while the other one was packed for a trip.  </li>
            <li> So instead of bra straps looking like this: |  | which is what they would normally look like, they started to do this: &amp;#62; &amp;#60;, pulling in at the middle where the Cami Secret was strapped because the Cami isn&#x27;t wide enough to lay properly across your chest while staying hooked to your bra straps.</li>
            <li> and it can get crinkles in it from either being too stretched out or too loose when you wear it.</li>
            <li> awful product too tiny to actually fit and be useful not adjustable.</li>
            <li> This happens if the distance between your bra straps is not the exact width of cami secret.</li>
            <li> Fasteners don&#x27;t hold so it pops loose.  </li>
            <li> like the colors in this pack: white, tan and black.</li>
            <li> I previously bought from a department store for almost the same price ($9.99)</li>
            <li> i would have given it 5 stars except i thing the snaps need to be just a little bit bigger to go around the strap.</li>
            <li> I bought some at a store that have wide strips of cloth to hook to your bra.</li>
            <li> I am a size 12/14, my bra size is roughly 36 C.  </li>
            <li> Works as desired and expected.</li>
            <li> They do not work if your bra has wide straps.</li>
            <li> it is not the real cami secret</li>
            <li> Once home, I tried the other two.  </li>
            <li> These just have a small short plastic hook that is not adjustable.</li>
            <li> And since I&#x27;m a small person, it slips so low</li>
            <li> and I look forward to getting some other colors.</li>
            <li> I have purchased some other cami secrets and they were wider and had snaps.</li>
            <li> The width from clip to clip is entirely too small for the distance between bra straps</li>
            <li> these are very small and do not extend wide enough to catch my bra strap.</li>
            <li> The gift ones came back as a complaint to me.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Now, I just need to by the other colors!</li>
            <li> Because they were pulled so tightly, the clasps would not hold.  </li>
            <li> There are also limits to how low you can put cami secret.</li>
            <li> The hooks are too narrow on these.</li>
            <li> will only work if the straps are thin.  </li>
            <li> They only work with thin straps.  </li>
            <li> ..don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> These were too narrow to reach from strap to strap without distorting.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that the Cami Secret will pull at your bra straps because it is so much smaller than what you need it to be.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just overall poorly made.</li>
            <li> but it may go up or down (usually up)</li>
            <li> hated them to small and cheap made don&#x27;t  get waste of money</li>
            <li> The picture is a lie, because the cami is so small it falls into my cleavage, doesn&#x27;t come close to reaching the bottom of my bra.</li>
            <li> The garter-style clamps will only accept *very* thin, single-ply fabric.  </li>
            <li> addition, it was very narrow.  </li>
            <li> The clasp quality/ design is not very good.</li>
            <li> I had lost my black cami secret</li>
            <li> These CAMI SECRET cleavage cover are small and hard to put on, the material is so thin, too.  </li>
            <li> These are not good for those who are over a d cup.</li>
            <li> I hate the new clips that Cami Secret has gone too.  </li>
            <li> Same idea, instead of a stupid plastic snap</li>
            <li> I have tried on line and shopped areas that carry the  Cami Secret.  </li>
            <li> Also, the size of the cami has decreased dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I purchased Cami Secret about a year ago in the neutral colors.  </li>
            <li> They are completely useless.</li>
            <li> The clasp is difficult to work around the bra strap also.</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> this is a fake product.</li>
            <li> is 100% false!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to wear it for...whether I was going fancy or just casual</li>
            <li> VERY POOR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; flips in</li>
            <li> It just seems, all around, to be a bad design.</li>
            <li> i was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY disappointed!</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These were great except they don&#x27;t work too well on a thick strapped bra since the clips aren&#x27;t wide enough.</li>
            <li> The idea for cami secret is great, but in application there are some quirks. It will stay attached to your bra but it may go up or down (usually up) and it can get crinkles in it from either being too stretched out or too loose when you wear it. This happens if the distance between your bra straps is not the exact width of cami secret. There are also limits to how low you can put cami secret. The lowest it can go is higher than most camis, so it doesn&#x27;t look good under every shirt or dress.In most cases wearing a regular cami is a better and more reliable option, but for a hot day when you don&#x27;t want to wear another layer of clothing cami secret is better. It&#x27;s light but it will provide you with the coverage you need. In summary, Cami secret is worth buying but don&#x27;t ditch your camis yet.</li>
            <li> Unusable.  The garter-style clamps will only accept *very* thin, single-ply fabric.  And the seam on the edge had better be almost nonexistent, too.  The clamp bent with the second try - way too fragile.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine a bra today that it would fit on.  I suppose you could safety pin it, but then the lump of the pin would show.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, it was very narrow.  It just seems, all around, to be a bad design. Nice idea, though.&lt;br /&gt;This one is going back.</li>
            <li> Smaller than I thought, but it is okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but it does do what you&#x27;re aiming for. It can ride up and flip out of your shirt, looking more like bib if you aren&#x27;t careful. A crafty person would do better to make their own version of this product but for those of us who don&#x27;t care to sew (or can&#x27;t) this will do.</li>
            <li> These are not good for those who are over a d cup. They are completely useless.</li>
            <li> I hate the new clips that Cami Secret has gone too.  They will not stay clipped.  They are not as long as the original snap type.  This is not even close to the original ones.  I had a set of the original ones with the three snap positions.  I loved them.  I bought these as a gift and just got myself another set.  The gift ones came back as a complaint to me.  I had not tried the new package yet and needed to use the black one while the other one was packed for a trip.  I could not keep it secure all day.  I finally got two safety pins and pinned it into place.  I did not need the embarrassement or the hassle that this was giving me.  Once home, I tried the other two.  What a dissappointment this was and is.  I will not buy any more.  I will make my own before I make this mistake again.  Unfortunately, no one seems to have the original version.  I have tried on line and shopped areas that carry the  Cami Secret.  What a shame to have such a perfect product and ruin it with cheap ways of getting by.</li>
            <li> It hides cleavage, but looks like a clip.  Would be better if it was made out of heavier material, like tee shirt material.</li>
            <li> The fasteners don&#x27;t hold well &amp; the  material&lt;br /&gt; Needs to be about an inch wider.  Not worth the money.  Adjustable snaps would work much better.</li>
            <li> I had lost my black cami secret so I had to order more. I wish I had listened to the reviews, but I really needed the black one. It is almost half the size of my old one and barely stretches across to clasp to my bra straps. The clasp is difficult to work around the bra strap also. The picture is a lie, because the cami is so small it falls into my cleavage, doesn&#x27;t come close to reaching the bottom of my bra. EXTREMELY disappointed! You&#x27;d be better off buying a real camisole. Wish they didn&#x27;t cheapen it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for one of my daughters, and it works quite well. The elastic across the top made it so that, even if she bent over, she would still be well covered. Good product!</li>
            <li> The item is itchy, does not stay in place, and is not as described in the description.  If you sew it into a shirt, it works, but I definitely  would not trust it in an office setting to stay in place.</li>
            <li> Bought two sets will be used for xmas paresents.  I really like them so I know rhey will be very well received</li>
            <li> I am not fond of wearing cami&#x27;s, but needed to cover up cleavage for a new job.  These are great!  They look nice, and have good coverage.  You can&#x27;t tell this isn&#x27;t a whole camisole.  Great product!</li>
            <li> a little flemsey but worth the price. most clothes are so low cut, it could use these in every color</li>
            <li> This product although a nice idea in theory but it is not for a larger chest. Gave item to daughter.</li>
            <li> Very nice if you don&#x27;t want to expose all with today&#x27;s low cut fashions . No worries when bending over with this in place . Easy to use .</li>
            <li> Hate these ones, loved the ones that had snaps</li>
            <li> Thought I would have to make my own and then I found these. Way better than sewing. Very nice.</li>
            <li> The hooks are too narrow on these. I bought some at a store that have wide strips of cloth to hook to your bra. These just have a small short plastic hook that is not adjustable. Won&#x27;t fit around my wide strap sports bras.</li>
            <li> this really works.  i would have given it 5 stars except i thing the snaps need to be just a little bit bigger to go around the strap.</li>
            <li> The concept is great ut the product is very flimsy. I purchase 3 of these for my dtr and 2 of the clips broke the first time she wore them. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This product needs to be totally re-designed or they need to make actual SIZES.  Their ONE SIZE FITS ALL description is 100% false! I am a size 12/14, my bra size is roughly 36 C.  This tiny peice of fabric looks like it&#x27;s made for an adolescent child!  I gave it to my 12 year old daughter and it fits her perfectly, she weighs about 90 lbs and is 5&#x27;4\\&quot;. She jokes that it looks like the front of a lace underwear. It&#x27;s THAT small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are anything over a size 0/1 DO NOT waste your money on this!  There is another product on here that I bought that is much better... chemisette.  Search for it.  Same idea, instead of a stupid plastic snap, it&#x27;s an actual elastic with a real button. AND it provides excellent coverage!</li>
            <li> the snaps are cheap and do not work on thick straps.  will only work if the straps are thin.  i wear a minimizer bra and they didn&#x27;t fit around the strap and close securely.  i was so disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife bought these because some of her shirts are too low cut for work.  She said these are great and more comfortable than having to wear layers.</li>
            <li> These are horrible.  MUCH SMALLER than the ones I had purchased in a store.  They don&#x27;t fit my 15 year old daughter who is small across the chest area.  Save your money, don&#x27;t order these.</li>
            <li> These things are tiny. I had such high hopes,  but the clips are to small to fit over the straps of any bra I our my daughter own. Useless.</li>
            <li> Could not get it to fit on my bra completly useless if you are larger chested woman. I am a 38 DDD.</li>
            <li> Works as desired and expected. I have a petite figure so it works fine and gives a good coverage. It doesn&#x27;t sag or move from it&#x27;s place much. It&#x27;s a good replacement of cami&#x27;s in summer season.</li>
            <li> had a different set before that was much better.  I did not care for the fasteners.  They only work with thin straps.  Also not as nice a material as my others</li>
            <li> It is a cute top but it does not fit correctly. It is considerably too small in the shoulders and upper arms. I was really looking forward to receiving it especially when I saw it.</li>
            <li> hated them to small and cheap made don&#x27;t  get waste of money</li>
            <li> Perfect for those shirts that just aren&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> Wish I had it years ago, I love it, and wish they had other colors.</li>
            <li> My wife had me order this product for her. She had previously purchased some Cami Secret items from the store and it had metal snaps and elastic, which worked great. However, she was disappointed with this product, as the quality is not as good as the ones she got from the store. It seems that this is a result of the maker making a cheaper product. It&#x27;s just not the same quality and is an inferior product to the ones they used to make.</li>
            <li> I am a new teacher this year and some of the blouses I own are a bit too low cut for school so I thought I would try these out. The snaps easily attach to your bra straps and eliminate the cleavage problem. The package says you can move it up or down for more coverage, but you can&#x27;t really move it up because it&#x27;ll slide right down. However it covers just fine at the bottom of your bra staps.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before I bought this..don&#x27;t waste your money..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;7 and wear a size 16.  These were too narrow to reach from strap to strap without distorting.  Because they were pulled so tightly, the clasps would not hold.  I ended up using safety pins to attach them to the inside of my shirts.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sister and she likes them a lot.  Said it didn&#x27;t shift up and loss like a real cami under her clothes</li>
            <li> awful product too tiny to actually fit and be useful not adjustable.</li>
            <li> The clips would not stay clipped onto my bra.this was not like the last set I found.I don&#x27;t suggest this.</li>
            <li> This is a nice purchase for those of us who don&#x27;t care for super low tops and blouses, but at the same time don&#x27;t always want to wear a tank or another shirt underneath what you&#x27;re already wearing (that can make it really hot on a warm day!). It looks really nice with whatever top I&#x27;ve had to wear it for...whether I was going fancy or just casual it went perfectly with out looking weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors in this pack: white, tan and black. Works for most of what my wardrobe needs are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the snaps could be improved upon.  While I have no problems when wearing a bra with thicker straps, I can&#x27;t wear the Cami with a thinner strapped bra-the Cami doesn&#x27;t stay in place as well.  And since I&#x27;m a small person, it slips so low I might as well not wear it. I&#x27;m thinking it needs at least one more snap to help keep it in place-if your a crafts/sewing person you could just add it and have no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Cami meets my need and I look forward to getting some other colors.</li>
            <li> Do not like the Cami with Clip-on.  They do not work if your bra has wide straps. The ones I have with snaps work great. Wish I could find a set with snaps. The clip-on cami do not have any strech.  Do not buy these.</li>
            <li> Zero stars if I could.  Fasteners don&#x27;t hold so it pops loose.  The packaging shows tucking the flap into the underside of the bra, but there is barely enough length to tuck it into the top of the bra and the fabric is so narrow that it pulls the bra straps together and the lace curls because it&#x27;s stretched too much.</li>
            <li> great when needed !! alot of summer tops require a tank under them , but this works better w/o the extra layer !</li>
            <li> does not attach to bra strap - I have to use safety pin to attach to bra strap.</li>
            <li> this is a fake product. it is not the real cami secret</li>
            <li> The button was broke and the color stuck to my clothes and spoilt my dress. Would never buy this again!</li>
            <li> one was great, one ripped on first day of use!</li>
            <li> I read all the negatives prior to ordering but still took a chance with these, purchasing the set of three for $9.98.  I have to agree with all the negative reviews --- these are not the good kind, these are the low quality version.  I previously bought from a department store for almost the same price ($9.99) but now they don&#x27;t have it, those are so much better. Since they are about the same price, I thought these would be the same quality as the set I bought at the store, but no! These CAMI SECRET cleavage cover are small and hard to put on, the material is so thin, too.  I seldom give a one star review but these are plain cheap which should be sold a the Dollar Store.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made....stitching is crooked.  Tan stitching doesn&#x27;t match color of Cami.  Comes way to high (almost to my collar bone! Returning it immediately!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered the classic set.  It was just what I needed to give away as a stylish gift for teens who wanted to cover up and look great.</li>
            <li> The clasp quality/ design is not very good. Keeps opening &amp; hence the fabric keeps shifting, doesn&#x27;t remain in place.</li>
            <li> This product should not be on the market.  The picture on the front of the package I ordered showed a simple snap closure, just like a set I had purchased years ago.  The closure is actually an old GARTER closure, like what was used 50 years ago to keep stockings hooked to a girdle or garter belt.  Also, the size of the cami has decreased dramatically.  I tried to wear one of the camis, but I had to keep pulling it into place, because my bra would show.  That never happened with the older, original product.  Lastly, the lace was sewn on crooked on two of the three camis.  This is a bait and switch job.</li>
            <li> Very good product, light weight and comfy. Stays in place.</li>
            <li> these are very small and do not extend wide enough to catch my bra strap. I have purchased some other cami secrets and they were wider and had snaps. These are not the good ones and difficult to snap. Also, the &amp;#34;beige&amp;#34; is not champagne or beige at all. It is straight gold.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product no stars at all I certainly would. I didn&#x27;t even have these clipped for a full minute before I had to take them off. The width from clip to clip is entirely too small for the distance between bra straps so I don&#x27;t know who had the idea to say that these are one size fits all because they are most certainly not. I&#x27;ve read a lot of people saying they had issues with the clips staying hooked onto the bra but honestly that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. The problem is that the Cami Secret will pull at your bra straps because it is so much smaller than what you need it to be. So instead of bra straps looking like this: |  | which is what they would normally look like, they started to do this: &amp;#62; &amp;#60;, pulling in at the middle where the Cami Secret was strapped because the Cami isn&#x27;t wide enough to lay properly across your chest while staying hooked to your bra straps. Also, they look cheaply made. The lace-y parts were unraveling already as soon as I opened it. I don&#x27;t see how any grown woman could wear these unless they had a petite figure. This would be better suited for prepubescent girls, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I Luv this product. I have placed  pieces of material on different articles of clothing for many years, now I use these, they work. Gave it 4 stars because I,find I still need to safety-pin the bottom to keep it in place at times.</li>
            <li> VERY POOR PRODUCT. WHERE THE CAMI CONNECTS WILL NOT STAY. VERY UN-HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM. I WOULD NOT EVER BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN, AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS DO NOT PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> The material is very thin and the &amp;#34;lace&amp;#34; flips in and it&#x27;s just overall poorly made. Like the concept, but this product doesn&#x27;t meet the mark.</li>
            <li> I purchased Cami Secret about a year ago in the neutral colors.  I wear them all the time, especially when I go to the Kingdom Hall. I&#x27;m heavy up top and even dresses and tops that shouldn&#x27;t show cleavage does on me. With these, I don&#x27;t have to worry about cleveage spilling out and it always stays in place.  My mom bought a pack too, after she borrowed mine.  Now, I just need to by the other colors!</li>
