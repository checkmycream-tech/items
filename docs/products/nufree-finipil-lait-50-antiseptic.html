            <li>I love this stuff for post waxing care, I&#x27;ve been ingrown hair free, the  cooling tingle sensation feels great too, not too overpowering.</li>

            <li>For the money and the size of this bottle its defiantly better to buy online.</li>
            <li>, this is so much more and cheaper for the price.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>and while she was out I did some more research.</li>
            <li>Maybe she&#x27;ll look into it and start carrying it there too. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more if I use it up.</li>
            <li>Product is top notch, but overpriced even for a premium</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe ok for people with cash to burn.</li>

            <li>This stuff is DEFINITELY worth trying!!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;ll get better with time as your body gets used to it, make sure you don&#x27;t soak in a bath, if you workout and get sweaty make sure to clean up ASAP, try not to touch the area, tea tree oil can help, coconut oil, etc etc).</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel better instead of itchy/uncomfortable and heals it quick!</li>
            <li>This works very good to eliminate razer burn and to keep nicks from getting infected, my neck is sensitive in some spots and this is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe this stuff would do anything, but my aesthetician gave me a free sample to try after a wax.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people that get Brazilians and easier on next visit</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve discovered it is available on amazon, I will always purchase it here.</li>
            <li>Works great and can be used for numerous things, from razor burn, skin irritation to sunburn!  </li>
            <li>Great for bikini, facial, or problem hair areas!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>This&#x27;s My first review on Amazon Love this product much, I love the coolness it makes my face feels fresh all day/night as well.</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>was worried, because I have a mild allergy to soy, and I&#x27;ve read that this is primarily a soy based product.  </li>
            <li>So I did and loved the initial results.</li>
            <li>This is not only good for razor burn, but also pimples.</li>
            <li>better than anything, very soothing and protects you from infection after shaving.</li>
            <li>It also is good for any scrape or sore facial area.  </li>
            <li>sure it&#x27;s fine for those without extremely (re: RIDICULOUSLY) sensitive skin, but rosacea sufferers, beware.</li>
            <li>Now I can wait longer between waxing, which is exactly the results I was looking for!</li>
            <li>arrived quickly and exactly as stated in the online description.  </li>
            <li>, right?)</li>
            <li>THE BEST SKIN CARE PRODUCT FOR FEMALE ADULT ACNE, WITH FACIAL HAIR.</li>
            <li>:)hat I&#x27;ve just plucked when noticing them, but it&#x27;s been maybe 3-4 hairs a day, which is NOTHING when you think about how many are actually capable of growing down there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also comes in little packets, which are good for travel or for waxers to give to clients at the spa just after waxing.</li>
            <li>Been using this product for a couple years now and it really does work!</li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommended it to everyone.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t order it at first</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know what their situation was or what they were using it for,</li>
            <li>I tested it first on the inside of my forearm to see if I would react, and I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It really did stunt the hair growth when I used it!  </li>
            <li>Exact same thing my waxer sells for a lot more.</li>
            <li>This is the same product sold at higher-end salons and spas, except it was priced WAY more reasonably.</li>
            <li>This lotion is really excellent for healing the skin after you shave, especially around your delicate areas.</li>
            <li>And there were so few reviews available to read that I really wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me</li>
            <li>And there were so few reviews available to read that I really wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me</li>
            <li>Was surprised at the size of the tube for the price I paid, but I know the prodcut works very well, so hopefully its worth it!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - a new staple in the medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li>Was recommended by a friend who is an aesthetician at a salon and the product really does what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>but it really is a COOLING effect.</li>
            <li>So I really wanted to follow up and add a review.</li>
            <li>So I really wanted to follow up and add a review.</li>
            <li>I use in on my bikini zone, which has always been very prone to ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing to the skin.</li>
            <li>I like that its antibacterial and anti-fungal even though I&#x27;ve never had problems with either haha-</li>
            <li>I received a few samples of this and liked it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product, but the one they show, is not the one you get.</li>
            <li>so they do not get infected if you just waxed or took hair off, very smoothing and feels very soft.</li>
            <li>Still, as any highly reactive person knows, you have to watch ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Normally after just a week or two I was having quite a bit of regrowth.</li>
            <li>Love finding it here for less!</li>
            <li>When I decided to start getting them again, I had my list of things to do on the days leading up to waxing and right before waxing and immediately after and the days following waxing</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so clean and tingly, and helps on those days when you&#x27;re in a hurry and need to use the dry shampoo, some astringent, and just the Finipil!  </li>
            <li>the skin above and between my eyebrows welted up immediately after my stylist used this on me for the first time</li>
            <li>or I misunderstood when I read the first time that this would be 6 oz (and bigger than the one</li>
            <li>I recently got my legs waxed for the first time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about growth retardation but for sure prevents infections.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed a HUGE improvement in how long the hair is taking to grow back out!</li>
            <li>i would not recommend this product if you have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was worried it would burn when I put it on immediately after my waxing because the skin is so sensitive there</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for one month with my epilator, and, so far, I don&#x27;t have any ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>Do not put your fingers near your eyes or it will burn and water.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t  used it consistently enough to know if it really slows growth.</li>
            <li>Good, no great product!</li>
            <li>It dried out my face and made me break out a little at first, but most new products do that to me until my skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li>I use it right after an appointment and it not only soothes the area but the hair grows back thinner and thinner each time.</li>
            <li>AT ALL when I was normally left with VERY red, swollen, inflamed skin down there), came home and put some more Lait 50 on immediately.</li>
            <li>you never use basically its like icy hot for your sensitive areas</li>
            <li>I have had some hairs pop up here and there over the past month that I&#x27;ve just plucked when noticing them, but it&#x27;s been maybe 3-4 hairs a day, which is NOTHING when you think about how many are actually capable of growing down there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;m still relatively new to the rosacea thing and figuring out all my triggers, but this was definitely one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no other reactions, and the product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it on my eczema spots, and they clear up by the next day!</li>
            <li>I have had in grown hair forever, finally this cream offers relief,</li>
            <li>What made it worse is that it&#x27;s recommended after waxing, and since there is many products that are involved in waxing, it took me a month to figure out this was the culprit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars even though it&#x27;s useless to me, because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cool to fault the manufacturer for some allergic reaction I have, but just be aware of it if you have a reaction and need some hypotheses for a diagnosis.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, but the one they show, is not the one you get.</li>
            <li> so they do not get infected if you just waxed or took hair off, very smoothing and feels very soft.</li>
            <li> Still, as any highly reactive person knows, you have to watch ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Normally after just a week or two I was having quite a bit of regrowth.</li>
            <li> Love finding it here for less!</li>
            <li> When I decided to start getting them again, I had my list of things to do on the days leading up to waxing and right before waxing and immediately after and the days following waxing</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so clean and tingly, and helps on those days when you&#x27;re in a hurry and need to use the dry shampoo, some astringent, and just the Finipil!  </li>
            <li> the skin above and between my eyebrows welted up immediately after my stylist used this on me for the first time</li>
            <li> or I misunderstood when I read the first time that this would be 6 oz (and bigger than the one</li>
            <li> I recently got my legs waxed for the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about growth retardation but for sure prevents infections.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a HUGE improvement in how long the hair is taking to grow back out!</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this product if you have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was worried it would burn when I put it on immediately after my waxing because the skin is so sensitive there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for one month with my epilator, and, so far, I don&#x27;t have any ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> Do not put your fingers near your eyes or it will burn and water.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t  used it consistently enough to know if it really slows growth.</li>
            <li> Good, no great product!</li>
            <li> It dried out my face and made me break out a little at first, but most new products do that to me until my skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> I use it right after an appointment and it not only soothes the area but the hair grows back thinner and thinner each time.</li>
            <li> AT ALL when I was normally left with VERY red, swollen, inflamed skin down there), came home and put some more Lait 50 on immediately.</li>
            <li> you never use basically its like icy hot for your sensitive areas</li>
            <li> I have had some hairs pop up here and there over the past month that I&#x27;ve just plucked when noticing them, but it&#x27;s been maybe 3-4 hairs a day, which is NOTHING when you think about how many are actually capable of growing down there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;m still relatively new to the rosacea thing and figuring out all my triggers, but this was definitely one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no other reactions, and the product seems to be working.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it on my eczema spots, and they clear up by the next day!</li>
            <li> I have had in grown hair forever, finally this cream offers relief,</li>
            <li> What made it worse is that it&#x27;s recommended after waxing, and since there is many products that are involved in waxing, it took me a month to figure out this was the culprit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars even though it&#x27;s useless to me, because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cool to fault the manufacturer for some allergic reaction I have, but just be aware of it if you have a reaction and need some hypotheses for a diagnosis.</li>
            <li> However exactly 24 hours after getting waxed several (and I mean SEVERAL, as in they were everywhere) fluid-filled tiny white bumps appeared.</li>
            <li> do not waste your time with ANY other product.</li>
            <li> off course some about of exfoliation as your hair grows back is very helpful but even if you don&#x27;t you should not the bumps and irritation that you may have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Some previous reviewers have said that it is overpriced but as someone else mentioned, a little bit goes a long way-- making the tube last and making it worth the price.</li>
            <li> but the smaple doesn&#x27;t last me too long.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product and recommended for sensitive skin users.</li>
            <li> although maybe that was a mental thing, and I wasn&#x27;t red,</li>
            <li> The hair grows back slower and less coarse</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else out there has had the same issue with those pesky bumps after and none of the other treatments have worked.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone else out there has had the same issue with those pesky bumps after and none of the other treatments have worked.</li>
            <li> Stray hairs that get ingrown seem to be less of a pesky problems if this is used regularly almost as a moisturizer around the chin.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had a SINGLE bump show up!</li>
            <li> So I was dealing with these awful bumps the first 3-4 days and then was only enjoying the smoothness for another week or so before I was playing the waiting game for the hair to grow out enough to get my next brazilian and start the process all over again.</li>
            <li> Just as I had expected and ordered.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a problem with ingrown hairs to matter how careful I was or how I treated the area afterwards.</li>
            <li> No infections and minimal bumps.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had a cold washcloth or something on the area for hours after application, which felt AHMAZING the days following the wax when I was usually pretty sore.</li>
            <li> just like other antiseptic creams.</li>
            <li> So I tried these things as well as other suggestions I found on Google</li>
            <li> I use it as a spot treatment before bed and the pimple usually subsides the next day morning.</li>
            <li> In fact I thought the itchiness was due to something else, so I kept using finipil.</li>
            <li> I continued to get the brazilians probably about 6 times and the bumps continued, then money got tight and I was discouraged with the bumps (and ingrown hairs)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sorry for such a long review, but if it hadn&#x27;t been for the reviews I had found I would have never tried it.</li>

            <li> I have also been using this on my dark underarm skin, and the skin is beginning to lighten up also!</li>
            <li> A VERY small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The girl had put some of this on my legs after the waxing and sent me home with a few sample packets.</li>
            <li> and they want like 25 dollars for a small little sample bottle</li>
            <li> Wrapping the bottle in tap...while i understand why you did...left this bottle a sticky mess!  </li>
            <li> In the past I purchased it from a beauty specialist.</li>
            <li> I can hardly use it b/c of the smell.</li>
            <li> The odor is subtle and does not linger.</li>
            <li> somewhat expensive for small amount of product.  </li>
            <li> Had my session (which btw was less painful...</li>
            <li> I was either sent the wrong one</li>
            <li> , I decided to give it a try (not like it&#x27;s that expensive</li>
            <li> The surface of my skin does feel cold and, perhaps, a bit numbed for a time after use.  </li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it, it works and has a cooling sensation</li>
            <li> post wax redness at all! :(</li>
            <li> I used this a week after a brazilian wax as was recommended and it was stinging really badly!</li>
            <li> and I was determined to get through it without the results being ruined by these annoying, unattractive bumps!</li>

            <li> THE BEST SKIN CARE PRODUCT FOR FEMALE ADULT ACNE, WITH FACIAL HAIR. SINCE I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT, NOT 1 ingrown hair, acidic pimples, skin never looked better!</li>
            <li> Great product! This is sold at my salon for much more expensive. Love finding it here for less!</li>
            <li> This is a great product..........I use it after I have my chin and lip waxed.</li>
            <li> This works very good to eliminate razer burn and to keep nicks from getting infected, my neck is sensitive in some spots and this is very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok...just like other antiseptic creams. Thought I would try it to see what it was like...ehhh.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe this stuff would do anything, but my aesthetician gave me a free sample to try after a wax. If you use it regularly, as directed on the bottle, it *does* work. It shortens the length of time between waxings. The hair grows back slower and less coarse (I was use it on my armpits). I did a test and didn&#x27;t use it for a month and definitely saw a difference. This product does what it says. It works!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people that get Brazilians and easier on next visit</li>
            <li> Everytime I get a Brazilian wax I&#x27;m always given a sample of Finipil but the smaple doesn&#x27;t last me too long. So I decided to search for it myself! Its really a good product. Very light lotion like feel. Keeps ingrown hairs away!</li>
            <li> My waxer uses this on me after getting waxed and has given me some sample packets, which seemed really great.  So I bought this, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.. I don&#x27;t know if my skin got used to it or what, but it&#x27;s not helping any razor burn, bumps, or post wax redness at all! :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years now and absolutely love it. In the past I purchased it from a beauty specialist. Now that I&#x27;ve discovered it is available on amazon, I will always purchase it here.</li>
            <li> do not waste your time with ANY other product. this is the best one there is. great cooling sensation, keeps ingrowns away, and inhibits hair growth. worth every penny! i use after brazillian waxings and it helps a TON</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this product if you have extremely sensitive skin or if you are prone to rosacea outbreaks. the skin above and between my eyebrows welted up immediately after my stylist used this on me for the first time and i dealt with a two week-long outbreak at the site of application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m still relatively new to the rosacea thing and figuring out all my triggers, but this was definitely one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine for those without extremely (re: RIDICULOUSLY) sensitive skin, but rosacea sufferers, beware.</li>
            <li> I started using this several years ago for my bikini line post waxings... it works wonders on ingrown hairs and those unsightly red bumps. It also works great on unearthing those under-the-skin pimples that hurt! When my husbands needs it, he asks me for the &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34; cream. It actually tingles so you know it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Use it on my bikini line daily and exfoliate 2-3 times a week. Haven&#x27;t had an ingrown since!</li>
            <li> I used this a week after a brazilian wax as was recommended and it was stinging really badly! I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has experienced this... I&#x27;m biding my time to give it another shot, based on all the good reviews; and I will update this once I know.</li>
            <li> I have had in grown hair forever, finally this cream offers relief, off course some about of exfoliation as your hair grows back is very helpful but even if you don&#x27;t you should not the bumps and irritation that you may have had in the past.</li>
            <li> See no results although it works great for burns lol</li>
            <li> For the money and the size of this bottle its defiantly better to buy online. I go to a spa that sells this and they want like 25 dollars for a small little sample bottle, this is so much more and cheaper for the price.&lt;br /&gt;If you never use basically its like icy hot for your sensitive areas so they do not get infected if you just waxed or took hair off, very smoothing and feels very soft. A little goes a long way with this product and recommended for sensitive skin users. Basically does what its suppose to do.</li>
            <li> What I received was the finipil lait 50, 1.5 oz, 44 ml.  Which, if I knew that this was going to be smaller than advertised, I would have ordered the four 44 ml tubes for $39.  I was either sent the wrong one or I misunderstood when I read the first time that this would be 6 oz (and bigger than the one the one I have currently).  Now I see no size whatsoever advertised on it and feel like that is misleading.  It&#x27;s a decent product, but the one they show, is not the one you get.</li>
            <li> This&#x27;s My first review on Amazon Love this product much, I love the coolness it makes my face feels fresh all day/night as well. I&#x27;d recommend it for everyone after waxing.</li>
            <li> The spa I go to uses this after waxing and it&#x27;s worked well.  I was happy to find somewhere that I could buy it to keep at home when needed.</li>
            <li> Works great and can be used for numerous things, from razor burn, skin irritation to sunburn!  Great product to have!</li>
            <li> Great product! Just as I had expected and ordered.  This is the same product sold at higher-end salons and spas, except it was priced WAY more reasonably.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it SMELLS AWEFUL. I can hardly use it b/c of the smell.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a couple years now and it really does work! Was recommended by a friend who is an aesthetician at a salon and the product really does what it is supposed to. I use it right after an appointment and it not only soothes the area but the hair grows back thinner and thinner each time. Great for bikini, facial, or problem hair areas!</li>
            <li> I got this product as a sample after a wax and it worked amazingly! I no longer wax, but Finipil does the same 100% A+ job no matter the removal method. I used to have a problem with ingrown hairs to matter how careful I was or how I treated the area afterwards. Now,  Finipil treats and prevents any unsightly bumps.I love it and would definitely recommended it to everyone. Some previous reviewers have said that it is overpriced but as someone else mentioned, a little bit goes a long way-- making the tube last and making it worth the price.</li>
            <li> About two years ago I decided I wanted to take the plunge and start getting brazilian waxes. So I did and loved the initial results. However exactly 24 hours after getting waxed several (and I mean SEVERAL, as in they were everywhere) fluid-filled tiny white bumps appeared. They went away after about 3 or 4 days. I Googled and I talked to my aesthetician about it the next time I had an appt and she gave me some different pointers on things to do to prevent the bumps from reappearing after future waxes (it&#x27;ll get better with time as your body gets used to it, make sure you don&#x27;t soak in a bath, if you workout and get sweaty make sure to clean up ASAP, try not to touch the area, tea tree oil can help, coconut oil, etc etc). So I tried these things as well as other suggestions I found on Google and still, the bumps appeared, like clockwork, 24 hours after waxing. I continued to get the brazilians probably about 6 times and the bumps continued, then money got tight and I was discouraged with the bumps (and ingrown hairs) I was getting every time, so I stopped getting them for about 6-8 months. When I decided to start getting them again, I had my list of things to do on the days leading up to waxing and right before waxing and immediately after and the days following waxing and I was determined to get through it without the results being ruined by these annoying, unattractive bumps! But AGAIN, there they were, every time. My aesthetician had a baby and was gone on maternity leave for 6 weeks and while she was out I did some more research. Rewording my problem a million different ways in the Google search bar until some salon in another state had Finipil Lait 50 mentioned on their website, and then I found it on amazon. I didn&#x27;t order it at first but when my lady came back from maternity leave and I had my upcoming waxing appt, I decided to give it a try (not like it&#x27;s that expensive, right?) So I bought it and it came in a day or two before my appt. I showered before my appt and applied some of the Lait 50 and headed to the salon.  Had my session (which btw was less painful...although maybe that was a mental thing, and I wasn&#x27;t red, AT ALL when I was normally left with VERY red, swollen, inflamed skin down there), came home and put some more Lait 50 on immediately. 24 hours went by and no signs of any bumps at all. I told myself maybe the cream was just delaying them a bit and they would eventually appear bc this stuff had to be too good to be true. Another 24 hours went by, and another, and another....it&#x27;s now been almost an entire month since the wax and I haven&#x27;t had a SINGLE bump show up! NOT. A. ONE!! And no ingrown hairs either! This stuff truly is a miracle worker! I read some reviews who said it didn&#x27;t work for them. I don&#x27;t exactly know what their situation was or what they were using it for, etc, but I am SO incredibly happy I found this stuff and gave it a try!! I Apply it to the area once a day after my shower and that&#x27;s it. It just works! I was worried it would burn when I put it on immediately after my waxing because the skin is so sensitive there and it has a &amp;#34;cooling effect&amp;#34; that I was concerned would end up being a &amp;#34;light my crotch on fire&amp;#34; effect instead but it really is a COOLING effect. I felt like I had a cold washcloth or something on the area for hours after application, which felt AHMAZING the days following the wax when I was usually pretty sore. I have also noticed a HUGE improvement in how long the hair is taking to grow back out! Normally after just a week or two I was having quite a bit of regrowth. So I was dealing with these awful bumps the first 3-4 days and then was only enjoying the smoothness for another week or so before I was playing the waiting game for the hair to grow out enough to get my next brazilian and start the process all over again. As I said earlier, it&#x27;s been a month, and guess what? I&#x27;M STILL SMOOTH!! I have had some hairs pop up here and there over the past month that I&#x27;ve just plucked when noticing them, but it&#x27;s been maybe 3-4 hairs a day, which is NOTHING when you think about how many are actually capable of growing down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sorry for such a long review, but if it hadn&#x27;t been for the reviews I had found I would have never tried it. And there were so few reviews available to read that I really wasn&#x27;t sure it would work for me and I almost didn&#x27;t try it. So I really wanted to follow up and add a review. Maybe someone else out there has had the same issue with those pesky bumps after and none of the other treatments have worked. This stuff is DEFINITELY worth trying!! I will be staying stocked up on it from now on and plan on telling my aesthetician about it the next time I see her. Maybe she&#x27;ll look into it and start carrying it there too. :)hat I&#x27;ve just plucked when noticing them, but it&#x27;s been maybe 3-4 hairs a day, which is NOTHING when you think about how many are actually capable of growing down there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m sorry for such a long review, but if it hadn&#x27;t been for the reviews I had found I would have never tried it.

            <li> I recently got my legs waxed for the first time. The girl had put some of this on my legs after the waxing and sent me home with a few sample packets. This stuff is great for more than just after waxing. I have been using it on my eczema spots, and they clear up by the next day! I have also been using this on my dark underarm skin, and the skin is beginning to lighten up also! I am convinced this stuff is a miracle cream!</li>
            <li> Great product!y great shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying this based upon my sister-in-law&#x27;s recommendation.  I use in on my bikini zone, which has always been very prone to ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of bikini hair removal, and even trimming with scissors gave me ingrowns.  I&#x27;ve been using it for one month with my epilator, and, so far, I don&#x27;t have any ingrowns.  So that is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried, because I have a mild allergy to soy, and I&#x27;ve read that this is primarily a soy based product.  I tested it first on the inside of my forearm to see if I would react, and I didn&#x27;t.  Still, as any highly reactive person knows, you have to watch ingredients.  The surface of my skin does feel cold and, perhaps, a bit numbed for a time after use.  For hair removal, of course, that is a good thing.  I&#x27;ve had no other reactions, and the product seems to be working.  I&#x27;ll buy more if I use it up.</li>
            <li> Love it! Perfect after any wax treatment</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this while getting a wax at a salon.  It is absolutely amazing and from my knowledge it works the way it&#x27;s intended!  The cooling sensation is phenomenal after a wax, but it&#x27;s also nice after you shave.  10/10 would recommend you buy it.</li>
            <li> I would get samples of this about once every two months from my estitician.  It really did stunt the hair growth when I used it!  I finally realized I just needed to buy some.  A VERY small amount goes a long way.  It dried out my face and made me break out a little at first, but most new products do that to me until my skin gets used to it.  Now I can wait longer between waxing, which is exactly the results I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt and item was just as described.  Product was not damaged and I had no issue with payment.  Wrapping the bottle in tap...while i understand why you did...left this bottle a sticky mess!  Even today it picks up every piece of hair or dust in my bathroom.  Gross!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and exactly as stated in the online description.  somewhat expensive for small amount of product.  would choose again.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really excellent for healing the skin after you shave, especially around your delicate areas. It makes your skin feel better instead of itchy/uncomfortable and heals it quick!</li>
            <li> Was surprised at the size of the tube for the price I paid, but I know the prodcut works very well, so hopefully its worth it!</li>
            <li> The Nufree Finipil Lait antiseptic is the perfect product to use after waxing to prevent any kind of rash or infection. It also comes in little packets, which are good for travel or for waxers to give to clients at the spa just after waxing.</li>
            <li> Exact same thing my waxer sells for a lot more. I love this stuff for post waxing care, I&#x27;ve been ingrown hair free, the  cooling tingle sensation feels great too, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing- great for waxing!!</li>
            <li> Use after shaving and you won&#x27;t get bumps.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Product is top notch, but overpriced even for a premium product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid 15$ for something the size of a sampler or travel size item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe ok for people with cash to burn.</li>
            <li> This felt great on injuries. I know its suppose to be used after hair removal, but using on any sore or cut has worked too.</li>
            <li> I make sure I have this around. This is not only good for razor burn, but also pimples. I use it as a spot treatment before bed and the pimple usually subsides the next day morning.</li>
            <li> Very soothing to the skin. I like the cooling sensation. The odor is subtle and does not linger. I will be ordering more of this product. A must have for anyone with ingrown hair issues. Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have!</li>
            <li> Use as part of my Brazilian wax regimen and it works wonders! Love it</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - a new staple in the medicine cabinet!</li>
            <li> better than anything, very soothing and protects you from infection after shaving. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about it, it works and has a cooling sensation</li>
            <li> I never used this product before but decided to try it after reading reviews on Amazon. Works great for reducing bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine. No infections and minimal bumps. I used this after getting a bikini wax. I&#x27;m not sure about growth retardation but for sure prevents infections.</li>
            <li> I use it with the nufree wax kit  A great product to use after waxing and helps relieve the sting.  good stuff</li>
            <li> Great for softening the skin around the chin.  Stray hairs that get ingrown seem to be less of a pesky problems if this is used regularly almost as a moisturizer around the chin.  It also is good for any scrape or sore facial area.  Has a tingly feeling to it and a sort of eucalyptse scent.  Do not put your fingers near your eyes or it will burn and water.  Use regularly for best results.</li>
            <li> excellent product!!!!</li>
            <li> It did everything it said it would do. It even got rid of the bumps under my arms and my son&#x27;s shaving bumps under his chin.</li>
            <li> I received a few samples of this and liked it so i bought a tube. When I wax, I like using this cream. I like that its antibacterial and anti-fungal even though I&#x27;ve never had problems with either haha- I like the way it feels- it has a cooling sensation that lasts for several hours. I didn&#x27;t ever have a problem with ingrowns but I believe this helps. I haven&#x27;t  used it consistently enough to know if it really slows growth.</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps with bumps after a brazilian wax!!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel so clean and tingly, and helps on those days when you&#x27;re in a hurry and need to use the dry shampoo, some astringent, and just the Finipil!  It makes you feel so refreshed.  .  .  Good, no great product!</li>
            <li> Lord have mercy.. the itchiness this thing caused. There is something in it that I&#x27;m allergic to, and for two weeks I was out of service. What made it worse is that it&#x27;s recommended after waxing, and since there is many products that are involved in waxing, it took me a month to figure out this was the culprit. In fact I thought the itchiness was due to something else, so I kept using finipil. I&#x27;m still giving it 3 stars even though it&#x27;s useless to me, because I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cool to fault the manufacturer for some allergic reaction I have, but just be aware of it if you have a reaction and need some hypotheses for a diagnosis.</li>
