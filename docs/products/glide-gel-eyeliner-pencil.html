            <li> Great eyeliner instead of the liquid. Very similar but more control with it being a pencil. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have another liner which is &amp;#34;darkest black&amp;#34;, this is MUCH lighter than that but doesn&#x27;t smudge as easily which is good. But the &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; in the name is misleading, this is a pencil, nothing &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; about it</li>
            <li> Loved these even more than 24/7 Urban Decay eyeliner. Once they are on they stay put even on my waterline. Great price, I will be repurchasing these. Trying to find other colors.</li>
            <li> I buy alot of makeup, and I&#x27;m always looking for great quality products at inexpensive prices. This gel liner is better than Urban Decay (I have 3 of these in different colors). Glides on smooth, and stays all day. Highly pigmented, and I&#x27;m a dark skinnned woman of color.  I&#x27;m definitely buying more.</li>
            <li> I wore this the whole day and it did not smear or run. It glided on black and it stayed black. I love this liner and I am never going back to regular pencil or liquid.</li>
            <li> Great smooth gliding eyeliner that looks spectacular on!</li>
            <li> I am using my husband&#x27;s account. I like this eyeliner and especially for the money. It applies so smooth and creamy. It is very pigmented. It last all day except for my waterline and then it needs to be reapplied. Which I have never found any eyeliner anywhere that truly lasts all day on my waterline. I would def. recommend this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love how the item glides on your eyelid and the color is intense which is nice. What I dislike a lot about this product is that it smears. I outlined my top lid and within half an hour I had the color on smearing onto my lower eye lid. Not pretty at all. Made me feel like a raccoon and well no one wants to feel this way about their eye liner.</li>
            <li> Awesome eyeliner, and really cheap. It glides on smooth and doesn&#x27;t smudge..all day wear literally. I was using urban decay 24/7 but at 20 bucks a pencil!!! these are definitely comparable and affordable</li>
            <li> Very good eyeliner. It is one of the few that doesn&#x27;t run and gather in the corner of my eye within a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have very watery eyes because I wear contacts and have allergies. This eyeliner smears and fades just in about an hour of putting it on my waterline. But a very good liner for my top lid.</li>
            <li> I am not giving it more than 3 stars because sharpening it to get a good point for application can be an unattainable feat. Slides on well though and colour is good</li>
            <li> Smudges in the waterline a little more than I would have liked, but it&#x27;s definitely the best eyeliner for this price range</li>
            <li> One of the best eyeliners I&#x27;ve ever used! Goes on once in the morning and stays on until I take it off. Waterproof and does not run or smear, however, I will say... don&#x27;t get it in your eyes because it will sting or blur (as most of them do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also because it does stay on ALL DAY, I found that I have to use makeup remover wipes, baby oil or vaseline to take it off at night and it comes right off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to order it online because only one store that I know of in my area sells it, and that&#x27;s 40 min. away. This is way more convenient.</li>
            <li> This stuff glides on like butter!!!! I shoulda order multiple👌</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this eyeliner. It glides on nice and dark and stays put all day. Price is amazing, I will order again and in brown.</li>
