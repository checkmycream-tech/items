            <li>Good shaving cream</li>
            <li>Just a good shaving cream.</li>
            <li>The smell is not the best but for what it does it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing</li>
            <li>It feels nice, smells great and does help with a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>It is a good quality shave gel, and you can get a nice, smooth shave with it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not the most popular.</li>
            <li>So glad I found here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of that, I love this for the way it makes my legs feel after using it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s the best shave cream I&#x27;ve used, especially compared to what you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li>I really love the product.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be buying more of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I saw this product in a grav3yardgirl Favorite Things video on YouTube.</li>
            <li>I definitely love the results I&#x27;m seeing.</li>
            <li>Which is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>If it were available in the stores where I shop, I do think I would continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs so smooth and nick-free.</li>
            <li>Definitely try this product if you can find it for a good price :)</li>
            <li>The scent is fine, nothing special.</li>
            <li>I am smooth and pretty!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works I used to have to shave 2 times a day to stay smooth and with this</li>
            <li>I figured it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I could easily go a couple more days so long as no one&#x27;s rubbing my leg.</li>
            <li>The color is a bright green, the scent is intangible, but not unpleasant.  </li>
            <li>So silky smooth, and soft to the touch!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of this product</li>
            <li>This being a Noxema product, the FIRST thing you need to do is paint the bottom ring with nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Used it on my beard area to shave the first day i got it.</li>
            <li>I really hope the product continues working this way!</li>
            <li>I bought this product to see if it would work I am so happy I used it one time and less hair grew back</li>
            <li>I purchased this stuff on closeout at my local drugstore just because it was cheap.</li>
            <li>Quite an easy fix for this minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never be satisfied with any other shaving cream again.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product at my local Walmart.</li>
            <li>I picked it up at my local drug store and I was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m noticing a slight increase in the time between shavings as compared to other products, but I want more time to be sure.</li>
            <li>This stuff is hard to find so its easy to buy here and the price is not bad.</li>
            <li>However after a month or two I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shaving as much (every 2 to 3 days since I have sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>so well you don&#x27;t have to use it as much or buy as much as you would with other shaving creams, so retailers might think it&#x27;s unpopular, when really it&#x27;s just doing what it claims to, unlike so many other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally noticed a difference after my first use.</li>
            <li>The hairs are nearly invisible and I think with more use it will slow the growth considerably!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t reduced anything.</li>
            <li>I have been buying it on line for the last two years because I like it that much.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft, no nicks unless my blade is getting dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s soft, not poky.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other shaving creams only because it&#x27;s more convenient to grab it at the local store rather than dealing with shipping.</li>
            <li>My leg hair is growing back slower and actually not as thick as it used to grow in.</li>

            <li> The first squirt came out HARD, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.  </li>
            <li> Highly toxic not safe.</li>
            <li> It really does soften leg hair &amp; slow the regrowth.</li>
            <li> After shaving i left a thin layer on my face to really sink in.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very thickly and moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> It DID take about a month to get to this point, but it was time well spent, and I was going to shave anyways, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about it really curtailing hair growth and used it for a month or two</li>
            <li> But then it dawned on me that I was shaving less and less and when my hair grew back in I wasn&#x27;t noticing the thick, itchy stubble that made me want to shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it has some terrible chemicals in it that will cause extra fingers and toes in my great-great-great-grandchildren, but this stuff is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> wonder if the fact that it takes a little while to see the benefits hurts the sales of this product and that&#x27;s why it can&#x27;t be found in retail locations anymore, also since it works</li>

            <li> and I could notice a slight difference in my hair growth!</li>
            <li> This claims to slow hair regrowth, but I have noticed zero effect.</li>
            <li> I suggest you try it if it works for my thick course hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously just shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was actually really skeptical when I ordered this, but with it being summer</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this at the store and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. So glad I found here on Amazon.  This shaving cream works. I have think body hair and this def slows the growth and thickness.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously just shaving cream. I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly 2 months and it hasn&#x27;t reduced anything.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stuff on closeout at my local drugstore just because it was cheap. I was skeptical about it really curtailing hair growth and used it for a month or two forgetting that it had that added benefit. But then it dawned on me that I was shaving less and less and when my hair grew back in I wasn&#x27;t noticing the thick, itchy stubble that made me want to shave everyday. It was coming in finer, softer and slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if the fact that it takes a little while to see the benefits hurts the sales of this product and that&#x27;s why it can&#x27;t be found in retail locations anymore, also since it works so well you don&#x27;t have to use it as much or buy as much as you would with other shaving creams, so retailers might think it&#x27;s unpopular, when really it&#x27;s just doing what it claims to, unlike so many other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried other shaving creams only because it&#x27;s more convenient to grab it at the local store rather than dealing with shipping. Despite the creepiness of putting some mysterious ingredient on my skin that slows my hair growth and might be \\&quot;unnatural\\&quot; I&#x27;ll never be satisfied with any other shaving cream again. I only hope this doesn&#x27;t stop getting manufactured for low sales.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m noticing a slight increase in the time between shavings as compared to other products, but I want more time to be sure. Regardless of that, I love this for the way it makes my legs feel after using it. So silky smooth, and soft to the touch! I&#x27;ll buy again just for that, it&#x27;s the best shave cream I&#x27;ve used, especially compared to what you can buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> Good shaving cream and I could notice a slight difference in my hair growth!</li>
            <li> This claims to slow hair regrowth, but I have noticed zero effect. It is a good quality shave gel, and you can get a nice, smooth shave with it. It is overpriced for that purpose alone, though.</li>
            <li> I like it; it seems to help. I am looking forward to the swim season using this product. Of course, I wish I could find it locally in a store.</li>
            <li> Works well as a shave gel, but I saw no reduction in hair growth or amount of times I needed to shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to see if it would work I am so happy I used it one time and less hair grew back this is so awsome I suggest you try it if it works for my thick course hair I know it will work for you too I&#x27;m definitely ordering more of this product it&#x27;s the best thank you amazon!</li>
            <li> I was actually really skeptical when I ordered this, but with it being summer I figured it would be worth a shot. I personally noticed a difference after my first use. The hair came back finer then it did when I used a regular shaving cr&amp;egrave;me.</li>
            <li> I like the product for shaving. It feels nice, smells great and does help with a smooth shave. I actually could not tell that it help with minimizing hair though. If it were available in the stores where I shop, I do think I would continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I bought this from a local store.  I was skeptical.  However after a month or two I noticed I wasn&#x27;t shaving as much (every 2 to 3 days since I have sensitive skin).  I really love the product.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at my local Walmart. I love it! It really does soften leg hair &amp; slow the regrowth. I used to shave my legs everyday. Now I can skip a day. I can&#x27;t find it locally. I have been buying it on line for the last two years because I like it that much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who unfortunately inherited her father&#x27;s abundance of follicles. Since she&#x27;s been using this to shave her legs and armpits, the hair regrowth is noticeably slower and the hairs themselves seem finer. I&#x27;m sure it has some terrible chemicals in it that will cause extra fingers and toes in my great-great-great-grandchildren, but this stuff is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add: We&#x27;ve also noticed that the regrowth of hair on my daughter&#x27;s legs is finer and her stubble is softer, less stabby.</li>
            <li> This being a Noxema product, the FIRST thing you need to do is paint the bottom ring with nail polish.  The cans will leave rust rings in the shower unless you do, they always have!  Quite an easy fix for this minor inconvenience.  If you don&#x27;t do it and get rust, use Barkeeper&#x27;s Friend cleanser, it&#x27;s made to get rust stains out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product inside.  The first squirt came out HARD, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.  The color is a bright green, the scent is intangible, but not unpleasant.  The product starts as a gel, then foams white as you rub it on.  Covers well, sticks well.  Rinses off the razor okay.  Leaves my skin soft, no nicks unless my blade is getting dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair minimizing?  Well, let me tell you - I&#x27;ve been considering napalm for my hair!  Sasquatch has nothing on me.  I can shave at 8 am and have 1/2&amp;#34; stubble that evening.  But that was before.  I shaved on Saturday, and here it is Monday afternoon and I can just feel some stubble.  And it&#x27;s soft, not poky.  It will get poky after another day, so shaving every day or two means I am smooth and pretty!  It DID take about a month to get to this point, but it was time well spent, and I was going to shave anyways, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying more of this stuff.  I think it&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to shaving with this stuff. I picked it up at my local drug store and I was so excited to use it. It lathers up very thickly and moisturizes really well. The scent is fine, nothing special. It leaves my legs so smooth and nick-free. And, best of all, after a couple uses I already can see that it&#x27;s minimizing my hair growth. It&#x27;s been three days since my last shave and the hair is only just starting to come in. I could easily go a couple more days so long as no one&#x27;s rubbing my leg. The hairs are nearly invisible and I think with more use it will slow the growth considerably! Definitely try this product if you can find it for a good price :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and I don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not the most popular. This stuff really works I used to have to shave 2 times a day to stay smooth and with this I can actually skip a day! Which is pretty amazing. This stuff is hard to find so its easy to buy here and the price is not bad. The smell is not the best but for what it does it&#x27;s worth it. This also prevents razor cuts I&#x27;ve noticed. Everyone needs this stuff so try it.</li>
            <li> Highly toxic not safe.I would not recommend it and would never buy it again .I scanned the bar code with my Environmental Working Group app.They rate all product for safety.</li>
            <li> Used it on my beard area to shave the first day i got it. After shaving i left a thin layer on my face to really sink in. The next day my beard growth was reduced dramatically. Wish i began using this product ages ago!</li>
            <li> Didnt work. Just a good shaving cream. I been using it for a month and I still shave the same amount.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a grav3yardgirl Favorite Things video on YouTube. I definitely love the results I&#x27;m seeing. My leg hair is growing back slower and actually not as thick as it used to grow in. I really hope the product continues working this way!</li>
