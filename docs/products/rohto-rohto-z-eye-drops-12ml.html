            <li> This eye drop clears the redness very fast. It helps the eyes feel and appear clearer.</li>
            <li> A bit stronger than I expected, but really refreshing and my eyes feel cleaner too</li>
            <li> Oh my I can&#x27;t help but love the chemical like burning sensation in my eyes after using these drops. It&#x27;s like crack for your eyes!</li>
            <li> Read this in article from Marie Claire Magazine and that Madonna use a similar Rohto eyedrops. Always use this when I wake up in the morning and whenever my eyes are tired. It takes a while to be delivered because I understand it comes directly from Japan.</li>
            <li> This eye drop is very refreshing! And the drop mouth design is very good, no drops falling out of the eye while applying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these eyedrops for years.  Until recently, one of my family was always traveling to Japan so I always stocked up.  I&#x27;m glad I can get them through Amzazon since those trips will likely be more infrequent.  I ALWAYS have these eyedrops with me.  They are the best I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> - extremely refreshing (the &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; gets a little taking used to, but once you adjust, there&#x27;s no going back--the best!!)&lt;br /&gt;- best eyedrops ever</li>
            <li> Doing a good job at whitening my eyes.</li>
            <li> good eye drop! Awesome product, shipped pretty fast from Japan too! As an added bonus, the seller&#x27;s child sent me an authentic Japanese gummy candy, and it was super tasty, not to mention touching.</li>
            <li> The best eyedrops, hands down. Feels very intense and almost painful if you haven&#x27;t used Rohto before. Clears up eyes like crazy, I use these primarily when I vape, since my eyes get very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> These are eyedrops with menthol so they are &amp;#34;refreshing&amp;#34; but more like BURNING. I compared whiteness between Clear Eyes and these and they both performed the same. So if you&#x27;re up for paying a premium price for burning your eyeballs that&#x27;s on you.  :D</li>
            <li> Awesome product, shipped pretty fast from Japan too! As an added bonus, the seller&#x27;s child sent me an authentic Japanese gummy candy, and it was super tasty, not to mention touching.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without these drops!!</li>
            <li> My eyes feel like they are exposed to antarctic winds.</li>
            <li> These are the best eye drops in the world. I found these in Japan 2 years ago and had to look online for more.The shipment came on time and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Best eye drops ever... Hold on to your seat when you use these things!</li>
            <li> Top eye drops. Very beneficial for sore eyes or dry eye. Best I have used, effect lasts all day long.</li>
            <li> I really like these eye drops but the ophthalmologist told me to never use them again because of the ingredients which can cause muscle paralysis and drying.</li>
            <li> My favorite of the rohto series. Love the unique bottle shape. I may need to get the contact version though! Keep it up Rohto!</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to arrive but worth it. Strong, cooling, cleansing feeling, especially helpful during allergy season and after spending hours reading or on the computer. Almost what you would call bracing and a bit of a shock but in a good way.</li>
            <li> I have terribly dry eyes and I regularly use a variety of eye drops regularly, including prescription ones, but I&#x27;ve always liked having my Rohto Z! eye drops in my line-up. No more! They used to be so cool and refreshing, but now they are cold and painful. I think they have mentol in them. Now why would you put menthol in a mucus membrane?  Anyway, all the writing on this newest Z! is in Japanese characters, so who knows?  I hope I can get my money back. Sticking to my Theratears, Systane, Genteal, etc. drops now.</li>
