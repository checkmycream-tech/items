            <li>This product is great for covering up everything.  </li>
            <li>Great coverage, stays put.  </li>
            <li>always buy a lighter shade for great coverage under foundation.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m extremely happy with the liquid concealer.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I went with this shade instead of a lighter one, because it literally matches me perfectly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really amazing, great coverage</li>
            <li>Good for blemishes but not tattoos.</li>
            <li>Medium light shades, matches my NC20 (mac) skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>Really good coverage.</li>
            <li>This works surprisingly well to hide my knuckle tattoos for work.</li>
            <li>This is a great concealer with nice coverage.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good concealer for awhile ..</li>
            <li>Product goes on smoothly and has very good coverage.</li>
            <li>I would go with a darker color unless you are very very light skinned!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the coverage.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Oh my god, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>DO NOT attempt to apply it to skin that does not have some kind of primer on it.</li>
            <li>The MUFE concealer is my holy grail but this is the best alternative I&#x27;ve tried thus far!</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned &amp; even this shade was too light for me.</li>
            <li>Great for covering up really large pimples and hickeys!</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews and looking at this items rating I thought this would be the perfect solution to a 15+ old tattoo I have on my hand.</li>
            <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t suffer from acne anymore, but I still use this product when I want good coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still my favorite go-to concealer.</li>
            <li>After that I used a flesh colored eye shadow on top of the concealer to better match my skin color</li>
            <li>It blends well, the coverage is awesome, and I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve found Sephora&#x27;s under-eye concealer, and it&#x27;s WAY better than this product.</li>
            <li>I just wish it was packaged better when delivering otherwise</li>
            <li>Worked ok.  </li>
            <li>and it was just ok.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use a light touch!</li>
            <li>my under eyes but make sure that you moisturize your&lt;br /&gt;under eye area</li>
            <li>I think I might want to get something to put over it for more of a shimmer/reflecting highlight though, since it&#x27;s matte.</li>
            <li>😊 LOVE LOVE THISS</li>
            <li>Better than tarte and it concealer and makeup for ever .</li>
            <li>I wiped everything off and the residual from my &amp;#34;paint massacre&amp;#34; was enough to flawlessly cover the blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY cover up/concealers</li>
            <li>This has better coverage than the MAC prolong wear concealer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>This is such an awesome concealer it conceals wonders, you must note that it does have a heavy consistency, if you blend it will look flawless.</li>
            <li>Also, be sure that the skin under and around your eyes has a light touch of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin is light to medium with yellow undertones and the medium light matches perfectly.</li>
            <li>it came very quickly</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t blend out easily it looks caked on, also if not blended then powdered it could smudge off and tattoo will show</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more, because again it does make a great facial concealer</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great value and super cheap for the quality!</li>
            <li>the color i got was a tad too light, but a light once over with my foundation made my face the perfect color, and it was smooth and all even toned, which i havent been able to achieve with past concealers.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my little tattoo I need to cover.</li>
            <li>This works great as a facial concealer and for lightly colored tattoos</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or irritation to my face also which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>This concealer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>The color was a bit light and the coverage since it stays sticky comes off when I apply my mineral powder makeup---disappointed.</li>
            <li>I bought the medium light (from Walmart for $6), it is about 1.5 shades lighter than my skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works fabulously to cover up the biggest pimples and darkest ink.</li>
            <li>It does not cover that great and does not last.</li>
            <li>I have fairly light olive skin and this color was WAY too light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to get something too light because again I needed it for covering redness.</li>
            <li>So I opted for the Medium Light shade.</li>
            <li>,it&#x27;s too light for me.</li>
            <li>I have started to develop light freckling on my cheeks and wanted to cover it ..</li>
            <li>Also the color ( I got light medium ) is like a clay gray color .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even cover a light freckle-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very well satisfied with this product to give me a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li>; from Walmart to Paris and without a doubt there&#x27;s no more shopping around for the best one..</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t glob on too much at first, thinking that you&#x27;ll get the most coverage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO many different foundantions and concealers and had yet to find one that I truly liked.</li>
            <li>but I contacted the seller &amp; sent it to me right away!</li>
            <li>Word of caution, find a good permanent makeup individual not one who is offering a discount.  </li>
            <li>(e.l.f. makes a good one at a very low price that gives your skin a bit of a silky touch.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>Meant for cool undertones.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint is that they don&#x27;t have a perfect color match for me.  </li>
            <li>This stuff comes off pretty easy, and you can get it at Walmart for $8...</li>
            <li>Excellent blend-ability - doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and covers very well.</li>
            <li>It arrived super quick.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the Hard Candy brand, and I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect shade for me and it has a yellow undertone instead of pink.</li>
            <li>I used this to cover up my friends small face tattoo and it worked great.</li>
            <li>right it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>First things first, the color shade names do not match the shade.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had this problem, but every time I&#x27;ve went to use this, a watery mix comes out first.</li>
            <li>First of all, I recommend using a touch of primer before applying this product.</li>
            <li>you wear this daily make sure to moisturize your face nightly.</li>
            <li>Deffinatly did not belive the reveiws that warned me, so when i got the concealer in i immediatly started dotting EVERY imperfection on my face, blended it in with a beauty blender, and ended up looking like i went face first in a can of nude colored paint.  </li>
            <li>This is a really heavy-duty product!  </li>
            <li>First off let me say ..</li>
            <li>;) I have noticed that it does tend to sink into the the wrinkles I have between my brows</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed black/white, my skin color isn&#x27;t really olive or tan, it&#x27;s more of a mix of pink/yellow....</li>
            <li>Great concealer to cover dark circle, blemishes and unwanted birth marks such as skin moles (non risen) or age spots.</li>
            <li>It is very oily.</li>
            <li>It creases around the eyes too much even when it&#x27;s set with powder</li>
            <li>but I really like how much coverage it is</li>
            <li>very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s even too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v read reviews that these concealers are much lighter than what you can expect based off the shade names.</li>
            <li>so i could really use the concealer</li>
            <li>it would work but who&#x27;s really going to do that.</li>
            <li>I figured this is cheap enough</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t have as much coverage as I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li>If I really feel the need</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I had kind of figured it would be.</li>
            <li>Great coverage and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but if you have severe dark circles it is better to go for a salmon color skin corrector under this concealer .</li>
            <li>For sure covers the dark circles under my eyes and makes me look refreshed.  </li>
            <li>They should expand their colors a little more.</li>
            <li>I have very vibrantly colored tattoos and if applied correctly and consistently this product covers them enough to make them unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>Due to the heavy nature of this product, it is best applied with a wet beauty blender.</li>
            <li>so I was on the hunt for a new concealer.  </li>
            <li>It felt so light and that tiny bit turned into covering my entire chin area and all of my imperfections!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product, but I am not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Once your finish applying set concealer with sponge by taking a dab at translucent powder (just a little bit) then spray your setting spray and then just apply lightly to you concealer to set.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it broke me out everywhere</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t give it five stars because for semi-dark colored tattoos it doesn&#x27;t cover unless you use to much to blend properly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make them totally invisible, but it does render them unnoticeable unless you&#x27;re really looking.</li>
            <li>really love the thick consistency.</li>
            <li>You need to follow directions and first use the pencil over the area you want to cover, then put on the liquid concealer and let it dry.</li>
            <li>I read the user reveiws on different sites and liked that a little went a long way.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this the concealer package had a small cut and that resulted in some leakage of concealer, I taped it and now it is fine.</li>
            <li>The only downfall (and i honestly think it would be like this ith ANY concealer, is that i had dry patches in various spots on my face and they looked extremely cakey</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of shade choices for this makeup, but it blends pretty well with any other makeup, especially if you use MAC ProLongwear concealer.</li>
            <li>I was using the Skin79 Pink BB Cream which I still like very much</li>
            <li>Give it time to dry or \\&quot;sink-in\\&quot; for a few moments before going for more.</li>
            <li>Fast service, not a fan of the product super thick</li>
            <li>Heavy duty and full coverage</li>
            <li>Through the years it has faded to a dark gray and it&#x27;s location and appearance makes me very self conscious around coworkers, customers, meeting new people.</li>
            <li>very thick, just warm it up in a rubbing motion between your fingers first but it will hide any blemish you have or just dark circles around your eyes!</li>
            <li>It seems that under the eye area it will get dried out rather quickly after i started using this product, which then clumps the makeup and lets it set into the wrinkles under the eye</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m only 20 years old.</li>
            <li>Who wants one eye thin line the other 3 times thicker &amp; more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>not COMPLETELY so I must wonder about a dark and large tatoo!  </li>
            <li>I really thought I actually found something to cover the dark circles I always have under my eyes.</li>

            <li> It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or irritation to my face also which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> This concealer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> The color was a bit light and the coverage since it stays sticky comes off when I apply my mineral powder makeup---disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought the medium light (from Walmart for $6), it is about 1.5 shades lighter than my skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works fabulously to cover up the biggest pimples and darkest ink.</li>
            <li> It does not cover that great and does not last.</li>
            <li> I have fairly light olive skin and this color was WAY too light.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get something too light because again I needed it for covering redness.</li>
            <li> So I opted for the Medium Light shade.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s too light for me.</li>
            <li> I have started to develop light freckling on my cheeks and wanted to cover it ..</li>
            <li> Also the color ( I got light medium ) is like a clay gray color .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even cover a light freckle-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very well satisfied with this product to give me a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> ; from Walmart to Paris and without a doubt there&#x27;s no more shopping around for the best one..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t glob on too much at first, thinking that you&#x27;ll get the most coverage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO many different foundantions and concealers and had yet to find one that I truly liked.</li>
            <li> but I contacted the seller &amp; sent it to me right away!</li>
            <li> Word of caution, find a good permanent makeup individual not one who is offering a discount.  </li>
            <li> (e.l.f. makes a good one at a very low price that gives your skin a bit of a silky touch.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> Meant for cool undertones.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that they don&#x27;t have a perfect color match for me.  </li>
            <li> This stuff comes off pretty easy, and you can get it at Walmart for $8...</li>
            <li> Excellent blend-ability - doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and covers very well.</li>
            <li> It arrived super quick.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the Hard Candy brand, and I am quite impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect shade for me and it has a yellow undertone instead of pink.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover up my friends small face tattoo and it worked great.</li>
            <li> right it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> First things first, the color shade names do not match the shade.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had this problem, but every time I&#x27;ve went to use this, a watery mix comes out first.</li>
            <li> First of all, I recommend using a touch of primer before applying this product.</li>
            <li> you wear this daily make sure to moisturize your face nightly.</li>
            <li> Deffinatly did not belive the reveiws that warned me, so when i got the concealer in i immediatly started dotting EVERY imperfection on my face, blended it in with a beauty blender, and ended up looking like i went face first in a can of nude colored paint.  </li>
            <li> This is a really heavy-duty product!  </li>
            <li> First off let me say ..</li>
            <li> ;) I have noticed that it does tend to sink into the the wrinkles I have between my brows</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed black/white, my skin color isn&#x27;t really olive or tan, it&#x27;s more of a mix of pink/yellow....</li>
            <li> Great concealer to cover dark circle, blemishes and unwanted birth marks such as skin moles (non risen) or age spots.</li>
            <li> It is very oily.</li>
            <li> It creases around the eyes too much even when it&#x27;s set with powder</li>
            <li> but I really like how much coverage it is</li>
            <li> very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s even too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v read reviews that these concealers are much lighter than what you can expect based off the shade names.</li>
            <li> so i could really use the concealer</li>
            <li> it would work but who&#x27;s really going to do that.</li>
            <li> I figured this is cheap enough</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t have as much coverage as I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li> If I really feel the need</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I had kind of figured it would be.</li>
            <li> Great coverage and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but if you have severe dark circles it is better to go for a salmon color skin corrector under this concealer .</li>
            <li> For sure covers the dark circles under my eyes and makes me look refreshed.  </li>
            <li> They should expand their colors a little more.</li>
            <li> I have very vibrantly colored tattoos and if applied correctly and consistently this product covers them enough to make them unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> Due to the heavy nature of this product, it is best applied with a wet beauty blender.</li>
            <li> so I was on the hunt for a new concealer.  </li>
            <li> It felt so light and that tiny bit turned into covering my entire chin area and all of my imperfections!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok product, but I am not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Once your finish applying set concealer with sponge by taking a dab at translucent powder (just a little bit) then spray your setting spray and then just apply lightly to you concealer to set.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it broke me out everywhere</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t give it five stars because for semi-dark colored tattoos it doesn&#x27;t cover unless you use to much to blend properly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make them totally invisible, but it does render them unnoticeable unless you&#x27;re really looking.</li>
            <li> really love the thick consistency.</li>
            <li> You need to follow directions and first use the pencil over the area you want to cover, then put on the liquid concealer and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I read the user reveiws on different sites and liked that a little went a long way.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this the concealer package had a small cut and that resulted in some leakage of concealer, I taped it and now it is fine.</li>
            <li> The only downfall (and i honestly think it would be like this ith ANY concealer, is that i had dry patches in various spots on my face and they looked extremely cakey</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of shade choices for this makeup, but it blends pretty well with any other makeup, especially if you use MAC ProLongwear concealer.</li>
            <li> I was using the Skin79 Pink BB Cream which I still like very much</li>
            <li> Give it time to dry or \\&quot;sink-in\\&quot; for a few moments before going for more.</li>
            <li> Fast service, not a fan of the product super thick</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and full coverage</li>
            <li> Through the years it has faded to a dark gray and it&#x27;s location and appearance makes me very self conscious around coworkers, customers, meeting new people.</li>
            <li> very thick, just warm it up in a rubbing motion between your fingers first but it will hide any blemish you have or just dark circles around your eyes!</li>
            <li> It seems that under the eye area it will get dried out rather quickly after i started using this product, which then clumps the makeup and lets it set into the wrinkles under the eye</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only 20 years old.</li>
            <li> Who wants one eye thin line the other 3 times thicker &amp; more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> not COMPLETELY so I must wonder about a dark and large tatoo!  </li>
            <li> I really thought I actually found something to cover the dark circles I always have under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It does the job but be aware that this product is really thick and can get cakey if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to purchase it from here if you live outside of USA, and be prepared to pay a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , several coats later after they eventually dry its a noticeable fix to correct permanent eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> if your looking for a long lasting concealer I recommend this</li>
            <li> I have never had a tube of concealer last me this long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty thick</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use to much and it is somewhat hard to get off, but that is probably why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I need to use just a teeny tiny little dab for my entire upper lip, basically I dont even squeeze the tube and just touch the tip to my make up brush</li>
            <li> NOT natural at all.</li>
            <li> it really takes very little to cover any area!</li>
            <li> Covers dark circles and brightens entire eye area.</li>
            <li> Only slight issue, it seemed to dry out the skin where it was applied, but that might just be because they&#x27;re newer tattoos.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin is actually having less breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I placed a little, I placed alot, I used the pencil, I tried applying regular concealer</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it took a little while to dry before putting on any other face makeup.</li>
            <li> It is pretty thick &amp; I use very little for my under eye circles.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, and a little goes a long way, I usually use a tiny dab for my whole face, and it stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected as I needed to cover bruising</li>
            <li> e look well rested no matter how tired I really am.</li>
            <li> I tries looking for it again at the store</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> So when they say a LITTLE goes a long way that&#x27;s what you need to do here .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> One eye has thicker perm eyeliner than the other.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how it would work for larger tattoos.</li>
            <li> but I have lots of dark spots and very uneven facial skin.</li>
            <li> I have a mustache shadow (SOO annoying) and this works ok to cover it.</li>
            <li> this product stays on when sweat is dripping down my face.</li>
            <li> It did cover my all black tattoo</li>
            <li> I am not mildly tempted to try another product...</li>
            <li> Black hair, brown eyes.</li>
            <li> I had mine for a year not even half done, but I lost it.</li>
            <li> I apply a moisturizer underneath as suggested in a previous review and the concealer stays in place all day.  </li>
            <li> Was disappointed that the color of this concealer is actually a light clay.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and sticky and does not dry matte at all.  </li>
            <li> Covers my dark under eye circles &amp; blemishes marks !</li>
            <li> With just a little drop.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived in just a few days, way before the scheduled delivery date.</li>
            <li> and it was sticky and tacky all day a waste of money</li>
            <li> Then apply Hard Candy Glamoflauge Heavy Duty Concealer in layers.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll go back to the expensive stuff for my tattoos.</li>
            <li> I tried it again just to make sure it was indeed as horrible as I thought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a coincedence or this product.</li>
            <li> I also have hyperhidrosis of the scalp and face (excessive sweating) and</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so hard that I&#x27;d probably have to soften it up some way in order to use it.</li>
            <li> It cut my foundation/concealer makeup application at the very least in half!</li>
            <li> Seems a bit ashy &amp; gray - not a warm, life-like color variety.  </li>
            <li> And because it&#x27;s so thick, it tends to crease.</li>
            <li> It goes on verrrrrry thick like a mask ..</li>
            <li> The concealers I&#x27;ve purchased always tend to be too thick and cakey.</li>
            <li> For anyone with acne scars or wrinkles, this is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the way this covered my circles.</li>
            <li> I used to have really blemished, acne-prone skin, so I know how awful it is to have makeup fading after an hour that leaves your skin looking</li>
            <li> give this concealer a 3 because it has a poor selection of colors and because it creases under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Epic fail !!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst I have tried .</li>
            <li> Very thick!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately does not cover like the write up.  </li>
            <li> Was unable to use since it didn&#x27;t come close to matching my skin.</li>
            <li> but i was wrong with the shade</li>
            <li> SMH such a horrible product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that this concealer stays around for a very long time because I would definitely be extremely disappointed if I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
            <li> I applied it :(</li>
            <li> Disgusting!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is very oily. It creases around the eyes too much even when it&#x27;s set with powder and I&#x27;m only 20 years old. I have sensitive skin and it broke me out everywhere I applied it :(</li>
            <li> Still my favorite go-to concealer. Literally covers everything. Everything.</li>
            <li> I got this to cover up a bruise. You need to follow directions and first use the pencil over the area you want to cover, then put on the liquid concealer and let it dry. After that I used a flesh colored eye shadow on top of the concealer to better match my skin color (regular powder didn&#x27;t cover well). It&#x27;s not perfect, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> First things first, the color shade names do not match the shade. I am fair skinned &amp; even this shade was too light for me. I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had this problem, but every time I&#x27;ve went to use this, a watery mix comes out first. It is pretty thick &amp; I use very little for my under eye circles. Personally, I think it took a little while to dry before putting on any other face makeup. I never tried the mini pencil, so I can&#x27;t say how that works. I also thought it felt somewhat oily when I used it. I always put my makeup on the back of my hand before applying so I don&#x27;t use to much and it is somewhat hard to get off, but that is probably why it&#x27;s called &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s an ok product, but I am not sure I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this to cover up my friends small face tattoo and it worked great. The people who knew he had a tattoo thought he got it removed. Just set with a powder is my only advice.</li>
            <li> I got it for it&#x27;s tattoo coverage. You need quite a bit to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> This stuff comes off pretty easy, and you can get it at Walmart for $8...</li>
            <li> It did cover my all black tattoo but u need the perfect shade mine was a touch lighter than my skin tone so i could notice the cover up spot  .</li>
            <li> Unfortunately does not cover like the write up.  It is thinner and somewhat runny, several coats later after they eventually dry its a noticeable fix to correct permanent eyeliner.  One eye has thicker perm eyeliner than the other.  Word of caution, find a good permanent makeup individual not one who is offering a discount.  I now have to spend additional time in the morning to make the eyeliner look the same on both eyes.  Who wants one eye thin line the other 3 times thicker &amp; more noticeable.  Shame on the tattoo artist that did this to me!</li>
            <li> Oh my god, this stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m so glad I went with this shade instead of a lighter one, because it literally matches me perfectly. It blends well, the coverage is awesome, and I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this were awesome. I really thought I actually found something to cover the dark circles I always have under my eyes. I was not happy with the way this covered my circles. Since then, I&#x27;ve found Sephora&#x27;s under-eye concealer, and it&#x27;s WAY better than this product.</li>
            <li> Best concealer ever. I wear this every day for under my eyes with powder to set it and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is such an awesome concealer it conceals wonders, you must note that it does have a heavy consistency, if you blend it will look flawless. When I ordered this the concealer package had a small cut and that resulted in some leakage of concealer, I taped it and now it is fine. I just wish it was packaged better when delivering otherwise it is great it came very quickly</li>
            <li> had to apply like 10 layers or so to not see tat</li>
            <li> Love it! Great concealer to cover dark circle, blemishes and unwanted birth marks such as skin moles (non risen) or age spots. Just outline with pencil then fill in and just apply the cream with finger or a sponge. Once your finish applying set concealer with sponge by taking a dab at translucent powder (just a little bit) then spray your setting spray and then just apply lightly to you concealer to set.</li>
            <li> Fast service, not a fan of the product super thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually pretty thick so if you don&#x27;t blend out easily it looks caked on, also if not blended then powdered it could smudge off and tattoo will show but I really like how much coverage it is</li>
            <li> Worked ok.  Not what I expected as I needed to cover bruising and it was just ok.  Like their regular foundation a lot though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would actually do on tatoos.  It doesn&#x27;t SEEM like it would cover a tatoo that well.  I have none, but I have this area on my knuckle that is a burst of blood vessels I guess, and I used it on that.  It worked but not COMPLETELY so I must wonder about a dark and large tatoo!  But for concealer, AOK.</li>
            <li> Good for blemishes but not tattoos.</li>
            <li> This concealer is fantastic. Covers dark circles and brightens entire eye area. Makes mm e look well rested no matter how tired I really am.</li>
            <li> very very good concealer 10/10 would recommend</li>
            <li> Please see if you can see my last review on another shade that I purchased of this product. Ive used &amp;#34; it all&amp;#34; from Walmart to Paris and without a doubt there&#x27;s no more shopping around for the best one..I am not mildly tempted to try another product...after 40 years ...perfection!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is very thick and sticky and does not dry matte at all.  The color was a bit light and the coverage since it stays sticky comes off when I apply my mineral powder makeup---disappointed.</li>
            <li> First of all, I recommend using a touch of primer before applying this product. (e.l.f. makes a good one at a very low price that gives your skin a bit of a silky touch.) Also, be sure that the skin under and around your eyes has a light touch of moisturizer. Then apply Hard Candy Glamoflauge Heavy Duty Concealer in layers. Don&#x27;t glob on too much at first, thinking that you&#x27;ll get the most coverage. Give it time to dry or \\&quot;sink-in\\&quot; for a few moments before going for more. I&#x27;m very well satisfied with this product to give me a more even skin tone. This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used the Hard Candy brand, and I am quite impressed. Just make sure you use a light touch!</li>
            <li> Great product. Would recommend to purchase it from here if you live outside of USA, and be prepared to pay a little more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perfect consistency that dries evenly and doesn&#x27;t oxidize ( change colour). Due to the heavy nature of this product, it is best applied with a wet beauty blender. Medium light shades, matches my NC20 (mac) skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> Was disappointed that the color of this concealer is actually a light clay. Was unable to use since it didn&#x27;t come close to matching my skin. Had to return it.</li>
            <li> Product goes on smoothly and has very good coverage. Product tube has hole.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best concealers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I really love the thick consistency. It works great&lt;br /&gt;for my under eyes but make sure that you moisturize your&lt;br /&gt;under eye area very well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will repurchase!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my little tattoo I need to cover. I am not sure how it would work for larger tattoos. I would recommend going with a darker shade than you think.</li>
            <li> I bought the medium light (from Walmart for $6), it is about 1.5 shades lighter than my skin. I wanted to use it as a highlighter/concealer anyway, so that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m mixed black/white, my skin color isn&#x27;t really olive or tan, it&#x27;s more of a mix of pink/yellow....if that even makes sense. I&#x27;m a bit lighter than Lisa Bonet, she&#x27;s the closest I can compare my skin color to. Black hair, brown eyes. I like this concealer because it stays on all day (it was 104 degrees here yesterday and it did not sweat off at all), and because I like it as a highlighter since it is a bit lighter than my skin. Really good coverage. It is matte, even though I use monistat anti-chafing gel as a primer. I think I might want to get something to put over it for more of a shimmer/reflecting highlight though, since it&#x27;s matte.</li>
            <li> I had to mix it with a darker tattoo concealer that I have, but once I got the color right it works pretty well. I have very vibrantly colored tattoos and if applied correctly and consistently this product covers them enough to make them unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> This is like a coat of paint for blemishes and tattoos. Beware, it is oil based (that&#x27;s why it works so well) so if you apply it and forget to wash it off, it will make your skin break out. Otherwise, it works fabulously to cover up the biggest pimples and darkest ink.</li>
            <li> Covers my dark under eye circles &amp; blemishes marks ! With just a little drop. I had mine for a year not even half done, but I lost it. I tries looking for it again at the store but I didn&#x27;t find it again so I order this it did take some time for the shipping but I contacted the seller &amp; sent it to me right away! Great service 😊 LOVE LOVE THISS if your looking for a long lasting concealer I recommend this 😁❤️</li>
            <li> This works great as a facial concealer and for lightly colored tattoos but I can&#x27;t give it five stars because for semi-dark colored tattoos it doesn&#x27;t cover unless you use to much to blend properly. I&#x27;ll probably buy more, because again it does make a great facial concealer but I&#x27;ll go back to the expensive stuff for my tattoos.</li>
            <li> I love this product !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in just a few days, way before the scheduled delivery date. It is a great concealer that will indeed cover EVERYTHING. I&#x27;ve found that putting on 1 layer letting it absorb and then applying another layer works best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wear this daily make sure to moisturize your face nightly. It seems that under the eye area it will get dried out rather quickly after i started using this product, which then clumps the makeup and lets it set into the wrinkles under the eye area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this product again!!!</li>
            <li> I used to have really blemished, acne-prone skin, so I know how awful it is to have makeup fading after an hour that leaves your skin looking...crappy. This stuff is awesome though! It&#x27;s thick, and a little goes a long way, I usually use a tiny dab for my whole face, and it stays on all day. There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of shade choices for this makeup, but it blends pretty well with any other makeup, especially if you use MAC ProLongwear concealer. Those two together are a match made in foundation heaven for blemished skin! Luckily I don&#x27;t suffer from acne anymore, but I still use this product when I want good coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Great value and super cheap for the quality!</li>
            <li> This product is not what I expected it to be. It does not cover that great and does not last.</li>
            <li> I have severe acne and this product is the only thing I can find to truley cover it up. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have a mustache shadow (SOO annoying) and this works ok to cover it. I have fairly light olive skin and this color was WAY too light. I need to use just a teeny tiny little dab for my entire upper lip, basically I dont even squeeze the tube and just touch the tip to my make up brush and that&#x27;s even too much. I would go with a darker color unless you are very very light skinned!</li>
            <li> Better than tarte and it concealer and makeup for ever . Great coverage ...does nor crease ...but if you have severe dark circles it is better to go for a salmon color skin corrector under this concealer .</li>
            <li> it really takes very little to cover any area! When I do run out of the product- which probably won&#x27;t be for some time!- I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great coverage! Excellent blend-ability - doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and covers very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned with yellow undertones. I wanted to try this concealer not to brighten, but to cover redness/blemishes. I&#x27;v read reviews that these concealers are much lighter than what you can expect based off the shade names. I didn&#x27;t want to get something too light because again I needed it for covering redness. So I opted for the Medium Light shade. It&#x27;s the perfect shade for me and it has a yellow undertone instead of pink. Heavy duty and full coverage so I only need the tiniest amount. Great buy! The MUFE concealer is my holy grail but this is the best alternative I&#x27;ve tried thus far!</li>
            <li> I bought this concealer to cover up my blemishes from the left over pregnancy acne that i couldnt get rid of. A little goes a LONG way. Deffinatly did not belive the reveiws that warned me, so when i got the concealer in i immediatly started dotting EVERY imperfection on my face, blended it in with a beauty blender, and ended up looking like i went face first in a can of nude colored paint.  I wiped everything off and the residual from my &amp;#34;paint massacre&amp;#34; was enough to flawlessly cover the blemishes. the color i got was a tad too light, but a light once over with my foundation made my face the perfect color, and it was smooth and all even toned, which i havent been able to achieve with past concealers. The only downfall (and i honestly think it would be like this ith ANY concealer, is that i had dry patches in various spots on my face and they looked extremely cakey so i had to start drowing in coconut oil to get rid of it so i could really use the concealer lol. I have already and will continue to reccommend this concealer to all of my friends.</li>
            <li> This product is great for covering up everything.  I apply a moisturizer underneath as suggested in a previous review and the concealer stays in place all day.  There is no need to reapply.</li>
            <li> Looks cakey and doesn&#x27;t cover pores. For anyone with acne scars or wrinkles, this is not a good choice.</li>
            <li> I have never had a tube of concealer last me this long. I think I&#x27;m sold on this stuff for life!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews and looking at this items rating I thought this would be the perfect solution to a 15+ old tattoo I have on my hand. Through the years it has faded to a dark gray and it&#x27;s location and appearance makes me very self conscious around coworkers, customers, meeting new people. I have tried MANY cover up/concealers but none actually did the trick or lasted longer than an hour. I was so hopeful this concealer would work but it DID NOT. I placed a little, I placed alot, I used the pencil, I tried applying regular concealer and then this, I tried using a primer. NOTHING. After about 30min the tattoo just seapped through. I guess if I applied it ever 30-45 min it would work but who&#x27;s really going to do that. I have no idea how this works on the face but DEF not made for tattos.</li>
            <li> You definitely need to get the matte finish to keep this product on.</li>
            <li> ONE OF THE BEST CONCEALERS OUT THERE!</li>
            <li> Meant for cool undertones. They should expand their colors a little more.</li>
            <li> It did not cover what I wanted it to cover and it was sticky and tacky all day a waste of money</li>
            <li> This works surprisingly well to hide my knuckle tattoos for work. It doesn&#x27;t make them totally invisible, but it does render them unnoticeable unless you&#x27;re really looking. Only slight issue, it seemed to dry out the skin where it was applied, but that might just be because they&#x27;re newer tattoos.</li>
            <li> Awesome! This has better coverage than the MAC prolong wear concealer. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this over MAC.</li>
            <li> This is a really heavy-duty product!  Great coverage, stays put.  My biggest complaint is that they don&#x27;t have a perfect color match for me.  Seems a bit ashy &amp; gray - not a warm, life-like color variety.  And because it&#x27;s so thick, it tends to crease.</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer with nice coverage.  For sure covers the dark circles under my eyes and makes me look refreshed.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Will work to cover my tattoo at my wedding!</li>
            <li> best concealer on the market! very thick, just warm it up in a rubbing motion between your fingers first but it will hide any blemish you have or just dark circles around your eyes! really good stuff!!!! and afordable! yay! always buy a lighter shade for great coverage under foundation.</li>
            <li> the product it&#x27;s really amazing, great coverage but i was wrong with the shade ,it&#x27;s too light for me.</li>
            <li> It does the job but be aware that this product is really thick and can get cakey if you are not careful. If you are going to use this concealer to cover some of your face imperfections I would recommend moisturizing your face first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this concealer a 3 because it has a poor selection of colors and because it creases under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy, but I had kind of figured it would be. It does the trick, let me tell you. DO NOT attempt to apply it to skin that does not have some kind of primer on it.</li>
            <li> Love it! Great coverage and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great for covering up really large pimples and hickeys!</li>
            <li> Best stuff for conceling!</li>
            <li> Great product. I am very pleased with the coverage. It arrived super quick. Color matches well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Very thick!</li>
            <li> Epic fail !!!! I cannot BELIEVE people like this stuff. First off let me say .. I have been looking for a good concealer for awhile .. I have started to develop light freckling on my cheeks and wanted to cover it ..I have been review searching everything . I figured this is cheap enough so hey why not? Let me tell you you get what you pay for ! Save your 6 dollars. This is by far the worst I have tried . It goes on verrrrrry thick like a mask .. So when they say a LITTLE goes a long way that&#x27;s what you need to do here . A tiny dab or you&#x27;re blending for an eternity . Also the color ( I got light medium ) is like a clay gray color . NOT natural at all. But I blended and blended and tried to make the best of it . I put it on and set it with MUFE setting powder AND urban decay setting spray. And guess what ?! Four hours later it was all gone off my nose and under my eyes looking like peeling caking skin . Disgusting! I tried it again just to make sure it was indeed as horrible as I thought. And guess what ?! It doesn&#x27;t even cover a light freckle- I don&#x27;t know how it could possibly cover a tattoo. SMH such a horrible product .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any tattoos but I have lots of dark spots and very uneven facial skin. I&#x27;ve tried SO many different foundantions and concealers and had yet to find one that I truly liked. I was using the Skin79 Pink BB Cream which I still like very much but it doesn&#x27;t have as much coverage as I&#x27;d like it to so I was on the hunt for a new concealer.  The concealers I&#x27;ve purchased always tend to be too thick and cakey. I purchased this product to use only as a concealer. I read the user reveiws on different sites and liked that a little went a long way. When I went to try it, I put a tiny bit on my finger and started smoothing it on. It felt so light and that tiny bit turned into covering my entire chin area and all of my imperfections! I decided to just keep going and try using it all over my face as a foundation and it looked great! I put some pressed powder over it and I was done. It cut my foundation/concealer makeup application at the very least in half! I tried using the pencil but it&#x27;s so hard that I&#x27;d probably have to soften it up some way in order to use it. If I really feel the need I&#x27;ll try it someday but I&#x27;m extremely happy with the liquid concealer. It hasn&#x27;t caused any breakouts or irritation to my face also which is a huge plus. In fact, my skin is actually having less breakouts.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a coincedence or this product. I also have hyperhidrosis of the scalp and face (excessive sweating) and this product stays on when sweat is dripping down my face. I know, ick! ;) I have noticed that it does tend to sink into the the wrinkles I have between my brows but I just touch that up when it happens. My skin is light to medium with yellow undertones and the medium light matches perfectly. I&#x27;m hoping that this concealer stays around for a very long time because I would definitely be extremely disappointed if I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!</li>
