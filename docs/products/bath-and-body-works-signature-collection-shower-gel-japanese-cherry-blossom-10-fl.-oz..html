            <li>The main feature I look for is a good lather.  </li>
            <li>If it came in a bigger bottle that would be great too.</li>

            <li>the person who received it Loved the product and would get the same thing again.</li>
            <li>I received this bottle of body wash super fast.</li>
            <li>lathers well and rinses off cleanly and is good at removing sweat and oil from my skin after a hard workout.  </li>
            <li>This shower gel hydrates my skin and keeps it soft and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>The scent does not last once you get out of the shower (but then, that&#x27;s the case with most shower gels I&#x27;ve used</li>

            <li> It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  </li>
            <li> This is thick and rich and goes a long, long way in the shower, especially with a loofa!</li>

            <li> A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last me 2-3 months at a minimum.  </li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t last very long post shower... but the formula DRIED my skin out.</li>
            <li> and there are only a few quality products that I can use.  </li>
            <li> but I am prone to dryness... and within a few days I had to discard it as my hands were starting to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So either this stuff has been sitting for a very long time and breaking down or something else is in the bottle or added in.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note: if you are sensitive to salicylates (aspirin), artificial dyes, and/or sulfates, this product contains all of those</li>
            <li> it smells horrible and 3.) has given me a major rash on my chest.</li>

            <li> Gift for wife. She likes it. Smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers well.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it.. She smells amazing everytime she s out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, just wish it moisturized better. Also wish it was more concentrated. If it came in a bigger bottle that would be great too.</li>
            <li> This is thick and rich and goes a long, long way in the shower, especially with a loofa!</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person who received it Loved the product and would get the same thing again.</li>
            <li> I have come to the belief this product has been tampered with prior to it getting to my doorstep. 1.) clear tape sealing the lid 2.) it smells horrible and 3.) has given me a major rash on my chest. I have used Bath and Body Works products for years. I didn&#x27;t want to run to the mall so I purchased this product to hold me over until I was back at B&amp;BW. Imagine going into Wal Mart and buying the cheapest perfume they sell. Then douse the entire bottle on you at one time. No exaggeration, this is what this stuff smells like and that is not what it smells like when you buy it from B&amp;BW. When I use on my chest, I break out and look like I have measles and it burns. So either this stuff has been sitting for a very long time and breaking down or something else is in the bottle or added in.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my mom. She&#x27;s loves this scent of this shower gel. These are great for gift giving.</li>
            <li> my daughter loved this gel.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use perfume anymore because after bathing with this Shower Gel I get compliments all day.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants to know what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better shower gels I have tried!  The main feature I look for is a good lather.  This one lathers great.  It only takes a little on my scrubby for my whole body.  I&#x27;m not going to review the scent because that is such a matter of personal taste.  I like the quality of this shower gel and recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use this together with the lotion and body mist. This scent is amazing. This shower gel hydrates my skin and keeps it soft and smooth all day. It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> i love this scent and have been wearing it for years i also use the body spray everyday light and natural</li>
            <li> Actually, check the photos on this page.  I recently stumbled on a 75 percent off sale!  Let&#x27;s just say, if Armageddon ever comes, I&#x27;m gonna be the best smelling, that&#x27;s for sure!  42 bottles of shower gel, 1 tube of lotion shower gel, 1 lotion and a body spray!</li>
            <li> My mother loves this scent so I got her this for Mother&#x27;s Day (:</li>
            <li> this was ordered for a birthday gift and was well received , my daughter just loved it and was so excited it got here on time</li>
            <li> I have been using this shower gel for about 10 years now, and I have to be honest I am not all that thrilled that they changed the formula.  I have very sensitive skin and there are only a few quality products that I can use.  The old formula was one of those products.  We shall see if this works as well.  So far so good though I&#x27;ve only used it twice.so hoping the change won&#x27;t make me have to change products.</li>
            <li> I received this bottle of body wash super fast. It&#x27;s my favourite, I always get compliments on the scent. I&#x27;m very pleased with the service &amp; the item.</li>
            <li> One of my students gave this to me as a gift and I loved the way it smelled. It was easy to buy from Amazon instead of running around trying to find it.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Great Gife my wife love this .product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my mother since she loves this fragrance.</li>
            <li> OK. First, I ordered this, JAPANESE Cherry Blossom.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent the regular cherry blossom. Huge difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After notifying Amazon, they got back to me with either, ship it back and let them send the &#x27;right&#x27; one or just keep it.&lt;br /&gt;The person I spoke with could not grantee they would send the correct one... (something about a &#x27;mixed bin&#x27; or a simple error of grabbing the wrong one) if they had the right one on hand or whatever. I figured I&#x27;d give it to a girlfriend but no takers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did end up using it. It smelled ok. The smell didn&#x27;t last very long post shower... but the formula DRIED my skin out. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but I am prone to dryness... and within a few days I had to discard it as my hands were starting to crack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re ok with getting the REGULAR cherry blossom, and being dried out, try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no response or reaching out from seller beyond my initial Amazon contact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give zero stars if it were an option but Amazon is too kind at times.</li>
            <li> Love love it my hubby loves the smEll I&#x27;m very happy would order it again wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to order again</li>
            <li> Smells great and clean. This is very soft on skin. It&#x27;s like luck in a bottle. Buy this if you love cherry blossoms.</li>
            <li> Sent this as a gift. It took a little long to get to the person, but it turned out ok. The person really loved the shower gel. I love all of Bath and Body works shower gels. This one is no exception.</li>
            <li> Love bath n body products!</li>
            <li> This is another nice shower gel from Bath and Body Works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cherry *blossom* scented, so it smells like flowers (not cherries).  The scent is light and not overpowering, I think.  The scent does not last once you get out of the shower (but then, that&#x27;s the case with most shower gels I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;m not disappointed because of that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lathers well and rinses off cleanly and is good at removing sweat and oil from my skin after a hard workout.  A little goes a long way, so this bottle will last me 2-3 months at a minimum.  I find it non-drying, as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: if you are sensitive to salicylates (aspirin), artificial dyes, and/or sulfates, this product contains all of those and you may want to avoid it.  While I do have sensitive skin, I seem to be OK using this because I wash it off directly after applying it.</li>
            <li> his was a gift and my sister liked it</li>
