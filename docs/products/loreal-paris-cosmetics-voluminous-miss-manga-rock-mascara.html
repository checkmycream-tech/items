            <li>Absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li>this formula/ brush combo is amazing.</li>
            <li>It holds a curl all day and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I just put the oil on, warm washcloth (</li>
            <li>I really liked the way it looked after I put it on, but I would not say this was the best formula as far as waterproof is concerned.</li>
            <li>Love love LOVE this mascara!</li>
            <li>Not the best but makes lashes look nice enough</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I LOVE Miss Manga Rock.</li>
            <li>I really love the manga mascaras.</li>
            <li>I usually do not like the spiky type brushes but this brush works BEAUTIFULLY with this formula.  </li>
            <li>I liked the original Miss Manga</li>
            <li>My expectation was nice fat full volume eyelashes.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look full and long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m well aware of &amp;#34;how&amp;#34; to apply this kind of mascara, so it wasn&#x27;t my technique.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim on a BOGO special since I love the original Miss Manga, Let me tell you honey</li>
            <li>It works best however if you go over it with another mascara to help with the little bit of clumping.</li>
            <li>but I love this mascara so much</li>
            <li>Full of length and volume...</li>
            <li>Cannot say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>It makes your lashes spiky and if you apply more after it dries, you can make them thicker and bigger and spikier.</li>
            <li>I had higher hopes about this product.  </li>
            <li>Eye lashes do not turn out exactly as promised, but I do like the affect.</li>
            <li>Removal of some at the tip was somewhat helpful -- I needed to use a pin to finally separate most of my lashes, which was really time consuming.</li>
            <li>alternate doing this) and it comes off fine with no damage to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lashes are naturally straight, i curly them then apply this</li>
            <li>This mascara creates a great dramatic lash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new Holy Grail mascara!</li>
            <li>main gripe I have is the &amp;#34;clumpiness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>On first open, first application, the product was already clumpy on the applicator.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like this product.</li>
            <li>Mainly because its waterproof and that is part my fault for buying the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the original Miss Manga mascara, so I can&#x27;t say how this compares, but this gives decent lash separation with a very black, spiky finish.</li>
            <li>No it does not look natural.</li>
            <li>and it gives such a lovely babydoll/ false eyelash look without being tacky or too much.</li>
            <li>but i like the mascara in general.</li>
            <li>This one in particular, is slightly thicker than the regular manga brand, and is VERY waterproof.</li>
            <li>If you want a result that is more dramatic, then you might like this.</li>

            <li> I purchased this on a whim on a BOGO special since I love the original Miss Manga, Let me tell you honey this formula/ brush combo is amazing. I usually do not like the spiky type brushes but this brush works BEAUTIFULLY with this formula.  My lashes are naturally straight, i curly them then apply this and it gives such a lovely babydoll/ false eyelash look without being tacky or too much. Lasts all day and all night. I remove it with extra virgin coconut oil. I just put the oil on, warm washcloth (alternate doing this) and it comes off fine with no damage to lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new Holy Grail mascara!</li>
            <li> Ok. This is my new favorite mascara. It makes your lashes look like huge thick fake dolly lashes. I love it. It makes your lashes spiky and if you apply more after it dries, you can make them thicker and bigger and spikier. No it does not look natural. But this is for those of us who want false doll lashes without the trouble!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! It holds a curl all day and it looks amazing. The wand is kinda terrifying and spikey and honestly hurts me a little bit but it&#x27;s nothing I can&#x27;t get past. It literally takes me 10 minutes to remove this, which I&#x27;m not a fan of at all but I love this mascara so much I just suck it up. Great job L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> I liked the original Miss Manga but I LOVE Miss Manga Rock.This mascara creates a great dramatic lash. If you dont like a little clumping then this is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this mascara! It works best however if you go over it with another mascara to help with the little bit of clumping.</li>
            <li> A++ for this mascara! It stays on all day, literally it&#x27;s really hard to remove! Also, it makes my lashes instantly bolder! Full of length and volume... Love this!!</li>
            <li> I had higher hopes about this product.  My expectation was nice fat full volume eyelashes. Not looking for length -- just the volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m well aware of &amp;#34;how&amp;#34; to apply this kind of mascara, so it wasn&#x27;t my technique. It is the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main gripe I have is the &amp;#34;clumpiness&amp;#34;.  On first open, first application, the product was already clumpy on the applicator. Removal of some at the tip was somewhat helpful -- I needed to use a pin to finally separate most of my lashes, which was really time consuming. A second coat was totally out of the question.</li>
            <li> the problem with this mascara is that it totally clumped my eyelashes. i blame the brush but i like the mascara in general. i use a different brush to apply.</li>
            <li> I really love the manga mascaras. This one in particular, is slightly thicker than the regular manga brand, and is VERY waterproof.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way it looked after I put it on, but I would not say this was the best formula as far as waterproof is concerned. Would use again.</li>
            <li> Eye lashes do not turn out exactly as promised, but I do like the affect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the original Miss Manga mascara, so I can&#x27;t say how this compares, but this gives decent lash separation with a very black, spiky finish. Of course, the end result doesn&#x27;t look like the ad pictures, but this mascara does give a doll-like look to your eyelashes. If you want a result that is more dramatic, then you might like this. Plus, I prefer the molded rubber/plastic brushes to the bristle brushes (regular Miss Manga has the bristle brush, Miss Manga Rock has the molded brush).</li>
            <li> I Have To Say I&#x27;ve Gone Through Quite A Bit Of Drugstore Mascaras. I&#x27;ve Tried Several From The Brand And Was Never Impressed Up Until Now. Miss Manga Rock Knocks The Orginal Out Of The Park. This Mascara Has A Baby Doll Effect On The Lashes, Last All Day And Seprates The Lashes Beautifully. Definitely Something Every Girl Should Have In There Beauty Regimen.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like this product. Mainly because its waterproof and that is part my fault for buying the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s like nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get off even with soap. It clumps my lashes together several days at a time. I can&#x27;t gully get the product off my lashes without ripping them off.</li>
            <li> Not the best but makes lashes look nice enough</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work well on my lashes, but the seller delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Love love LOVE this mascara! Cannot say enough good things about it. My eyelashes look full and long and beautiful!</li>
