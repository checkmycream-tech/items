            <li>Great curls, no tangling ....</li>

            <li>This Dryer and Styler is absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice and close for me to pop over and pick it up at the postal stn!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to master the art of using a curling iron, so this tool is the best for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t express how pleased I am with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Thats what I find works best :)</li>
            <li>I love this thing, it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>A Great styling product and a really good price.</li>
            <li>So thrilled to see it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Over the years I have used many of these &amp; felt Revlon offered the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And then, sharing a hotel room with my co-writer, I noticed something astounding!  </li>
            <li>Sure would love to have the 1200 watts with no ions!!!   </li>
            <li>It is a perfect shape and size and easy to control.</li>
            <li>This wonderful product is easy to use and give me the body I want.</li>
            <li>It is very suitable for my hair curly but in my electricity will become 220-250 volts instead of 110 volts could not be used</li>
            <li>The one I have now screams louder than any hair dryer you&#x27;ve ever heard, and after about three minutes you can see a bright flare-up inside the unit and the heating element is done for the day.  </li>
            <li>and I also purchased one for my daughter who loved mine and is so happy to have her own.  </li>
            <li>Good air flow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely delighted and</li>
            <li>it clicks, you are good to go again.</li>
            <li>Looked like a good buy, but wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>If you order it, then GOOD LUCK getting into the package.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit to replace one that I have used and loved for years.  </li>
            <li>Loved it...recommended it to all my girlfriends.  </li>
            <li>Would have loved to have kept this item.  </li>
            <li>She used mine while visiting and loved it as well.  </li>
            <li>I think 5-7 years is a good life</li>
            <li>As good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my hair looked but the one I bought in August has quit working.  </li>
            <li>This one works as good but they changed buttons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as effective and creates frizzy fly aways</li>
            <li>NONE of them are this good.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>This one is a good value in my book.</li>
            <li>Its good to see the shape</li>
            <li>using it saves lots of time and gives good results.</li>
            <li>So what does a good husband say???</li>
            <li>good.</li>
            <li>It was good just not for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>Good heat and wattage</li>
            <li>A really good hair setting tool.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, it is exactly what I needed !!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use for great results.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this seller again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Conair is great, love it...</li>

            <li>This is the best of the hot air styling brushes I have tried and it is a good value.  </li>

            <li>It works great and leaves my extensions silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>, My wife love it, she can cambing too softly, it&#x27;s very nice product.</li>
            <li>Well, the attachments are great, the hot and cool settings are perfect and (when it works) it does a great job styling my hard-to-style hair.    </li>
            <li>I love how my hair comes out... perfect and smooth &amp;#34;bob.&amp;#34;  </li>

            <li>I sure didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>My job requires me to wear a headset for most of the day -- even this can&#x27;t flatten my hair!  </li>

            <li>I love this item!  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite!  </li>
            <li>The Revlon hot air dryer and styler is the best invention.  </li>
            <li>LOVE!  </li>
            <li>My curls aren&#x27;t as perfect as if I use a curling iron, but I still look pretty fab if I do say so myself.  </li>
            <li>By switching to the come like tools, you could style your hair more effectively!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this curling iron/blowdryer!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>but you better have a back-up dryer on hand for when this one dies halfway through the drying process!</li>
            <li>I love this tool!</li>
            <li>Great for blow outs and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have fine, shorter hair, and the bristles on the brushes of this product hold my hair and create great curls.  </li>
            <li>This is a great tool to help smooth and straighter hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this styler; although doesn&#x27;t give very smooth and freeze free results it is a nice tool to get great volume and very nice and defined</li>
            <li>Now I spend 15-20 minutes and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>Styles my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the greatest dryer and styler!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lookes nice and works for a while, but it ended up in the trash within 8 mths of use.</li>
            <li>I have to say my hair comes out really nice with this.  </li>
            <li>That should be against some kind of consumer protection law.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to girls who don&#x27;t have the skills yet have the heart to style their own hair like me.</li>
            <li>My hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice cord which comes out the end and turns as you work which prevents tangling of the cord.</li>
            <li>I really liked the volume it gave me.  </li>
            <li>THINK ANYONE WANTING A GOOD MULTI-PURPOSE STYLER WILL LOVE THIS BRUSH.......</li>
            <li>so she can do her own hair</li>
            <li>Nice item but</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, just a woman that knows how to do her own hair</li>
            <li>+ it gives volume and nice curls.</li>
            <li>you can create a nice bend or wave)</li>
            <li>Seller is excellent, fast shipping but product itself is not meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li>one of the best hot air kit on the market, my wife love it.</li>
            <li>the cool setting is great</li>
            <li>I just got a new shorter haircut and this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to handle and it blows alot of air for good drying.</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY EASY TO HANDLE.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to get curls and waves that stay.</li>
            <li>it is very easy to use and reliable........</li>
            <li>Pretty darned good for someone who is as uncoordinated as me!</li>
            <li>Awesome for getting a near salon blow out!</li>
            <li>I do not have any hair volume, this gave me a healthy amount of volume, I love it!</li>
            <li>But, no fear, Amazon is the BEST as far as returns go!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a hot air brush!!!!</li>
            <li>I am thrilled that I found this dryer on Amazon, my favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li>it is the closest I am able to come to &#x27;Salon hair&#x27;..straightens &amp; volumizes nicely..</li>
            <li>Amazing tool - makes drying my hair so much better and easier.  </li>
            <li>What this thing does for you is more than amazing.  </li>
            <li>but with this dryer you can get a near perfect blow out.</li>
            <li>have very fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair which does not hold style well</li>
            <li>Use quite often, styles very quickly (I have medium length hair) and the two brushes is just a plus!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This little thing is awesome gives great shine never going to use a reg.</li>
            <li>Works Great also great for short hair.</li>
            <li>This type of brush works best for me to have smooth straight hair.</li>
            <li>This is a welcome return of the first  handheld dryers which had a clip on attached brush (Claudio, I think.</li>
            <li>The Hot air dryer and styler is great.  </li>
            <li>This dryer worked great but was just too hot.</li>
            <li>This hot air dryer is a great deal....</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Its very light weight so my arm doesnt feel like its falling off after 10 mins.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job on your hair, and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>All of them touted fancy features and promised amazing results in the most easy to use design</li>
            <li>Amazing product I love it so easy to use 😻😻😻</li>
            <li>Does a great job and leaves my hair in great condition I get so many compliments when I use this to dry my hair</li>
            <li>The large barrel gives great body and wave.  </li>
            <li>The large brush attachment is great for lift.</li>
            <li>This tool is IDEAL for straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I really love this styler.</li>
            <li>Much better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Well, I opened it today and it worked ok.  </li>
            <li>She has had it for many years and loves the way it works with the attachments.</li>
            <li>Since she is pleased then so am I. \\&quot;If</li>
            <li>Love It.</li>
            <li>SO glad I was able to find one here on Amazon</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most helpful to section off your hair when you use this.</li>
            <li>I love this item....</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the medium that I used the most.  </li>
            <li>I could not find it in my local stores, so was so happy to see it on Amazon, at a good price.  </li>
            <li>better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been coordinated enough for the two handed brush-blower method, so this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so healthy</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This nifty gizmo sure does speed up drying and styling and getting out in the morning.</li>
            <li>For more volume I still use my hair blower and a brush, but I&#x27;d recommend this product for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on their hair.    </li>
            <li>Wish it hadn&#x27;t come with the kit, I might have saved even more money... :-)  </li>
            <li>I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite hair dryer</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
            <li>I love the High/Cool setting that allows me to style at will with out burning/</li>
            <li>but  i love it for dog grooming</li>
            <li>Satisfied</li>
            <li>The blowdryer part is ok, but didn&#x27;t like the brushes at all.  </li>
            <li>I have used it more without the brushes on it to get the wetness out of my hair at the roots.  </li>
            <li>Others may be more coordinated and be able to get better hair styling using this brush dryer.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be more of a blower than a styler.  </li>
            <li>If you use it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting often then it will probably burn out real quick.</li>
            <li>The blow-dryer attachment is designed perfectly so there is no awkwardness trying to figure out how to hold it like a traditional L shaped blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>I love what it does</li>
            <li>so I decided to try one more time</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) However, I am exceptionally pleased with this product as it gives me the closest fininsh to having my hair done by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Only reason for the \\&quot;4\\&quot; it is very loud!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>The first day I used it people were like \\&quot;You&#x27;re hair is so nice today!</li>
            <li>I have not used Revlon&#x27;s ceramic version yet, so I cannot attest to whether this is better than that one or not.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li>I would LOVE to have an ORIGNAL REVLON IONIC.    </li>
            <li>I had a Conair one for years and it much better made.</li>
            <li>works perfectly for my short hair style.</li>
            <li>Image most people having hair like spaghetti.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this adds body and style to my hair.  </li>
            <li>have receive many compliments since I began using it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>, I love this hotbrush</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush dryer because I needed to be able to do one handed grooming do to upcoming surgery.  </li>
            <li>all in all, I love it, but it is not for everyone</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>I Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li>I was able to style with just this tool today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At the end I stuck the barrel under the top chunks (so they just draped over the barrel,)</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>IT recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li>It is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love this for styling my hair</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>The two different sized brushes are also great!</li>
            <li>i love this product cuz it is combination of hair dryer and styler.</li>
            <li>this product do it well and makes more volume that i need.great.</li>
            <li>It creates the sleek/soft salon look we love :)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li>Love it makes me look like I&#x27;ve had a pro blow out</li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand and type blower for close to ten years, the best one I have found.  </li>
            <li>or you want to set it better.  </li>
            <li>and I love that feature.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I also loved the powerful wattage.</li>
            <li>The more I use this product the better</li>
            <li>Plus the bristles are great--they hold hair better than Conair rubber type bristle.  </li>
            <li>It straightens my hair but still gives it more volume than when I use a flatiron to straighten it.</li>
            <li>so I miss more than I can curl.  </li>
            <li>switch just would not shut off most of the time.</li>
            <li>Love how it dries, curls, and gives my hair volume with just ONE tool.</li>
            <li>I used to have to blow it out and then curl it to make sure I didn&#x27;t look like a troll doll.  </li>
            <li>it would be nice if they could reduce the sound.</li>
            <li>but this product gives more interest to try it out.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a number of these blow dryers but this one Is my favorite..  </li>
            <li>it falls apart before even me touching it</li>
            <li>The curling while drying eliminates the curling iron out of my morning routine and that sure saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li>I found this item and wasn&#x27;t sure about it -</li>
            <li>etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;She has had so many comments about how lovely her hair looks.</li>
            <li>Quality product, great price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li>Compact stylish...</li>
            <li>Avoid this product - it cannot be used for more than 3 minutes without overheating.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews saying that theirs was over-heating</li>
            <li>I watched the reviews on YouTube and glad I invested in this affordable product.</li>
            <li>While I love it here at home......</li>
            <li>I was hopping to be able to do my hair with the air brush with one hand.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love this item</li>
            <li>/&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>This dryer saves a lot of time (it still takes me 25-30 minutes, but I have a lot of hair), and I love that it does two steps in one.  </li>
            <li>My all-time favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is a brush and dryer in one.</li>
            <li>Love this styler.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Revlon styling tools like this one before and love them.  </li>
            <li>This was the best product I could find closest to what I had prior.</li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and smooth and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>Overall,I&#x27;m pleased with the brush/dryer.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand has been the Conair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lightweight and the extra attachments give you some options, excellent price.</li>
            <li>&quot; One more thing</li>
            <li>I use it most every day now.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn her hair and gets it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>i love this styler.</li>
            <li>I found this brand has the best blower and the option of a quick switch to cool if it gets too hot</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look super healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fast and easy, and my hair alwasys had a great shine.  </li>
            <li>This dryer/styler is very light weight and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The long bristles hold my hair against the aluminum barrel perfectly while drying.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this hot air brush as an alternative / spare to my much beloved VS model.  </li>
            <li>I saw that the John Frieda hot air brush had good reviews</li>
            <li>So this one is the best, but it is nothing to compare with, working just fine for last 4 month.</li>
            <li>Handled brush (which has a great grip and adds ions to my hair) and hope that the new Helen of Troy will work for me.    </li>
            <li>Works best on hair that is already 80% dry.</li>
            <li>this had been a hair saver for me - quick, efficient and effective...    </li>
            <li>I have tried many hair dryers, but this is so easy to use and dries my hair in the shortest time.  </li>
            <li>best product on the market to actually dry your hair while you style it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, it doesn&#x27;t require much coordination (great for the mornings...yawn!)</li>
            <li>: the air is very hot even at lowest position, attachment is not that handy.</li>
            <li>This is a great dryer for people who are short on time and need a great style FAST!</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to get good with this new hair dryer/curling iron, but with more use I am getting better....</li>
            <li>Now, before you think that there must be a problem with my hands and that must be th reason I had so many problems with it, my hands are fine.  </li>
            <li>For someone like me who isn&#x27;t a very good stylist, this dryer with a brush makes an enormous difference!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very pleased using hot air brushes for perhaps 15 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of styling techniques and products, and nothing really looks that good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful, gives my hair more volume, everybody thinks my hair is thicker then</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other barrel-type hair dryers and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I just received this Revlon hot air brush and I love it!</li>
            <li>This hot air kit is even more functional than a hair dryer!</li>
            <li>I have had my original one for 5 or more years</li>
            <li>I hope the new one I get works as good but more importantly</li>
            <li>It gives me the look I like &amp; is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t be used on the highest level because it overheats easily.</li>
            <li>This makes it really easy to style my hair and get that blow out look after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>My ordered arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>Now, it can break easily if you drop it or bang it around</li>
            <li>Dries and styles in one easy step.</li>
            <li>and it was so easy.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it on Amazon.com after not being able to find it at my local retailer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Things I like about it:  Easy to attach and unattach the attachments.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to use - if you can use a curling iron, you can use this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to do too.  </li>
            <li>I found myself covering that part as I was styling my hair, but it can also be easily avoided too.  </li>
            <li>I can style my hair very quickly and easily</li>
            <li>had plastic tips that were longer, could be removed, and had a grooved texture and narrower width -- they were easy to grasp and easy to distinguish from the barrel without looking.  </li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to change.</li>
            <li>Had older version and loved it.  </li>
            <li>But overall for the price it is good to have handy and it has three heads.</li>
            <li>For years I used a hair dryer with a brush and on special occasions, when I wanted more fullness and style, I used a Braun, Butane Gas Curling Brush that is no longer made.    </li>
            <li>Made a great general hair dryer though.</li>
            <li>When I first got this brush, I really liked it.</li>
            <li>First off the pros for this appliance: Smooths the hair nicely as it dries, also if you hold it in one spot</li>
            <li>The Revlon Ionic Dryer and Styler is the best product that I&#x27;ve found to quickly and easily dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it has been working fine ever since.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t hold the styler still for long--keep wrapping and rewrapping and pulling thru, and it&#x27;ll work fine.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and somewhat wavy, the brushes hold the hair well, unlike curling irons where the hair slips off of the rod.</li>
            <li>would buy again light weight easy on the hands and fingers it</li>
            <li>I have fine, frizzy hair that is slightly wavy, and have used these type of stylers to eliminate the frizz and perfectly straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and this brush gave me the frizzes&#x27;.</li>
            <li>PART IS SO LIGHT AND EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li>Fine for super-fast touch ups, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t touched the reset button since then and the dryer has worked fine.</li>
            <li>Wish that it didn&#x27;t get quite so hot but overall great value!!</li>
            <li>Because of the brush you are able to get better control and focus on the hot air flow.</li>
            <li>Great for refreshing hairdo on days when I don&#x27;t wash and dry.</li>
            <li>This is the only hair gadget that I own and that&#x27;s okay because it has the function of two!</li>
            <li>I really love this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li>From the Mrs. here--This little hair tool is great!  </li>
            <li>Very good product and working as expected.  </li>
            <li>This has made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>huge hastle.  </li>
            <li>Even though they both have 500 watts for some reason the difference was huge.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these recently and have not been at all happy with it.  </li>
            <li>and then I use this to smooth and style my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smooth, sleek and shiny without having to add any smoothing products.</li>
            <li>This leaves a hand free.</li>
            <li>I just use coconut oil to smooth the fly-aways after I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the longevity of this product, if it lasts even six months of daily use I could consider it a great achievement.</li>
            <li>and it smoothed it out nicely without it being to straight.  </li>
            <li>hit is with hot, then hit it with cool, and the end result was a lot more volume on top.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts when I ordered this because it was so cheap,</li>
            <li>Adds fullness and light curl to the ends.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair always looking nice without much effort.</li>
            <li>The ion light stays on but just stops drying and rotating.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, I have bought 5 (gifts) and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li>I received the RV-7497 which does not have an ION on/off switch with light.  </li>
            <li>Happy it was only $20, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer will come out with some larger barrel attachments - 2\\&quot; would be great.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the bulky Spin Brush, its shaped well to fit your hand.  </li>
            <li>One of them had a tendency to shut itself off, meaning it was overheating, so I tossed it, but the others have been fantastic.</li>
            <li>The 1200 watts is great for gettng hair &amp;#34;damp dry&amp;#34;, then pop on the proper brush size and style away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years, it is awesome!</li>
            <li>I just light mist</li>
            <li>I smooth through the style with my fingers and use a mist of hairspray-</li>
            <li>I had read it makes your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and can also curl if that is what you like.</li>
            <li>I hope this product stays available.</li>
            <li>The Cons: It heats up way too fast, honestly I was worried it would overheat and damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I can get much better drying results with my regular hair dryer and a good brush.    </li>
            <li>I loved the first one, so when I dropped and broke the first one I had to get another.   </li>
            <li>Okay, I never leave reviews, but I love this thing so much..</li>
            <li>So far so good, hope it holds up.</li>
            <li>Maybe good for someone who is extremely good with their hands - I&#x27;m good but found this difficult.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest using the cool blast until the hair is cooled before you remove the hair from the brush after it has been curled..</li>
            <li>WHOA, IS IT HOT!!  </li>
            <li>This beautiful trend-setting blonde uses a hot air brush!  </li>
            <li>This is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and full and smooth.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li>It is super easy to get the height and curl</li>
            <li>My fuzzy straight hair comes out smooth and shiny and I can do great natural looking flips and lifts.</li>
            <li>I used the Model number that was on the original I had purchased and ordered two.    </li>
            <li>it was NOT a duplicate of the original I had bought (even though I send the model number when ordering).       </li>
            <li>this blowdries my hair smooth but full of body.  </li>
            <li>However, since most younger people like   over-sized barrells (this comes with a 1 inch and a 1 1/14), you will be much more pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li>The original model had a button where you could turn on and off the ionic feature.</li>
            <li>When I first discovered it, I called it my \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Great product for as long as it lasted.</li>
            <li>My favorite hair styling hot air dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this hot air brush and have used one for years.</li>
            <li>I can only get a few good, perfectly functioning months out of one of these things, and after that it smokes and overheats</li>
            <li>The top end where you place your fingers for add support while styling can get too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>Someone with fine straight hair would probably be better with another dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a great little dryer with the most watts for your buck.  </li>
            <li>High setting is good for drying, but too hot for curling.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have a free hand to handle the hair instead of brush in one hand and hairblower in the other when doing your own hair.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to buy the same dryer again.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you have different kind of hair, and longer arms, you will love it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to purchase a hot air dryer with brushes, I would make sure you get one with the cool setting, to set the curls, like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out how to clean the barrel.</li>
            <li>This tool does both and gives a nice lift that I used to be only able to get from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li>I have even smelled burning hair even though I clean it.</li>
            <li>That being said it&#x27;s an excellent value and for the first time in my life I have straight frizz-free hair on a regular basis!</li>
            <li>I have used many similar products and find the Revlon Ionic Hot Air Stylers are the most reasonably priced and still a good product.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair SO MUCH body, its just wonderful, and it dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very powerful dryer and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>Thought the older version was a little more effective, but for the cost, it&#x27;s a good buy and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had more hot air stylers than hot dinners, but this one beats the lot!  </li>
            <li>I  am very pleased with this products performance and would highly recommend it to anyone lookinig for a hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many of these styling dryers over the years, and this one is the most powerful by far.</li>
            <li>After doing some research I realized that for my type of hair I needed a more powerful hot hair brush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as amazing as my old one</li>
            <li>The finished style has nice volume but pretty darned straight.  </li>
            <li>If only I could operate the button, I could make my hair look really good with the RV440.  </li>
            <li>The smaller good for definition.  </li>
            <li>wait for it to cool</li>
            <li>my best groom dryer at least for now do now use brushes at all husband used it to dru paint on wood</li>
            <li>I looked in the mirror and realized it had burned off a good section (about 1 inch by 1 inch) of my hair in the back of my head.</li>
            <li>They specify 3 speed settings and 3 heat settings, but this isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li>I find my hair is smoother and full bodied and holds the style longer.</li>
            <li>The cool setting was not at all cool or even room temperature.  </li>
            <li>Its cool because it dries your hair, straightens, and gives it flip or curl.</li>
            <li>I really fell in love with this dryer.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price either :-)</li>
            <li>It also has a cool setting to set your curls.  </li>
            <li>So, I couldn&#x27;t get the  full volume results I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li>Has all the features I want, like a cool setting.</li>
            <li>Tried the restart button; gave it time to cool.  </li>
            <li>I tend to use it on the lower or cool settings.  </li>
            <li>it went to cool to set curl.  </li>
            <li>I have not found this to be true.</li>
            <li>If you have very curly hair like me you will fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love it</li>
            <li>Not all have the cool button</li>
            <li>It is very convenient and help me detangle my hair better.</li>
            <li>I also like the COOL shot after I&#x27;ve done styling, which locks in the curl.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know when you would ever use the cool setting, but I suppose some people might find a use for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about mine.</li>
            <li>That seemed to give me the blast of cool air</li>
            <li>I do use a syrum in the ends, but that is more to prevent split ends as my hair is very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT is a great little product that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Loved it because it dries very quickly into a smooth, slightly curled style.  </li>
            <li>This gives me good volume and body and just enough curl for a soft smooth bob hairdo, dries my hair quickly with one hand and fits in my gym bag much better than a dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same one I used to own and love except for the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cool and the very hot still work, but</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>The design is good -- lightweight, easy to use, I like that it doesn&#x27;t spin like other models and it has never gotten tangled in my hair, and you can change out the size of the brush</li>
            <li>This product is seriously the best thing I ever bought for my hair.</li>
            <li>But, it does an adequate job.  </li>
            <li>and I see it wearing out quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of this air brush, but obviously needs a cooling factor and over all better quality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, but I would really like to get something similar, because it&#x27;s a great hair tool when it&#x27;s not faulty.   </li>
            <li>I would love it if  someone put out the older style.</li>
            <li>It is super</li>
            <li>I have extensions that get super frizzy and unsightly</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this even better than my last one!</li>
            <li>melting my hair like most blow dryers and curling irons tend to do on high.  </li>
            <li>I found it still works, but I have to use on high to make sure it gets the flow of air all the way through the barrel.  </li>
            <li>, i make hair look more manageable and less  frizzy ,  i have a lot of hair ,  its brushes wont stick long into it  when i style , but it is perfect  and good quality product for those have normal not thick freezze hair</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one on the shelves!!!</li>
            <li>It also gets very hot to hang on to.  </li>
            <li>You have to soak the brushes in very hot water every couple of months if you use product in your hair.  </li>
            <li>The dryer gets very hot on the highest setting and when the brush comes off you are at risk of burning yourself on the metal part of the brush.</li>
            <li>this Revlon Shine enhancing Hot Air Kit feels like a feather (maybe not as light</li>
            <li>Glad I did because the second one I purchased actually works great and has no problems with the switch.  </li>
            <li>the 1st use I was in love with it, my mom used mine and ended up buying on for herself, I also had 2 other friends who liked mine and decided to purchase one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The nozzle gets VERY HOT.</li>
            <li>But it does get VERY hot and has burned my skin.  </li>
            <li>first thing that surprised me was that it gave me more volume at the roots!  </li>
            <li>It has helped me cut down on styling time and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>It blows cool air just fine but really?</li>
            <li>For a person with fine hair, it is superior to a curling iron when smoothing and styling hair because it doesn&#x27;t smash hair down but provides a refining lift.  </li>
            <li>the clip on it broke, so the attachments wont go on any more, for this reason I am buying a new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll work again but then shut off right away after you let it cool.</li>
            <li>Gave great style but over heats withing less than two minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not good at doing my own hair, but this thing makes me look good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been recently purchasing replacement for a con air hot brush I loved for years.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks so good when I use this to dry and style.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, light weight, effective the only reason its not 5 stars is because it is very loud</li>
            <li>BUT LOVE IT SO FAR!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>Love this for quickly styling my fine hair, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li>So much easier than using a hair dryer!!</li>
            <li>Does a pretty descent job at drying your hair without causing frizzies!</li>
            <li>I just got this and have only used it once, but I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>If this is your problem, as it is mine, use this Hot Air Drier and Styler!</li>
            <li>It has to get hot in order to style!</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li>So hot!</li>
            <li>This thing is just way too hot !</li>
            <li>I loved the product this replaced but when the attachment lock broke on the old model I needed to buy the new one.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use and sure beats the two-handed styling with a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fortunate to have hair that people frequently compliment.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine straight hair in a medium length \\&quot;bob\\&quot; type hairstyle.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, you can&#x27;t get the hair to roll because there&#x27;s so much air being blown on the piece of hair you are working with.  </li>
            <li>I have relatively straight, fine hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming it works well for folks with fine and straight hair, but for gals like me, with tones of wavy hair, the brushes just couldn&#x27;t handle my hair.</li>
            <li>Then the styler brush is great for adding a little curl.</li>
            <li>Dries fast and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I found it at Amazon at a great price, received it in just a few days,</li>
            <li>Drys my hair fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work amazingly</li>
            <li>Its much easier to use than a hairdryer and brush to get a smooth blow out.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the ionic feature, which leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The barrel is nice and fat, and the bristles hold the hair just enough without tangling.  </li>
            <li>it is not as powerful.</li>
            <li>I think I got my money&#x27;s worth for each one.</li>
            <li>Definately worth it tho.</li>
            <li>I have short curly hair and the dryer smoothes it out and makes it nice and wavy.</li>
            <li>I laugh at whoever gets it stuck in their hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly/wavy...and getting more, platinum, shall we say, by the hour.   </li>
            <li>This item works 100% better than my old one.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised at the great reviews, I guess I had a different experience.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>My old Revlon was much better.</li>
            <li>I can actually get good results fast with this unit</li>
            <li>The bristles are to soft to roll your hair on that you end up touching the barrel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li>I love the way it points directly to the location for drying.</li>
            <li>and I love the bristles on the brush; it&#x27;s really soft to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>Even my husband has commented several times on how nice my hair looks now.</li>
            <li>I have used several of these curler/blow dryer products over the years and have really liked them.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fun to work with.  </li>
            <li>And it is fun -</li>
            <li>Totally worth the price</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>But, that was rare.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, the super hot heat really does set my hair really well for the rest of the day!!!</li>
            <li>First one came damaged but Amazon was quick to replace.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very short and don&#x27;t catch the hair easily (which is also a postive feature because my hair didn&#x27;t get easily tangled).</li>
            <li>This is the very first hot airbrush that has not offered the option to turn off the ionic treatment.</li>
            <li>On the original I purchased,  the \\&quot;settings button\\&quot; was raised and MUCH      easier to use.    </li>
            <li>I have same product that I purchase many years ago in the store and this new one is not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>I threw the dryer right into the garbage.</li>
            <li>The right amount of heat and blow from the dryer inside.  </li>
            <li>The control buttons for on off and temperature are located on the handle right under the spring loaded clamp.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>I am right handed.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something that would eliminate me sweating right after the shower while I fix my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but you get the comparison right?)</li>
            <li>Eventually, they might burn out and one I had years ago did it right away (which I returned).  </li>
            <li>Removing it right after using it is dangerous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My issue was that it over heated very quickly and after only 5 months the thing started smoking after less than 1 min of use and broke for good!  </li>
            <li>Live it, it is Easy to use,</li>
            <li>Not too hot, but just warm enough.  </li>
            <li>first thing I liked about this dryer is the extra nozzle attachment.  </li>
            <li>IT MAKES MY HAIR TIME VERY EASY AND SIMPLE!    </li>
            <li>It gives the same results but is WAY easier because you are only using 1 tool instead of 2 :) LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Before I blow dry, I comb Biotin &amp; collagen oil treatment through my hair which promotes more shine!</li>
            <li>The barrel is huge, way too big for me to handle easily.  </li>
            <li>You can go from damp hair to the best look possible in half the time with this Revolon ionizer.</li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot and drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a great product have to be careful as it gets hot on high</li>
            <li>I have had several of these of different brands, styles, features and prices and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>recommend to prep your hair with the right products; for curl definition I really like Aussie Curl Define mousse; very niche and light weight product that doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue on the hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I wanted but doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li>Most other similar dryers have a cool shot button, but not an actual cool setting, this one does, and it great- til it quits working.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work right out of the package and I returned it.  </li>
            <li>I am now on my second Revlon Ionizer Roller Brush and it works great to dry my curly hair straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product has enough power for a quick dry and great body.</li>
            <li>It only took a few times to figure out how to best use it</li>
            <li>Works great for styling and drying your hair, the multiple settings and different attachments are a plus.</li>
            <li>It has a cool shot which is also very helpful as it gets hot.</li>
            <li>I did purchase a third, similar, Revlon RVTH500 Tourmaline Heat 1500W Hot Air Styler w/ Nano Ceramic, it works great.</li>
            <li>As a dryer the Revlon dries very fast but as stylist, I would have perferred a 3/4 barrell.  </li>
            <li>ONE PROBLEM, it doesn&#x27;t have very much power</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>only issue is it gets very hot, even on the lower heat level, so I&#x27;m just careful with it, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>I use the high heat for 10 seconds, then the cool to set the curl.</li>
            <li>Roll the air on the brush and roll and use the medium or high heat depending on your preference, then without releasing the hair switch to the cool option to set the curl/hair then release.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to treat my hair a little more gently these days, so I mostly use the cooler setting, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry I can kick up the heat.  </li>
            <li>but I was able to fix that issue with a simple hair tie wrapped around to cover the seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Naturally I chose Amazon because the item qualified for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>and it got so hot it was burning my scalp.  </li>
            <li>...too hot to touch.</li>
            <li>Plus, the air coming out of the attachments is so hot</li>
            <li>The iron got too hot and overheated.  </li>
            <li>It gets extremely hot to the point of burning    your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried similar ones &amp; most of them overheat &amp; burn out.</li>
            <li>Also the barrel was so hot that I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>My first broke in Italy</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>More than likely, its just a fuse that blows but I&#x27;m just not going to take the time to figure that out.   </li>
            <li>The first one I bought was the 1800 watt, and that thing is too hot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying another one, because my daughter broke the first one.  </li>
            <li>I bought one and used it yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li>It is not a dryer, just a hot brush which is also 1 1/2 around.</li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li>First of all, let&#x27;s talk about the noise level on this thing.  </li>
            <li>This Brush worked wonders for me and the first time I used it someone stopped me and said I had been to a hair salon.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes for better flips, curls, waves.</li>
            <li>B000PXYAL2 Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic]], which doesn&#x27;t seem to have these unwanted vents,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I comb the tangles out and add a heat protector cream and then use the Hot Air Dryer.</li>
            <li>I first part my hair into six sections</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been searching for a different brand w/ a higher wattage in hopes to resolve the problem, but have been able to find anything I like the looks of..</li>
            <li>had I been more organized I would have sent the others back..</li>
            <li>and  would be lost without this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>My biggest problem was how hot the air was.</li>
            <li>K Revlon RV440C 1200W Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler]]</li>
            <li>Let me first start by saying I ordered this product on Saturday, February 7, 2015</li>
            <li>I love the multiple heads expecially the concentrator</li>
            <li>the Hot setting is TOO hot.</li>
            <li>When I first got it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for years.  </li>
            <li>Me encanta este hot brush le he tenido hace unos 4</li>
            <li>I loved this product for the first few months.  </li>
            <li>my hair takes 45-55 minutes, it dose get REALY hot</li>
            <li>It does the job pretty well and is durable.</li>
            <li>Had my first one for over 4 years and just got this one to replace it.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I thought it was going to be the answer to my problems, then the brush kept coming off</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how much body my hair has with no products!</li>
            <li>I have this exact Hot Air Kit from the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Noticed many people had similar problems from the reviews.</li>
            <li>The vents under the brush attachments blow hot air out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other brands I have tried:  Hot Tools and John Frieda.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is how I use the revlon hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li>The John frieda hot air brush left my hair noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why I decided to give this Revlon hot air brush a chance.</li>
            <li>I do my whole hair with it, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li>First of all...</li>
            <li>I bought my first one around 14 years ago or so.</li>
            <li>and the tips get hot</li>
            <li>I bought this Revlon Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li>, After I bought this one I tried to use it, it&#x27;s really hot, the brush is burn you can smell of burning rubber.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Such a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not difficult to hold or handle, but it makes my hair frizzier than a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy one of the hot brush dryer when I tried out my friend&#x27;s once.</li>
            <li>I used to use electric rollers (have hundreds of them) but using this hot air dryer and styler</li>
            <li>This is a great smoothing product for frizzy and thick hair.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s probably great for thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>ok, i ordered this product and never once received it, so i wanted a refund but never once got it back.</li>
            <li>Kinda funny..</li>
            <li>Very upset with myself!  </li>
            <li>It has to be there, otherwise the brush is too hot  to touch.</li>
            <li>I hope I find a better brand some day (currently looking).</li>
            <li>I first bought the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler.  </li>
            <li>Most likely because of the heat - this thing is HOT.</li>
            <li>It is too hot for me.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair, this does a great job of minimizing the time I spend to straighten it.</li>
            <li>The top piece has already been popping off andthe attachment has already started falling off like my last one.</li>
            <li>A Hot Air Brush will help in controlling the frizz.  </li>
            <li>I had to return this Hot air brush after two weeks because it no longer heated.  </li>
            <li>This Hot Air Kit was given for Christmas to a family member who had requested it.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but has blown a fuse ever 1/4 times of use.</li>
            <li>This hot air dryer brush does add shine to my hair,easy to hold and is well made..</li>
            <li>I purchased this one and a similar Revlon brush which I also like but this is my favorite..</li>
            <li>I had a hot air brush simular to this one years ago.</li>
            <li>i love the attachments but the handle is too short and your hand ends up on the air flow vents</li>
            <li>I like my hair after using this hot air brush.</li>
            <li>The item description states that this hot brush has an ion on/of switch.</li>
            <li>returning this item, and the search will go on for a non-ionic hot brush.</li>
            <li>I bought mine at CVS pharmacy, but it is this exact product.  </li>
            <li>Then I section my hair (top, middle, bottom).  </li>
            <li>Use the thick brush and works great.</li>
            <li>Move than what she asked for, but exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li>spent considerable time trying to figure how to use this successfully, but no matter how I tried, I ended up burning my fingers and scalp.</li>
            <li>The hot air styling wand is one of those products I just assumed belonged to that category of woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get pretty hot even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>It is fast and fun to use.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it dried and styled my hair.  </li>
            <li>Did a good job straightening one of my clients hair, she has naturally curly hair, but it is not as powerful as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>This tool makes it so easy that I actually take a little extra time in the morning to use it, and my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li>The best way to use it is to wait until your hair is almost dry but still a little damp.</li>
            <li>Also, this product has a super high wattage comapaired to those I have found in discount stores.</li>
            <li>She loves the new one and claims it has more power then the old one ever had.</li>
            <li>High power, several settings, very easy to use.</li>
            <li>When I was able to actually get hair to stay on the brush, it worked really well and very fast.</li>
            <li>I get all day body and shine that is amazing without using any other products except hair spray to finish it off.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have nearly as many split ends as my flat iron created.</li>
            <li>I have since bought a Chi Flat Iron and LOVE it.</li>
            <li>though I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in its natural state of wavy chaos, I bought the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot Air Kit, for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I had previously owned an older version of this hair dryer/styler and loved it.</li>
            <li>And I get a nice soft wave or even a lot straighter than just regular blow drying.  </li>
            <li>This is an obvious design flaw, and although I try my best to keep my hair out of the crevice, at least once each time I style my hair, it gets caught in the end and rips out of my head.</li>
            <li>The high heat and powerful blow dryer aren&#x27;t of much use if the plastic tips on the barrels are too short to hold without fingers touching the metal and</li>
            <li>The first day I used it, when I went to work people kept complimenting on my new haircut!!  </li>
            <li>Have received many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this to tame it and give it a light curl rather than the unruly curls I am used to.</li>
            <li>The texture of finish of my hair comes out so much better than using a blow dryer, meaning it has a soft wave to it and is not slightly frizzy.  </li>
            <li>i have nothing positive to ay about this item.</li>
            <li>some positive reviews on this and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  </li>
            <li>This is the first of these products that I&#x27;ve really had a problem with.</li>
            <li>It does get hot really fast</li>
            <li>Seriously love it and wish I had purchased one a long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The brush gets hot fast so be prepared.  </li>
            <li>Try to get your roots straight first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even used it on dry hair and it works great on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li>It does get very hot on the hottest setting, but dries hair quicker than most others and with less frizz.</li>
            <li>Cool is fast blower with no heat (and if you want to use low heat, followed by a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot;, you have to cycle through a high power blast of heat first).    </li>
            <li>It is great for those of us who have a hard time with blow dryer and brush!</li>
            <li>It dries my hair very quickly and styles it at the same time.</li>
            <li>The Cool/High setting on this model is just warm enough to dry and curl quickly without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li>took off one star only because the attachments don&#x27;t change out easily.</li>
            <li>though.one star only because the attachments don&#x27;t change out easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d wanted something with a bit more power that would dry my hair faster.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to do the back of the hair as well as the front.  </li>
            <li>Even so, with this producut I am able to dry &amp; style my hair every morning</li>
            <li>Pro: I love this blower it is so easy to have to use just one hand to style and dry your hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I pick up a part of the section of my hair and apply the brush at the scalp and run the brush under the hair and then on top of the hair about 3-5 times on both sides of the hair until dry</li>
            <li>It is worth it because it saves me precious time in the morning when I am getting ready, I don&#x27;t get all sweaty, my hand doesn&#x27;t cramp, and my hair looks better than if I used a wooden round brush w/hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I really have problems blow drying my hair straight without getting frizz, so I decided to buy a hot air dryer.</li>
            <li>It is fairly easy to get used to handling, and you accomplish drying and curling at the same time.  </li>
            <li>and they made your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t blow all over the place when trying to dry it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the blowing mechanism is strong and keeps your hair from wanting to curl around the brush.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t yet and certainly don&#x27;t plan too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty heavy compared to others (probably because of the motor is more powerful).  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this styler and it IS loud and very hot.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your precious locks or your money!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to work and has multiple heat settings - the high setting gets really hot.  </li>
            <li>but then this of type of curler is always loud especially on high.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this dryer/styler for several years - it has to be replaced every year or so which is fine...</li>
            <li>This styler dries and smoothes my shortish and very fine hair quickly; doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume but does eliminate frizzies and makes it look shinier than usual.</li>
            <li>I use the smaller barrel to style my bangs, but the air from the vents blows my fine bangs all over the place as I try to latch onto them with the bristles of the barrel.  </li>
            <li>Iconic Hot Air Dryer is not only offers a much easier technique, it also achieves the straight (no curls)</li>
            <li>The product works great especially for my super thick hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better for those with really thick hair, but I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bristles on the barrel are separated enough to grab my hair (and I have fine hair-doesnt take much).</li>
            <li>And it gets too hot on HIGH.      </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve found is that if I&#x27;m using high heat for any length of time, the barrel gets as hot as a curling iron.</li>
            <li>The high heat selection is too hot and</li>
            <li>After the first use I&#x27;m returning it and getting the John Freida, which I see is highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I fireup the Revlon hot air brush on high for about 10 seconds, let it get warmed up.  </li>
            <li>The whole unit is really bulky and quite large.  </li>
            <li>(Most importantly)...The \\&quot;settings button\\&quot; on the new product is FLAT....      </li>
            <li>I bought it at Target a little over a month ago and so far, it&#x27;s the best 20 bucks I ever spent.  </li>
            <li>I had one before but this one is new and improved and seems more powerful than the other.</li>
            <li>but when you have to have your hair just right or have someplace special to go.......I blow dry because I can control the styling better when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li>roughly so it does require a bit more gentle care than a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Crossing my fingers it lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>i used it twice and threw it in the trash - it is absolutely a disaster</li>
            <li>So much easier to style my hair.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It takes frizz out and really smooths my hair.  </li>
            <li>so if really straight is what you desire you&#x27;re going to have to use a straightener.</li>
            <li>Thanks,  Susan  Update 10/13/11  </li>
            <li>As described and delivered fast.  </li>
            <li>are that the power is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Used along with a foaming mousse, it feels like I have twice as much hair.  </li>
            <li>this works very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset.</li>
            <li>I actually owned one of these and the bristles on it were cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>In the end my hair was still frizzy, without the shine, and had WAY too much volume.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what the purpose is of the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; feature.  </li>
            <li>This works really well and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really care for this brush.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Revlon</li>
            <li>All the gel and hairspray in the world could not give me anything, but string straight hair.</li>
            <li>It is a very well contructed product.</li>
            <li>It really scared me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They have changed the heat levels in a way that doesn&#x27;t make much sense.</li>
            <li>I have medium-thick, fine-textured, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I can make my hair almost straight or flip the ends under.  </li>
            <li>but it does not work very well.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use this if you want a &#x27;gentle&#x27; hair-dryer because it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>It tames her hair to waves when she wants that look and makes it much easier to straighten for days</li>
            <li>she wants that look.</li>
            <li>Would really like to know where I can get it if they will not send it.  </li>
            <li>Use it every day to create lots of volume, and it&#x27;s very east to use.</li>
            <li>And it very noisy.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really style my hair while damp.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise works very well.</li>
            <li>Very noisy though</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, and I can style it anyway I choose.</li>
            <li>and it was gentle on my hair</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll absolutely order another one.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is straight to begin with, that&#x27;s not helpful to me.</li>
            <li>very dissapointed</li>
            <li>Really dries and curls fast, so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if the &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; feature is real or just marketing, but I don&#x27;t really care - this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>As always with Amazon, order processing was fast and item was received within estimated time.  </li>
            <li>This dryer does work very well.</li>
            <li>Use this nozzle first, as you would your normal dryer, to remove alot of the moisture.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and for me, that is a bonus since I have had rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are tiny, wiggly and cheaply made and wont hold my hair and the bristles just slide on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I was scared my hair might get tangled in the brush and that the heat would be too much by my scalp.</li>
            <li>So I would really recommend this item.</li>
            <li>she started to use it the very day she got it ..</li>
            <li>She loves it and raves about how it saves her so much time styling her hair and doesn&#x27;t need to have anymore additional &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; to fix her hair.  </li>
            <li>A half-done head of hair doesn&#x27;t really suit my sense of style.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Drys the hair fast and really straight.......and having the brush piece attached helps make the process easier than using a brush and blow dryer separately.  </li>
            <li>Blows my hair so straight</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The same one is no longer available.</li>
            <li>The whole process including blow drying and then using the Revlon tool once hair is just damp is about 20 minutes, as my hair is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li>it really is!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>and then another 30-45 minutes using a straight iron; then another 30 minutes with a curling iron...</li>
            <li>The tips on these barrels are permanently attached, too short to grasp well, and made of smooth plastic</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to work it very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see Revlon bring back the old design.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s salon quality, but it makes my hair look natural, only better.  </li>
            <li>Finally, I direct the top section back.  </li>
            <li>I did the right side with the Infinity Pro and the left side with the John frieda hot air brush and what a difference!</li>
            <li>They last a long time and are easy to operate and are \\&quot;balanced well\\&quot;, which is important.  </li>
            <li>This product helps tame my unmanageable hair and makes it look soft, smooth, and healthy.</li>
            <li>It really makes my life easier, but it takes a long time to dry my hair and obtain a good result.</li>
            <li>But as you can see, I can&#x27;t live without this hot air dryer as it makes hair styling much easier.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatly it didnt have duel voltage so not able to use it in New Zealand maybe be good idea to state this when advertising product .</li>
            <li>My hair is a short pixie, but my bangs are long enough for the large brush and the smaller one is good for the top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used previous models of this hot brush for about 15 years and love it, when I can turn off the ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first same item broke quickly, so I have been using this one for about a year.</li>
            <li>How it works:  3 settings: High, Low and Cool (the high and low are warm air and the cool blows out the same amount of air as the high setting, but it&#x27;s cool air, not warm).  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to to dry with this light weight dryer and a round brush to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li>I said, no, I used my new Ionic hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>I have long, thick, coarse, naturally curly/frizzy hair, and this dryer makes my hair shiny, smooth, and with a perfect curled-end flip.  </li>
            <li>I have long layers and this just never worked as well as my old favorite that was light purple and white.</li>
            <li>Works great, but it is ridiculous how loud the dryer is.  </li>
            <li>The older blue model is fantastic, get that instead.</li>
            <li>Using a flat iron afterwards makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>This is my second, the first survived more than 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li>BECAUSE, the 2 products I received were different from the original I had bought in these ways:    </li>
            <li>The final result is a smooth, soft finsihed look without the use of additional styling tools like hot rollers or a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have long, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This tool makes it incredibly easy to blow dry my hair while still giving it volume and bounce.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s much lighter than the old one.</li>
            <li>(not sure my dad will do that great of a job if it&#x27;s left to him!)</li>
            <li>Three out of four worked fine and for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I really do not think that this is a good purchase because it takes so much time to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li>Its decent and does the job, but it does not have teh same punch as my original one.</li>
            <li>High is fast blower with heat.</li>
            <li>the bristles are fine (at least on my fine hair.)  </li>
            <li>it does very well is dry your hair, add volume and smooth it.  </li>
            <li>This unit is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that gets hot enough to really add some volume and curl to my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I don&#x27;t have enough practice using this with brushes that don&#x27;t roll on their own so it was unpractical to dry my hair using the attachable stationery brushes.</li>
            <li>I used to spend about 45 minutes blow drying my hair with a more typical dryer, then using either a flat iron or a curling iron to smooth it out...took forever.  </li>
            <li>I love the results it gives me, and it&#x27;s easy to use--though I agree, seriously, that if you are using the high setting you should wear earplugs--it really is that loud.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a whole new one after I messed up my kit&#x27;s larger barrel brush while trying to clean it</li>
            <li>It created light smoke one time when I used it for too long - my fire alarm went off.</li>
            <li>it stays wavy, bouncy, the ends of my hair look smooth, and it holds the style ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li>The product I swapped it for was a Conair double ionic port dryer, with a cool shot button, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li>I have not found that to be true compared to my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The end of the brush remains cool enough to touch, which makes styling easier for me.  </li>
            <li>first of all, the brushes are so soft that the hair won&#x27;t even adhere to it...</li>
            <li>which makes changing them when hot sensitive to fingers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hyperventilate trying to cool it off enough to use it again.  </li>
            <li>I like it for daily re-styling and not bad for on the road.  </li>
            <li>In my past units (I&#x27;ve owned two others before this one, one of which was also a Revlon product, in fact), that switch was super easy to get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Low, High, and cool.  </li>
            <li>It comes with two interchangeable heads and has three speeds; high, low, cool.   </li>
            <li>Perfect for those who can&#x27;t seem to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other.</li>
            <li>This week she commented on how much healthier my hair seemed after using the new dryer just two months.</li>
            <li>My point is, Revlon does not sell the parts separately, so if that is one is messed up or lost, you have to purchase a whole new kit.  </li>
            <li>More body, less mousse and root lifter.  </li>
            <li>When ordering this one it looked like it was made better, but on arrival, I could see that the bristles on this were just as thin and cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>I want to buy the older version.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s still a good product but for people who have thin straight hair that just want to add some volume.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and it&#x27;s a lot easier than drying and using a standard brush at the same time.  </li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better would be the choice of a fatter brush instead of a smaller one.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, course hair and this tool smooths out my hair and makes getting ready much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Cord swivels as you turn the main part.  </li>
            <li>Low is still pretty hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several hot air brushes over the years, but this is the first I couldn&#x27;t use at all.</li>
            <li>Even though I was on 2nd day hair (shampooed the day before with no intention of a shampoo that morning before an early conference), I tried it out to smooth out some indentations in my straightened</li>
            <li>Even on low heat the barrel gets pretty hot, so I haven&#x27;t needed to use the high heat setting.  </li>
            <li>Well, not only does it vent very hot air, it blows the surrounding hair in all directions, undoing what you just did.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality dryer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This one did not get high ratings</li>
            <li>The heat is way too high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and am about to buy another to keep on hand in case</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>I had a previous version of this item (same brand, same style)that worked great for years.  </li>
            <li>This definitely take a little longer to dry your whole head, but it looks WAY better and has MUCH more volume.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it takes a long time to blow dry with a round brush, and it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it when the results aren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li>Well, that plus a little hairspray :-)  </li>
            <li>appliance also gets extremely hot and the &#x27;cool touch tip&#x27; is not long enough to protect your fingers when you try to hold it.  </li>
            <li>I had to keep telling them it wasn&#x27;t a new haircut but a new hair dryer!</li>
            <li>It is VERY LOUD and VERY HOT even on the low setting.  </li>
            <li>And my hair is not thick or curly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair free of static electricity, but that&#x27;s to be expected in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li>It does not pull my hair out, it gets my natural hair straight from the roots in seconds.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and has so much volume after using it I don&#x27;t need to do another thing to it.  </li>
            <li>Great product design, lousy innards.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t normally have.  </li>
            <li>But I love the way it dries my hair--soooo much easier than the gun-type dryer used with a round brush-what a pain!</li>
            <li>A few more notes about Amazon&#x27;s description of this product:    1.</li>
            <li>but i am sure it will not last a long time.   </li>
            <li>so I wanted to find a way to easily round brush my hair because I love the way it looks</li>
            <li>It dose the job, and takes like 10-15 minutes, where with a normal blow-dryer</li>
            <li>When I placed the order in April, I ordered two, and one has a short and will not run on fast fan, hot heat.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done my full hair with it but wanted to test out the frequent complaints I saw such as weight and noise.</li>
            <li>Saves me so much time and because the barrel is metal, it&#x27;s hot enough to style it like a curling iron does.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a dryer unless you didn&#x27;t have a normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I read that a hair dryer could leave hair more shiny, but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>It is great if you have a thick, wavy or frizzy hairstyle and works well if let your hair air dry and want to style it and skip the hair drying process.</li>
            <li>It lends limp air a lot of body, since you can hold the curler part very close to your scalp and lift the hair easily.</li>
            <li>The button is alittle more stiff on the new one</li>
            <li>I have not-too-thick VERY curly hair, and this hot brush (I only use the largest attachment, and just throw away the smaller and the blow dryer) gets my hair from soaking wet and frizzy to dry, sleek, and gorgeous in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible that I received a defective unit, but I also was displeased with the large amount of exposed metal, making it much easier to burn yourself while using it.</li>
            <li>This brush dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used and also makes my frizzy/unruly/curly hair completely smooth.  </li>
            <li>My only problem with hot air brush was that the high heat setting wouldn&#x27;t work for two months.</li>
            <li>My first and last time to use it, I had done a section of hair on HIGH for about three seconds</li>
            <li>The attachments got so hot when I used the heat settings (low or high, it didn&#x27;t matter) that I could not remove them to switch out (from dryer head to brush) without a washcloth or something.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s off to Walgreens or Kmart or another drugstore to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I CAN&#x27;T live without this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li>The new model has an opening on both the brushes where they connect to the handle.  </li>
            <li>My stylist recommended this to me when I got a new hair style.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new one cause in brasil</li>
            <li>I just got a new hairstyle...</li>
            <li>Time to try a new brand.</li>
            <li>me a new one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>But then I just got Her a new one.</li>
            <li>Like any new hair appliance, it took some practice/experimenting to style my hair the way I wanted it.  </li>
            <li>I buy 2 at a time, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Plus the new is a dryer also, so</li>
            <li>It takes longer for me to dry my hair with this new one, but the added 5 minutes is worth it for not having to spend $200 a year buying new blow dryers!</li>
            <li>Luckily I can use the dryer with an unattached styling brush to dry the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I just have to adjust to low heat, which will take a much longer time to style my hair, which I&#x27;m not liking very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it on my dry hair to give it a quick flip either under or up</li>
            <li>I put a ton of super glue on it and am waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li>Just a quick dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too expensive, and does a good job of drying my hair fast while still giving me volume.  </li>
            <li>It is the best hair dryer ever for thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li>It is very loud though.</li>
            <li>With this tool, it takes less than 10 minutes to fully dry my hair (which goes well past my shoulders), and turns out perfectly every time.</li>
            <li>The plastic brush bristles are too soft to hold my thin, fine hair securely</li>
            <li>The first day I used this brand new dryer, it overheated after 5 minutes and never turned back on.  </li>
            <li>It allows so many different hair styles to be accomplished with little practice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can dry my hair pretty fast - about 20 minutes from start to finish.</li>
            <li>and I get my hair dried pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Small enough and easy to handle, I like it very much!</li>
            <li>It is such a good dryer for my hair to dry and style at the same time, but they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I had to return it and purchased a different brand and style of hot air curler.</li>
            <li>First of all it is totally unwieldly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a hassle to send it back, and now I&#x27;m out of a hot air dryer until I get a replacement.</li>
            <li>I used this on the low setting and still it became so hot</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target after seeing my sister using a similar type of hot air brush.</li>
            <li>K Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue]]</li>
            <li>All of my issues could be due to a defective unit or perhaps this item is better suited to a different type of hair.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I am not particularly talented when it comes to doing my own hair.</li>
            <li>wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li>and I was so surprised when I got home from work on February 9th to find the product already on my door step!  </li>
            <li>I simply rolled each chunk up on the barrel and hit it with the hot air.  </li>
            <li>This causes alot of the hot air to escape there and not make it to the actual barrel part.  </li>
            <li>the low button between the hot and medium and</li>
            <li>This is the third brand of hot air brush I have bought.  </li>
            <li>Then I section off my hair with the bottom part of hair left out as the first section.  </li>
            <li>While it does get hot, I have found that it does not get any hotter than my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue</li>
            <li>i gave mine which i had for over a year the same exactly one</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be ok for a baby&#x27;s head or perhaps a small animal</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Not only is the volume lower, but there is still plenty of hot air</li>
            <li>The first one lasted 2 years and finally overheated and died.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the money, even if it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>have used Conair instant heat hot brush for past 7 years and it is a better buy than this</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and could not find in my local stores.  </li>
            <li>I went with the Revlon one because of the higher wattage and bigger brush size.   </li>
            <li>I use it on the low heat setting and it gets plenty hot to style my stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time I purchased this hot air dryer &amp; styler.  </li>
            <li>I went to my local beauty supply store and bought a Helen of Troy hot air brush with a 1 1/2 \\&quot; barrel</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, and it only takes minutes to dry my relatively short hair.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to straighten your hair and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li>Then the past couple years they deteriorated more quickly, from brushes slipping off to just burning out.</li>
            <li>Even though air comes out faster on the high speed than on the low speed, it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair as well as a real hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>and I guess the ion styling dried it very quickly and the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li>Even on low, this item got far too hot and fried my hair.</li>
            <li>I have thin, curly, frizzy hair and this is the only straightener I&#x27;ve used successfully, for about 10 years now.</li>
            <li>after I was done with the initial styling, I turned the brush off, waited about a minute, then turned it on to the \\&quot;cool setting\\&quot; and lightly brushed my hair with it.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li>This one works fine, but you can tell they&#x27;ve changed the quality a little.  </li>
            <li>Now that is worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li>Not as powerful as other older models of this brush I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work for me, but it simply does not produce enough hot air.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy and cumbersome to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Use to fully dry and style or just to touch up, smooth and add extra body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry my pretty thick hair, and does such a good job that I don&#x27;t need to re-do my hair the following day -</li>
            <li>I have a new hairstyle that requires a better bend than I get from my Braun, which is why I thought I would try a Dryer/Styler Brush instead, but it just is a lot more work and the results are bad.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s as much as a blow dryer because that&#x27;s how much you need to dry your hair!</li>
            <li>Mine is fine and board straight, hers is thick and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I get more voulme using the traditional brush/dryer method, but this is a little easier to get the job</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that it does tend to get a little hot to handle on the high setting, but it&#x27;s worth it to me because it dries my hair so fast, while styling it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I received it 2 days earlier than expected, which was great because I was having many bad hair days</li>
            <li>I bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it, I was not, It snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude.</li>
            <li>On closer look it almost appears some of the plastic had been melting so clearly this was defective from the start.</li>
            <li>The whole point of these things is to take out the extra step and make it all happen in one.</li>
            <li>The brush frequently falls off because it doesn&#x27;t connect well, and burns your fingers when you try to catch it.  </li>
            <li>It was, by far, the loudest blow dryer I have ever heard.  </li>
            <li>As with all electronic/electrical devices it is getting old</li>
            <li>My hair was completely jacked up until I got it in the mail</li>
            <li>I got this to replace an old unit I had for 10 years.  </li>
            <li>My hair turns out soft and styled</li>
            <li>This product works really well, because you don&#x27;t have to hold a brush and hair dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li>It has a much shorter handle and simply grabs the hair to turn it under.</li>
            <li>I think there was just way too much air power, as it only blew my hair around as I was trying to use the brush.</li>
            <li>As far as the product.  </li>
            <li>I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for young kids/teens because like I said, you can easly burn yourself by toughting the brush.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for my wife who likes it so far.</li>
            <li>Finally it is loud, loud like a leaf blower.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a lot of air pressure blowing out of it for my tastes and the bristles are to soft to grip my hair and pull it taunt.  </li>
            <li>It really have the same effect as if I just when to the salon!</li>
            <li>however the result is that while you are trying to roll your hair, there is a lot of air being blown directly on the hair you are trying to roll.  </li>
            <li>Purchased in March 2015, as of Aug 18, 2015, the electrical box that plugs into the wall completely fell apart with pieces falling out everywhere.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s old Hair Dryer died one day and I hear her say, Honey &amp;#34;Buy</li>
            <li>My old one broke</li>
            <li>Two weeks after the return window expired, it stopped putting out heat completely.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is loud as some reviewers suggested, but I wouldn&#x27;t say itsear piercing and compared to my old dryer, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and I am 50.</li>
            <li>I try to leave it on \\&quot;low\\&quot; because the \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;cool\\&quot; settings are quite loud, which is why I&#x27;ve rated it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same feeling with this brush, but much easier to manage, and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I returned it and went with this one (which is much simular to the one I had years back.</li>
            <li>I agree that on the highest setting the dryer is way too loud and you cannot move the switch with one finger.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty long, just below my chest.</li>
            <li>It also gave a soft bevel to the ends.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s working well for me so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough for the toughest hair but with different heat settings it can be gentle enough for the most delicate baby hair.</li>
            <li>What a shame to put such a POORLY DESIGNED BUTTON on an otherwise good styler.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brushes didn&#x27;t want to grip my hair, but that&#x27;s probably because I have really thick hair that needs more than soft bristles to grab hold of it.  </li>
            <li>Might work okay with thick longer hair where you don&#x27;t wind it up to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better.</li>
            <li>Would have loved this product if it hadn&#x27;t broken the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Good but with thin hair you definitely need to use a water bottle to dampen your hair before using it...if not curls won&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li>After using the new red model on high the plastic melted.</li>
            <li>let it sit for 5 seconds, then turn the brush on cool for 5-10 seconds and run the brush down to the ends turning under as I do so.  </li>
            <li>Blow in it to cool it down?  </li>
            <li>This was the second time I purchased this hot air dryer &amp; styler (the first one broke through my carelessness, and was in no way due to a manufacturing defect).</li>
            <li>I use it more as a finisher after I have round brushed my head normally with blow dryer and brush to help smooth out the waves that I was unable to smooth out in the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>As they are generally inexpensive, I&#x27;ve made it a habit to keep a new one in reserve.</li>
            <li>The first 2 that I owned,  each lasted more than a couple of years; almost daily use on coarse, long (past below bra strap), not so straight hair.</li>
            <li>I also love that it takes about half the time to dry now.</li>
            <li>Also, the handle can feel a bit loose from the hot wand part.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hairdryer to replace the exact same model that had just worn out after several years of use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product 5/24/10 to replace the older model which died only 6 months after I bought it.  </li>
            <li>While I have purchased several hot air dryers from Revlon over the years, the one I received didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li>I just purchased a second one for my mother who has the exact opposite of my hair...</li>
            <li>I bought another brand first from my local drug store and took it back after one use.</li>
            <li>I recently got my hair cut - it is a pretty short bob - just below my chin.</li>
            <li>Only giving it 4 stars because first time I ordered it the wiring was faulty and it would turn off at different times.</li>
            <li>Takes a little more time to dry my hair</li>
            <li>In all fairness, the unusable button and too-high heat on HIGH were the only problems I had.</li>
            <li>I bought this at Target after seeing such high stars for this product.    </li>
            <li>and my hair was starting to show no style and frizz, but simply drying my hair with this hair dryer/styler, resulted in great body and no more frizz!!!</li>
            <li>This one gives you the option of small curls or a smooth look.</li>
            <li>I have long very wavy hair</li>
            <li>I quickly dry my hair that style it with the large attachment......</li>
            <li>Keep them brushed out with an old toothbrush or vacuum brush and your styling brush should have a much longer life span.  </li>
            <li>Use the low with the large brush for styling, volumizing, larger curls or waves or for straightening.  </li>
            <li>did not get as much curl, wave or flip as my hairdresser does using a separate hair dryer and a large round brush.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and this dryer gives me body and fullness.</li>
            <li>i think anyone who is good with hair or has at least shoulder length hair might find it a little easier.    </li>
            <li>So useful for me because it gives me the opportunity to blow dry my hear with style, not just being flat.</li>
            <li>My hair is short curly and the latest products blow so hard</li>
            <li>Although it is being replaced , hope new one will last awhile .</li>
            <li>I have had mine for about 7 years and it still works like brand new with almost daily use.</li>
            <li>I find the round tube type brush attachment perfect for my hair as I am awkward with a blow dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li>Now I use this tool to blow dry my hair and the results are so much</li>
            <li>My stylist was really concerned by how dry my hair had become.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this Revlon hair dryer, I can blow dry my hair again.  </li>
            <li>so it takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry the whole thing</li>
            <li>In addition, you can dry your hair straight or style and curl it while drying.</li>
            <li>This has the heat and power to really get your hair dry with lastings curls (or straightening).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>so I think it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as I would like .....</li>
            <li>And  you can dry your hair straight or style and curl it while drying.  </li>
            <li>At least this has a one-year warranty, but I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to get them to honor it.  </li>
            <li>For a few seconds I could see the potential for fat, smooth waves.      </li>
            <li>It makes drain my thick curly hair easy and manageable</li>
            <li>love this, have used daily since I got it and have thick, curly hair and</li>
            <li>Dry first with a regular dryer for speed, then finish with this.</li>
            <li>I blow dry the roots of my hair first with a regular hair dryer and then finish the rest of my hair with the Revlon tool.</li>
            <li>My hair is super straight and pretty thick and very very flat, it&#x27;s hard for me to get any sort of volume to it - and this hot air brush fully did the trick.</li>
            <li>I wore my hair natural to work the other day and people wanted to know how I get it so straight</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this, so you don&#x27;t have to hold a blow dryer in one hand, and a round brush in the other.</li>
            <li>Not as strong so you can&#x27;t blow and pull hair hard enough to make it dry and straight.</li>
            <li>Not very warm,takes quite a long time to get a strong curl on even dry hair.</li>
            <li>It only has a high and low setting.</li>
            <li>I have long  curly hair and  before using it I used a regular blow drier until it was about 80 to 90% dry because otherwise the &amp;#34;hot  air&amp;#34; is so cool that  I felt it would never dry my hair or would take forever.</li>
            <li>Its difficult to keep switching from low HOT to the high blow cool setting</li>
            <li>It would be easier to grow an extra arm and be able to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, and use the new hand to separate the sections.</li>
            <li>I am a girl who generally does not do a lot with my hair.  </li>
            <li>They generally lasted 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it was so loud I had to wear ear plugs while I was using it.  </li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t like was that this was extremely loud, even at the low setting.</li>
            <li>I use handfuls of leave-in conditioner, curl cream, curl gel, &amp;  even coconut oil, barely making a difference.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still easier to use than a regular dryer and brush (two handed styling) which requires turning off the dryer frequently in order to re-position the brush correctly.</li>
            <li>and I do not know if it would be accepted, but barely usable.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a second time after my old one wore out after about 10 years.</li>
            <li>I make soft, shiny waves with the larger barrel brush, which I prefer for myself.  </li>
            <li>but I went with it because it is the same brand as my old one.  </li>
            <li>When complete my hair is left shiny and has some body and curl.</li>
            <li>I really thought the brushes were harder, that was a dissapointment, but in all it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>When I tried to use fingers/palm hold to my hair in place over the bristles so I could wrap it around the barrel, after a minute of running, even on low, the barrel became too handle or even bring near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product was so loud that I resorted to wearing earplugs for the first few times</li>
            <li>It is the most frustratingly packaged product you will ever find.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps its only because I have thick African textured hair, it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair enough to get a straight blow dry, perhaps better suited to Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>and it still works, but I recently bought a new one at a local store for around the same price the old one was.</li>
            <li>Use the High with the focus attachment to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and did a terrific job of drying my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it works much the same as the old model.</li>
            <li>Recently, my dryer had been over heating and taking too long to cool down (keeping in mind that it&#x27;s almost ten years old).  </li>
            <li>Use a blow dryer (or air dry your hair) to about 75% dry, then switch to the hot air brush to style.  </li>
            <li>Styling products tend to build up on the metal part, and it is kinda hard to clean since I don&#x27;t think you can immerse it.</li>
            <li>A hot mess.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be flat and lifeless, and now feels soft and moisturized...</li>
            <li>I use this product almost daily on my hair (long and thick hair) absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, long, course hair and the original model would dry my hair in 45 minutes, smooth enough that I did not need a flat iron.</li>
            <li>and it does work great, however this one came with problems and it is the worse thing i bought lately.</li>
            <li>The old version had a bigger ridge, that actually slid with one finger.  </li>
            <li>Since you have to hold it closer to your head than a regular hair dryer and especially when you are holding it near the ear....</li>
            <li>It is much easier to use than a round brush and dryer separately like the professional stylists do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get out of the shower one day (inevitably a day when I really desperately need my hair to look good) and</li>
            <li>It is frustrating when I am in a hurry as I constantly have to revue the setting to make sure they are where they have to be for optimal use.</li>
            <li>Wow, can you make the switch any more difficult to move?  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not completely dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen the older generation with their pink sleep-in curlers and blue-rod perms.  </li>
            <li>Gets a little to hot for my liking.</li>
            <li>It gets louder on the cool and high setting but blows about equally as hard as it does in the low setting which was disappointing, but over all its a great purchase and makes round brushing a lot easier.</li>
            <li>My hair is of medium thickness and slightly wavy -- normally very easy to work with -- but the bristles go flat when I try to grab even a small section of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer gets too hot when drying with the barrels and there is not a quick release for you hair, only for changing the attachment.  </li>
            <li>is that the motor is quite noisy; you have to use it closed doors or without anyone in the house; I wonder if the manufacturer could add a better motor or less noisy; I have not seen any other styling tools like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would take forever to dry as I use a much more powerful regular blowdryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just possible to slide it from OFF to HIGH, but not HIGH to OFF, or any setting in between.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good luck with these in accomplishing silky smooth hair with just enough volume, but this one was terrible.</li>
            <li>It takes so much longer to dry your hair with this thing than it does to blow dry it with the Revlon Ion Dryer and then straighten your hair with a straightner.  </li>
            <li>So much easier than using both hands- one for hair dryer &amp; the other for a brush!</li>
            <li>The former one didn&#x27;t last as long as the others and this new one has designed those openings to keep it from overheating.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I will agree with is that the switch could be a little better, but as long as you even have the teeniest bit of a nail you can switch it up and down with no problems.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands, sizes and versions of this product when I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one.  </li>
            <li>It still blows cool air, but it would take about 20 minutes to do the other half of my head that isn&#x27;t styled yet.  </li>
            <li>At first I had to stop and put it down to change the heat setting, but after a few pushes back and forth, it doesn&#x27;t require quite as much thumb</li>
            <li>The new model has a switch that is much harder to turn off and on with just one hand.  </li>
            <li>I see a clear difference in my hair, it feels softer and shines after a blow dry.</li>
            <li>I generally like this, but I recommend getting the more expensive model as this one has metal which burns your skin if you touch it while styling your hair.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it as much as the previous two, because I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair shorter.</li>
            <li>I used to spend 30-45 minutes drying with a blow-dryer and round brush; setting it in hot rollers and then styling - total time took about an 1 1/2 - 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Probably not enough power for someone with thick full hair</li>
            <li>you have thick, curly, frizzy, stubborn, resistant or even soft fine delicate hair, I highly recommend this styler.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, down to my shoulder blades, and it&#x27;s pretty curly.  </li>
            <li>It looks like you had your hair done professionally every single day.  </li>
            <li>No flat iron straightener has ever worked as well for me.   </li>
            <li>Seems to overheat much faster than previous ones I&#x27;ve owned (same model).</li>
            <li>after shampooing, I use a leave in Garnier product for smoothing split ends, then I blow dry with a regular vented brush (not a round brush) until my hair is just damp.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on both brush attachments are way too short and flimsy, making it almost impossible to get a good grip on your hair as you are styling it.  </li>
            <li>This was not the answer for me my hair is very thin and very fine</li>
            <li>I was able to dry my very thick, curly, frizzy hair on the low setting!</li>
            <li>I simply throw some mouse in it and let it partially air dry while getting ready in the mornings and then use the 1.5 in.</li>
            <li>I wear a glove on the opposite hand as the tip of the brush is not long enough to grip.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair which I blow mostly dry, then use the larger brush to smooth out my hair and curl it.  </li>
            <li>It absolutly will not curl my baby fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>I am told it will grab my baby fine, thin hair.     </li>
            <li>I have rather thin, baby fine, chin length hair and zero stying skill.</li>
            <li>My hair is super thick, and I ONLY use the low setting.  </li>
            <li>I finally ditched that one and was hesitant to by another one but couldn&#x27;t find any others with the round brush that had at least 1000 watts so it could actually dry your hair instead of just blowing warm</li>
            <li>Once I got the hang of using it (there was a little bit of a learning curve), it was much faster than the dryer.  </li>
            <li>My hair is white and given to frizziness and out of control curl, but it is thin and baby fine.  </li>
            <li>Before you had it on high to curl and then one setting down</li>
            <li>For now, I&#x27;ll keep buying it as the good outweighs the bad....</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s nice and close for me to pop over and pick it up at the postal stn!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to master the art of using a curling iron, so this tool is the best for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how pleased I am with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Thats what I find works best :)</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> A Great styling product and a really good price.</li>
            <li> So thrilled to see it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many of these &amp; felt Revlon offered the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And then, sharing a hotel room with my co-writer, I noticed something astounding!  </li>
            <li> Sure would love to have the 1200 watts with no ions!!!   </li>
            <li> It is a perfect shape and size and easy to control.</li>
            <li> This wonderful product is easy to use and give me the body I want.</li>
            <li> It is very suitable for my hair curly but in my electricity will become 220-250 volts instead of 110 volts could not be used</li>
            <li> The one I have now screams louder than any hair dryer you&#x27;ve ever heard, and after about three minutes you can see a bright flare-up inside the unit and the heating element is done for the day.  </li>
            <li> and I also purchased one for my daughter who loved mine and is so happy to have her own.  </li>
            <li> Good air flow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely delighted and</li>
            <li> it clicks, you are good to go again.</li>
            <li> Looked like a good buy, but wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> If you order it, then GOOD LUCK getting into the package.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace one that I have used and loved for years.  </li>
            <li> Loved it...recommended it to all my girlfriends.  </li>
            <li> Would have loved to have kept this item.  </li>
            <li> She used mine while visiting and loved it as well.  </li>
            <li> I think 5-7 years is a good life</li>
            <li> As good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair looked but the one I bought in August has quit working.  </li>
            <li> This one works as good but they changed buttons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as effective and creates frizzy fly aways</li>
            <li> NONE of them are this good.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> This one is a good value in my book.</li>
            <li> Its good to see the shape</li>
            <li> using it saves lots of time and gives good results.</li>
            <li> So what does a good husband say???</li>
            <li> good.</li>
            <li> It was good just not for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Good price.</li>
            <li> Good heat and wattage</li>
            <li> A really good hair setting tool.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, it is exactly what I needed !!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use for great results.</li>

            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> My job requires me to wear a headset for most of the day -- even this can&#x27;t flatten my hair!  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I love this product for what it does for my hair WHEN IT WORKS!  </li>

            <li> This is my favorite!  </li>
            <li> The Revlon hot air dryer and styler is the best invention.  </li>
            <li> LOVE!  </li>
            <li> My curls aren&#x27;t as perfect as if I use a curling iron, but I still look pretty fab if I do say so myself.  </li>
            <li> By switching to the come like tools, you could style your hair more effectively!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this curling iron/blowdryer!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> but you better have a back-up dryer on hand for when this one dies halfway through the drying process!</li>
            <li> I love this tool!</li>
            <li> Great for blow outs and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have fine, shorter hair, and the bristles on the brushes of this product hold my hair and create great curls.  </li>
            <li> This is a great tool to help smooth and straighter hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this styler; although doesn&#x27;t give very smooth and freeze free results it is a nice tool to get great volume and very nice and defined</li>
            <li> Now I spend 15-20 minutes and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Styles my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest dryer and styler!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lookes nice and works for a while, but it ended up in the trash within 8 mths of use.</li>
            <li> I have to say my hair comes out really nice with this.  </li>
            <li> That should be against some kind of consumer protection law.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to girls who don&#x27;t have the skills yet have the heart to style their own hair like me.</li>
            <li> My hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice cord which comes out the end and turns as you work which prevents tangling of the cord.</li>
            <li> I really liked the volume it gave me.  </li>
            <li> THINK ANYONE WANTING A GOOD MULTI-PURPOSE STYLER WILL LOVE THIS BRUSH.......</li>
            <li> so she can do her own hair</li>
            <li> Nice item but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, just a woman that knows how to do her own hair</li>
            <li> + it gives volume and nice curls.</li>
            <li> you can create a nice bend or wave)</li>
            <li> Seller is excellent, fast shipping but product itself is not meeting my expectations.</li>
            <li> one of the best hot air kit on the market, my wife love it.</li>
            <li> the cool setting is great</li>
            <li> I just got a new shorter haircut and this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to handle and it blows alot of air for good drying.</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY EASY TO HANDLE.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to get curls and waves that stay.</li>
            <li> it is very easy to use and reliable........</li>
            <li> Pretty darned good for someone who is as uncoordinated as me!</li>
            <li> Awesome for getting a near salon blow out!</li>
            <li> I do not have any hair volume, this gave me a healthy amount of volume, I love it!</li>
            <li> But, no fear, Amazon is the BEST as far as returns go!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a hot air brush!!!!</li>

            <li> but with this dryer you can get a near perfect blow out.</li>
            <li> have very fine shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair which does not hold style well</li>

            <li> This type of brush works best for me to have smooth straight hair.</li>
            <li> This is a welcome return of the first  handheld dryers which had a clip on attached brush (Claudio, I think.</li>
            <li> The Hot air dryer and styler is great.  </li>
            <li> This dryer worked great but was just too hot.</li>
            <li> This hot air dryer is a great deal....</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Its very light weight so my arm doesnt feel like its falling off after 10 mins.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job on your hair, and is easy to travel with.</li>

            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I really love this styler.</li>
            <li> Much better than a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Well, I opened it today and it worked ok.  </li>
            <li> She has had it for many years and loves the way it works with the attachments.</li>
            <li> Since she is pleased then so am I. \\&quot;If</li>
            <li> Love It.</li>
            <li> SO glad I was able to find one here on Amazon</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most helpful to section off your hair when you use this.</li>
            <li> I love this item....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the medium that I used the most.  </li>
            <li> I could not find it in my local stores, so was so happy to see it on Amazon, at a good price.  </li>
            <li> better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been coordinated enough for the two handed brush-blower method, so this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so healthy</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This nifty gizmo sure does speed up drying and styling and getting out in the morning.</li>
            <li> For more volume I still use my hair blower and a brush, but I&#x27;d recommend this product for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on their hair.    </li>
            <li> Wish it hadn&#x27;t come with the kit, I might have saved even more money... :-)  </li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite hair dryer</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I love the High/Cool setting that allows me to style at will with out burning/</li>
            <li> but  i love it for dog grooming</li>
            <li> Satisfied</li>
            <li> The blowdryer part is ok, but didn&#x27;t like the brushes at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used it more without the brushes on it to get the wetness out of my hair at the roots.  </li>
            <li> Others may be more coordinated and be able to get better hair styling using this brush dryer.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be more of a blower than a styler.  </li>
            <li> If you use it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting often then it will probably burn out real quick.</li>
            <li> The blow-dryer attachment is designed perfectly so there is no awkwardness trying to figure out how to hold it like a traditional L shaped blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> I love what it does</li>
            <li> so I decided to try one more time</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) However, I am exceptionally pleased with this product as it gives me the closest fininsh to having my hair done by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Only reason for the \\&quot;4\\&quot; it is very loud!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> The first day I used it people were like \\&quot;You&#x27;re hair is so nice today!</li>
            <li> I have not used Revlon&#x27;s ceramic version yet, so I cannot attest to whether this is better than that one or not.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li> I would LOVE to have an ORIGNAL REVLON IONIC.    </li>
            <li> I had a Conair one for years and it much better made.</li>
            <li> works perfectly for my short hair style.</li>
            <li> Image most people having hair like spaghetti.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this adds body and style to my hair.  </li>
            <li> have receive many compliments since I began using it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> , I love this hotbrush</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush dryer because I needed to be able to do one handed grooming do to upcoming surgery.  </li>
            <li> all in all, I love it, but it is not for everyone</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> I Love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> I was able to style with just this tool today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At the end I stuck the barrel under the top chunks (so they just draped over the barrel,)</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> IT recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li> It is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love this for styling my hair</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> The two different sized brushes are also great!</li>
            <li> i love this product cuz it is combination of hair dryer and styler.</li>
            <li> this product do it well and makes more volume that i need.great.</li>
            <li> It creates the sleek/soft salon look we love :)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love it</li>
            <li> Love it makes me look like I&#x27;ve had a pro blow out</li>
            <li> I love this item.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand and type blower for close to ten years, the best one I have found.  </li>
            <li> or you want to set it better.  </li>
            <li> and I love that feature.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I also loved the powerful wattage.</li>
            <li> The more I use this product the better</li>
            <li> Plus the bristles are great--they hold hair better than Conair rubber type bristle.  </li>
            <li> It straightens my hair but still gives it more volume than when I use a flatiron to straighten it.</li>
            <li> so I miss more than I can curl.  </li>
            <li> switch just would not shut off most of the time.</li>
            <li> Love how it dries, curls, and gives my hair volume with just ONE tool.</li>
            <li> I used to have to blow it out and then curl it to make sure I didn&#x27;t look like a troll doll.  </li>
            <li> it would be nice if they could reduce the sound.</li>
            <li> but this product gives more interest to try it out.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of these blow dryers but this one Is my favorite..  </li>
            <li> it falls apart before even me touching it</li>
            <li> The curling while drying eliminates the curling iron out of my morning routine and that sure saves a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I found this item and wasn&#x27;t sure about it -</li>
            <li> etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;She has had so many comments about how lovely her hair looks.</li>
            <li> Quality product, great price and fast delivery...</li>
            <li> Compact stylish...</li>
            <li> Avoid this product - it cannot be used for more than 3 minutes without overheating.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews saying that theirs was over-heating</li>
            <li> I watched the reviews on YouTube and glad I invested in this affordable product.</li>
            <li> While I love it here at home......</li>
            <li> I was hopping to be able to do my hair with the air brush with one hand.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love this item</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This dryer saves a lot of time (it still takes me 25-30 minutes, but I have a lot of hair), and I love that it does two steps in one.  </li>
            <li> My all-time favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is a brush and dryer in one.</li>
            <li> Love this styler.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Revlon styling tools like this one before and love them.  </li>
            <li> This was the best product I could find closest to what I had prior.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and smooth and no frizz.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really glad I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> Overall,I&#x27;m pleased with the brush/dryer.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand has been the Conair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lightweight and the extra attachments give you some options, excellent price.</li>
            <li> &quot; One more thing</li>
            <li> I use it most every day now.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn her hair and gets it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> i love this styler.</li>
            <li> I found this brand has the best blower and the option of a quick switch to cool if it gets too hot</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look super healthy and shiny!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fast and easy, and my hair alwasys had a great shine.  </li>
            <li> This dryer/styler is very light weight and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The long bristles hold my hair against the aluminum barrel perfectly while drying.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air brush as an alternative / spare to my much beloved VS model.  </li>
            <li> I saw that the John Frieda hot air brush had good reviews</li>
            <li> So this one is the best, but it is nothing to compare with, working just fine for last 4 month.</li>
            <li> Handled brush (which has a great grip and adds ions to my hair) and hope that the new Helen of Troy will work for me.    </li>
            <li> Works best on hair that is already 80% dry.</li>
            <li> this had been a hair saver for me - quick, efficient and effective...    </li>
            <li> I have tried many hair dryers, but this is so easy to use and dries my hair in the shortest time.  </li>
            <li> best product on the market to actually dry your hair while you style it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, it doesn&#x27;t require much coordination (great for the mornings...yawn!)</li>
            <li> : the air is very hot even at lowest position, attachment is not that handy.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer for people who are short on time and need a great style FAST!</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get good with this new hair dryer/curling iron, but with more use I am getting better....</li>
            <li> Now, before you think that there must be a problem with my hands and that must be th reason I had so many problems with it, my hands are fine.  </li>
            <li> For someone like me who isn&#x27;t a very good stylist, this dryer with a brush makes an enormous difference!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased using hot air brushes for perhaps 15 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of styling techniques and products, and nothing really looks that good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful, gives my hair more volume, everybody thinks my hair is thicker then</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other barrel-type hair dryers and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I just received this Revlon hot air brush and I love it!</li>
            <li> This hot air kit is even more functional than a hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I have had my original one for 5 or more years</li>
            <li> I hope the new one I get works as good but more importantly</li>
            <li> It gives me the look I like &amp; is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t be used on the highest level because it overheats easily.</li>
            <li> This makes it really easy to style my hair and get that blow out look after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> My ordered arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> Now, it can break easily if you drop it or bang it around</li>
            <li> Dries and styles in one easy step.</li>
            <li> and it was so easy.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find it on Amazon.com after not being able to find it at my local retailer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Things I like about it:  Easy to attach and unattach the attachments.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to use - if you can use a curling iron, you can use this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to do too.  </li>
            <li> I found myself covering that part as I was styling my hair, but it can also be easily avoided too.  </li>
            <li> I can style my hair very quickly and easily</li>
            <li> had plastic tips that were longer, could be removed, and had a grooved texture and narrower width -- they were easy to grasp and easy to distinguish from the barrel without looking.  </li>
            <li> The attachments are easy to change.</li>
            <li> Had older version and loved it.  </li>
            <li> But overall for the price it is good to have handy and it has three heads.</li>
            <li> For years I used a hair dryer with a brush and on special occasions, when I wanted more fullness and style, I used a Braun, Butane Gas Curling Brush that is no longer made.    </li>
            <li> Made a great general hair dryer though.</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush, I really liked it.</li>
            <li> First off the pros for this appliance: Smooths the hair nicely as it dries, also if you hold it in one spot</li>
            <li> The Revlon Ionic Dryer and Styler is the best product that I&#x27;ve found to quickly and easily dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it has been working fine ever since.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hold the styler still for long--keep wrapping and rewrapping and pulling thru, and it&#x27;ll work fine.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and somewhat wavy, the brushes hold the hair well, unlike curling irons where the hair slips off of the rod.</li>
            <li> would buy again light weight easy on the hands and fingers it</li>
            <li> I have fine, frizzy hair that is slightly wavy, and have used these type of stylers to eliminate the frizz and perfectly straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair and this brush gave me the frizzes&#x27;.</li>
            <li> PART IS SO LIGHT AND EASY TO USE.</li>
            <li> Fine for super-fast touch ups, but that&#x27;s about it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t touched the reset button since then and the dryer has worked fine.</li>
            <li> Wish that it didn&#x27;t get quite so hot but overall great value!!</li>
            <li> Because of the brush you are able to get better control and focus on the hot air flow.</li>
            <li> Great for refreshing hairdo on days when I don&#x27;t wash and dry.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gadget that I own and that&#x27;s okay because it has the function of two!</li>
            <li> I really love this hot air brush!  </li>
            <li> From the Mrs. here--This little hair tool is great!  </li>
            <li> Very good product and working as expected.  </li>
            <li> This has made a huge difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> huge hastle.  </li>
            <li> Even though they both have 500 watts for some reason the difference was huge.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these recently and have not been at all happy with it.  </li>
            <li> and then I use this to smooth and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smooth, sleek and shiny without having to add any smoothing products.</li>
            <li> This leaves a hand free.</li>
            <li> I just use coconut oil to smooth the fly-aways after I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the longevity of this product, if it lasts even six months of daily use I could consider it a great achievement.</li>
            <li> and it smoothed it out nicely without it being to straight.  </li>
            <li> hit is with hot, then hit it with cool, and the end result was a lot more volume on top.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I ordered this because it was so cheap,</li>
            <li> Adds fullness and light curl to the ends.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair always looking nice without much effort.</li>
            <li> The ion light stays on but just stops drying and rotating.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, I have bought 5 (gifts) and everyone loves it.</li>
            <li> I received the RV-7497 which does not have an ION on/off switch with light.  </li>
            <li> Happy it was only $20, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer will come out with some larger barrel attachments - 2\\&quot; would be great.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the bulky Spin Brush, its shaped well to fit your hand.  </li>
            <li> One of them had a tendency to shut itself off, meaning it was overheating, so I tossed it, but the others have been fantastic.</li>
            <li> The 1200 watts is great for gettng hair &amp;#34;damp dry&amp;#34;, then pop on the proper brush size and style away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years, it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I just light mist</li>
            <li> I smooth through the style with my fingers and use a mist of hairspray-</li>
            <li> I had read it makes your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and can also curl if that is what you like.</li>
            <li> I hope this product stays available.</li>
            <li> The Cons: It heats up way too fast, honestly I was worried it would overheat and damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I can get much better drying results with my regular hair dryer and a good brush.    </li>
            <li> I loved the first one, so when I dropped and broke the first one I had to get another.   </li>
            <li> Okay, I never leave reviews, but I love this thing so much..</li>
            <li> So far so good, hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> Maybe good for someone who is extremely good with their hands - I&#x27;m good but found this difficult.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest using the cool blast until the hair is cooled before you remove the hair from the brush after it has been curled..</li>
            <li> WHOA, IS IT HOT!!  </li>
            <li> This beautiful trend-setting blonde uses a hot air brush!  </li>
            <li> This is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and full and smooth.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy and quick to use.  </li>
            <li> It is super easy to get the height and curl</li>
            <li> My fuzzy straight hair comes out smooth and shiny and I can do great natural looking flips and lifts.</li>
            <li> I used the Model number that was on the original I had purchased and ordered two.    </li>
            <li> it was NOT a duplicate of the original I had bought (even though I send the model number when ordering).       </li>
            <li> this blowdries my hair smooth but full of body.  </li>
            <li> However, since most younger people like   over-sized barrells (this comes with a 1 inch and a 1 1/14), you will be much more pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li> The original model had a button where you could turn on and off the ionic feature.</li>
            <li> When I first discovered it, I called it my \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Great product for as long as it lasted.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair styling hot air dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush and have used one for years.</li>
            <li> I can only get a few good, perfectly functioning months out of one of these things, and after that it smokes and overheats</li>
            <li> The top end where you place your fingers for add support while styling can get too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> Someone with fine straight hair would probably be better with another dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a great little dryer with the most watts for your buck.  </li>
            <li> High setting is good for drying, but too hot for curling.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have a free hand to handle the hair instead of brush in one hand and hairblower in the other when doing your own hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to buy the same dryer again.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have different kind of hair, and longer arms, you will love it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to purchase a hot air dryer with brushes, I would make sure you get one with the cool setting, to set the curls, like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how to clean the barrel.</li>
            <li> This tool does both and gives a nice lift that I used to be only able to get from my hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> I have even smelled burning hair even though I clean it.</li>
            <li> That being said it&#x27;s an excellent value and for the first time in my life I have straight frizz-free hair on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I have used many similar products and find the Revlon Ionic Hot Air Stylers are the most reasonably priced and still a good product.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair SO MUCH body, its just wonderful, and it dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very powerful dryer and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> Thought the older version was a little more effective, but for the cost, it&#x27;s a good buy and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more hot air stylers than hot dinners, but this one beats the lot!  </li>
            <li> I  am very pleased with this products performance and would highly recommend it to anyone lookinig for a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many of these styling dryers over the years, and this one is the most powerful by far.</li>
            <li> After doing some research I realized that for my type of hair I needed a more powerful hot hair brush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as amazing as my old one</li>
            <li> The finished style has nice volume but pretty darned straight.  </li>
            <li> If only I could operate the button, I could make my hair look really good with the RV440.  </li>
            <li> The smaller good for definition.  </li>
            <li> wait for it to cool</li>
            <li> my best groom dryer at least for now do now use brushes at all husband used it to dru paint on wood</li>
            <li> I looked in the mirror and realized it had burned off a good section (about 1 inch by 1 inch) of my hair in the back of my head.</li>
            <li> They specify 3 speed settings and 3 heat settings, but this isn&#x27;t true.  </li>
            <li> I find my hair is smoother and full bodied and holds the style longer.</li>
            <li> The cool setting was not at all cool or even room temperature.  </li>
            <li> Its cool because it dries your hair, straightens, and gives it flip or curl.</li>
            <li> I really fell in love with this dryer.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price either :-)</li>
            <li> It also has a cool setting to set your curls.  </li>
            <li> So, I couldn&#x27;t get the  full volume results I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li> Has all the features I want, like a cool setting.</li>
            <li> Tried the restart button; gave it time to cool.  </li>
            <li> I tend to use it on the lower or cool settings.  </li>
            <li> it went to cool to set curl.  </li>
            <li> I have not found this to be true.</li>
            <li> If you have very curly hair like me you will fall in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love it</li>
            <li> Not all have the cool button</li>
            <li> It is very convenient and help me detangle my hair better.</li>
            <li> I also like the COOL shot after I&#x27;ve done styling, which locks in the curl.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know when you would ever use the cool setting, but I suppose some people might find a use for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about mine.</li>
            <li> That seemed to give me the blast of cool air</li>
            <li> I do use a syrum in the ends, but that is more to prevent split ends as my hair is very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT is a great little product that is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Loved it because it dries very quickly into a smooth, slightly curled style.  </li>
            <li> This gives me good volume and body and just enough curl for a soft smooth bob hairdo, dries my hair quickly with one hand and fits in my gym bag much better than a dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same one I used to own and love except for the color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cool and the very hot still work, but</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> The design is good -- lightweight, easy to use, I like that it doesn&#x27;t spin like other models and it has never gotten tangled in my hair, and you can change out the size of the brush</li>
            <li> This product is seriously the best thing I ever bought for my hair.</li>
            <li> But, it does an adequate job.  </li>
            <li> and I see it wearing out quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love the idea of this air brush, but obviously needs a cooling factor and over all better quality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, but I would really like to get something similar, because it&#x27;s a great hair tool when it&#x27;s not faulty.   </li>
            <li> I would love it if  someone put out the older style.</li>
            <li> It is super</li>
            <li> I have extensions that get super frizzy and unsightly</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and dries my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love this even better than my last one!</li>
            <li> melting my hair like most blow dryers and curling irons tend to do on high.  </li>
            <li> I found it still works, but I have to use on high to make sure it gets the flow of air all the way through the barrel.  </li>
            <li> , i make hair look more manageable and less  frizzy ,  i have a lot of hair ,  its brushes wont stick long into it  when i style , but it is perfect  and good quality product for those have normal not thick freezze hair</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one on the shelves!!!</li>
            <li> It also gets very hot to hang on to.  </li>
            <li> You have to soak the brushes in very hot water every couple of months if you use product in your hair.  </li>
            <li> The dryer gets very hot on the highest setting and when the brush comes off you are at risk of burning yourself on the metal part of the brush.</li>
            <li> this Revlon Shine enhancing Hot Air Kit feels like a feather (maybe not as light</li>
            <li> Glad I did because the second one I purchased actually works great and has no problems with the switch.  </li>
            <li> the 1st use I was in love with it, my mom used mine and ended up buying on for herself, I also had 2 other friends who liked mine and decided to purchase one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The nozzle gets VERY HOT.</li>
            <li> But it does get VERY hot and has burned my skin.  </li>
            <li> first thing that surprised me was that it gave me more volume at the roots!  </li>
            <li> It has helped me cut down on styling time and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> It blows cool air just fine but really?</li>
            <li> For a person with fine hair, it is superior to a curling iron when smoothing and styling hair because it doesn&#x27;t smash hair down but provides a refining lift.  </li>
            <li> the clip on it broke, so the attachments wont go on any more, for this reason I am buying a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll work again but then shut off right away after you let it cool.</li>
            <li> Gave great style but over heats withing less than two minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not good at doing my own hair, but this thing makes me look good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recently purchasing replacement for a con air hot brush I loved for years.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks so good when I use this to dry and style.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light weight, effective the only reason its not 5 stars is because it is very loud</li>
            <li> BUT LOVE IT SO FAR!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love this for quickly styling my fine hair, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> So much easier than using a hair dryer!!</li>
            <li> Does a pretty descent job at drying your hair without causing frizzies!</li>
            <li> I just got this and have only used it once, but I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> If this is your problem, as it is mine, use this Hot Air Drier and Styler!</li>
            <li> It has to get hot in order to style!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> So hot!</li>
            <li> This thing is just way too hot !</li>
            <li> I loved the product this replaced but when the attachment lock broke on the old model I needed to buy the new one.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use and sure beats the two-handed styling with a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fortunate to have hair that people frequently compliment.</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine straight hair in a medium length \\&quot;bob\\&quot; type hairstyle.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, you can&#x27;t get the hair to roll because there&#x27;s so much air being blown on the piece of hair you are working with.  </li>
            <li> I have relatively straight, fine hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it works well for folks with fine and straight hair, but for gals like me, with tones of wavy hair, the brushes just couldn&#x27;t handle my hair.</li>
            <li> Then the styler brush is great for adding a little curl.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I found it at Amazon at a great price, received it in just a few days,</li>
            <li> Drys my hair fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work amazingly</li>
            <li> Its much easier to use than a hairdryer and brush to get a smooth blow out.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the ionic feature, which leaves my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The barrel is nice and fat, and the bristles hold the hair just enough without tangling.  </li>
            <li> it is not as powerful.</li>
            <li> I think I got my money&#x27;s worth for each one.</li>
            <li> Definately worth it tho.</li>
            <li> I have short curly hair and the dryer smoothes it out and makes it nice and wavy.</li>
            <li> I laugh at whoever gets it stuck in their hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly/wavy...and getting more, platinum, shall we say, by the hour.   </li>
            <li> This item works 100% better than my old one.</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at the great reviews, I guess I had a different experience.</li>
            <li> so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the money</li>
            <li> My old Revlon was much better.</li>
            <li> I can actually get good results fast with this unit</li>
            <li> The bristles are to soft to roll your hair on that you end up touching the barrel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO WORTH</li>
            <li> I love the way it points directly to the location for drying.</li>
            <li> and I love the bristles on the brush; it&#x27;s really soft to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> Even my husband has commented several times on how nice my hair looks now.</li>
            <li> I have used several of these curler/blow dryer products over the years and have really liked them.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fun to work with.  </li>
            <li> And it is fun -</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> But, that was rare.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, the super hot heat really does set my hair really well for the rest of the day!!!</li>
            <li> First one came damaged but Amazon was quick to replace.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very short and don&#x27;t catch the hair easily (which is also a postive feature because my hair didn&#x27;t get easily tangled).</li>
            <li> This is the very first hot airbrush that has not offered the option to turn off the ionic treatment.</li>
            <li> On the original I purchased,  the \\&quot;settings button\\&quot; was raised and MUCH      easier to use.    </li>
            <li> I have same product that I purchase many years ago in the store and this new one is not as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> I threw the dryer right into the garbage.</li>
            <li> The right amount of heat and blow from the dryer inside.  </li>
            <li> The control buttons for on off and temperature are located on the handle right under the spring loaded clamp.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I am right handed.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something that would eliminate me sweating right after the shower while I fix my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but you get the comparison right?)</li>
            <li> Eventually, they might burn out and one I had years ago did it right away (which I returned).  </li>
            <li> Removing it right after using it is dangerous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My issue was that it over heated very quickly and after only 5 months the thing started smoking after less than 1 min of use and broke for good!  </li>
            <li> Live it, it is Easy to use,</li>
            <li> Not too hot, but just warm enough.  </li>
            <li> first thing I liked about this dryer is the extra nozzle attachment.  </li>
            <li> IT MAKES MY HAIR TIME VERY EASY AND SIMPLE!    </li>
            <li> It gives the same results but is WAY easier because you are only using 1 tool instead of 2 :) LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Before I blow dry, I comb Biotin &amp; collagen oil treatment through my hair which promotes more shine!</li>
            <li> The barrel is huge, way too big for me to handle easily.  </li>
            <li> You can go from damp hair to the best look possible in half the time with this Revolon ionizer.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot and drys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a great product have to be careful as it gets hot on high</li>
            <li> I have had several of these of different brands, styles, features and prices and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> recommend to prep your hair with the right products; for curl definition I really like Aussie Curl Define mousse; very niche and light weight product that doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted but doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> Most other similar dryers have a cool shot button, but not an actual cool setting, this one does, and it great- til it quits working.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work right out of the package and I returned it.  </li>
            <li> I am now on my second Revlon Ionizer Roller Brush and it works great to dry my curly hair straight and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product has enough power for a quick dry and great body.</li>
            <li> It only took a few times to figure out how to best use it</li>
            <li> Works great for styling and drying your hair, the multiple settings and different attachments are a plus.</li>
            <li> It has a cool shot which is also very helpful as it gets hot.</li>
            <li> I did purchase a third, similar, Revlon RVTH500 Tourmaline Heat 1500W Hot Air Styler w/ Nano Ceramic, it works great.</li>
            <li> As a dryer the Revlon dries very fast but as stylist, I would have perferred a 3/4 barrell.  </li>
            <li> ONE PROBLEM, it doesn&#x27;t have very much power</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> only issue is it gets very hot, even on the lower heat level, so I&#x27;m just careful with it, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> I use the high heat for 10 seconds, then the cool to set the curl.</li>
            <li> Roll the air on the brush and roll and use the medium or high heat depending on your preference, then without releasing the hair switch to the cool option to set the curl/hair then release.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to treat my hair a little more gently these days, so I mostly use the cooler setting, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry I can kick up the heat.  </li>
            <li> but I was able to fix that issue with a simple hair tie wrapped around to cover the seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Naturally I chose Amazon because the item qualified for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> and it got so hot it was burning my scalp.  </li>
            <li> ...too hot to touch.</li>
            <li> Plus, the air coming out of the attachments is so hot</li>
            <li> The iron got too hot and overheated.  </li>
            <li> It gets extremely hot to the point of burning    your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried similar ones &amp; most of them overheat &amp; burn out.</li>
            <li> Also the barrel was so hot that I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> My first broke in Italy</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> More than likely, its just a fuse that blows but I&#x27;m just not going to take the time to figure that out.   </li>
            <li> The first one I bought was the 1800 watt, and that thing is too hot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying another one, because my daughter broke the first one.  </li>
            <li> I bought one and used it yesterday for the first time.</li>
            <li> It is not a dryer, just a hot brush which is also 1 1/2 around.</li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> First of all, let&#x27;s talk about the noise level on this thing.  </li>
            <li> This Brush worked wonders for me and the first time I used it someone stopped me and said I had been to a hair salon.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes for better flips, curls, waves.</li>
            <li> B000PXYAL2 Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic]], which doesn&#x27;t seem to have these unwanted vents,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I comb the tangles out and add a heat protector cream and then use the Hot Air Dryer.</li>
            <li> I first part my hair into six sections</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been searching for a different brand w/ a higher wattage in hopes to resolve the problem, but have been able to find anything I like the looks of..</li>
            <li> had I been more organized I would have sent the others back..</li>
            <li> and  would be lost without this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> My biggest problem was how hot the air was.</li>
            <li> K Revlon RV440C 1200W Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler]]</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying I ordered this product on Saturday, February 7, 2015</li>
            <li> I love the multiple heads expecially the concentrator</li>
            <li> the Hot setting is TOO hot.</li>
            <li> When I first got it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for years.  </li>
            <li> Me encanta este hot brush le he tenido hace unos 4</li>
            <li> I loved this product for the first few months.  </li>
            <li> my hair takes 45-55 minutes, it dose get REALY hot</li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well and is durable.</li>
            <li> Had my first one for over 4 years and just got this one to replace it.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I thought it was going to be the answer to my problems, then the brush kept coming off</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how much body my hair has with no products!</li>
            <li> I have this exact Hot Air Kit from the 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Noticed many people had similar problems from the reviews.</li>
            <li> The vents under the brush attachments blow hot air out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other brands I have tried:  Hot Tools and John Frieda.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is how I use the revlon hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast!</li>
            <li> The John frieda hot air brush left my hair noticeably better.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why I decided to give this Revlon hot air brush a chance.</li>
            <li> I do my whole hair with it, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time tonight.  </li>
            <li> First of all...</li>
            <li> I bought my first one around 14 years ago or so.</li>
            <li> and the tips get hot</li>
            <li> I bought this Revlon Hot Air Brush</li>
            <li> , After I bought this one I tried to use it, it&#x27;s really hot, the brush is burn you can smell of burning rubber.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Such a worthwhile purchase.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not difficult to hold or handle, but it makes my hair frizzier than a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy one of the hot brush dryer when I tried out my friend&#x27;s once.</li>
            <li> I used to use electric rollers (have hundreds of them) but using this hot air dryer and styler</li>
            <li> This is a great smoothing product for frizzy and thick hair.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s probably great for thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> ok, i ordered this product and never once received it, so i wanted a refund but never once got it back.</li>
            <li> Kinda funny..</li>
            <li> Very upset with myself!  </li>
            <li> It has to be there, otherwise the brush is too hot  to touch.</li>
            <li> I hope I find a better brand some day (currently looking).</li>
            <li> I first bought the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler.  </li>
            <li> Most likely because of the heat - this thing is HOT.</li>
            <li> It is too hot for me.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, this does a great job of minimizing the time I spend to straighten it.</li>
            <li> The top piece has already been popping off andthe attachment has already started falling off like my last one.</li>
            <li> A Hot Air Brush will help in controlling the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I had to return this Hot air brush after two weeks because it no longer heated.  </li>
            <li> This Hot Air Kit was given for Christmas to a family member who had requested it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but has blown a fuse ever 1/4 times of use.</li>
            <li> This hot air dryer brush does add shine to my hair,easy to hold and is well made..</li>
            <li> I purchased this one and a similar Revlon brush which I also like but this is my favorite..</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush simular to this one years ago.</li>
            <li> i love the attachments but the handle is too short and your hand ends up on the air flow vents</li>
            <li> I like my hair after using this hot air brush.</li>
            <li> The item description states that this hot brush has an ion on/of switch.</li>
            <li> returning this item, and the search will go on for a non-ionic hot brush.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at CVS pharmacy, but it is this exact product.  </li>
            <li> Then I section my hair (top, middle, bottom).  </li>
            <li> Use the thick brush and works great.</li>
            <li> Move than what she asked for, but exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li> spent considerable time trying to figure how to use this successfully, but no matter how I tried, I ended up burning my fingers and scalp.</li>
            <li> The hot air styling wand is one of those products I just assumed belonged to that category of woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does get pretty hot even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> It is fast and fun to use.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it dried and styled my hair.  </li>
            <li> Did a good job straightening one of my clients hair, she has naturally curly hair, but it is not as powerful as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This tool makes it so easy that I actually take a little extra time in the morning to use it, and my hair looks great!  </li>
            <li> The best way to use it is to wait until your hair is almost dry but still a little damp.</li>
            <li> Also, this product has a super high wattage comapaired to those I have found in discount stores.</li>
            <li> She loves the new one and claims it has more power then the old one ever had.</li>
            <li> High power, several settings, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I was able to actually get hair to stay on the brush, it worked really well and very fast.</li>
            <li> I get all day body and shine that is amazing without using any other products except hair spray to finish it off.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have nearly as many split ends as my flat iron created.</li>
            <li> I have since bought a Chi Flat Iron and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in its natural state of wavy chaos, I bought the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot Air Kit, for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I had previously owned an older version of this hair dryer/styler and loved it.</li>
            <li> And I get a nice soft wave or even a lot straighter than just regular blow drying.  </li>
            <li> This is an obvious design flaw, and although I try my best to keep my hair out of the crevice, at least once each time I style my hair, it gets caught in the end and rips out of my head.</li>
            <li> The high heat and powerful blow dryer aren&#x27;t of much use if the plastic tips on the barrels are too short to hold without fingers touching the metal and</li>
            <li> The first day I used it, when I went to work people kept complimenting on my new haircut!!  </li>
            <li> Have received many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this to tame it and give it a light curl rather than the unruly curls I am used to.</li>
            <li> The texture of finish of my hair comes out so much better than using a blow dryer, meaning it has a soft wave to it and is not slightly frizzy.  </li>
            <li> i have nothing positive to ay about this item.</li>
            <li> some positive reviews on this and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  </li>
            <li> This is the first of these products that I&#x27;ve really had a problem with.</li>
            <li> It does get hot really fast</li>
            <li> Seriously love it and wish I had purchased one a long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The brush gets hot fast so be prepared.  </li>
            <li> Try to get your roots straight first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used it on dry hair and it works great on dry hair as well.</li>
            <li> It does get very hot on the hottest setting, but dries hair quicker than most others and with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Cool is fast blower with no heat (and if you want to use low heat, followed by a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot;, you have to cycle through a high power blast of heat first).    </li>
            <li> It is great for those of us who have a hard time with blow dryer and brush!</li>
            <li> It dries my hair very quickly and styles it at the same time.</li>
            <li> The Cool/High setting on this model is just warm enough to dry and curl quickly without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> took off one star only because the attachments don&#x27;t change out easily.</li>
            <li> though.one star only because the attachments don&#x27;t change out easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d wanted something with a bit more power that would dry my hair faster.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to do the back of the hair as well as the front.  </li>
            <li> Even so, with this producut I am able to dry &amp; style my hair every morning</li>
            <li> Pro: I love this blower it is so easy to have to use just one hand to style and dry your hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I pick up a part of the section of my hair and apply the brush at the scalp and run the brush under the hair and then on top of the hair about 3-5 times on both sides of the hair until dry</li>
            <li> It is worth it because it saves me precious time in the morning when I am getting ready, I don&#x27;t get all sweaty, my hand doesn&#x27;t cramp, and my hair looks better than if I used a wooden round brush w/hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I really have problems blow drying my hair straight without getting frizz, so I decided to buy a hot air dryer.</li>
            <li> It is fairly easy to get used to handling, and you accomplish drying and curling at the same time.  </li>
            <li> and they made your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t blow all over the place when trying to dry it anymore.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the blowing mechanism is strong and keeps your hair from wanting to curl around the brush.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t yet and certainly don&#x27;t plan too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty heavy compared to others (probably because of the motor is more powerful).  </li>
            <li> I just purchased this styler and it IS loud and very hot.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your precious locks or your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to work and has multiple heat settings - the high setting gets really hot.  </li>
            <li> but then this of type of curler is always loud especially on high.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this dryer/styler for several years - it has to be replaced every year or so which is fine...</li>
            <li> This styler dries and smoothes my shortish and very fine hair quickly; doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume but does eliminate frizzies and makes it look shinier than usual.</li>
            <li> I use the smaller barrel to style my bangs, but the air from the vents blows my fine bangs all over the place as I try to latch onto them with the bristles of the barrel.  </li>
            <li> Iconic Hot Air Dryer is not only offers a much easier technique, it also achieves the straight (no curls)</li>
            <li> The product works great especially for my super thick hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better for those with really thick hair, but I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bristles on the barrel are separated enough to grab my hair (and I have fine hair-doesnt take much).</li>
            <li> And it gets too hot on HIGH.      </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve found is that if I&#x27;m using high heat for any length of time, the barrel gets as hot as a curling iron.</li>
            <li> The high heat selection is too hot and</li>
            <li> After the first use I&#x27;m returning it and getting the John Freida, which I see is highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I fireup the Revlon hot air brush on high for about 10 seconds, let it get warmed up.  </li>
            <li> The whole unit is really bulky and quite large.  </li>
            <li> (Most importantly)...The \\&quot;settings button\\&quot; on the new product is FLAT....      </li>
            <li> I bought it at Target a little over a month ago and so far, it&#x27;s the best 20 bucks I ever spent.  </li>
            <li> I had one before but this one is new and improved and seems more powerful than the other.</li>
            <li> but when you have to have your hair just right or have someplace special to go.......I blow dry because I can control the styling better when I blow dry.  </li>
            <li> roughly so it does require a bit more gentle care than a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Crossing my fingers it lasts a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> i used it twice and threw it in the trash - it is absolutely a disaster</li>
            <li> So much easier to style my hair.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> It takes frizz out and really smooths my hair.  </li>
            <li> so if really straight is what you desire you&#x27;re going to have to use a straightener.</li>
            <li> Thanks,  Susan  Update 10/13/11  </li>
            <li> As described and delivered fast.  </li>
            <li> are that the power is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Used along with a foaming mousse, it feels like I have twice as much hair.  </li>
            <li> this works very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset.</li>
            <li> I actually owned one of these and the bristles on it were cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> In the end my hair was still frizzy, without the shine, and had WAY too much volume.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what the purpose is of the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; feature.  </li>
            <li> This works really well and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really care for this brush.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Revlon</li>
            <li> All the gel and hairspray in the world could not give me anything, but string straight hair.</li>
            <li> It is a very well contructed product.</li>
            <li> It really scared me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They have changed the heat levels in a way that doesn&#x27;t make much sense.</li>
            <li> I have medium-thick, fine-textured, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I can make my hair almost straight or flip the ends under.  </li>
            <li> but it does not work very well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use this if you want a &#x27;gentle&#x27; hair-dryer because it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> It tames her hair to waves when she wants that look and makes it much easier to straighten for days</li>
            <li> she wants that look.</li>
            <li> Would really like to know where I can get it if they will not send it.  </li>
            <li> Use it every day to create lots of volume, and it&#x27;s very east to use.</li>
            <li> And it very noisy.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really style my hair while damp.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise works very well.</li>
            <li> Very noisy though</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, and I can style it anyway I choose.</li>
            <li> and it was gentle on my hair</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll absolutely order another one.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is straight to begin with, that&#x27;s not helpful to me.</li>
            <li> very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Really dries and curls fast, so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if the &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; feature is real or just marketing, but I don&#x27;t really care - this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> As always with Amazon, order processing was fast and item was received within estimated time.  </li>
            <li> This dryer does work very well.</li>
            <li> Use this nozzle first, as you would your normal dryer, to remove alot of the moisture.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and for me, that is a bonus since I have had rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are tiny, wiggly and cheaply made and wont hold my hair and the bristles just slide on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I was scared my hair might get tangled in the brush and that the heat would be too much by my scalp.</li>
            <li> So I would really recommend this item.</li>
            <li> she started to use it the very day she got it ..</li>
            <li> She loves it and raves about how it saves her so much time styling her hair and doesn&#x27;t need to have anymore additional &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; to fix her hair.  </li>
            <li> A half-done head of hair doesn&#x27;t really suit my sense of style.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Drys the hair fast and really straight.......and having the brush piece attached helps make the process easier than using a brush and blow dryer separately.  </li>
            <li> Blows my hair so straight</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The same one is no longer available.</li>
            <li> The whole process including blow drying and then using the Revlon tool once hair is just damp is about 20 minutes, as my hair is shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> it really is!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> and then another 30-45 minutes using a straight iron; then another 30 minutes with a curling iron...</li>
            <li> The tips on these barrels are permanently attached, too short to grasp well, and made of smooth plastic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to work it very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see Revlon bring back the old design.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s salon quality, but it makes my hair look natural, only better.  </li>
            <li> Finally, I direct the top section back.  </li>
            <li> I did the right side with the Infinity Pro and the left side with the John frieda hot air brush and what a difference!</li>
            <li> They last a long time and are easy to operate and are \\&quot;balanced well\\&quot;, which is important.  </li>
            <li> This product helps tame my unmanageable hair and makes it look soft, smooth, and healthy.</li>
            <li> It really makes my life easier, but it takes a long time to dry my hair and obtain a good result.</li>
            <li> But as you can see, I can&#x27;t live without this hot air dryer as it makes hair styling much easier.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly it didnt have duel voltage so not able to use it in New Zealand maybe be good idea to state this when advertising product .</li>
            <li> My hair is a short pixie, but my bangs are long enough for the large brush and the smaller one is good for the top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used previous models of this hot brush for about 15 years and love it, when I can turn off the ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first same item broke quickly, so I have been using this one for about a year.</li>
            <li> How it works:  3 settings: High, Low and Cool (the high and low are warm air and the cool blows out the same amount of air as the high setting, but it&#x27;s cool air, not warm).  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to to dry with this light weight dryer and a round brush to smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> I said, no, I used my new Ionic hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse, naturally curly/frizzy hair, and this dryer makes my hair shiny, smooth, and with a perfect curled-end flip.  </li>
            <li> I have long layers and this just never worked as well as my old favorite that was light purple and white.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it is ridiculous how loud the dryer is.  </li>
            <li> The older blue model is fantastic, get that instead.</li>
            <li> Using a flat iron afterwards makes a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> This is my second, the first survived more than 4 years of daily use.</li>
            <li> BECAUSE, the 2 products I received were different from the original I had bought in these ways:    </li>
            <li> The final result is a smooth, soft finsihed look without the use of additional styling tools like hot rollers or a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have long, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This tool makes it incredibly easy to blow dry my hair while still giving it volume and bounce.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s much lighter than the old one.</li>
            <li> (not sure my dad will do that great of a job if it&#x27;s left to him!)</li>
            <li> Three out of four worked fine and for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I really do not think that this is a good purchase because it takes so much time to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long fine hair.</li>
            <li> Its decent and does the job, but it does not have teh same punch as my original one.</li>
            <li> High is fast blower with heat.</li>
            <li> the bristles are fine (at least on my fine hair.)  </li>
            <li> it does very well is dry your hair, add volume and smooth it.  </li>
            <li> This unit is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that gets hot enough to really add some volume and curl to my fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I don&#x27;t have enough practice using this with brushes that don&#x27;t roll on their own so it was unpractical to dry my hair using the attachable stationery brushes.</li>
            <li> I used to spend about 45 minutes blow drying my hair with a more typical dryer, then using either a flat iron or a curling iron to smooth it out...took forever.  </li>
            <li> I love the results it gives me, and it&#x27;s easy to use--though I agree, seriously, that if you are using the high setting you should wear earplugs--it really is that loud.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a whole new one after I messed up my kit&#x27;s larger barrel brush while trying to clean it</li>
            <li> It created light smoke one time when I used it for too long - my fire alarm went off.</li>
            <li> it stays wavy, bouncy, the ends of my hair look smooth, and it holds the style ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> The product I swapped it for was a Conair double ionic port dryer, with a cool shot button, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li> I have not found that to be true compared to my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The end of the brush remains cool enough to touch, which makes styling easier for me.  </li>
            <li> first of all, the brushes are so soft that the hair won&#x27;t even adhere to it...</li>
            <li> which makes changing them when hot sensitive to fingers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hyperventilate trying to cool it off enough to use it again.  </li>
            <li> I like it for daily re-styling and not bad for on the road.  </li>
            <li> In my past units (I&#x27;ve owned two others before this one, one of which was also a Revlon product, in fact), that switch was super easy to get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Low, High, and cool.  </li>
            <li> It comes with two interchangeable heads and has three speeds; high, low, cool.   </li>
            <li> Perfect for those who can&#x27;t seem to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other.</li>
            <li> This week she commented on how much healthier my hair seemed after using the new dryer just two months.</li>
            <li> My point is, Revlon does not sell the parts separately, so if that is one is messed up or lost, you have to purchase a whole new kit.  </li>
            <li> More body, less mousse and root lifter.  </li>
            <li> When ordering this one it looked like it was made better, but on arrival, I could see that the bristles on this were just as thin and cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> I want to buy the older version.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still a good product but for people who have thin straight hair that just want to add some volume.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and it&#x27;s a lot easier than drying and using a standard brush at the same time.  </li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better would be the choice of a fatter brush instead of a smaller one.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, course hair and this tool smooths out my hair and makes getting ready much quicker.  </li>
            <li> Cord swivels as you turn the main part.  </li>
            <li> Low is still pretty hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several hot air brushes over the years, but this is the first I couldn&#x27;t use at all.</li>
            <li> Even though I was on 2nd day hair (shampooed the day before with no intention of a shampoo that morning before an early conference), I tried it out to smooth out some indentations in my straightened</li>
            <li> Even on low heat the barrel gets pretty hot, so I haven&#x27;t needed to use the high heat setting.  </li>
            <li> Well, not only does it vent very hot air, it blows the surrounding hair in all directions, undoing what you just did.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This one did not get high ratings</li>
            <li> The heat is way too high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and am about to buy another to keep on hand in case</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this item (same brand, same style)that worked great for years.  </li>
            <li> This definitely take a little longer to dry your whole head, but it looks WAY better and has MUCH more volume.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it takes a long time to blow dry with a round brush, and it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it when the results aren&#x27;t that great.  </li>
            <li> Well, that plus a little hairspray :-)  </li>
            <li> appliance also gets extremely hot and the &#x27;cool touch tip&#x27; is not long enough to protect your fingers when you try to hold it.  </li>
            <li> I had to keep telling them it wasn&#x27;t a new haircut but a new hair dryer!</li>
            <li> It is VERY LOUD and VERY HOT even on the low setting.  </li>
            <li> And my hair is not thick or curly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair free of static electricity, but that&#x27;s to be expected in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> It does not pull my hair out, it gets my natural hair straight from the roots in seconds.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and has so much volume after using it I don&#x27;t need to do another thing to it.  </li>
            <li> Great product design, lousy innards.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t normally have.  </li>
            <li> But I love the way it dries my hair--soooo much easier than the gun-type dryer used with a round brush-what a pain!</li>
            <li> A few more notes about Amazon&#x27;s description of this product:    1.</li>
            <li> but i am sure it will not last a long time.   </li>
            <li> so I wanted to find a way to easily round brush my hair because I love the way it looks</li>
            <li> It dose the job, and takes like 10-15 minutes, where with a normal blow-dryer</li>
            <li> When I placed the order in April, I ordered two, and one has a short and will not run on fast fan, hot heat.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done my full hair with it but wanted to test out the frequent complaints I saw such as weight and noise.</li>
            <li> Saves me so much time and because the barrel is metal, it&#x27;s hot enough to style it like a curling iron does.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a dryer unless you didn&#x27;t have a normal hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read that a hair dryer could leave hair more shiny, but it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> It is great if you have a thick, wavy or frizzy hairstyle and works well if let your hair air dry and want to style it and skip the hair drying process.</li>
            <li> It lends limp air a lot of body, since you can hold the curler part very close to your scalp and lift the hair easily.</li>
            <li> The button is alittle more stiff on the new one</li>
            <li> I have not-too-thick VERY curly hair, and this hot brush (I only use the largest attachment, and just throw away the smaller and the blow dryer) gets my hair from soaking wet and frizzy to dry, sleek, and gorgeous in under 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible that I received a defective unit, but I also was displeased with the large amount of exposed metal, making it much easier to burn yourself while using it.</li>
            <li> This brush dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used and also makes my frizzy/unruly/curly hair completely smooth.  </li>
            <li> My only problem with hot air brush was that the high heat setting wouldn&#x27;t work for two months.</li>
            <li> My first and last time to use it, I had done a section of hair on HIGH for about three seconds</li>
            <li> The attachments got so hot when I used the heat settings (low or high, it didn&#x27;t matter) that I could not remove them to switch out (from dryer head to brush) without a washcloth or something.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s off to Walgreens or Kmart or another drugstore to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I CAN&#x27;T live without this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.  </li>
            <li> The new model has an opening on both the brushes where they connect to the handle.  </li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me when I got a new hair style.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new one cause in brasil</li>
            <li> I just got a new hairstyle...</li>
            <li> Time to try a new brand.</li>
            <li> me a new one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But then I just got Her a new one.</li>
            <li> Like any new hair appliance, it took some practice/experimenting to style my hair the way I wanted it.  </li>
            <li> I buy 2 at a time, I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Plus the new is a dryer also, so</li>
            <li> It takes longer for me to dry my hair with this new one, but the added 5 minutes is worth it for not having to spend $200 a year buying new blow dryers!</li>
            <li> Luckily I can use the dryer with an unattached styling brush to dry the rest of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I just have to adjust to low heat, which will take a much longer time to style my hair, which I&#x27;m not liking very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on my dry hair to give it a quick flip either under or up</li>
            <li> I put a ton of super glue on it and am waiting for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Just a quick dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too expensive, and does a good job of drying my hair fast while still giving me volume.  </li>
            <li> It is the best hair dryer ever for thin, limp hair.</li>
            <li> It is very loud though.</li>
            <li> With this tool, it takes less than 10 minutes to fully dry my hair (which goes well past my shoulders), and turns out perfectly every time.</li>
            <li> The plastic brush bristles are too soft to hold my thin, fine hair securely</li>
            <li> The first day I used this brand new dryer, it overheated after 5 minutes and never turned back on.  </li>
            <li> It allows so many different hair styles to be accomplished with little practice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can dry my hair pretty fast - about 20 minutes from start to finish.</li>
            <li> and I get my hair dried pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Small enough and easy to handle, I like it very much!</li>
            <li> It is such a good dryer for my hair to dry and style at the same time, but they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I had to return it and purchased a different brand and style of hot air curler.</li>
            <li> First of all it is totally unwieldly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a hassle to send it back, and now I&#x27;m out of a hot air dryer until I get a replacement.</li>
            <li> I used this on the low setting and still it became so hot</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target after seeing my sister using a similar type of hot air brush.</li>
            <li> K Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue]]</li>
            <li> All of my issues could be due to a defective unit or perhaps this item is better suited to a different type of hair.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I am not particularly talented when it comes to doing my own hair.</li>
            <li> wow, what a difference!  </li>
            <li> and I was so surprised when I got home from work on February 9th to find the product already on my door step!  </li>
            <li> I simply rolled each chunk up on the barrel and hit it with the hot air.  </li>
            <li> This causes alot of the hot air to escape there and not make it to the actual barrel part.  </li>
            <li> the low button between the hot and medium and</li>
            <li> This is the third brand of hot air brush I have bought.  </li>
            <li> Then I section off my hair with the bottom part of hair left out as the first section.  </li>
            <li> While it does get hot, I have found that it does not get any hotter than my regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue</li>
            <li> i gave mine which i had for over a year the same exactly one</li>
            <li> /&gt;It would be ok for a baby&#x27;s head or perhaps a small animal</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time last night</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Not only is the volume lower, but there is still plenty of hot air</li>
            <li> The first one lasted 2 years and finally overheated and died.&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the money, even if it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> have used Conair instant heat hot brush for past 7 years and it is a better buy than this</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and could not find in my local stores.  </li>
            <li> I went with the Revlon one because of the higher wattage and bigger brush size.   </li>
            <li> I use it on the low heat setting and it gets plenty hot to style my stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this hot air dryer &amp; styler.  </li>
            <li> I went to my local beauty supply store and bought a Helen of Troy hot air brush with a 1 1/2 \\&quot; barrel</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, and it only takes minutes to dry my relatively short hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to straighten your hair and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> Then the past couple years they deteriorated more quickly, from brushes slipping off to just burning out.</li>
            <li> Even though air comes out faster on the high speed than on the low speed, it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair as well as a real hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I guess the ion styling dried it very quickly and the way I wanted it.</li>
            <li> Even on low, this item got far too hot and fried my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly, frizzy hair and this is the only straightener I&#x27;ve used successfully, for about 10 years now.</li>
            <li> after I was done with the initial styling, I turned the brush off, waited about a minute, then turned it on to the \\&quot;cool setting\\&quot; and lightly brushed my hair with it.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> This one works fine, but you can tell they&#x27;ve changed the quality a little.  </li>
            <li> Now that is worth every single penny.  </li>
            <li> Not as powerful as other older models of this brush I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me, but it simply does not produce enough hot air.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy and cumbersome to use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Use to fully dry and style or just to touch up, smooth and add extra body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry my pretty thick hair, and does such a good job that I don&#x27;t need to re-do my hair the following day -</li>
            <li> I have a new hairstyle that requires a better bend than I get from my Braun, which is why I thought I would try a Dryer/Styler Brush instead, but it just is a lot more work and the results are bad.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s as much as a blow dryer because that&#x27;s how much you need to dry your hair!</li>
            <li> Mine is fine and board straight, hers is thick and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I get more voulme using the traditional brush/dryer method, but this is a little easier to get the job</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that it does tend to get a little hot to handle on the high setting, but it&#x27;s worth it to me because it dries my hair so fast, while styling it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I received it 2 days earlier than expected, which was great because I was having many bad hair days</li>
            <li> I bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it, I was not, It snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude.</li>
            <li> On closer look it almost appears some of the plastic had been melting so clearly this was defective from the start.</li>
            <li> The whole point of these things is to take out the extra step and make it all happen in one.</li>
            <li> The brush frequently falls off because it doesn&#x27;t connect well, and burns your fingers when you try to catch it.  </li>
            <li> It was, by far, the loudest blow dryer I have ever heard.  </li>
            <li> As with all electronic/electrical devices it is getting old</li>
            <li> My hair was completely jacked up until I got it in the mail</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an old unit I had for 10 years.  </li>
            <li> My hair turns out soft and styled</li>
            <li> This product works really well, because you don&#x27;t have to hold a brush and hair dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li> It has a much shorter handle and simply grabs the hair to turn it under.</li>
            <li> I think there was just way too much air power, as it only blew my hair around as I was trying to use the brush.</li>
            <li> As far as the product.  </li>
            <li> I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for young kids/teens because like I said, you can easly burn yourself by toughting the brush.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my wife who likes it so far.</li>
            <li> Finally it is loud, loud like a leaf blower.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot of air pressure blowing out of it for my tastes and the bristles are to soft to grip my hair and pull it taunt.  </li>
            <li> It really have the same effect as if I just when to the salon!</li>
            <li> however the result is that while you are trying to roll your hair, there is a lot of air being blown directly on the hair you are trying to roll.  </li>
            <li> Purchased in March 2015, as of Aug 18, 2015, the electrical box that plugs into the wall completely fell apart with pieces falling out everywhere.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s old Hair Dryer died one day and I hear her say, Honey &amp;#34;Buy</li>
            <li> My old one broke</li>
            <li> Two weeks after the return window expired, it stopped putting out heat completely.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is loud as some reviewers suggested, but I wouldn&#x27;t say itsear piercing and compared to my old dryer, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and I am 50.</li>
            <li> I try to leave it on \\&quot;low\\&quot; because the \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;cool\\&quot; settings are quite loud, which is why I&#x27;ve rated it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same feeling with this brush, but much easier to manage, and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I returned it and went with this one (which is much simular to the one I had years back.</li>
            <li> I agree that on the highest setting the dryer is way too loud and you cannot move the switch with one finger.</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty long, just below my chest.</li>
            <li> It also gave a soft bevel to the ends.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working well for me so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful enough for the toughest hair but with different heat settings it can be gentle enough for the most delicate baby hair.</li>
            <li> What a shame to put such a POORLY DESIGNED BUTTON on an otherwise good styler.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brushes didn&#x27;t want to grip my hair, but that&#x27;s probably because I have really thick hair that needs more than soft bristles to grab hold of it.  </li>
            <li> Might work okay with thick longer hair where you don&#x27;t wind it up to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better.</li>
            <li> Would have loved this product if it hadn&#x27;t broken the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Good but with thin hair you definitely need to use a water bottle to dampen your hair before using it...if not curls won&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> After using the new red model on high the plastic melted.</li>
            <li> let it sit for 5 seconds, then turn the brush on cool for 5-10 seconds and run the brush down to the ends turning under as I do so.  </li>
            <li> Blow in it to cool it down?  </li>
            <li> This was the second time I purchased this hot air dryer &amp; styler (the first one broke through my carelessness, and was in no way due to a manufacturing defect).</li>
            <li> I use it more as a finisher after I have round brushed my head normally with blow dryer and brush to help smooth out the waves that I was unable to smooth out in the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> As they are generally inexpensive, I&#x27;ve made it a habit to keep a new one in reserve.</li>
            <li> The first 2 that I owned,  each lasted more than a couple of years; almost daily use on coarse, long (past below bra strap), not so straight hair.</li>
            <li> I also love that it takes about half the time to dry now.</li>
            <li> Also, the handle can feel a bit loose from the hot wand part.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer to replace the exact same model that had just worn out after several years of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 5/24/10 to replace the older model which died only 6 months after I bought it.  </li>
            <li> While I have purchased several hot air dryers from Revlon over the years, the one I received didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> I just purchased a second one for my mother who has the exact opposite of my hair...</li>
            <li> I bought another brand first from my local drug store and took it back after one use.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut - it is a pretty short bob - just below my chin.</li>
            <li> Only giving it 4 stars because first time I ordered it the wiring was faulty and it would turn off at different times.</li>
            <li> Takes a little more time to dry my hair</li>
            <li> In all fairness, the unusable button and too-high heat on HIGH were the only problems I had.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target after seeing such high stars for this product.    </li>
            <li> and my hair was starting to show no style and frizz, but simply drying my hair with this hair dryer/styler, resulted in great body and no more frizz!!!</li>
            <li> This one gives you the option of small curls or a smooth look.</li>
            <li> I have long very wavy hair</li>
            <li> I quickly dry my hair that style it with the large attachment......</li>
            <li> Keep them brushed out with an old toothbrush or vacuum brush and your styling brush should have a much longer life span.  </li>
            <li> Use the low with the large brush for styling, volumizing, larger curls or waves or for straightening.  </li>
            <li> did not get as much curl, wave or flip as my hairdresser does using a separate hair dryer and a large round brush.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and this dryer gives me body and fullness.</li>
            <li> i think anyone who is good with hair or has at least shoulder length hair might find it a little easier.    </li>
            <li> So useful for me because it gives me the opportunity to blow dry my hear with style, not just being flat.</li>
            <li> My hair is short curly and the latest products blow so hard</li>
            <li> Although it is being replaced , hope new one will last awhile .</li>
            <li> I have had mine for about 7 years and it still works like brand new with almost daily use.</li>
            <li> I find the round tube type brush attachment perfect for my hair as I am awkward with a blow dryer and a brush.  </li>
            <li> Now I use this tool to blow dry my hair and the results are so much</li>
            <li> My stylist was really concerned by how dry my hair had become.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this Revlon hair dryer, I can blow dry my hair again.  </li>
            <li> so it takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry the whole thing</li>
            <li> In addition, you can dry your hair straight or style and curl it while drying.</li>
            <li> This has the heat and power to really get your hair dry with lastings curls (or straightening).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> so I think it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as I would like .....</li>
            <li> And  you can dry your hair straight or style and curl it while drying.  </li>
            <li> At least this has a one-year warranty, but I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to get them to honor it.  </li>
            <li> For a few seconds I could see the potential for fat, smooth waves.      </li>
            <li> It makes drain my thick curly hair easy and manageable</li>
            <li> love this, have used daily since I got it and have thick, curly hair and</li>
            <li> Dry first with a regular dryer for speed, then finish with this.</li>
            <li> I blow dry the roots of my hair first with a regular hair dryer and then finish the rest of my hair with the Revlon tool.</li>
            <li> My hair is super straight and pretty thick and very very flat, it&#x27;s hard for me to get any sort of volume to it - and this hot air brush fully did the trick.</li>
            <li> I wore my hair natural to work the other day and people wanted to know how I get it so straight</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, so you don&#x27;t have to hold a blow dryer in one hand, and a round brush in the other.</li>
            <li> Not as strong so you can&#x27;t blow and pull hair hard enough to make it dry and straight.</li>
            <li> Not very warm,takes quite a long time to get a strong curl on even dry hair.</li>
            <li> It only has a high and low setting.</li>
            <li> I have long  curly hair and  before using it I used a regular blow drier until it was about 80 to 90% dry because otherwise the &amp;#34;hot  air&amp;#34; is so cool that  I felt it would never dry my hair or would take forever.</li>
            <li> Its difficult to keep switching from low HOT to the high blow cool setting</li>
            <li> It would be easier to grow an extra arm and be able to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, and use the new hand to separate the sections.</li>
            <li> I am a girl who generally does not do a lot with my hair.  </li>
            <li> They generally lasted 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it was so loud I had to wear ear plugs while I was using it.  </li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t like was that this was extremely loud, even at the low setting.</li>
            <li> I use handfuls of leave-in conditioner, curl cream, curl gel, &amp;  even coconut oil, barely making a difference.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still easier to use than a regular dryer and brush (two handed styling) which requires turning off the dryer frequently in order to re-position the brush correctly.</li>
            <li> and I do not know if it would be accepted, but barely usable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a second time after my old one wore out after about 10 years.</li>
            <li> I make soft, shiny waves with the larger barrel brush, which I prefer for myself.  </li>
            <li> but I went with it because it is the same brand as my old one.  </li>
            <li> When complete my hair is left shiny and has some body and curl.</li>
            <li> I really thought the brushes were harder, that was a dissapointment, but in all it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> When I tried to use fingers/palm hold to my hair in place over the bristles so I could wrap it around the barrel, after a minute of running, even on low, the barrel became too handle or even bring near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product was so loud that I resorted to wearing earplugs for the first few times</li>
            <li> It is the most frustratingly packaged product you will ever find.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps its only because I have thick African textured hair, it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair enough to get a straight blow dry, perhaps better suited to Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> and it still works, but I recently bought a new one at a local store for around the same price the old one was.</li>
            <li> Use the High with the focus attachment to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and did a terrific job of drying my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it works much the same as the old model.</li>
            <li> Recently, my dryer had been over heating and taking too long to cool down (keeping in mind that it&#x27;s almost ten years old).  </li>
            <li> Use a blow dryer (or air dry your hair) to about 75% dry, then switch to the hot air brush to style.  </li>
            <li> Styling products tend to build up on the metal part, and it is kinda hard to clean since I don&#x27;t think you can immerse it.</li>
            <li> A hot mess.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be flat and lifeless, and now feels soft and moisturized...</li>
            <li> I use this product almost daily on my hair (long and thick hair) absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long, course hair and the original model would dry my hair in 45 minutes, smooth enough that I did not need a flat iron.</li>
            <li> and it does work great, however this one came with problems and it is the worse thing i bought lately.</li>
            <li> The old version had a bigger ridge, that actually slid with one finger.  </li>
            <li> Since you have to hold it closer to your head than a regular hair dryer and especially when you are holding it near the ear....</li>
            <li> It is much easier to use than a round brush and dryer separately like the professional stylists do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get out of the shower one day (inevitably a day when I really desperately need my hair to look good) and</li>
            <li> It is frustrating when I am in a hurry as I constantly have to revue the setting to make sure they are where they have to be for optimal use.</li>
            <li> Wow, can you make the switch any more difficult to move?  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not completely dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the older generation with their pink sleep-in curlers and blue-rod perms.  </li>
            <li> Gets a little to hot for my liking.</li>
            <li> It gets louder on the cool and high setting but blows about equally as hard as it does in the low setting which was disappointing, but over all its a great purchase and makes round brushing a lot easier.</li>
            <li> My hair is of medium thickness and slightly wavy -- normally very easy to work with -- but the bristles go flat when I try to grab even a small section of hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dryer gets too hot when drying with the barrels and there is not a quick release for you hair, only for changing the attachment.  </li>
            <li> is that the motor is quite noisy; you have to use it closed doors or without anyone in the house; I wonder if the manufacturer could add a better motor or less noisy; I have not seen any other styling tools like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would take forever to dry as I use a much more powerful regular blowdryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just possible to slide it from OFF to HIGH, but not HIGH to OFF, or any setting in between.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good luck with these in accomplishing silky smooth hair with just enough volume, but this one was terrible.</li>
            <li> It takes so much longer to dry your hair with this thing than it does to blow dry it with the Revlon Ion Dryer and then straighten your hair with a straightner.  </li>
            <li> So much easier than using both hands- one for hair dryer &amp; the other for a brush!</li>
            <li> The former one didn&#x27;t last as long as the others and this new one has designed those openings to keep it from overheating.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I will agree with is that the switch could be a little better, but as long as you even have the teeniest bit of a nail you can switch it up and down with no problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, sizes and versions of this product when I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one.  </li>
            <li> It still blows cool air, but it would take about 20 minutes to do the other half of my head that isn&#x27;t styled yet.  </li>
            <li> At first I had to stop and put it down to change the heat setting, but after a few pushes back and forth, it doesn&#x27;t require quite as much thumb</li>
            <li> The new model has a switch that is much harder to turn off and on with just one hand.  </li>
            <li> I see a clear difference in my hair, it feels softer and shines after a blow dry.</li>
            <li> I generally like this, but I recommend getting the more expensive model as this one has metal which burns your skin if you touch it while styling your hair.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it as much as the previous two, because I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair shorter.</li>
            <li> I used to spend 30-45 minutes drying with a blow-dryer and round brush; setting it in hot rollers and then styling - total time took about an 1 1/2 - 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Probably not enough power for someone with thick full hair</li>
            <li> you have thick, curly, frizzy, stubborn, resistant or even soft fine delicate hair, I highly recommend this styler.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, down to my shoulder blades, and it&#x27;s pretty curly.  </li>
            <li> It looks like you had your hair done professionally every single day.  </li>
            <li> No flat iron straightener has ever worked as well for me.   </li>
            <li> Seems to overheat much faster than previous ones I&#x27;ve owned (same model).</li>
            <li> after shampooing, I use a leave in Garnier product for smoothing split ends, then I blow dry with a regular vented brush (not a round brush) until my hair is just damp.  </li>
            <li> The bristles on both brush attachments are way too short and flimsy, making it almost impossible to get a good grip on your hair as you are styling it.  </li>
            <li> This was not the answer for me my hair is very thin and very fine</li>
            <li> I was able to dry my very thick, curly, frizzy hair on the low setting!</li>
            <li> I simply throw some mouse in it and let it partially air dry while getting ready in the mornings and then use the 1.5 in.</li>
            <li> I wear a glove on the opposite hand as the tip of the brush is not long enough to grip.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair which I blow mostly dry, then use the larger brush to smooth out my hair and curl it.  </li>
            <li> It absolutly will not curl my baby fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> I am told it will grab my baby fine, thin hair.     </li>
            <li> I have rather thin, baby fine, chin length hair and zero stying skill.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thick, and I ONLY use the low setting.  </li>
            <li> I finally ditched that one and was hesitant to by another one but couldn&#x27;t find any others with the round brush that had at least 1000 watts so it could actually dry your hair instead of just blowing warm</li>
            <li> Once I got the hang of using it (there was a little bit of a learning curve), it was much faster than the dryer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is white and given to frizziness and out of control curl, but it is thin and baby fine.  </li>
            <li> Before you had it on high to curl and then one setting down</li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;ll keep buying it as the good outweighs the bad....</li>
            <li> It must dry natural &amp; not be combed or brushed when dry.</li>
            <li> and I still need several small sections to dry properly, but it does dry quickly.</li>
            <li> Sure, it may be a little awkward to hold and use when you first try it</li>
            <li> My hair is very dull, dry, &amp; fine.</li>
            <li> It creates the same style as my flat iron but without drying out my hair or frizzing it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried curling irons, curling brushes, even flat irons (which totally scorched the ends of my hair).  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it wouldn&#x27;t really curl my hair, but it does fluff it, and untangle it nicely.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted except that the brushes that are described as 1&#x27; and 1½&amp;#34; are at least 3/4 to an inch larger.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too soft, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair and it&#x27;s not powerful enough for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> Because you&#x27;re creating curl at the same time, I erred on the side of smaller chunks at a time, which ended up taking just as long.  </li>
            <li> Usually my arm gets tired once I get to the crown and kind of give up.</li>
            <li> Granted, the handle is large and somewhat bulky in my small hand</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you plan on using it to replace the round brush/hair dryer combo.  </li>
            <li> Hot and cold air is just the right velosity for styling with a brush</li>
            <li> The low setting is too low to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair using the largest brush on the lowest heat setting; only occasionally do I use the highest setting.  </li>
            <li> so I can use the brushes but the amount of air that comes out is not enough to dry my short hair.  </li>
            <li> The diameter of my hair is smaller like angel hair pasta, only curly, frizzy &amp; dry (caucasian).</li>
            <li> and I only need one hand to dry and style my hair at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Finally died last year and Amazon to the rescue because all the other ones I bought in stores did not dry my hair and got caught in my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the small brush because it gives me too much curl, so it&#x27;s been put away since day one.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT even think of buying this product with the flat controls.  </li>
            <li> It works on short or long hair, but with longish hair there can be a tendancy for it to cut out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use a flat iron after I use this but 99% of the time</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair that lays flat on my head.</li>
            <li> I never use a flat iron I just use this.</li>
            <li> Depending on how long your hair is you can blowdryer and style all at the same time and not have to curl!!</li>
            <li> , coz it doesn&#x27;t make any noise and the bristles are sturdy and long enough to hold my hair and does the job in under 10 min.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need the flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need a flat iron, curling iron and/or curlers.</li>
            <li> It works for long or short hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use a flat iron after this.</li>
            <li> long enough (15-20 seconds</li>
            <li> I towel dry my hair, put my product in, blow dry my hair with a regular blow dryer for 2-3 minutes concentrating the air flow at the back middle of my head at the roots where the thickest part of my hair is using my fingers to lift my hair away from my scalp.  </li>
            <li> But the first one died after maybe 3 months, and the second one, after a few months, now only heats a little bit, so</li>
            <li> Who knows where these are made but clearly QC has plummeted &amp; how they kept the price down.</li>
            <li> I typically go through a new one about every 2-4 years, so I expected similar long-lasting quality from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised to see that this product has so many bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> None of them ever had enough power to actually dry my hair.</li>
            <li> On low, it was tolerable but it would have taken me an hour to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use my regular hair dryer to mostly dry my hair</li>
            <li> Before my hair was completely dry, I added the smaller brush to style/smooth my hair.</li>
            <li> The attachments were a nightmare and nearly impossible to change out and the power button liked to stick at the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> With this thing, I use it and it takes me only like 20 minutes to dry, and style my hair.</li>
            <li> It has an attachment that allows you to use it as a regular hair dryer, or you can dry your hair using the brush attachments.  </li>
            <li> and I usually dry it using the larger brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> so I use a regular hair dryer to dry my hair to damp.  </li>
            <li> Then, I use the larger of the two brushes to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can style and dry at same time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the fastest way to blow dry and style my hair at the same time....</li>
            <li> well if you have long, thick hair, and you are trying to use this to dry your wet hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it was just too large and hard to handle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair that long as this drys my hair and curls it at the same time.</li>
            <li> This one, however, I can&#x27;t keep the brushes on long enough to even dry my bangs.  </li>
            <li> But with this product, if I blow dry from wet (towel dried), I can achieve really great waves and volume that I have previously been unable.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle though it is a bit thick for my small hands.  </li>
            <li> My previous method of hair styling was to either put my wet hair into a high bun, or to let my hair air dry and then straighten it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I find this item difficult to find in any my local stores; The drugstore where I originally purchased it is no longer here.</li>
            <li> I dry my hair with my normal hair dryer until it is just little damp, about 80% dry.</li>
            <li> I have relatively coarse, hard to damage hair, and I literally smelled my hair BURNING on high heat.  </li>
            <li> It last about 3 to 5 years using every single day of the year!</li>
            <li> I usually remove the brush and just blow dryer my hair on high heat to &amp;#34;dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d blow dry it and then use a curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li> I usually have to wear it in a bun for a day after before my flat iron will work out the semi-permanent kinks the new model leaves in my hair.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair short and found I am a total klutz with conventional blow dryer and brush.  </li>
            <li> years looked fine, so I decided to purchase a new one, despite of the bad reviews.</li>
            <li> When with this sucker falls of the counter with its intense blower...</li>
            <li> It was about 4 inches long.  </li>
            <li> The handle is much larger and harder to hold.</li>
            <li> This happens when the hair is wrapped around the styler(or whatever it is called) for a long</li>
            <li> a price ranging from $15 to $25, it&#x27;s cheaper to buy one of these a month than to get my hair professionally blown out every few days.</li>
            <li> It is way too long and cumbersome.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t want to burn the thing out by using it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed for a long time.</li>
            <li> it was low powered and I could only use it to style my hair after I had dried it with a regular hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 different products and had to return them at Target since they did not work out and not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get caught in long hair.</li>
            <li> It works to straighten, and curl long wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> We both have LONG</li>
            <li> Ive had mine for a long time.</li>
            <li> second problem was just how difficult it was to get to the COOL button.  </li>
            <li> and so I read all the reviews for the different brands of this type of hot air curler and was totally confused.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite loud, not a huge deal but</li>
            <li> I hate this &amp;#34;new version&amp;#34; of what was a good thing.  </li>
            <li> Compared to a regular blow drier which feels very heavy and loud</li>
            <li> Previously, people have complained that it has gotten too hot or left their hair damaged.</li>
            <li> This styler is very helpful but you need to let your hair dry at least 80% before styling with this.</li>
            <li> I chose this Revlon product because I had a previous model for several years that recently died.</li>
            <li> and it took so long to get a curl even partially dry</li>
            <li> Roll it up again if not complete dry.  </li>
            <li> Thin, fine, limp hair?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a round blow dryer but my hair stylist recommended it for my fine, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other hairdryers and always go back to this one, I am thinking of buying another to keep as a spare.</li>
            <li> And of course I took the advice of other reviewers and kept to low heat and air settings.</li>
            <li> so extreme that it shot sparks out at my head &amp; chest that actually burned..</li>
            <li> I only buy Revlon products because I&#x27;ve come to realize that they&#x27;re stronger than other brantds.</li>
            <li> I see that other customers have had the same issues and it appears that Revlon is in no hurry to fix it.</li>
            <li> so i usually make round back of head and make straight front of my hair.</li>
            <li> With this, you could potentially get rid of any other dryer you have.</li>
            <li> i have tried other stylers but they were too &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; and i took them all back.</li>
            <li> The first one was broken right out of the package, the button clip that keeps the brush on was broken, the 2nd one burned out, the 3rd one, the little screen on the bottom broke off and</li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t hold it close to your scalp for very long so that the curling iron effect is lost.     </li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and very thick and very long.  </li>
            <li> If I wanted to use two appliances to dry and style my hair</li>
            <li> If a blow iron can&#x27;t dry your hair you might as well be using a curling iron</li>
            <li> I use it as a blow dryer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It has 2 brushes and a directional air flow nozzle, should you choose to just blow dry.</li>
            <li> I can even style my hair when hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I never did get my hair all the way dry with this product.  </li>
            <li> Dry and style all at once.  </li>
            <li> After my hair was dry, but not bent under where</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry, I take out the rollers and use this to blow out the curls.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are not meant to dry the roots.  </li>
            <li> I dry just to give a couple seconds to rest.</li>
            <li> dry or air dry 1/2 way &amp; finish w/ this dryer..  </li>
            <li> and it looks really dry when I style it.</li>
            <li> This product makes my dry frizzy hair even drier &amp; frizzier.</li>
            <li> and I always dry my hair before using the styler so there is no excuses for this crappy product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to both dry and help style my hair.  </li>
            <li> like this dryer because you can dry hair with it as well as style it.</li>
            <li> Per instructions I waiting until my hair was about 1/2 dry, then I sectioned it off, and started drying.</li>
            <li> When I have time I wait until my hair is just damp to dry it to minimize damage.</li>
            <li> I used to have to blow dry my hair and then straighten it out.  </li>
            <li> I try not to over dry my hair with it.</li>
            <li> like this dryer because you can dry hair with it as well as style it.  </li>
            <li> I have always used it on my 80 % dry hair and it took me forever to set my hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using a blow dry and a brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this to dry my hair</li>
            <li> to dry my hair</li>
            <li> and it takes about 30 minutes to completely dry which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> I wait for my hair to be almost dry</li>
            <li> and then I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and couldn&#x27;t wait to dry</li>
            <li> when I blow dry them, so I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> No need to use curling iron after blow dry.</li>
            <li> Now I can dry my hair and style it in 10 min</li>
            <li> The brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush.</li>
            <li> I also realize I should use a solid wooden round brush with boar bristle, and I do use one on occasion.  </li>
            <li> my hair is short, straight and thin.</li>
            <li> Use the low with the small brush for making curls (use when hair is damp, not wet).  </li>
            <li> Someone with very thick coarse hair may do very well with this dryer, however if you have color treated average hair, you may experience the same problems I have.</li>
            <li> will definitely be using this tool daily, and can tell it will be less stressful on both me and my hair!</li>
            <li> so unless you turn it off - it overheats and shuts down till it cools down completely.</li>
            <li> I chose this one because Target had limited options and this one came with two sizes of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it happens every single time..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get a polished look when the hot air brush is making a mess out of all of the hair you just styled.</li>
            <li> It actually cuts down on my drying time and make my roots dry quicker.</li>
            <li> When that part is dry, I let the middle section down and direction</li>
            <li> Just a small section in my longish hair, at the nape of my neck, but WOW.  </li>
            <li> Not worth packing up and sending back</li>
            <li> It has grown past my shoulder blades, near to my bra band.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure it it will work if you have really natural curly hair</li>
            <li> I have literally used this three times and the hot air is now broken.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my older model by Revlon but this model is harder to turn on &amp; hard to change speeds.</li>
            <li> must admit that I was affraid it would not work out for my hair, my hair is thin, but I have a lot of hair and pretty curly.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> If you use it when your hair is too wet, it will take too long.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally has this really tight curl in the back and a straight front, which makes it difficult to style.  </li>
            <li> And I can always turn it down to the low setting if I need to.  </li>
            <li> They basically turn my stick-straight hair into coarse, curly hair from down there.</li>
            <li> (mine down to my waist, hers to 3/4 back) hair.</li>
            <li> Plus with the new design, the brush stays attached even while pulling through thick hair.</li>
            <li> Previously I would have to blowdry, then sometimes flatten with a straight-iron the back portion, then curl with a fat curling iron to get everything uniform.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it less than two months ago and it doesnt work properly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is capable of drying towel dried hair</li>
            <li> I thought I was born with white womens hair, but I wasn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m a black woman.</li>
            <li> Works well on wet of dry hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the button is hard to slide from hot to medium</li>
            <li> And let&#x27;s be clear: even though it takes 30 minutes to dry my hair, the dryer is hardly getting a workout.  </li>
            <li> Have always been a bit wary of it tho, because it gets very very hot</li>
            <li> It ends up being a big mess.  </li>
            <li> I hate almost all hair dryers; I love this one!</li>
            <li> I will do a crude 5 minute dry with my fingers and the blower, mostly concentrating on the roots, and then I will style the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> &amp; I cannot hold a round brush &amp; dry at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Instead of having a detachable head (another flaw with the Revlon: the head comes loose, especially if you are slightly aggressive with your straightening), it&#x27;s all one piece, the handle is thinner, and the bristles aren&#x27;t that sharp plastic - they&#x27;re faux-boar bristles, so your hair is shinier.</li>
            <li> I was left with little stubbles of hair.</li>
            <li> If Revlon could make these last a little longer I would change my rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this one a little over a month</li>
            <li> AND I can get a little style in it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I got it since my bff recommended, ( I have medium thick to coarse loose curly and wavy hair prone to immense frizz)</li>
            <li> The other brand was wimpy and took forever to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry like other dryers i have used.</li>
            <li> but it took such a long time to dry my thick curly hair and when I was done it looked frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> It works more like a curling iron than a brush, and I wonder if some of the folks who have rated it badly were using it incorrectly.</li>
            <li> :  Cheaply made, the handle vibrates so badly from the motor that it actually hurts my hand.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product in THEORY, but the design is awful!</li>
            <li> I love this hairdryer but it has to be replaced after a few months otherwise it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I usually have to opt for low and take 3 x as long to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have owned several of these and my only complaint is that they tend to burn out after about 2 to 3 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews that this dryer has gotten.  </li>
            <li> This product does not last long, keep that in mind if you have past shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised at the negative comments this has received.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> It dried my hair and styled it at the same time like it claims it will.  </li>
            <li> that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item last month at Target, I needed a way to straighten, and curl my hair because I have shoulder problems, so it hurts to hold up a round brush and hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I do not use this on damp or wet hair.  </li>
            <li> BUT..they burn out after only a few months..</li>
            <li> hers is straight and thin.  </li>
            <li> am sticking with my blow dryer and big round brush.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to juggle the blowdryer and my round brush back and forth.  </li>
            <li> it makes it harder to use.  </li>
            <li> I know I use to big of  a section sometimes for the brush I am using because I am impatient and in a hurry</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t careful you will scorch your hair do to the metal on the brush heating up.  </li>
            <li> Then recently, It heats up and works for a few minutes then just stops.</li>
            <li> It does break after a year or two but that should be expected with every day use.</li>
            <li> so it will cost me 12.00 pound to send it back waste of money</li>
            <li> Curious, I asked to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I came online to try to track down an older model.&lt;br /&gt;Update: have ordered the Conair model but in the mean time I stand by this review.  </li>
            <li> They saved a fraction of a cent by making it flat with LITTLE ridges to use to slide it.  </li>
            <li> I found it a little heavy and awkward to use, and it really gets hot.  </li>
            <li> and it acutally changes the curl vs. leaving some weird mix that just makes your hair stick straight out as it will if you try this with a curling or flat iron.  </li>
            <li> 3 attachments:  small brush, large brush and hard plastic &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; (focus attachment).  </li>
            <li> I have short layered hair that is incredibly thick but lays very flat.  </li>
            <li> No more needing a third hand trying to style my hair with a round brush and regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> *Came back to say that after about a year of using this an average of twice a week, the little prongs that hold the brush onto the unit broke so the brush would not stay attached.   </li>
            <li> I can make it fluffy or flat if I wish.</li>
            <li> The hot setting can go slow and fast but the cold setting doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> I typically have very long hair and have always used a straightener.  </li>
            <li> It cuts blow dry time in half</li>
            <li> I alternate between cold and hot to set the style and also it doesn&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li> This hairdryer works for my hair once it&#x27;s about half dry.  </li>
            <li> Instead of a dry, frizzy, curly bush on my head, I had a slightly straighter, even drier, frizzier bush on my head.</li>
            <li> I dry and style with this in half the time.</li>
            <li> The dryer part works fine, but it&#x27;s VERY difficult to remove the brushes and change them.  </li>
            <li> and then I turn it down to low, and  run it down my hair underneath down to the ends, roll the hair up the brush</li>
            <li> and for having 1200 watts is surprisingly not too loud.</li>
            <li> I did not have the other problems that other 1-star reviews cited.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, especially the small brush, but it&#x27;s not a miracle tool.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other hairdryer except this one.</li>
            <li> (I need it in the front, I used one of my other Goody Ionic gel handle brushes.</li>
            <li> If using this product be careful!</li>
            <li> the brush in the other.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other hot air stylers, this one has vents at the base of the barrels, apparently designed to also blow air from the outside (in addition to the inside the barrel).  </li>
            <li> Does NOT heat up, as other reviews states.</li>
            <li> Will check out other brushes in a brick and mortar store to see about the size of the brush before ordering again.</li>
            <li> I let them soak then scrape through the bristles with a sharp comb.</li>
            <li> Can not find any other that works for my hair, like this one does.  </li>
            <li> I considered other brands/models but after reading not so favorable reviews decided to stick with the Revlon.</li>
            <li> The air blows around the brush,  not through it like other models.</li>
            <li> And it was 10 dollars cheaper than the other brand.</li>
            <li> also have NEVER had the overheating problem described by some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> Usually by the time I did the front and sides the back had dryed in an unflattering shape.</li>
            <li> It is also often difficult to hold because it gets so hot.</li>
            <li> It is hotter than other brands (conair), which is why I buy it  </li>
            <li> For my hair, the small one is too small and the big one is too big.</li>
            <li> but it just wasn&#x27;t giving me the results I wanted lately due to changes in my hair.</li>
            <li> and it usually takes me at least a half hour to get it dry with a normal hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> No more...with this little gem, I simply wind the hair around the brush and roll it up to my scalp, hold it for a few seconds then roll it out.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this.</li>
            <li> and I use mine daily on curly, coarse and very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I can thumb the switch easily to low or cold, or on or off, while rolling my hair up in it, straight drying, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can thumb the switch easily to low or cold, or on or off, while rolling my hair up in it, straight drying, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is very loud, the buttons are poorly located.  </li>
            <li> this is the second Revlon Hot Air Kit I&#x27;ve purchased and both have had the same problem where the dryer and curl attachments don&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; into the base unit.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is so hard to use, i have to actually use sharp tool to turn off and on.</li>
            <li> It looks like I may have to stop hating my limp, dry (and yet somehow oily?) hair!</li>
            <li> The handle is large and a bit difficult to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> I have recently cut this mess into a medium length bob because I was tired of being strangled by my hair in the middle of the night while I slept.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really thick and coarse and I usually have to use my flat iron to curl to my hair.  </li>
            <li> : I have to hold it from the plastic tip by my other hand so that it does not fall down, and every minute I have to bend down to the floor in order to pick up the plastic tip.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 3 stars because it is hard to turn on and off.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the intense heat has damaged my hair.</li>
            <li> The one I had the bristles burned due to the heat and was a mess.</li>
            <li> Only complaint about it.</li>
            <li> The brush is horrible and cheap, I had to constantly screw the brush back together</li>
            <li> I had it for at least 5 years, but when I moved out I left it for my mom who shared it with me.</li>
            <li> I have difficult hair which is not quite straight but not quite curly.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I have purchased others and they are not worth two cents.....</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair and blow drying is such a hassle.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the bristle brushes would get tangled in my thick hair (even the directions suggest only wrapping the hair twice).</li>
            <li> Low is slow blower with heat.  </li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t thick enough to grab your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick in the back, and I have thinned it out twice.  </li>
            <li> have long (halfway past the shoulders), thick Asian hair</li>
            <li> once I realized I just had to hold it more towards the heated end rather than the base where it needs to suck air.  </li>
            <li> For anyone with thick, coarse, curly hair like mine</li>
            <li> I bought my Revlon styler after being tired of having to blow dry my hair with a regular hair dryer, it would take ages.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have had no problem with the dryer shutting down from overuse.</li>
            <li> I can twrill the dryer and it lifts my hair in layers as I work my way down.  </li>
            <li> You would need a power converter which steps down the power from 220 to 110.  </li>
            <li> What it came down to was the bristles didnt grab my hair</li>
            <li> It tends to over heat and just shut down.</li>
            <li> Then one cannot use it until it cools down.</li>
            <li> I have put all my other styling tools away!</li>
            <li> No more struggling to get hair dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to blow dry my hair for the past 14 years.</li>
            <li> The small gives soft subtle curls.  </li>
            <li> This cuts my styling time down to a half hour.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even imagine struggling with the round brush in one hand and hair dryer in the other.  </li>
            <li> , you can&#x27;t turn off the ionizer, there is no cool down button</li>
            <li> I had a revlon Hot air dryer and Styler for 8 years before it finally broke :(</li>
            <li> The 1200 watt works just as well on slightly damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I am Black and have relaxed hair.  </li>
            <li> and also seems to have a less monsterous handle, because I do like the smoothing effect that I get from Revlon&#x27;s bristly barrels.    </li>
            <li> I had the Thermalaire previously and</li>
            <li> It also cuts my blow drying time in half.      </li>
            <li> Have had 2 of these previously.  </li>
            <li> It has cut the time it takes to do my hair in half because it curls &amp; styles as it dries .  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s less costly than buying a hair dryer</li>
            <li> It is 1500 watts compared to the typical 500-700 watts in stores.</li>
            <li> (I take one converter and 2 or 3 adapters when I travel), plus 2 of those plugs that turn one plug into 3 - off subject, I know.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair and have always dealt with some frizz</li>
            <li> It styled my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel as durable as the previous ones I&#x27;ve owned</li>
            <li> This product takes less time and makes my hair wavy and manageable.</li>
            <li> Unable to slide the button away from HIGH, I had to hurriedly unplug the cord.      </li>
            <li> I had to replace my second one because I mistakenly put the big styler on wrong and when I tried to take it off, the little lock snapped</li>
            <li> Its dangerous hot</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no problem for the piece of hair you&#x27;re trying to curl, but it messes up the sections of hair around it by blowing them around into a mess.  </li>
            <li> Maybe some day when I have a lot of time to mess with my hair, I&#x27;ll take another stab at it.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick and somewhat unruly hair and this works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> IT WILL NOT GIVE A TIGHT</li>
            <li> And the brush hardly stays in its place while I dry my hair</li>
            <li> found the brushs are to hard on hair get tanged on long human hair very  hard on hair</li>
            <li> I returned it after getting super frustrated with the product quality.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hands cramp from the handle being normal sized and it takes me about 40-45 minutes to round brush out my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 6 of the Revlon RV440C or equivalent Revlon products over the past 3 years and only one is working now.</li>
            <li> If I haven&#x27;t washed my hair that day, I just throw a little water on my hair to get the brush to set the curl.</li>
            <li> Blow little air.</li>
            <li> It is a loud, long, clumsy object that to me is useless.</li>
            <li> I guess the 1200W is a little overkill, but the barrel design also adds to the problem.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> With a little practice, no-one noticed the difference between one handed and two handed grooming.</li>
            <li> It tends to pull little hairs from the plastic end piece</li>
            <li> This product can give your hair as much or as little drama as you are looking for.  </li>
            <li> I do find myself using my hand to wrap the ends just where I want them - the bristles could be a little longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I like this little dryer.</li>
            <li> and all she uses is a little mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s casually styled, long, with heavy blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> I usually replace mine once every year to year and a half bcuz it will lose a bit of its power and the brush bristles will wear down</li>
            <li> so disappointed, this product would be rated a 5 because i used to have this product when i was back in high school</li>
            <li> Had curling brush for about a month , all ready giving trouble , cutting on and off ?</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Just a faster way to use a round brush with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a cool-shot button, so it overheats every few seconds and quits....</li>
            <li> This one is 2\\&quot; round, and held it bent under while I hair sprayed it into place.    </li>
            <li> I purchased this after someone recommended using this because I have trouble doing blow outs at home.  </li>
            <li> I have tried round brushes, blow dryers, comb dryers...</li>
            <li> Gives the convenience &amp; manageability of a round brush &amp;  dryer in one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Revlon dryer styler round brush for years.  </li>
            <li> no trying to juggle the round brush and separate hair dryer, and I can do it with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush, but no.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I still prefer my round brush and blow dryer to do my weekly blow-out.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t use a round brush and a blow dryer on myself to save my life</li>
            <li> So I should nit hae to waste time on returned items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using blow dryers and round brushes</li>
            <li> (I sometimes still straighten my hair afterwards because its to fluffy)</li>
            <li> On the hair it does grab, you will have split ends left behind.</li>
            <li> If you have Dominican hair Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product...</li>
            <li> I went to cosmotology school, didn&#x27;t finish, and I know how to round brush my hair at home.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these and both stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> Of course at the salon they use a round brush that creates all this volume and bounce...</li>
            <li> It literally take 5 minutes for my hair to be blow dried and styled in one step.</li>
            <li> I had this a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I recently took it on a business trip and while in my checked bag, it got broken.</li>
            <li> The brushes catch my thin hair just enough without tangling.  </li>
            <li> UGH what a waste of time.</li>
            <li> it reminds of a few years ago when those caruso steam curlers were in fashion (remember those?)</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that the round brush spinned while drying.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use ion-generating tools on my hair because they DESTROY my hair in a way that my hair must be cut off.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a few weeks and eventually the bristles started to bend.</li>
            <li> It does not smooth out well</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy thick hair which is terribly difficult to straighten.  </li>
            <li> and I usually turn it down before I am finished.  </li>
            <li> Silky and frizz less!</li>
            <li> This cuts time in half for me!</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> The heat setting is hot or cold no warm setting.</li>
            <li> This does the job but not easily.  </li>
            <li> The new one gives me the frizziest most horrible results so bad that even my flat iron cannot straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> : I had hand surgery last year which was not successful and as a result it is extremely difficult for me to use a brush and a regular hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the off/on slider switch is hard to move, hard to get a grip on it.  </li>
            <li> Second, the cord rotates so that it doesn&#x27;t get all twisted, as the previous one did, when you rotate the brush to style your hair.</li>
            <li> I am compelled to write my first review ever, because this product is so bad.</li>
            <li> Yes, the brushes click in and out and yes, they are very hot around the base after a few minutes use.  </li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to waste hours drying and fixing my hair.</li>
            <li> now I use the broken one to dry my eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I am no good with the blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other....</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it might be too heavy or loud as other reviewers complained about but not at all!</li>
            <li> This is a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> , I was not able to change the hair brush attachment without wrapping it in a towel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too lazy to return it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a blowdryer and a round brush in one!  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair, and for years had trouble trying to straighten it....</li>
            <li> you also need to be carefull with the brushes I accidently squished the small one (which was useless anyways) and put a dent in the big one.</li>
            <li> If I use a round brush, the type that is two pieces fitted together and glued with a wider handle, my hair is so thick that when I blow out my hair I can hear the brush cracking and trying to break.  </li>
            <li> You get two brushes, but the smaller one is useless for me and</li>
            <li> But the quality of the product is worse than ever expected-</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are no many alternative products with the same brush.</li>
            <li> Its not perfect, but I like it enough to keep</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t even go past my ears)</li>
            <li> I use it no more than once a week,</li>
            <li> and I hate sweating right after a shower while trying to fix my hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it dried my hair, but it was a styling failure.</li>
            <li> With the other two I learned the secret:</li>
            <li> I am desperate for it, as I am on the last little bit in the container.  </li>
            <li> The switch is sometimes difficult to move (flat ).  </li>
            <li> All tend to overheat and don&#x27;t last as long as regular dryers, but this one is the worst one I have owned.</li>
            <li> But I wonder how thin of hair you have to actually have to get it to not be completely frustrating.</li>
            <li> this time, revlon has re-designed the controls, making them flat and totally impossible to operate...there is NO WAY you can adjust the heat/cooling button w/o putting the styler down and adjusting with TWO hands..    </li>
            <li> Lastly, I have had horrible luck with hair dryers in the past, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how this dryer withstood years of travel and use.</li>
            <li> Plus, the air flow at the base of the brush goes out in all directions, completely undoing any previous styling efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the sliding button is just too hard to slide.  </li>
            <li> Hard with arthritis.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to handle because I dye it</li>
            <li> It is hard to use and not the one pictured in the photo.</li>
            <li> As a mater of fact I have had a hard time replacing the one I blew out in Europe.  </li>
            <li> I was having a hard time getting the lift by my roots with just a hairdryer and a brush.</li>
            <li> I have to take it out of my hair and sit it on my lap and press hard to change temperature.</li>
            <li> The button for the heat settings needs to be improved, hard to move.</li>
            <li> read other reviews on here that talked about this tool cutting the drying time in half--</li>
            <li> I previously  bought the Infinity Pro Rotating hot air brush by Conair and was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have read negative comments on this dryer saying the brushes do not stay attached.  </li>
            <li> I have used one almost every day for at least 5 or 7 years.  </li>
            <li> I have had no problems like the ones others have complained about.  </li>
            <li> and I just wanted to contradict some of the negative reviews it has gotten.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this contraption for, not kidding, at least 10 years, and it has never crapped out on me.</li>
            <li> tip for those who complained about overheating...</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this might still take a while.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, curly, unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> and I have naturally thick and frizzy hair and</li>
            <li> It dries hair slowly</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Now, as I try to run the brush through my hair, it begins to come away from the base, which makes the whole process problematic.  </li>
            <li> Brush could be stiffer and longer for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> it slow underneath and ontop of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick frizzy &amp; curly hair-</li>
            <li> I hated this right away but have continued to use it to try to learn to like it.  </li>
            <li> poor quality, not easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I mean within 10 seconds.  </li>
            <li> I mean you couldn&#x27;t even shut the switch off sometimes using two hands, or two thumbs!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> that I usually got frustrated and only used it for my bangs.  </li>
            <li> only issue I had with my previous one was the seam in the plastic where the brush head connected to the base used to snag my hair out from time to time</li>
            <li> It seriously cut my time in half!!!</li>
            <li> Revlon has some serious issues with this and should fix it.  </li>
            <li> I have been unable to master blow drying my hair with a round brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry I wasted my money on this product...</li>
            <li> I like it, but because I am not good with hair I struggle for some time until I get the results I want.  </li>
            <li> The power control button is very difficult to control with just my thumb and the attachments get so hot so quickly, it is impossible to touch them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite everything I&#x27;ve heard/read about the Ionic part supposedly cutting down on the frizz</li>
            <li> On this one, the off/on control switch is very hard operate.</li>
            <li> I looked down to see that the section of hair that I was drying had burnt off and fallen to the floor!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
            <li> The heat selector is a bit tough to push.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> It is a little louder on the cold shot but</li>
            <li> The second broke at the base where the cord split and</li>
            <li> It works, but I am not happy with the on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m OK...but certainly not a happy as I could be.....    </li>
            <li> It looked worse.  </li>
            <li> and I hate having to manipulate both a brush and a standard blow dryer simultaneously.</li>
            <li> Beware these brushes combs are made of plastic thin nubs.</li>
            <li> Not happy yet.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have really thin, sparse hair...</li>
            <li> The secret is using it correctly.  </li>
            <li> What it does poorly is curl.  </li>
            <li> It is a piece of junk made with poor quality parts.</li>
            <li> Not great quality.</li>
            <li> I have relatively thin hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my hair is too thick for it.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would solve my lack of coordination using a round brush and blow dryer because its an all-in-one device, boy was i wrong!</li>
            <li> RIDICULOUS and INACCESSIBLE!@</li>
            <li> Wished I could keep it, but even small curling barrel would not be awkward for me to use.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I have LOTS of thick curly hair with crazy body.</li>
            <li> Purchased two similar dryers, and hated them.</li>
            <li> The other problem is that there are \\&quot;vents\\&quot; at the base of each roller insert which blow out heat which does not filter into the brush attachments.  </li>
            <li> I have always hated to blow dry my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> The switch is insanely annoying, very difficult to manipulate/change temps while styling and for my standards it didn&#x27;t provide enough power to use the \\&quot;air flow</li>
            <li> The dryer breaks, without fail, once a month.</li>
            <li> this item, unfortunately, appeared a defect.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has some design defects that make it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Used to do hair &amp; this is a sad product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they would not send it</li>
            <li> even the medium heat can be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Now I need to order another \\&quot;spare\\&quot; as I never know when it is going to fail.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and bought another, unfortunately Revlon has since changed the product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t get bored and stop halfway through, the way I do when I have to blow it out and curl it.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m out $23, sadly.</li>
            <li> The mini barrel is useless.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the negative reviews this products has received.</li>
            <li> Frustrating!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to separate and wind hair on it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it stopped working after a month.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
            <li> Difficult to use for curling.</li>
            <li> When the cord would rotate around the base of the brush, there would be a blue spark in the base and it would randomly shut off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether my air styler is one flawed product out of a million, but, disappointingly, it has ceased to work well for me.</li>
            <li> Also, I like a button you can just press for a cold shot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at using a round brush to blow out my hair.</li>
            <li> One I had to return overheated to a dangerous point.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> By that I mean the the clip that holds the barrel onto the base broke, so the barrel won&#x27;t stay on the base.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> so maybe their stock is bad?</li>
            <li> The base not at all awkward for me to use in this manner</li>
            <li> I hate it, This product should be recall since it dangerous.</li>
            <li> It sucks!!!!</li>
            <li> and i am so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed with the brush contantly detaching when I don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference until the 5th sweep. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The process was very awkward,  The RV 440 C 1200 Watt</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;m growing my hair out, and it&#x27;s at the \\&quot;stupid flippy</li>
            <li> is to remove the attachment and to use the base as a blower.</li>
            <li> And I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since buying it!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer over a year ago and that dryer was terrible - even dangerous !</li>
            <li> , she used it for the vacation and HATED IT</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> This is the worst of the three and is going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> Worst ever!  </li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> am very unhappy with this!!!!!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Perhaps its only because I have thick African textured hair, it doesn&#x27;t grip my hair enough to get a straight blow dry, perhaps better suited to Caucasian hair. Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working very nice, My wife love it, she can cambing too softly, it&#x27;s very nice product. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Seems to overheat much faster than previous ones I&#x27;ve owned (same model). Crossing my fingers it lasts a reasonable amount of time. Works best on hair that is already 80% dry.</li>
            <li> my wife and my daugther loves this item ,they use it a lot and they like how it finish their hair</li>
            <li> I love this!  It&#x27;s the second one I have owned...bought another to leave at my winter home.  I have read negative comments on this dryer saying the brushes do not stay attached.  I think people just don&#x27;t know how to use it because it works perfectly for me.</li>
            <li> STILL LEARNING HOW TO USE IT! BUT LOVE IT SO FAR!</li>
            <li> Good air flow. But every time I try to pull the brush through my hair, it falls off. EVERY time! And my hair is not thick or curly. Very disappointed. I cannot use it and would never recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these of different brands, styles, features and prices and this one is by far the best. I owned one of these years ago and used it for years until it finally gave out. I replaced that one with a different brand. And then another and another but never got the same results. None of them ever had enough power to actually dry my hair. All of them touted fancy features and promised amazing results in the most easy to use design but they all ended up in my junk drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one has 1200 watts of power. That&#x27;s as much as a blow dryer because that&#x27;s how much you need to dry your hair! If I wanted to use two appliances to dry and style my hair I&#x27;d blow dry it and then use a curling iron or flat iron. The whole point of these things is to take out the extra step and make it all happen in one. If a blow iron can&#x27;t dry your hair you might as well be using a curling iron instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this one actually DOES do both. I just placed my order for this one and can&#x27;t wait to get it. It&#x27;s the exact same one I used to own and love except for the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had with my previous one was the seam in the plastic where the brush head connected to the base used to snag my hair out from time to time but I was able to fix that issue with a simple hair tie wrapped around to cover the seam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thick, curly, frizzy, stubborn, resistant or even soft fine delicate hair, I highly recommend this styler. It&#x27;s powerful enough for the toughest hair but with different heat settings it can be gentle enough for the most delicate baby hair. Use to fully dry and style or just to touch up, smooth and add extra body. Your hair will love it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hairdryer to replace the exact same model that had just worn out after several years of use. It is a perfect shape and size and easy to control. Hot and cold air is just the right velosity for styling with a brush and I like the ionic feature. I do not use the brush attachments that are included. I have tried other hairdryers and always go back to this one, I am thinking of buying another to keep as a spare.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT IS VERY EASY TO HANDLE.  iT DOES A WONDERFUL JOB OF DRYING.  The styler brushes are the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  I was a Beautician for 18 years and this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I had to replace the same dryer as this because I dropped and broke the one I had.  Amazon and Target were the only 2 places I could find to order.  Naturally I chose Amazon because the item qualified for free shipping.  I love this dryer. I have been using for over 5 years and would not want to have to use another dryer.</li>
            <li> I really love this styler. I use it as a blow dryer to dry my hair. I absolutely love the ionic feature, which leaves my hair really soft and shiny. My only problem with hot air brush was that the high heat setting wouldn&#x27;t work for two months. I was about to throw it away and then I decided to try it again and it has been working fine ever since.</li>
            <li> If only I could operate the button, I could make my hair look really good with the RV440.  The barrel is nice and fat, and the bristles hold the hair just enough without tangling.  For a few seconds I could see the potential for fat, smooth waves.      But the sliding button is just too hard to slide.  The button has four settings: OFF-COOL-LOW-HIGH.  It&#x27;s just possible to slide it from OFF to HIGH, but not HIGH to OFF, or any setting in between.  And it gets too hot on HIGH.      My first and last time to use it, I had done a section of hair on HIGH for about three seconds and it got so hot it was burning my scalp.  Unable to slide the button away from HIGH, I had to hurriedly unplug the cord.      What a shame to put such a POORLY DESIGNED BUTTON on an otherwise good styler. In all fairness, the unusable button and too-high heat on HIGH were the only problems I had. I did not have the other problems that other 1-star reviews cited.</li>
            <li> Bought this dryer at a local drugstore. Loved it because it dries very quickly into a smooth, slightly curled style.  Have always been a bit wary of it tho, because it gets very very hot...too hot to touch. But I dealt with that because I like the way my hair turns out with it. BUT THEN, today when I was drying my hair as I always do, I smelled burning hair. I looked down to see that the section of hair that I was drying had burnt off and fallen to the floor!!!!  It was about 4 inches long.  Just a small section in my longish hair, at the nape of my neck, but WOW.  I threw the dryer right into the garbage. BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I loved the product this replaced but when the attachment lock broke on the old model I needed to buy the new one. This is a complete disappointment. The handle is much larger and harder to hold. The power control button is very difficult to control with just my thumb and the attachments get so hot so quickly, it is impossible to touch them. Plus, the air coming out of the attachments is so hot, you can&#x27;t hold it close to your scalp for very long so that the curling iron effect is lost.     I&#x27;d love to see Revlon bring back the old design. It was perfect and needed no tweaking.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thought the older version was a little more effective, but for the cost, it&#x27;s a good buy and works well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to get curls and waves that stay. Much better than a curling iron. I have short/medium length hair that I flip under and the curls really last. I use the high heat for 10 seconds, then the cool to set the curl. I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair that long as this drys my hair and curls it at the same time. If I haven&#x27;t washed my hair that day, I just throw a little water on my hair to get the brush to set the curl. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this for quickly styling my fine hair, especially for traveling.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read that a hair dryer could leave hair more shiny, but it&#x27;s true! It is very easy to use, and it only takes minutes to dry my relatively short hair. Definitely no longer than a regular hair dryer. I bought it because I&#x27;m growing my hair out, and it&#x27;s at the \\&quot;stupid flippy stage\\&quot; as I call it. It helps in that area a lot, and it gives my hair body it doesn&#x27;t normally have.  I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> This product is very good in design with three heads.  Small enough and easy to handle, I like it very much!</li>
            <li> This product stopped working after I used it 4 times.  The iron got too hot and overheated.  Before it overheated it did work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00022WA9K/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> This product has enough power for a quick dry and great body. It is so easy to use and sure beats the two-handed styling with a regular blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these recently and have not been at all happy with it.  It gets extremely hot to the point of burning    your hair.  The brush frequently falls off because it doesn&#x27;t connect well, and burns your fingers when you try to catch it.  Finally, the blowing mechanism is strong and keeps your hair from wanting to curl around the brush.  I would skip this one...it is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous!!  Saves me a ton of time - and pain: I had hand surgery last year which was not successful and as a result it is extremely difficult for me to use a brush and a regular hairdryer.  I&#x27;m absolutely delighted and if/when it wears out I&#x27;ll be looking to Amazon to buy another one (just over the border from Canada is Buffalo NY so it&#x27;s nice and close for me to pop over and pick it up at the postal stn!)</li>
            <li> poor quality, not easy to use. Blow little air.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have tried similar ones &amp; most of them overheat &amp; burn out. This one gives you the option of small curls or a smooth look. And the dryer is just an added plus! The brush helps your hair stay curled around it. It just the best. Thanks</li>
            <li> I found this product to be inferior. This product was so loud that I resorted to wearing earplugs for the first few times I used it. Also the barrel was so hot that I couldn&#x27;t use it. I would never suggest this anyone purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target since it was on sale for $16.99.  I bought this to replace the one I currently owned which was a Wahl brand that had overheated on me.  Well, I opened it today and it worked ok.  It dried my hair and styled it at the same time like it claims it will.  The only thing is that it was so loud I had to wear ear plugs while I was using it.  It sounded like a leaf blower blowing in my ears.  It was, by far, the loudest blow dryer I have ever heard.  On low, it was tolerable but it would have taken me an hour to dry my hair.  I am going to return it tomorrow and look for another one.  I would not recommend this is you value your hearing.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target after seeing such high stars for this product.    Works great, but it is ridiculous how loud the dryer is.  I have to wear EAR PLUGS just to use this product!! Otherwise, after drying my hair, I can&#x27;t hear anyone who talks to me.     Definitely Revlon&#x27;s product designers and engineers need to rethink this.  I am planning on tossing this in the trash soon b/c it&#x27;s just too onerous.</li>
            <li> Dries fast and makes my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> My wife already owns this hair dryer. She has had it for many years and loves the way it works with the attachments. As with all electronic/electrical devices it is getting old so I thought I would surprise her with a replacement. She loves the new one and claims it has more power then the old one ever had. Since she is pleased then so am I. \\&quot;If the woman of the house isn&#x27;t happy then no one in the house is Happy!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I purchased this product 5/24/10 to replace the older model which died only 6 months after I bought it.  I plugged in the dryer and instantly sparks and smoke started coming out of the swivel area where the cord connects.  Beware!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I recently went from hip length hair to a short almost bob cut &amp; I cannot hold a round brush &amp; dry at the same time.  This duet saved me.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I just got a new shorter haircut and this is perfect for me. I have very fine, thin hair and this dryer gives me body and fullness. Love It.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace one just like it I had had for years that finally wore out.  This one, however, I can&#x27;t keep the brushes on long enough to even dry my bangs.  Luckily I can use the dryer with an unattached styling brush to dry the rest of my hair.  It was exactly what I wanted but doesn&#x27;t work right.</li>
            <li> Had curling brush for about a month , all ready giving trouble , cutting on and off ? Although it is being replaced , hope new one will last awhile .</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this dryer/styler for several years - it has to be replaced every year or so which is fine...this time, revlon has re-designed the controls, making them flat and totally impossible to operate...there is NO WAY you can adjust the heat/cooling button w/o putting the styler down and adjusting with TWO hands..    i used it twice and threw it in the trash - it is absolutely a disaster and i am so disappointed.  this had been a hair saver for me - quick, efficient and effective...    DO NOT even think of buying this product with the flat controls.  Revlon obviously didn&#x27;t conduct any consumer testing.</li>
            <li> Love this! So much easier to style my hair. Probably not enough power for someone with thick full hair but otherwise it&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many of these styling dryers over the years, and this one is the most powerful by far. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, but it dries hair fast and it appears to be a sturdy product.</li>
            <li> I had a revlon Hot air dryer and Styler for 8 years before it finally broke :( but I&#x27;m SO SO glad I was able to find one here on Amazon...My hair was completely jacked up until I got it in the mail haha. Best Styler EVER!!!</li>
            <li> The on/off switch is so hard to use, i have to actually use sharp tool to turn off and on. Very cheaply made.  The device quit working a month after purchase, just outside the return window.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, so you don&#x27;t have to hold a blow dryer in one hand, and a round brush in the other. What I didn&#x27;t like was that this was extremely loud, even at the low setting. Especially when you&#x27;re styling next to your ear. It&#x27;s most helpful to section off your hair when you use this. If you have thick hair, this might still take a while.</li>
            <li> I love this item....I use my regular hair dryer to mostly dry my hair and then I use this to smooth and style my hair.  It takes frizz out and really smooths my hair.  I tried another Revlon style but I didn&#x27;t like it, it didn&#x27;t have the Ionic feature, that&#x27;s the only difference I saw, so that must be what makes the difference.  I am buying a 2nd one to have at our lake house, don&#x27;t want to be without one.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have been using and recommending this hair drier for years and have owned 3. It works on short or long hair, but with longish hair there can be a tendancy for it to cut out. This happens when the hair is wrapped around the styler(or whatever it is called) for a long time-- I guess the thing can&#x27;t \\&quot;breathe\\&quot; and over heats, so you have to wait a minute and push the reset button. hen it clicks, you are good to go again. I had one that did that alot and finally died. With the other two I learned the secret: don&#x27;t hold the styler still for long--keep wrapping and rewrapping and pulling thru, and it&#x27;ll work fine. I had to replace my second one because I mistakenly put the big styler on wrong and when I tried to take it off, the little lock snapped and I can&#x27;t use that styler. But I love the way it dries my hair--soooo much easier than the gun-type dryer used with a round brush-what a pain! If you wear your hair straightish or sorta puffy or turned under it is great. I wish it had duel voltage so I could use it overseas. I finally found one sort of like it in Italy, so I am covered for Europe--tho it is not as powerful.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light weight, effective the only reason its not 5 stars is because it is very loud</li>
            <li> This item no longer works on medium heat.  The cool and the very hot still work, but it&#x27;s the medium that I used the most.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> The first 2 that I owned,  each lasted more than a couple of years; almost daily use on coarse, long (past below bra strap), not so straight hair. After the second one broke, I went back to the retail store and I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one on the shelves!!! I was so looking forward to buying it a third time. I think I got my money&#x27;s worth for each one. I did purchase a third, similar, Revlon RVTH500 Tourmaline Heat 1500W Hot Air Styler w/ Nano Ceramic, it works great. It&#x27;s definitely not the same, but it does what I need it for. I haven&#x27;t used it as much as the previous two, because I&#x27;ve been keeping my hair shorter.</li>
            <li> So much easier than using a hair dryer!! Does a pretty descent job at drying your hair without causing frizzies! Doesn&#x27;t quite straighten your hair, keeps it a bit wavy so if really straight is what you desire you&#x27;re going to have to use a straightener. Definately worth it tho. I have thick curly/wavy hair and blow drying is such a hassle. This is quick and easy. Defnite GREAT buy.</li>
            <li> This product has the power I need to do the job.  Have tried some with fewer watts, and they don&#x27;t do the job at all.  I can even use this as a hairdryer, so there are fewer appliances to worry about.  My only complaint is that the off/on slider switch is hard to move, hard to get a grip on it.  The notches should be larger.    I could not find it in my local stores, so was so happy to see it on Amazon, at a good price.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best hair dryer I have ever owned. No more needing a third hand trying to style my hair with a round brush and regular hair dryer. My hair is smooth, sleek and shiny without having to add any smoothing products. My hair looks amazing! This is my second, the first survived more than 4 years of daily use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my third Revlon hair dryer, same model, in several years. My first broke in Italy eventhough I used a converter (do not use converters with it, it says so on the instructions booklet, but I had neglected to read it). The second broke at the base where the cord split and the wire became exposed. I do like the dryer though, I have tried others and they did not compare. It dries my hair very quickly and styles it at the same time. I have short curly hair and the dryer smoothes it out and makes it nice and wavy.</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an old unit I had for 10 years.  It does just what it is supposed to do.  It is a little louder on the cold shot but that is to be expected.  I laugh at whoever gets it stuck in their hair.  Do you not know how to use this?  The large barrel gives great body and wave.  The small gives soft subtle curls.  My hair turns out soft and styled</li>
            <li> My previous method of hair styling was to either put my wet hair into a high bun, or to let my hair air dry and then straighten it with a flat iron. Now I use this tool to blow dry my hair and the results are so much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never been coordinated enough for the two handed brush-blower method, so this product is perfect for me. My hair feels so healthy and I don&#x27;t have nearly as many split ends as my flat iron created. My hair has volume and is shiny, plus my hair still looks great the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I have to save you time is to remove the attachment and to use the base as a blower. I will do a crude 5 minute dry with my fingers and the blower, mostly concentrating on the roots, and then I will style the rest of my hair. The base not at all awkward for me to use in this manner and it saves me a ton of time.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this thing.  I&#x27;m not good at doing my own hair, but this thing makes me look good.  Ten minutes of brushing with it when I get out of the shower, a couple of curls around it once or twice--and bam! I&#x27;m done with a sleek bob.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this for my hair.  I have used one almost every day for at least 5 or 7 years.  I love how my hair comes out... perfect and smooth &amp;#34;bob.&amp;#34;  The right amount of heat and blow from the dryer inside.  This is a terrific product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my gym bag looking for a quicker way to style my short flip hairdo. For me this is a styling tool, and not a replacement for a standard blow dryer. I still think it&#x27;s faster to use a dryer to get the water out, then use this when it&#x27;s damp. I&#x27;ll also spritz my hair with water and use it to touch up my hair if I don&#x27;t want to wash it every day. I like it a lot, especially the small brush, but it&#x27;s not a miracle tool. Just a faster way to use a round brush with a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I really like this! It has helped me cut down on styling time and my hair looks great.My hair is fine and somewhat wavy, the brushes hold the hair well, unlike curling irons where the hair slips off of the rod. I have not had any problems with hair getting caught or tangled in the brushes, it is lightweight and I like the fact that I can use it as just a blow dryer, if I choose.This hair appliance also has plenty of drying power. It has 2 brushes and a directional air flow nozzle, should you choose to just blow dry. For the price, it can&#x27;t be beat for a name brand product.</li>
            <li> This is a welcome return of the first  handheld dryers which had a clip on attached brush (Claudio, I think. I used mine until it died and have missed it since). I have balance challenges and can&#x27;t seem to manage the brush and heavier dryers and cord all tangling up. This leaves a hand free. I was concerned that the bristle brushes would get tangled in my thick hair (even the directions suggest only wrapping the hair twice). Doesn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. This nifty gizmo sure does speed up drying and styling and getting out in the morning. It has all you need with the included infused. The one thing I would add is a smaller bristle attachment for finishing the shorter hair at the bottom. And of course I took the advice of other reviewers and kept to low heat and air settings. The large brush attachment is great for lift. The smaller good for definition.  Best of all this travels well and compactly.</li>
            <li> I find this the best hairdryer for my hair! It gives me the look I like &amp; is so easy to use.  I don&#x27;t use any other hairdryer except this one.</li>
            <li> I had to return this because the handle is so big that I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I have medium size hands and it was just too large and hard to handle.My hair is short and the brushes were too big.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very pleased using hot air brushes for perhaps 15 years. It takes some practice to start with. I&#x27;m very fortunate to have hair that people frequently compliment. It&#x27;s casually styled, long, with heavy blonde highlights. My hair is naturally curly/wavy...and getting more, platinum, shall we say, by the hour.   This is the very first hot airbrush that has not offered the option to turn off the ionic treatment. What I&#x27;ve found is that if I&#x27;m using high heat for any length of time, the barrel gets as hot as a curling iron. The low setting is too low to dry my hair. This is the first of these products that I&#x27;ve really had a problem with. Unfortunately, the intense heat has damaged my hair. Sure would love to have the 1200 watts with no ions!!!   As others have mentioned in reviewing products of this type, the become inoperable in a relatively short period of time. As they are generally inexpensive, I&#x27;ve made it a habit to keep a new one in reserve. More than likely, its just a fuse that blows but I&#x27;m just not going to take the time to figure that out.   Revlon...just in case your listening...bring back the button that turns off the ions!!!  Thanks,  Susan  Update 10/13/11  I purchased a newer dryer that is lower wattage. It also allows for lowering the amount of ionization. This has made a huge difference in the condition of my hair. My stylist was really concerned by how dry my hair had become. This week she commented on how much healthier my hair seemed after using the new dryer just two months. This is truly a dramatic difference. Someone with very thick coarse hair may do very well with this dryer, however if you have color treated average hair, you may experience the same problems I have.</li>
            <li> I had previously owned an older version of this hair dryer/styler and loved it. After years of using it, it finally gave out. So I replaced it with this newer model.  I like it just the same!  I have been letting my hair grow (without even a trimming) for months now and my hair was starting to show no style and frizz, but simply drying my hair with this hair dryer/styler, resulted in great body and no more frizz!!! I like that I can even style my hair when hair is dry.</li>
            <li> As described and delivered fast.  Has three heat settings and does what it&#x27;s suppposed to do.  This styler dries and smoothes my shortish and very fine hair quickly; doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume but does eliminate frizzies and makes it look shinier than usual. Even on low heat the barrel gets pretty hot, so I haven&#x27;t needed to use the high heat setting.  For more volume I still use my hair blower and a brush, but I&#x27;d recommend this product for people who don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time on their hair.    **Came back to say that after about a year of using this an average of twice a week, the little prongs that hold the brush onto the unit broke so the brush would not stay attached.   I duct-taped it together (!) and it still works, but I recently bought a new one at a local store for around the same price the old one was. I see they&#x27;ve changed the attachment part, so maybe I wasn&#x27;t the only one who had an issue.</li>
            <li> I have bought this for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Pros are that the power is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the air is very hot even at lowest position, attachment is not that handy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using one of these for years.  Couldn&#x27;t be without it.  I have thick curly hair which I blow mostly dry, then use the larger brush to smooth out my hair and curl it.  Takes me about 10 minutes.  The first one I bought was the 1800 watt, and that thing is too hot.  Burns my ears and head.  The 1200 watt works just as well on slightly damp hair.  I&#x27;ve never been able to master the art of using a curling iron, so this tool is the best for me.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  Styles my hair nicely.  My hair is a short pixie, but my bangs are long enough for the large brush and the smaller one is good for the top.  My hair is white and given to frizziness and out of control curl, but it is thin and baby fine.  The tourmaline smooths and volumizes without frizz.  Yes, the brushes click in and out and yes, they are very hot around the base after a few minutes use.  I just grab my hand towel to use as a &amp;#34;pot holder&amp;#34; to change brushes.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost daily on my hair (long and thick hair) absolutely love it. I was worried when I purchased this as I was replacing a similar product that no longer was in production. This item works 100% better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Even on low, this item got far too hot and fried my hair. I had to return it and purchased a different brand and style of hot air curler. It&#x27;s possible that I received a defective unit, but I also was displeased with the large amount of exposed metal, making it much easier to burn yourself while using it.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the greatest dryer and styler!  The long bristles hold my hair against the aluminum barrel perfectly while drying.  Used along with a foaming mousse, it feels like I have twice as much hair.  Fifteen minutes and I have terrific-looking sleek and shiny hair.   I don&#x27;t use the small brush because it gives me too much curl, so it&#x27;s been put away since day one.  Wish it hadn&#x27;t come with the kit, I might have saved even more money... :-)  I have never had it stop working on me.  Maybe because I&#x27;m constantly pulling the brush out to the ends of my hair and then rolling up again, and it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to overheat.</li>
            <li> this works very well.  It cuts blow dry time in half</li>
            <li> This product works really well, because you don&#x27;t have to hold a brush and hair dryer at the same time. For myself, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Worked absolutely great with my frizzy hair. Creates volume and waves. Very easy to use for great results. Can&#x27;t be used on the highest level because it overheats easily. It created light smoke one time when I used it for too long - my fire alarm went off. I kept using it on low for almost another year but eventually all the dust got caught in the back which can&#x27;t be cleaned and a flame shot out.   I love this hairdryer but it has to be replaced after a few months otherwise it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Target over a year ago.  I have fairly fine straight hair in a medium length \\&quot;bob\\&quot; type hairstyle.  I dry my hair using the largest brush on the lowest heat setting; only occasionally do I use the highest setting.  It works great to give my hair style with some volume.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement to the one I had that died.  It works, but I am not happy with the on/off switch.  They saved a fraction of a cent by making it flat with LITTLE ridges to use to slide it.  Need two hands to turn it on.  The old version had a bigger ridge, that actually slid with one finger.  Hard with arthritis.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  I have always hated to blow dry my frizzy hair and I can&#x27;t get the hang of two hand hair dryer+round brush.  This was a perfect combination.  It does get hot really fast but I think that helps with the smoothing effect.  And I get a nice soft wave or even a lot straighter than just regular blow drying.  Sometimes I use a flat iron after I use this but 99% of the time this is all I need.  I pair it with a heat protected/shine spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And great price here!!!  I think I paid $30 for it at Target.</li>
            <li> This dryer gets too hot when drying with the barrels and there is not a quick release for you hair, only for changing the attachment.  I would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I bought this item at Target (same price) because I wanted to straighten and style my hair in the same step.  Looked like a good buy, but wasn&#x27;t.  I returned it after getting super frustrated with the product quality.  It doesn&#x27;t have a cool-shot button, so it overheats every few seconds and quits....wait for it to cool and it turns on again, speed up the process by taking off the attachment and blowing into it....huge hastle.  I never did get my hair all the way dry with this product.  The product I swapped it for was a Conair double ionic port dryer, with a cool shot button, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Updating this review.  After three years of almost daily use, a piece that holds the brush broke.  It&#x27;s been my favorite hair dryer and I&#x27;m thrilled to be able to buy the same dryer again.  I&#x27;m buying another one, because my daughter broke the first one.  This is a great little dryer with the most watts for your buck.  I&#x27;ve had other barrel-type hair dryers and this one is the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have not-too-thick VERY curly hair, and this hot brush (I only use the largest attachment, and just throw away the smaller and the blow dryer) gets my hair from soaking wet and frizzy to dry, sleek, and gorgeous in under 10 minutes. It&#x27;s a godsend, especially when coupled with Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s \\&quot;straight\\&quot; straightening gel. When it&#x27;s working, it&#x27;s phenomenal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUT. This is a big but. The dryer breaks, without fail, once a month. I don&#x27;t know if it overheats or it shorts out or it just falls apart, but I&#x27;ll get out of the shower one day (inevitably a day when I really desperately need my hair to look good) and the darn thing just won&#x27;t turn on. So it&#x27;s off to Walgreens or Kmart or another drugstore to buy a new one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;At a price ranging from $15 to $25, it&#x27;s cheaper to buy one of these a month than to get my hair professionally blown out every few days. But it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;m happy doing. I eventually gave in and bought a $65 version by a brand I don&#x27;t remember the name of (BaBy[something]). Instead of having a detachable head (another flaw with the Revlon: the head comes loose, especially if you are slightly aggressive with your straightening), it&#x27;s all one piece, the handle is thinner, and the bristles aren&#x27;t that sharp plastic - they&#x27;re faux-boar bristles, so your hair is shinier. It takes longer for me to dry my hair with this new one, but the added 5 minutes is worth it for not having to spend $200 a year buying new blow dryers!</li>
            <li> this item, unfortunately, appeared a defect. Even following all the instructions, like test and reset buttons etc., the second time I used it, it started smoking and then burnt out. I&#x27;m very upset. I consider paying for it as a loss of money.</li>
            <li> Not one of the best brushes I&#x27;ve purchased.  Disappointed with the brush contantly detaching when I don&#x27;t want it to.</li>
            <li> Dry and style all at once.  High power, several settings, very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This styler seemed great out of the package, and it works well at drying hair. However, it RIPS OUT MY HAIR! Where the metal brush and plastic end meet, my hair gets caught and torn out of my scalp! This is an obvious design flaw, and although I try my best to keep my hair out of the crevice, at least once each time I style my hair, it gets caught in the end and rips out of my head. It also gets caught where the metal brush meets the handle, but not as often as the crevice on the end. The last time I used it this happened four times, so I am returning it!!</li>
            <li> I bought one and used it yesterday for the first time. First of all it is totally unwieldly.  It is way too long and cumbersome. It absolutly will not curl my baby fine, thin hair. The bristles just dont grab my hair to turn it under.  It is a loud, long, clumsy object that to me is useless. I can get much better drying results with my regular hair dryer and a good brush.    I am returning it and have ordered a Helen Of Troy Brush Iron 1-1/2\\&quot; Mega Barrel.  It is not a dryer, just a hot brush which is also 1 1/2 around. It has a much shorter handle and simply grabs the hair to turn it under. I am told it will grab my baby fine, thin hair.     For years I used a hair dryer with a brush and on special occasions, when I wanted more fullness and style, I used a Braun, Butane Gas Curling Brush that is no longer made.    I have a new hairstyle that requires a better bend than I get from my Braun, which is why I thought I would try a Dryer/Styler Brush instead, but it just is a lot more work and the results are bad.  I prefer my 1600 watt regular blow dryer and my Goody Ionic Gel Handled brush (which has a great grip and adds ions to my hair) and hope that the new Helen of Troy will work for me.    If not, I will go back to my Braun or do what I did yesterday.  After my hair was dry, but not bent under where (I need it in the front, I used one of my other Goody Ionic gel handle brushes. This one is 2\\&quot; round, and held it bent under while I hair sprayed it into place.    Maybe if you have different kind of hair, and longer arms, you will love it. I sure didn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I have long, baby fine hair.  I love the High/Cool setting that allows me to style at will with out burning/melting my hair like most blow dryers and curling irons tend to do on high.  I usually have to opt for low and take 3 x as long to do my hair.  The Cool/High setting on this model is just warm enough to dry and curl quickly without damaging my hair.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has some design defects that make it difficult to use.  The control buttons for on off and temperature are located on the handle right under the spring loaded clamp.  I have shut it off inadvertently and also changed the temperature by accident.  It is frustrating when I am in a hurry as I constantly have to revue the setting to make sure they are where they have to be for optimal use.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! The attachments will not stay on.  They keep popping off while I am using it.  I have since bought a Chi Flat Iron and LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last month at Target, I needed a way to straighten, and curl my hair because I have shoulder problems, so it hurts to hold up a round brush and hair dryer.  The product is very loud, the buttons are poorly located.  It also gets very hot to hang on to.  The concept is great, but mine has already cracked at the base where the brush attaches, that wasn&#x27;t sturdy at all, it only attached at the front and I was forever hitting that release button and having the brush fall off!  I tried to find a Revlon website to contact the company, but all I can find is the makeup part of the company. Do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace a prior product. If you order it, then GOOD LUCK getting into the package. It is the most frustratingly packaged product you will ever find.  RIDICULOUS and INACCESSIBLE!@</li>
            <li> found the brushs are to hard on hair get tanged on long human hair very  hard on hair but  i love it for dog grooming the cool setting is great would buy again light weight easy on the hands and fingers it my best groom dryer at least for now do now use brushes at all husband used it to dru paint on wood workimg low heat we do not want to cook are pets</li>
            <li> Great buy!!  Satisfied</li>
            <li> I just got this and have only used it once, but I LOVE it! It looks like I may have to stop hating my limp, dry (and yet somehow oily?) hair!</li>
            <li> This is probably my 4th one since 2008. I CAN&#x27;T live without this product. This is how you get a salon-style blow out at home. Revlon - please never stop making this product.</li>
            <li> The brushes will not stay attached while blowing drying your hair</li>
            <li> This is the second revlon styler I have owned.  I loved the first one, so when I dropped and broke the first one I had to get another.   The button is alittle more stiff on the new one but otherwise it is great.  I alternate between cold and hot to set the style and also it doesn&#x27;t overheat.  Works for me!  And the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have been unable to master blow drying my hair with a round brush so I tried this out of desperation. I LOVE it! It gives the same results but is WAY easier because you are only using 1 tool instead of 2 :) LOVE it! Thanks Revlon!</li>
            <li> While I have purchased several hot air dryers from Revlon over the years, the one I received didn&#x27;t work properly. I typically go through a new one about every 2-4 years, so I expected similar long-lasting quality from this product. However, when I tried to use it, the power would come and go. It never worked properly. About a month after I got it, I contacted customer service, and in all fairness, the company did give me authorization to ship the product back for a replacement. It&#x27;s just a hassle to send it back, and now I&#x27;m out of a hot air dryer until I get a replacement.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight and very thick and very long.  This hairdryer works for my hair once it&#x27;s about half dry.  I was disappointed that it wouldn&#x27;t really curl my hair, but it does fluff it, and untangle it nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair free of static electricity, but that&#x27;s to be expected in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> I was given this product as a gift. I have been drying my hair for 20 years and know how to operate a hair dryer. I used this on the low setting and still it became so hot, I was not able to change the hair brush attachment without wrapping it in a towel. When I was finished drying my hair I looked in the mirror and realized it had burned off a good section (about 1 inch by 1 inch) of my hair in the back of my head. I was left with little stubbles of hair. I called revlon and was advised that they don&#x27;t manufacture this hair dryer, the company Helen of Troy does and they use the Revlon name. If using this product be careful! I don&#x27;t want anyone else to lose their hair. I&#x27;m only giving this product one star because I can&#x27;t give it no stars.</li>
            <li> I actually owned one of these and the bristles on it were cheaply made.  When ordering this one it looked like it was made better, but on arrival, I could see that the bristles on this were just as thin and cheap plastic.  The one I had the bristles burned due to the heat and was a mess. I payed $9.97 for mine when I lived in CA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lookes nice and works for a while, but it ended up in the trash within 8 mths of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after someone recommended using this because I have trouble doing blow outs at home.  I can&#x27;t seem to work the blow dryer in one hand and the brush in the other.  I have to say my hair comes out really nice with this.  It&#x27;s easy to work and has multiple heat settings - the high setting gets really hot.  I&#x27;ve only used the brush attachments because I am trying to copy the blow out look I get from the salons.  The attachments work great and I have no problem with them coming out.  I do not use this on damp or wet hair.  I am Black and have relaxed hair.  After I wash and condition my hair, I go under a hooded dryer (on a low-med setting) with rollers.  After my hair is dry, I take out the rollers and use this to blow out the curls.  This makes it really easy to style my hair and get that blow out look after I wash my hair.  Also, Amazon has the best price!</li>
            <li> First of all, let&#x27;s talk about the noise level on this thing.  YIKES!  That should be against some kind of consumer protection law. The blowdryer part is ok, but didn&#x27;t like the brushes at all.  I&#x27;ll go back to my Conair stying brush and my straightener. &lt;br /&gt;Live and learn.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful.  I have hair that will not hold curl with a curling iron, and can not use hair spray.  This Brush worked wonders for me and the first time I used it someone stopped me and said I had been to a hair salon. I said, no, I used my new Ionic hot air brush.  I can&#x27;t express how pleased I am with this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> The only one with air brush. So this one is the best, but it is nothing to compare with, working just fine for last 4 month.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer. I have used it more without the brushes on it to get the wetness out of my hair at the roots.  The brushes are not meant to dry the roots.  It takes some getting used to. It does work as advertised.  I strongly suggest using the cool blast until the hair is cooled before you remove the hair from the brush after it has been curled.. It definitely makes for better flips, curls, waves. It is cumbersome when doing the left side of my hair. I am right handed.  But, that is just my lack of coordination. If you are looking to purchase a hot air dryer with brushes, I would make sure you get one with the cool setting, to set the curls, like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not get as much curl, wave or flip as my hairdresser does using a separate hair dryer and a large round brush. But, it does an adequate job.  Others may be more coordinated and be able to get better hair styling using this brush dryer. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for the quality of this product. It makes drain my thick curly hair easy and manageable I would recommend this to your friend and I would buy this again if I ever had to in the future if I had to .</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. I have fine, frizzy hair that is slightly wavy, and have used these type of stylers to eliminate the frizz and perfectly straighten my hair. I&#x27;ve always had good luck with these in accomplishing silky smooth hair with just enough volume, but this one was terrible. I think there was just way too much air power, as it only blew my hair around as I was trying to use the brush. In the end my hair was still frizzy, without the shine, and had WAY too much volume.  Maybe it works better for those with really thick hair, but I don&#x27;t recommend this for anyone who has fine, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be more of a blower than a styler.  I guess the 1200W is a little overkill, but the barrel design also adds to the problem.  Unlike other hot air stylers, this one has vents at the base of the barrels, apparently designed to also blow air from the outside (in addition to the inside the barrel).  This is especially a problem with the smaller attachment, because its vents are larger.  I use the smaller barrel to style my bangs, but the air from the vents blows my fine bangs all over the place as I try to latch onto them with the bristles of the barrel.  Maybe this works well if you have long, thick hair, and you are trying to use this to dry your wet hair quickly.  But this doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I&#x27;ll try the [[ASIN:B000PXYAL2 Revlon RV444 Hot Air Styler and Dryer with Ceramic]], which doesn&#x27;t seem to have these unwanted vents, and also seems to have a less monsterous handle, because I do like the smoothing effect that I get from Revlon&#x27;s bristly barrels.    A few more notes about Amazon&#x27;s description of this product:    1. They specify 3 speed settings and 3 heat settings, but this isn&#x27;t true.  There are 3 settings... Period.  Low, High, and cool.  Low is slow blower with heat.  High is fast blower with heat. Cool is fast blower with no heat (and if you want to use low heat, followed by a \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot;, you have to cycle through a high power blast of heat first).    2.  I really don&#x27;t know what the purpose is of the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; feature.  For some reason, it&#x27;s an option, with an associated button and LED that you have to push each time if you want to use it.  Sounds like marketing hype if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Target after seeing my sister using a similar type of hot air brush. I had never seen one before but knew instantly I needed to try one. I chose this one because Target had limited options and this one came with two sizes of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine shoulder length hair. The directions suggested I use the smaller size brush. I dry my hair with my normal hair dryer until it is just little damp, about 80% dry. (I know I could use the attachment for drying but I don&#x27;t want to burn the thing out by using it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed for a long time. Plus changing attachments was more difficult than it should be. Mine doesn&#x27;t pull apart easily.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I comb the tangles out and add a heat protector cream and then use the Hot Air Dryer. I first part my hair into six sections then I finish drying it on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; speed and then curl the ends  by starting out at \\&quot;low\\&quot;. I then blast it on \\&quot;high\\&quot; for a couple seconds and then blast it with \\&quot;cool\\&quot; for a couple seconds. I turn it off before letting the curl out. This works really well and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite everything I&#x27;ve heard/read about the Ionic part supposedly cutting down on the frizz I have not found that to be true compared to my regular hair dryer. I just use coconut oil to smooth the fly-aways after I am done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the longevity of this product, if it lasts even six months of daily use I could consider it a great achievement. If you use it on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting often then it will probably burn out real quick. I turn mine off in between each section of hair I dry just to give a couple seconds to rest. You have to take the product for what it is and not expect it to be a hair dryer. It isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest pulling any hair in the brush out of it before you use it (not after or you will get burned!). If you let hair build up in the brush it will burn out. I also brush my hair well before using it and I usually only have to pull out one or two strands the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star only because the attachments don&#x27;t change out easily. It could be just mine though.one star only because the attachments don&#x27;t change out easily. It could be just mine though.</li>
            <li> This was not the answer for me my hair is very thin and very fine this dryer just does not do what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00022WA9K Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue]] Thanks to this Revlon hair dryer, I can blow dry my hair again.  I have Osteoarthritis and cannot hold a regular hair dryer. It was easy to use and did a terrific job of drying my thick hair.  Before my hair was completely dry, I added the smaller brush to style/smooth my hair. My hair looked great! This is a great hair dryer for everyone--disabled or not! I am thrilled that I found this dryer on Amazon, my favorite place to shop.</li>
            <li> love this, have used daily since I got it and have thick, curly hair and this works well. Have used just as a dryer as well. Have received many compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this to tame it and give it a light curl rather than the unruly curls I am used to.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive styler that Works great.  I have long very wavy hair and it smoothed it out nicely without it being to straight.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hot air brush as an alternative / spare to my much beloved VS model.  I&#x27;d wanted something with a bit more power that would dry my hair faster.  I didn&#x27;t really care for this brush.  Reasons?  Handle was way too big and hurt my hand to hold for any length of time.  It&#x27;s also pretty heavy compared to others (probably because of the motor is more powerful).  The attachments were a nightmare and nearly impossible to change out and the power button liked to stick at the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting.  The bristles on the brushes didn&#x27;t want to grip my hair, but that&#x27;s probably because I have really thick hair that needs more than soft bristles to grab hold of it.  Now, before you think that there must be a problem with my hands and that must be th reason I had so many problems with it, my hands are fine.  All of my issues could be due to a defective unit or perhaps this item is better suited to a different type of hair.  I don&#x27;t know.  I do know that I am going to buy another Vidal Sassoon brush before I leave Amazon today.  It may not have the power, but it does a fab job on my hair.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! The blow-dryer attachment is designed perfectly so there is no awkwardness trying to figure out how to hold it like a traditional L shaped blow-dryer. With this one tool I can do everything in 30 minutes that used to take me close to an hour with 2 tools.</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship w/ this product..I have purchase 4 in the last 2 years or so..I love what it does w/ my hair, I use it to finish my hair (blow dry or air dry 1/2 way &amp; finish w/ this dryer..  it is the closest I am able to come to &#x27;Salon hair&#x27;..straightens &amp; volumizes nicely..BUT..they burn out after only a few months..I use it 5-6x a week, but only for 2-3 minutes a time to finish my hair..this last one sparked &amp; &#x27;blew up&#x27; so extreme that it shot sparks out at my head &amp; chest that actually burned..I vow to never buy it again, but after a few weeks w/ out it I really miss the lift it gives my hair, so I try again in hopes that I just bought a dud..but it happens every single time..i&#x27;ve been searching for a different brand w/ a higher wattage in hopes to resolve the problem, but have been able to find anything I like the looks of..so I decided to try one more time, it&#x27;s a step up from this model, being the 1500w version..hoping this one lasts longer..hanging onto my receipt just in case this one doesn&#x27;t last a year (none of the others have  &amp; they are under a year warranty..had I been more organized I would have sent the others back..3 stars..would give it 5 for the results, but a 1 for the quality of the product..</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one.  This makes it easy to straighten your hair and dry at the same time.</li>
            <li> makes great waves &amp; curls</li>
            <li> Amazing product I love it so easy to use 😻😻😻</li>
            <li> So far I love this product.  I find my hair is smoother and full bodied and holds the style longer.</li>
            <li> This is the easiest and fastest hair dryer ever.  I have tried many hair dryers, but this is so easy to use and dries my hair in the shortest time.  It is so easy to do the back of the hair as well as the front.  The result looks like a hairdresser styled my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried round brushes, blow dryers, comb dryers... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it, and have not been happy. Maybe because I am no cosmetologist. :&#x3D;) However, I am exceptionally pleased with this product as it gives me the closest fininsh to having my hair done by my hairdresser. I love it. Gives the convenience &amp; manageability of a round brush &amp;  dryer in one. Thanks Revlon</li>
            <li> I have POOF! All the gel and hairspray in the world could not give me anything, but string straight hair. I just refuse to color AND perm my hair anymore! This tool is IDEAL for straight, fine hair. My job requires me to wear a headset for most of the day -- even this can&#x27;t flatten my hair!  Only reason for the \\&quot;4\\&quot; it is very loud!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I only gave this product 3 stars because it is hard to turn on and off.  Also, I like a button you can just press for a cold shot and this does not have that either.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  I have used it once and am going to send it back.  The attachments got so hot when I used the heat settings (low or high, it didn&#x27;t matter) that I could not remove them to switch out (from dryer head to brush) without a washcloth or something.  The cool setting was not at all cool or even room temperature.  I am surprised at the great reviews, I guess I had a different experience.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other negative reviews.  I&#x27;ve used the Revlon dryer styler round brush for years.  When they die, I replace them.  The former one didn&#x27;t last as long as the others and this new one has designed those openings to keep it from overheating.  Well, not only does it vent very hot air, it blows the surrounding hair in all directions, undoing what you just did.  I came online to try to track down an older model.&lt;br /&gt;Update: have ordered the Conair model but in the mean time I stand by this review.  Its dangerous hot and I mean within 10 seconds.  Its difficult to keep switching from low HOT to the high blow cool setting and I see it wearing out quickly.  I think this item should be recalled for safety reasons.  Might work okay with thick longer hair where you don&#x27;t wind it up to the scalp.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair gadget that I own and that&#x27;s okay because it has the function of two! I recommend this to girls who don&#x27;t have the skills yet have the heart to style their own hair like me.</li>
            <li> I replaced with a Conair.  Not only can I not get the nozzle off so I can use the brushes but the amount of air that comes out is not enough to dry my short hair.  Conair is great, love it...can change the brushes and blows ample air!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. I only buy Revlon products because I&#x27;ve come to realize that they&#x27;re stronger than other brantds. I bought it for like $15 at Kmart. I had one before but this one is new and improved and seems more powerful than the other. Its cool because it dries your hair, straightens, and gives it flip or curl. My hair is hard to handle because I dye it and it looks really dry when I style it. With this thing, I use it and it takes me only like 20 minutes to dry, and style my hair. The first day I used it people were like \\&quot;You&#x27;re hair is so nice today! What&#x27;d you do!?\\&quot; Use this product with a syrum and hair spray. Thats what I find works best :)</li>
            <li> This was the second time I purchased this hot air dryer &amp; styler (the first one broke through my carelessness, and was in no way due to a manufacturing defect). I have used this dryer for three years and have been impressed with its performance. I have very fine hair which does not hold style well &amp; I am not particularly talented when it comes to doing my own hair. Even so, with this producut I am able to dry &amp; style my hair every morning and  would be lost without this hot air brush. I have not used Revlon&#x27;s ceramic version yet, so I cannot attest to whether this is better than that one or not. Lastly, I have had horrible luck with hair dryers in the past, and I was pleasantly surprised to see how this dryer withstood years of travel and use. It is a very well contructed product.</li>
            <li> Gave great style but over heats withing less than two minutes. So disappointed. Will have to try another brand or something.</li>
            <li> This product is seriously the best thing I ever bought for my hair. I have extremely thick, curly, unmanageable hair. This product helps tame my unmanageable hair and makes it look soft, smooth, and healthy. I like how it is a brush and dryer combined- no trying to juggle the round brush and separate hair dryer, and I can do it with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only gripe I have with it is I can&#x27;t figure out how to clean the barrel. Styling products tend to build up on the metal part, and it is kinda hard to clean since I don&#x27;t think you can immerse it. But other than that, it&#x27;s a great product and I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> excelente complemento</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace one that I have used and loved for years.  My biggest problem was how hot the air was. WHOA, IS IT HOT!!  I have relatively coarse, hard to damage hair, and I literally smelled my hair BURNING on high heat.  It really scared me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second problem was just how difficult it was to get to the COOL button.  Wow, can you make the switch any more difficult to move?  In my past units (I&#x27;ve owned two others before this one, one of which was also a Revlon product, in fact), that switch was super easy to get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this unit ever again.  I&#x27;m too lazy to return it or else I would.  I just have to adjust to low heat, which will take a much longer time to style my hair, which I&#x27;m not liking very much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, the super hot heat really does set my hair really well for the rest of the day!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.....IT MAKES MY HAIR TIME VERY EASY AND SIMPLE!    BUT...I bought this product at a drug store 2-3 years ago (recommendation from a friend in the hair business).  Loved it...recommended it to all my girlfriends.  After 3 years......the product started  \\&quot;burning out\\&quot; and turning off....so, I decided to buy another one.  Checked  out every drug store....there were none to be had.      Went to the internet....VIOLA!  Found it.   I was happy....ordered two.  I used the Model number that was on the original I had purchased and ordered two.    My ordered arrived very quickly.  I was happy......    UNTIL...I used the product.  Product worked great...HOWEVER...it was NOT a duplicate of the original I had bought (even though I send the model number when ordering).       I am happy (but not as happy as I should be)....BECAUSE, the 2 products I received were different from the original I had bought in these ways:    1.  The orignal had a button for \\&quot;ionic\\&quot;....the replacement does not.    2.  (Most importantly)...The \\&quot;settings button\\&quot; on the new product is FLAT....      On the original I purchased,  the \\&quot;settings button\\&quot; was raised and MUCH      easier to use.    I&#x27;m OK...but certainly not a happy as I could be.....    SO...AMAZON....  Can you get REVLON to call me....??    I would LOVE to have an ORIGNAL REVLON IONIC.    Thank you.    Marcy McCann  618-223-3322  MarcyinPV@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> I just purchased my 3rd one of these over a 10 year period.  They do burn up eventually, however, I have always been happy with the device until now.  The new model has a switch that is much harder to turn off and on with just one hand.  They have changed the heat levels in a way that doesn&#x27;t make much sense.</li>
            <li> This is my second Revlon Ionic hair dryer. I use it on my dry hair to give it a quick flip either under or up and it does that with some smoothing results!</li>
            <li> Thin, fine, limp hair? If this is your problem, as it is mine, use this Hot Air Drier and Styler! My hair actually has lift and volume after its use!  I have had no problem with the dryer shutting down from overuse. Highly recommended![[ASIN:B00022WA9K Revlon RV440C 1200W Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler]]</li>
            <li> product was defective</li>
            <li> Great product! I really fell in love with this dryer. It gives smoothness and shine and I finish my hair within 20 minutes and I have a lot of hair! You really can&#x27;t beat the price either :-)</li>
            <li> It is too flimsy! the smaller styler falls of the holder all the time. It styles well but i am sure it will not last a long time.   I had a Conair one for years and it much better made. I do not recommend it   &lt;...&gt;</li>
            <li> I love this thing, it&#x27;s perfect for me.  I have rather thin, baby fine, chin length hair and zero stying skill. This gives me good volume and body and just enough curl for a soft smooth bob hairdo, dries my hair quickly with one hand and fits in my gym bag much better than a dryer and curling iron.</li>
            <li> Okay, I never leave reviews, but I love this thing so much.. I just HAD to rave about it.  This definitely take a little longer to dry your whole head, but it looks WAY better and has MUCH more volume.  It&#x27;s a blowdryer and a round brush in one!  I have had no problems like the ones others have complained about.  Mine has never overheated, and it holds my hair.. the bristles are fine (at least on my fine hair.)  Only thing I will agree with is that the switch could be a little better, but as long as you even have the teeniest bit of a nail you can switch it up and down with no problems.  LOVE THIS! Would recommend to everyone!  I actually look forward to blowdrying my hair now!</li>
            <li> I have used many similar products and find the Revlon Ionic Hot Air Stylers are the most reasonably priced and still a good product.  They last a long time and are easy to operate and are \\&quot;balanced well\\&quot;, which is important.  The only reason I don&#x27;t give it five stars is because the screws in the brush wands tend to work their way out over a period of time and that is a nuisance.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Does NOT heat up, as other reviews states. Use quite often, styles very quickly (I have medium length hair) and the two brushes is just a plus!</li>
            <li> works perfectly for my short hair style.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer and straightner in one.  Plus with the new design, the brush stays attached even while pulling through thick hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this hot air brush!  I had the Thermalaire previously and it was low powered and I could only use it to style my hair after I had dried it with a regular hair dryer.  After it died, I decided to try this one because it is 1200W -- wow, what a difference!  It has an attachment that allows you to use it as a regular hair dryer, or you can dry your hair using the brush attachments.  I have short layered hair and I usually dry it using the larger brush attachment.  It gives my hair SO MUCH body, its just wonderful, and it dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  The first day I used it, when I went to work people kept complimenting on my new haircut!!  I had to keep telling them it wasn&#x27;t a new haircut but a new hair dryer! And I haven&#x27;t had a bad hair day since buying it!  The only problem I&#x27;ve had is that it does tend to get a little hot to handle on the high setting, but it&#x27;s worth it to me because it dries my hair so fast, while styling it at the same time.  And I can always turn it down to the low setting if I need to.  It also has a cool setting to set your curls.  This is a GREAT item and I just wanted to contradict some of the negative reviews it has gotten.  This is a great dryer for people who are short on time and need a great style FAST!</li>
            <li> Thought this would save time and be easier than a blow dryer and round brush, but no. My hair is long-ish and kind of fine/straight. The brushes would not grab the hair enough like my regular round hair brush. So, I couldn&#x27;t get the  full volume results I wanted. I can see how those with thick or wavy hair would fare better. It is very loud though. I returned mine.</li>
            <li> This product makes my dry frizzy hair even drier &amp; frizzier. Instead of a dry, frizzy, curly bush on my head, I had a slightly straighter, even drier, frizzier bush on my head. Even trying keratin products did not help. No shine whatsoever! It looked worse.  My hair is very dull, dry, &amp; fine. To compare to others hair. Image most people having hair like spaghetti. The diameter of my hair is smaller like angel hair pasta, only curly, frizzy &amp; dry (caucasian). I use handfuls of leave-in conditioner, curl cream, curl gel, &amp;  even coconut oil, barely making a difference. It must dry natural &amp; not be combed or brushed when dry. I officially give up &amp; realize I have a hair curse.</li>
            <li> I love this product for what it does for my hair WHEN IT WORKS!  I am on my 4th one since December and the only reason I keep getting the same one is because I keep exchanging it. The first one was broken right out of the package, the button clip that keeps the brush on was broken, the 2nd one burned out, the 3rd one, the little screen on the bottom broke off and it smells like it is burning and the 4th one was purchased on Friday and died on Tuesday. I finally wrote to the manufacturer!!! I am exchanging again today  for a different model. I hope the new one I get works as good but more importantly, I hope it keeps working!!!</li>
            <li> Let me first start by saying I ordered this product on Saturday, February 7, 2015 and I was so surprised when I got home from work on February 9th to find the product already on my door step!  Awesome shipping here.  As far as the product.  I absolutely love it and would recommend this to anyone looking for a hot air brush!!!!</li>
            <li> I have literally used this three times and the hot air is now broken. It blows cool air just fine but really? I have thick hair and I always dry my hair before using the styler so there is no excuses for this crappy product. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 5 years and I have naturally thick and frizzy hair and this blowdries my hair smooth but full of body.  I love it.  I have long hair so it takes me about 15 minutes to blow dry the whole thing but I don&#x27;t have to curl or style it after that so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Would have loved to have kept this item.  It was exactly what I wanted except that the brushes that are described as 1&#x27; and 1½&amp;#34; are at least 3/4 to an inch larger.  I believe that they measure the barrel of the brush and not the brush.  I have short hair and wanted this both as a dryer and to get volume using the brush.  The smallest brush was way too big and had no choice but to return it.  Will check out other brushes in a brick and mortar store to see about the size of the brush before ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is my second like this.  I like it for daily re-styling and not bad for on the road.  If you want to use it as a regular styler you need patience.  I still prefer my round brush and blow dryer to do my weekly blow-out.</li>
            <li> I am a girl who generally does not do a lot with my hair.  This tool makes it so easy that I actually take a little extra time in the morning to use it, and my hair looks great!  I wish I had gotten one sooner.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer! It does not pull my hair out, it gets my natural hair straight from the roots in seconds. My only complaint is the button is hard to slide from hot to medium</li>
            <li> The product works great especially for my super thick hair. However it does over heat so you have to be cautious not to burn your fingers off.</li>
            <li> I love the way this adds body and style to my hair.  It dries hair slowly so I use a regular hair dryer to dry my hair to damp.  Then, I use the larger of the two brushes to dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have receive many compliments since I began using it.  I wish the bristles on brush were longer.  It is also noiser than my regular hair dryer.  I have not had it overheat like others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI:  I have medium-thick, fine-textured, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it, I was not, It snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude. Very unhappy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Terrible! Does not work as described!!!! Used to do hair &amp; this is a sad product. I tried it once and threw it away!!!</li>
            <li> The bristle brush on this doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair type. I have baby fine hair and this brush gave me the frizzes&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, curly hair.  Over the years I have tried everything on my hair-various curlers, dryers, brushes, curling wands, you name it.  The Revlon Ionic Dryer and Styler is the best product that I&#x27;ve found to quickly and easily dry and style my hair.  I can make my hair almost straight or flip the ends under.  I can make it fluffy or flat if I wish. Granted, the handle is large and somewhat bulky in my small hand but it&#x27;s still easier to use than a regular dryer and brush (two handed styling) which requires turning off the dryer frequently in order to re-position the brush correctly. It does have several different attatchments but I only use the one which looks like a brush.  It has a really nice cord which comes out the end and turns as you work which prevents tangling of the cord. I have owned several of these and my only complaint is that they tend to burn out after about 2 to 3 years. And that is with using it about twice a week for about 30 to 40 minutes each time.  But hey, it does work so I just go buy another one.  For that reason I gave it four stars rather than five. If Revlon could make these last a little longer I would change my rating to five stars.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would solve my lack of coordination using a round brush and blow dryer because its an all-in-one device, boy was i wrong! This is a great product in THEORY, but the design is awful! There are holes between the brush attachment and blowing component that prevent heat from reaching the brush and drying my hair. Very disappointed in this product. Returning IMMEDIATELY!</li>
            <li> I have had this brush dryer for about 4 months.  I loved the way it dried and styled my hair.  The end of the brush remains cool enough to touch, which makes styling easier for me.  However, this week, the barrel stopped sticking into the base--both barrels...  Now, as I try to run the brush through my hair, it begins to come away from the base, which makes the whole process problematic.  I don&#x27;t know whether my air styler is one flawed product out of a million, but, disappointingly, it has ceased to work well for me.</li>
            <li> The dryer part works fine, but it&#x27;s VERY difficult to remove the brushes and change them.  Not sure I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love using this on my hair in the morning and my hair stays great for days.  A great deal!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and I can&#x27;t use a round brush and a blow dryer on myself to save my life so I wanted to find a way to easily round brush my hair because I love the way it looks so I decided to try this. I&#x27;m not very impressed. I love the multiple heads expecially the concentrator but it does not work very well.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.  Works like a charm...4 stars because I wish the medium setting was just a tad hotter...the Hot setting is TOO hot.</li>
            <li> Be very careful with this. When I first got it I really liked the volume it gave me.  Within about two months of using it, I noticed the last couple of inches of my hair had gotten fried!  Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I find the round tube type brush attachment perfect for my hair as I am awkward with a blow dryer and a brush.  Have used this type for years and it&#x27;s lightweight &amp; easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this exact product for years.  I love it. It just has to be replaced every five years or so because the motor gives out.  You have to soak the brushes in very hot water every couple of months if you use product in your hair.  I let them soak then scrape through the bristles with a sharp comb.</li>
            <li> Me encanta este hot brush le he tenido hace unos 4 años y es el mejor si lo sabes manejar , I love this hotbrush I have it for 4 years ans its the best if you know to used is your BFF... &lt;3</li>
            <li> As a dryer the Revlon dries very fast but as stylist, I would have perferred a 3/4 barrell.  However, since most younger people like   over-sized barrells (this comes with a 1 inch and a 1 1/14), you will be much more pleased with this.  Also, I would have like the option on  the stylist portion to turn off the air.</li>
            <li> The Hot air dryer and styler is great.  IT is a great little product that is easy to use.  I have thick curly hair, and for years had trouble trying to straighten it.... juggling a brush, hair clips and a blow dryer.  This tool makes it incredibly easy to blow dry my hair while still giving it volume and bounce.  It also cuts my blow drying time in half.      I just purchased a second one for my mother who has the exact opposite of my hair... hers is straight and thin.  She used mine while visiting and loved it as well.  I definitely recommend this product for people who want to style their hair, but don&#x27;t have a lot of time to devote to doing their hair all the time.</li>
            <li> I loved this product for the first few months.  I only used it maybe 1-2 a week.  It&#x27;s so fast and easy, and my hair alwasys had a great shine.  My issue was that it over heated very quickly and after only 5 months the thing started smoking after less than 1 min of use and broke for good!  I love the idea of this air brush, but obviously needs a cooling factor and over all better quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, it is exactly what I needed !!</li>
            <li> i have nothing positive to ay about this item. So I should nit hae to waste time on returned items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this set for probably 5-7 years and I love it. I&#x27;ve tried using blow dryers and round brushes but I guess I just don&#x27;t have the coordination to make them work.  This brush and blow dryer all in one is the easiest to use (with a swivel cord so it doesn&#x27;t tangle as you turn it) and works well, drying and styling. I&#x27;ve even used it on dry hair and it works great on dry hair as well. I&#x27;m writing this review now, after all these years, because it just today breathed its&#x27; last; the cord, where the swivel attaches to the unit, began sparking.  I think 5-7 years is a good life and I&#x27;m looking to buy this again.</li>
            <li> As good as any I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I like this Revlon hair shine improvement products , i make hair look more manageable and less  frizzy ,  i have a lot of hair ,  its brushes wont stick long into it  when i style , but it is perfect  and good quality product for those have normal not thick freezze hair</li>
            <li> I bought this brush dryer because I needed to be able to do one handed grooming do to upcoming surgery.  It is easy to handle though it is a bit thick for my small hands.  With a little practice, no-one noticed the difference between one handed and two handed grooming.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second Revlon Ionizer Roller Brush and it works great to dry my curly hair straight and smooth.  I wore my hair natural to work the other day and people wanted to know how I get it so straight, this is the reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am looking to buy another to have as a spare before Revlon discontinues the product.</li>
            <li> My mom actually bought this while we were on vacation in Boston because she forgot hers back home, she used it for the vacation and HATED IT so I permanently barrowed it from her. It dose the job, and takes like 10-15 minutes, where with a normal blow-dryer my hair takes 45-55 minutes, it dose get REALY hot, I accidently burned my friends leg, and I do have scars on the back of my ears, neck and on my head. It would spark from time to time, and sometimes it would smell like smoke, but turns out the smoke smell was my hair. I dropped it quiet a bit and the clip on it broke, so the attachments wont go on any more, for this reason I am buying a new one. now I use the broken one to dry my eyeliner. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend you use this if you want a &#x27;gentle&#x27; hair-dryer because it isn&#x27;t. I have LOTS of thick curly hair with crazy body. (I sometimes still straighten my hair afterwards because its to fluffy) I also wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for young kids/teens because like I said, you can easly burn yourself by toughting the brush. you also need to be carefull with the brushes I accidently squished the small one (which was useless anyways) and put a dent in the big one. all in all, I love it, but it is not for everyone</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair. Of course she likes to change her hair, now and then. This is a great tool to help smooth and straighter hair. It tames her hair to waves when she wants that look and makes it much easier to straighten for days she wants that look.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work for me, but it simply does not produce enough hot air.&lt;br /&gt;Heavy and cumbersome to use.&lt;br /&gt;I am sticking with my blow dryer and big round brush.</li>
            <li> I find this hair dryer is perfect for my hair.  Can not find any other that works for my hair, like this one does.  However, at the same time, I tried to order Hollywood Beauty Olive Oil Shine Moisturizer for my hair.  Again, it is the only thing on the market, that I have found that works for me,.  Unfortunately, they would not send it and I do not know why?  I am desperate for it, as I am on the last little bit in the container.  Would really like to know where I can get it if they will not send it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 10 years now and converted my mom &amp; sister to users as well, for several years now.  I don&#x27;t ever plan on switching back to a blow dryer &amp; it&#x27;s in the essential category as a travel item.  The texture of finish of my hair comes out so much better than using a blow dryer, meaning it has a soft wave to it and is not slightly frizzy.  I&#x27;m surprised to see that this product has so many bad reviews.  Now, it can break easily if you drop it or bang it around roughly so it does require a bit more gentle care than a blow dryer.  I usually replace mine once every year to year and a half bcuz it will lose a bit of its power and the brush bristles will wear down but it&#x27;s only $20 a pop as opposed to $30+ blow dryers that are out there.  Here&#x27;s how I use it:  I usually remove the brush and just blow dryer my hair on high heat to &amp;#34;dry it out some&amp;#34; before I put it to work by attaching the brush and curling the brush from the root of my hair slowly/gently pulling it out to the ends.  I don&#x27;t ever use the smaller attachment brush, I use the bigger one.  It&#x27;s basically the result of the big brush and blow drying technique that you get at the salon but in one.  Sure, it may be a little awkward to hold and use when you first try it but I&#x27;m telling you, stick with it 3 days and you won&#x27;t switch back to a blow dryer.  I haven&#x27;t yet and certainly don&#x27;t plan too.  I Love, love, love this product.  Have a great hair day!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM. THE HAIR DRYER PART IS SO LIGHT AND EASY TO USE. SAME FOR THE BRUSHES FOR IT</li>
            <li> Brush could be stiffer and longer for my thick hair.  High setting is good for drying, but too hot for curling.</li>
            <li> I bought this item to both dry and help style my hair.  Yes, it dried my hair, but it was a styling failure.</li>
            <li> I chose this Revlon product because I had a previous model for several years that recently died. I have fine, straight hair and I hate having to manipulate both a brush and a standard blow dryer simultaneously. This type of dryer/styler works well for me. I considered other brands/models but after reading not so favorable reviews decided to stick with the Revlon. There are some improvements on this model. First of all, it&#x27;s much lighter than the old one. Second, the cord rotates so that it doesn&#x27;t get all twisted, as the previous one did, when you rotate the brush to style your hair. Other than that, it works much the same as the old model. This unit is the only one I&#x27;ve tried that gets hot enough to really add some volume and curl to my fine, straight hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Have had 2 of these previously.  I literally wear them out.  A Great styling product and a really good price.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this blow dryer over a six months ago and still performing quite well.&lt;br /&gt;Actually works great and has no problems with it. I can thumb the switch easily to low or cold, or on or off, while rolling my hair up in it, straight drying, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is the way it&#x27;s supposed to work! Actually, I&#x27;ve  ordered a second one so I have a spare for a rainy day or even traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I like this dryer because you can dry hair with it as well as style it. In addition, you can dry your hair straight or style and curl it while drying. Great for traveling when you don&#x27;t have room for packing .&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a quality dryer.</li>
            <li> I hate this &amp;#34;new version&amp;#34; of what was a good thing.  You can&#x27;t get the brush to come lose without burning your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The way they designed this model, you can&#x27;t turn off the ionizer, there is no cool down button so unless you turn it off - it overheats and shuts down till it cools down completely. I want to buy the older version. Anyone know where I can find one?</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;ve only used this product once, so my opinion could change, but I&#x27;m thinking it will only get easier to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews on here that talked about this tool cutting the drying time in half-- I didn&#x27;t find that to be the case.  Because you&#x27;re creating curl at the same time, I erred on the side of smaller chunks at a time, which ended up taking just as long.  The benefit however, comes with the end result!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks like I had a  blow-out at the salon.  It is smooth and full and smooth.  My hair naturally has this really tight curl in the back and a straight front, which makes it difficult to style.  This product smoothed out everything so that you can&#x27;t even tell that it has a tendancy to curl in the back.  Previously I would have to blowdry, then sometimes flatten with a straight-iron the back portion, then curl with a fat curling iron to get everything uniform.  I was able to style with just this tool today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it was a lot simpler to use this tool.  I didn&#x27;t have to juggle the blowdryer and my round brush back and forth.  I simply rolled each chunk up on the barrel and hit it with the hot air.  At the end I stuck the barrel under the top chunks (so they just draped over the barrel,) hit is with hot, then hit it with cool, and the end result was a lot more volume on top.  Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be using this tool daily, and can tell it will be less stressful on both me and my hair!</li>
            <li> No complaints here. It does the job pretty well and is durable. Had my first one for over 4 years and just got this one to replace it. It&#x27;s a good product overall. worth the money and I like the results.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I ordered this because it was so cheap, even when I received it but I opened it and gave it a try and its great. Its very light weight so my arm doesnt feel like its falling off after 10 mins. It seriously cut my time in half!!!</li>
            <li> I am compelled to write my first review ever, because this product is so bad. This styler deserves zero stars. Off the bat, it is the loudest dryer ever; it sounds like high-pitched screaming. It also isn&#x27;t thick enough to grab your hair. On the hair it does grab, you will have split ends left behind. Don&#x27;t waste your precious locks or your money!</li>
            <li> THIS BRUSH IS TERRIFIC!! I&#x27;VE BEEN LOOKING FOR A STYLING BRUSH LIKE THIS FOR YEARS.  I already had a curler/dryer but the wattage was so low and it took so long to get a curl even partially dry that I usually got frustrated and only used it for my bangs.  This has the heat and power to really get your hair dry with lastings curls (or straightening).&lt;br /&gt;The only tip I would give people that may have had problems, is to watch how you hold the handle. You do not want to block the air vents at the bottom of the handle because this could cause the unit to overheat and eventually cause problems.  Also, you want to periodically check the screening at the bottom of the handle...over time these can get clogged with lint &amp; spray products.  Keep them brushed out with an old toothbrush or vacuum brush and your styling brush should have a much longer life span.  I always do this and have hair dryers that are over 18 years old.&lt;br /&gt;I THINK ANYONE WANTING A GOOD MULTI-PURPOSE STYLER WILL LOVE THIS BRUSH.......IT WORKS LIKE A CHARM!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.  Use it every day to create lots of volume, and it&#x27;s very east to use.</li>
            <li> Use it daily. Dry first with a regular dryer for speed, then finish with this. Adds fullness and light curl to the ends. Great for refreshing hairdo on days when I don&#x27;t wash and dry. Keeps my hair always looking nice without much effort.</li>
            <li> Ouch.  The high heat selection is too hot and even the medium heat can be uncomfortable.  The barrel is huge, way too big for me to handle easily.  And it very noisy.  Not worth packing up and sending back and I do not know if it would be accepted, but barely usable.  My old Revlon was much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a round blow dryer but my hair stylist recommended it for my fine, thin hair.  When I first used this product I thought it was going to be the answer to my problems, then the brush kept coming off and I soon learned that one problem was replaced by another. Revlon has some serious issues with this and should fix it.  The dryer gets very hot on the highest setting and when the brush comes off you are at risk of burning yourself on the metal part of the brush. No matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t keep the brush on.  After the first use I&#x27;m returning it and getting the John Freida, which I see is highly recommended.  I see that other customers have had the same issues and it appears that Revlon is in no hurry to fix it.</li>
            <li> Cut my hair short and found I am a total klutz with conventional blow dryer and brush.  I can actually get good results fast with this unit</li>
            <li> Has all the features I want, like a cool setting. Most other similar dryers have a cool shot button, but not an actual cool setting, this one does, and it great- til it quits working. I&#x27;ve gone through 4 of these in a year, they just stop working.&lt;br /&gt;C&#x27;mon Revlon, get your act together and put out better quality!</li>
            <li> Pro: I love this blower it is so easy to have to use just one hand to style and dry your hair at the same time.  Only con on this product is that they do not sell replacement brushes, the bristles seems to become either burnt or defective after using it for awhile, but for the Pro side and price I just bought another one that&#x27;s how good it works!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my wife who likes it so far. Adds curl to her hair without all the spray she used to use.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my hair looked but the one I bought in August has quit working.  It lasted 8 months and now it won&#x27;t heat up anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom and she hated it. If you have Dominican hair Dont waste your money. This is for white people silky type of hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really style my hair while damp.  Gave it away to someone who could use it.  First one came damaged but Amazon was quick to replace.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair that lays flat on my head. This wonderful product is easy to use and give me the body I want. I cannot believe how simple it is to use. Per instructions I waiting until my hair was about 1/2 dry, then I sectioned it off, and started drying. I cannot believe how much body my hair has with no products! And it stays that way without any hair spray.  Seriously love it and wish I had purchased one a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to waste hours drying and fixing my hair. This does it in one step of drying and styling.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It helps to take the frizz out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Happy I made the purchase!</li>
            <li> I have this exact Hot Air Kit from the 90&#x27;s.  It worked wonderfully till I overheated it.  The new model has an opening on both the brushes where they connect to the handle.  This causes alot of the hot air to escape there and not make it to the actual barrel part.  I found it still works, but I have to use on high to make sure it gets the flow of air all the way through the barrel.  Just hope it doesn&#x27;t overheat using it like this....keeping my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;The purchase was wonderful.  I received it 2 days earlier than expected, which was great because I was having many bad hair days LOL.</li>
            <li> Would have loved this product if it hadn&#x27;t broken the second time I used it.  Tried the restart button; gave it time to cool.  Nothing worked, so I returned it. Noticed many people had similar problems from the reviews. Now I&#x27;m starting over to find something that will actually work.  Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> The vents under the brush attachments blow hot air out.  It&#x27;s no problem for the piece of hair you&#x27;re trying to curl, but it messes up the sections of hair around it by blowing them around into a mess.  It&#x27;s hard to get a polished look when the hot air brush is making a mess out of all of the hair you just styled.</li>
            <li> This does the job but not easily.  The handle is large and a bit difficult to maneuver.  The brush gets hot fast so be prepared.  I tend to use it on the lower or cool settings.  Finally it is loud, loud like a leaf blower.  I put ear plugs in  whenever I use it otherwise it is too troublesome.  All in all it styles well but I am going to search for a quieter product.</li>
            <li> I hate it, This product should be recall since it dangerous. Burned my ear with it. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Had older version and loved it.  This one works as good but they changed buttons.  Before you had it on high to curl and then one setting down it went to cool to set curl.  Now they have but the low button between the hot and medium and it makes it harder to use.  Only complaint about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recently purchasing replacement for a con air hot brush I loved for years.  This is one product of THREE brands I tried.  Beware these brushes combs are made of plastic thin nubs. When with this sucker falls of the counter with its intense blower...the combs MELTED! I have long layers and this just never worked as well as my old favorite that was light purple and white. Good luck!</li>
            <li> Amazing tool - makes drying my hair so much better and easier.  LOVE IT recommended it to many friends.</li>
            <li> I bought at Target and returned it too. I kept burning  my hand. The bristles are to soft to roll your hair on that you end up touching the barrel.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand of hot air brush I have bought.  Not happy yet.  (bought this one locally, not on Amazon).  This is the worst of the three and is going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:  Power (1200W), Ionic, bristle style, 2 sizes of barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  Cheaply made, the handle vibrates so badly from the motor that it actually hurts my hand.  My hair gets caught in the seam between the tip and the barrel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other brands I have tried:  Hot Tools and John Frieda.</li>
            <li> The air blows around the brush,  not through it like other models. It&#x27;s not as effective and creates frizzy fly aways</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry I wasted my money on this product...I threw the packaging away, so couldn&#x27;t return it...first of all, the brushes are so soft that the hair won&#x27;t even adhere to it...2nd, the heat comes out around the handle and burns your hand...I could only use it on low and it still burned my hand &amp; head...Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this product...it&#x27;s AWFUL!!!</li>
            <li> My stylist recommended this to me when I got a new hair style.  I found it at Amazon at a great price, received it in just a few days, couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  I love it!  It has cut the time it takes to do my hair in half because it curls &amp; styles as it dries .  I have put all my other styling tools away!</li>
            <li> *skip to second paragraph for review*  I have semi-thick density, wavy/curly hair.  I have recently cut this mess into a medium length bob because I was tired of being strangled by my hair in the middle of the night while I slept.  I went to cosmotology school, didn&#x27;t finish, and I know how to round brush my hair at home.  My hair is so thick in the back, and I have thinned it out twice.  If I use a round brush, the type that is two pieces fitted together and glued with a wider handle, my hair is so thick that when I blow out my hair I can hear the brush cracking and trying to break.  I also realize I should use a solid wooden round brush with boar bristle, and I do use one on occasion.  Unfortunately, my hands cramp from the handle being normal sized and it takes me about 40-45 minutes to round brush out my hair.  I know I use to big of  a section sometimes for the brush I am using because I am impatient and in a hurry and I hate sweating right after a shower while trying to fix my hair.  I have a conair infinitipro spin brush.  I use it more as a finisher after I have round brushed my head normally with blow dryer and brush to help smooth out the waves that I was unable to smooth out in the back of my head.  It is ok.  There isn&#x27;t a lot of air pressure blowing out of it for my tastes and the bristles are to soft to grip my hair and pull it taunt.  You cannot use it to blow out your hair, just to help finish it.  Unless you have really thin, sparse hair...then maybe. I wanted something that would eliminate me sweating right after the shower while I fix my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I use the revlon hot air brush.  I towel dry my hair, put my product in, blow dry my hair with a regular blow dryer for 2-3 minutes concentrating the air flow at the back middle of my head at the roots where the thickest part of my hair is using my fingers to lift my hair away from my scalp.  Then I section off my hair with the bottom part of hair left out as the first section.  I fireup the Revlon hot air brush on high for about 10 seconds, let it get warmed up.  I pick up a part of the section of my hair and apply the brush at the scalp and run the brush under the hair and then on top of the hair about 3-5 times on both sides of the hair until dry and then I turn it down to low, and  run it down my hair underneath down to the ends, roll the hair up the brush let it sit for 5 seconds, then turn the brush on cool for 5-10 seconds and run the brush down to the ends turning under as I do so.  If you aren&#x27;t careful you will scorch your hair do to the metal on the brush heating up.  I don&#x27;t have any problems of my hair blowing around everywhere like others were saying.  This product is what it is, whether it lasts 6 months or 2 years.  It is worth it because it saves me precious time in the morning when I am getting ready, I don&#x27;t get all sweaty, my hand doesn&#x27;t cramp, and my hair looks better than if I used a wooden round brush w/hair dryer.  What is not to like?  I bought mine at Target.  It was on sale in the store for around $20.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon in a while. It&#x27;s amazing. I can style and dry at same time and it&#x27;s fast! My fuzzy straight hair comes out smooth and shiny and I can do great natural looking flips and lifts. It&#x27;s SO WORTH THE MONEY! I&#x27;ll always have one of these from now on.</li>
            <li> This hot air brush is wonderful. It comes with two interchangeable heads and has three speeds; high, low, cool.   I have found that this tool is great when it comes to styling hair. Previously, people have complained that it has gotten too hot or left their hair damaged. I have not found this to be true. While it does get hot, I have found that it does not get any hotter than my regular hair dryer. It has to get hot in order to style! It allows so many different hair styles to be accomplished with little practice. It works great on my bangs as well.  I highly recommend this product. Please do not be scared by the &amp;#34;too hot&amp;#34; reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this for styling my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, sizes and versions of this product when I couldn&#x27;t find this particular one.  NONE of them are this good.  I have fine, shorter hair, and the bristles on the brushes of this product hold my hair and create great curls.  I can&#x27;t even imagine struggling with the round brush in one hand and hair dryer in the other.  This product has cut my \\&quot;doing my hair\\&quot; time to minutes.  My mom is having shoulder replacement surgery and will only have use of one arm during recovery, I&#x27;m buying this for her so she can do her own hair (not sure my dad will do that great of a job if it&#x27;s left to him!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 2 of these and both stopped working after a few months. I had it for about 6 months or longer and I loved it. Then recently, It heats up and works for a few minutes then just stops. The ion light stays on but just stops drying and rotating. It&#x27;ll work again but then shut off right away after you let it cool. It sucks!!!! I bought it at Rite Aid so maybe their stock is bad? I don&#x27;t know, but I would really like to get something similar, because it&#x27;s a great hair tool when it&#x27;s not faulty.   Revlon RV440C 1200 Watt Ionic Hot Air Dryer and Styler, Blue</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 6 of the Revlon RV440C or equivalent Revlon products over the past 3 years and only one is working now. When I placed the order in April, I ordered two, and one has a short and will not run on fast fan, hot heat. Now I need to order another \\&quot;spare\\&quot; as I never know when it is going to fail. But as you can see, I can&#x27;t live without this hot air dryer as it makes hair styling much easier. If only the Revlon company could improve the reliability.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a second time after my old one wore out after about 10 years. I bought another brand first from my local drug store and took it back after one use. The other brand was wimpy and took forever to dry my hair. This one is GREAT in terms of the power and settings. Drys my hair fast and smooth. And it was 10 dollars cheaper than the other brand. This one is a good value in my book.</li>
            <li> I do not like the attachment mechanism or button to turn on the hair dryer.  It is hard to use and not the one pictured in the photo.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift, my daughter loves it. Makes hair styling eaiser and quicker in the morning. Dries and styles in one easy step.</li>
            <li> Very good product and working as expected.  I have purchased 2 different products and had to return them at Target since they did not work out and not what I expected.  This product is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for!</li>
            <li> one of the best hot air kit on the market, my wife love it. She was using for the last 15 years. It last about 3 to 5 years using every single day of the year!</li>
            <li> It tends to pull little hairs from the plastic end piece</li>
            <li> I just received this Revlon hot air brush and I love it! I was afraid that it might be too heavy or loud as other reviewers complained about but not at all! Compared to a regular blow drier which feels very heavy and loud this Revlon Shine enhancing Hot Air Kit feels like a feather (maybe not as light but you get the comparison right?) and for having 1200 watts is surprisingly not too loud. I previously  bought the Infinity Pro Rotating hot air brush by Conair and was very disappointed. The bristles are too soft, it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair and it&#x27;s not powerful enough for my type of hair. I have long  curly hair and  before using it I used a regular blow drier until it was about 80 to 90% dry because otherwise the &amp;#34;hot  air&amp;#34; is so cool that  I felt it would never dry my hair or would take forever. End result? A hot mess. It made my hair soooo frizzy. I did the right side with the Infinity Pro and the left side with the John frieda hot air brush and what a difference! The John frieda hot air brush left my hair noticeably better.  Even though they both have 500 watts for some reason the difference was huge. I think the Infinity Pro it&#x27;s still a good product but for people who have thin straight hair that just want to add some volume. After doing some research I realized that for my type of hair I needed a more powerful hot hair brush and that&#x27;s why I decided to give this Revlon hot air brush a chance. I haven&#x27;t done my full hair with it but wanted to test out the frequent complaints I saw such as weight and noise. I will update my review as soon I do my whole hair with it, can&#x27;t wait!</li>
            <li> Works just as promised</li>
            <li> I love this brush. It makes my hair look super healthy and shiny! It has three settings: hot-fast, hot-slow, &amp; cool-fast. The two different sized brushes are also great!</li>
            <li> this is the second Revlon Hot Air Kit I&#x27;ve purchased and both have had the same problem where the dryer and curl attachments don&#x27;t stay &amp;#34;clicked&amp;#34; into the base unit.  I have returned it.</li>
            <li> I love the way it points directly to the location for drying. It actually cuts down on my drying time and make my roots dry quicker.</li>
            <li> Pretty darned good for someone who is as uncoordinated as me!</li>
            <li> Works just as promised, came just in time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m terrible at using a round brush to blow out my hair. This styler is very helpful but you need to let your hair dry at least 80% before styling with this. I recommend it for anyone who is a hair novice like myself.</li>
            <li> i love this product cuz it is combination of hair dryer and styler. my hair is short, straight and thin. so i usually make round back of head and make straight front of my hair. this product do it well and makes more volume that i need.great.</li>
            <li> Purchased it less than two months ago and it doesnt work properly. It heats up and stop working. I bought a new one cause in brasil i gave mine which i had for over a year the same exactly one and it does work great, however this one came with problems and it is the worse thing i bought lately.</li>
            <li> I just got a new hairstyle...sort of a shoulder length bob look.  I typically have very long hair and have always used a straightener.  Of course at the salon they use a round brush that creates all this volume and bounce...I can NEVER duplicate that at home...until now!  I used this product for the first time tonight.  First of all...it&#x27;s so easy and quick to use.  My hair is so soft and has so much volume after using it I don&#x27;t need to do another thing to it.  I put a tad bit of pomade in my hair and off I go.  I would highly recommend this if you plan on using it to replace the round brush/hair dryer combo.  It creates the sleek/soft salon look we love :)</li>
            <li> I like everything about this hair dryer......don&#x27;t love it but like it.  I have not had anything like it so I&#x27;m still experimenting.  I have short hair so I think it doesn&#x27;t dry as fast as I would like .....I like that I can twrill the dryer and it lifts my hair in layers as I work my way down.  That&#x27;s where I think I don&#x27;t have experience .....so I can&#x27;t blame the dryer.......I just can&#x27;t seem to layer properly all over my head.  The dryer was perfect......condition.....I like that it doesn&#x27;t let my hair fly all over the place. (ionic).</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy from this seller again.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY ONE PROBLEM, it doesn&#x27;t have very much power and I wish I had known this before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;It would be ok for a baby&#x27;s head or perhaps a small animal</li>
            <li> I have had mine for about 7 years and it still works like brand new with almost daily use. I have a lot of layers and have medium length hair. I simply throw some mouse in it and let it partially air dry while getting ready in the mornings and then use the 1.5 in. Attachment for styling. It literally take 5 minutes for my hair to be blow dried and styled in one step. Saves me so much time and because the barrel is metal, it&#x27;s hot enough to style it like a curling iron does. The bristles on this attachment are also short so your hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck in it but work well to hold your hair in place. Absolutely love it! I cannot believe it&#x27;s so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> The only place I can ever find this is on Amazon. I always recommend this product when I get compliments on my hair,I tell people it&#x27;s because of my blow dryer. It lasts well over a year and I use mine daily on curly, coarse and very thick hair. I think I&#x27;m on my 4th/5th one. Actually the barrel is what winds up wearing out before the motor, which I could find a place to buy a replacement for just that.</li>
            <li> I had a brush/dryer for years and years, also made by Revlon.  My hair always looked great when I was done blow drying it. Recently, my dryer had been over heating and taking too long to cool down (keeping in mind that it&#x27;s almost ten years old).  So I went online to find another hair dryer just like it, and I found this one.  It&#x27;s as amazing as my old one and I love the bristles on the brush; it&#x27;s really soft to the scalp.  And I like the ice blue color.  It&#x27;s very stylish.  I love this dryer and it&#x27;s a lot easier than drying and using a standard brush at the same time.  Also, it&#x27;s less costly than buying a hair dryer AND then the rolling brush.  I don&#x27;t regret getting it at all.</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush. It&#x27;s a hair dryer, hair straightener and curler in one. It gives lots of volume and body to my hair.</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my older model by Revlon but this model is harder to turn on &amp; hard to change speeds.</li>
            <li> best product on the market to actually dry your hair while you style it. Doesn&#x27;t get caught in long hair. Fabulous, I have bought 5 (gifts) and everyone loves it. I bought my first one around 14 years ago or so. Finally died last year and Amazon to the rescue because all the other ones I bought in stores did not dry my hair and got caught in my hair. So thrilled to see it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The switch is sometimes difficult to move (flat ).  Otherwise works very well.</li>
            <li> The original model had a button where you could turn on and off the ionic feature. I have very thick, long, course hair and the original model would dry my hair in 45 minutes, smooth enough that I did not need a flat iron. It would even leave my fingertips feeling tingly, a sign of the ionic power. Eventually it died and I had to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and bought another, unfortunately Revlon has since changed the product. The newer model does not offer the turn on/off button and I guess the ionic feature is supposedly always on? The new one gives me the frizziest most horrible results so bad that even my flat iron cannot straighten my hair. I usually have to wear it in a bun for a day after before my flat iron will work out the semi-permanent kinks the new model leaves in my hair. The brush is horrible and cheap, I had to constantly screw the brush back together and eventually the screws fell out all the way and got lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They ruined the best dryer ever.</li>
            <li> Works great. Perfect for those who can&#x27;t seem to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other. Very noisy though and the tips get hot which makes changing them when hot sensitive to fingers. But I wouldn&#x27;t stop usIng it. Great results.</li>
            <li> I wore one out after daily use for 3 1/2 years.  When it broke I ordered two so I would have a backup.</li>
            <li> I love this! It really have the same effect as if I just when to the salon! Silky and frizz less!</li>
            <li> I have thin, curly, frizzy hair and this is the only straightener I&#x27;ve used successfully, for about 10 years now. It&#x27;s fast, and I can style it anyway I choose.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly it didnt have duel voltage so not able to use it in New Zealand maybe be good idea to state this when advertising product .</li>
            <li> If you have very curly hair like me you will fall in love with this product. All you do is take a section of your hair and roll it up like a roller.  Turn in on for 15 seconds un-role.  Roll it up again if not complete dry.  I never use a flat iron I just use this. Curly hair woman can not say this about any blow dryer.  It will take awhile to get use too.  It will give you body so if you want it straighter don&#x27;t roll it up.  Brush it slow underneath and ontop of your hair.  Try to get your roots straight first and then worry about the bottom of your hair.</li>
            <li> This saves me time and I only need one hand to dry and style my hair at the same time.  It gives my hair volume and shine, I would definetely recomend.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this styler and it IS loud and very hot.  Mine started smoking after about 45 seconds.  The other problem is that there are \\&quot;vents\\&quot; at the base of each roller insert which blow out heat which does not filter into the brush attachments.  This is probably meant to dissipate some of the heat however the result is that while you are trying to roll your hair, there is a lot of air being blown directly on the hair you are trying to roll.  If you have fine hair, you can&#x27;t get the hair to roll because there&#x27;s so much air being blown on the piece of hair you are working with.  It ends up being a big mess.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> I love this item!  I have very curly, frizzy thick hair which is terribly difficult to straighten.  I used to use a hair blow dryer and a brush, but I didn&#x27;t like how the brush ripped at my hair.  I bought this Revlon Hot Air Brush and it was gentle on my hair and it was so easy.  No flat iron straightener has ever worked as well for me.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also have NEVER had the overheating problem described by some of the other reviews. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So hot! could burn your hair, After I bought this one I tried to use it, it&#x27;s really hot, the brush is burn you can smell of burning rubber. I can&#x27;t take a risk use it. So I throw it away no point keeping it because I never going to use it.&lt;br /&gt;#DON&#x27;T BUY IT.#</li>
            <li> I use this constantly.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> It works great!  Put some curl in my hair!</li>
            <li> This is great for my curly frizzy hair.  It dries and calms the frizzies at the same time.</li>
            <li> Love it makes me look like I&#x27;ve had a pro blow out</li>
            <li> This dryer worked great but was just too hot. I really wanted to love it but it burned my scalp and forehead. No problem returning though. Prompt credit to my account. I will be trying a different model.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  My hair is really thick and coarse and I usually have to use my flat iron to curl to my hair.  But with this product, if I blow dry from wet (towel dried), I can achieve really great waves and volume that I have previously been unable.  Have to use anti-frizz serum because of my type of hair, but I 100% reccommend this product!  Such a worthwhile purchase.  I love it. It takes some finessing, but with practise you wont have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> I really have problems blow drying my hair straight without getting frizz, so I decided to buy a hot air dryer. Unfortunately, this doesn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s not difficult to hold or handle, but it makes my hair frizzier than a hair dryer. Back to the drawing board!</li>
            <li> I have used this brand and type blower for close to ten years, the best one I have found.  The only thing that would make it better would be the choice of a fatter brush instead of a smaller one.  You get two brushes, but the smaller one is useless for me and even the larger one could be wider.  When I first discovered it, I called it my \\&quot;magic wand\\&quot;.  It is so nice to have a free hand to handle the hair instead of brush in one hand and hairblower in the other when doing your own hair.  I found this brand has the best blower and the option of a quick switch to cool if it gets too hot or you want to set it better.  Not all have the cool button and I love that feature.  Eventually, they might burn out and one I had years ago did it right away (which I returned).  Others have worked for years.  I ran over my gym bag with the car and crunched the one I&#x27;m replacing, although the motor still works.  I still wish, though, that it had a bigger (fatter) brush.  One last comment:  I find this item difficult to find in any my local stores; The drugstore where I originally purchased it is no longer here.</li>
            <li> I bought this at another store because I had to see what I was buying. I used it for the first time last night and I love it. When I have time I wait until my hair is just damp to dry it to minimize damage. I was able to dry my very thick, curly, frizzy hair on the low setting! The power and I guess the ion styling dried it very quickly and the way I wanted it. The brush can get very warm so I just keep the brush moving. It is great for those of us who have a hard time with blow dryer and brush! I also loved the powerful wattage.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, course hair and this tool smooths out my hair and makes getting ready much quicker.  I used to have to blow dry my hair and then straighten it out.  This tool does both and gives a nice lift that I used to be only able to get from my hairdresser.  Even my husband has commented several times on how nice my hair looks now. Definitely would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite!  I had this a few years ago. Purchased two similar dryers, and hated them. I am happy to be usinf this styler again. I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> The more I use this product the better I like it, but because I am not good with hair I struggle for some time until I get the results I want.  i think anyone who is good with hair or has at least shoulder length hair might find it a little easier.    I like the idea that without the brushes you can use it as a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy one of the hot brush dryer when I tried out my friend&#x27;s once. It worked so well on my hair and straightened it wonderfully. I don&#x27;t know if it is gonna be damaging to the hair tho. I try not to over dry my hair with it. It is very convenient and help me detangle my hair better.</li>
            <li> The Revlon hot air dryer and styler is the best invention.  I cannot handle a dryer and a separate brush so this solves my problem.  I used to use electric rollers (have hundreds of them) but using this hot air dryer and styler lets me do my hair, including drying it to damp with a regular dryer, in about 12 minutes.  Plus the bristles are great--they hold hair better than Conair rubber type bristle.  I&#x27;d give it six stars if possible.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I wish I had known about this years ago.  I have short layered hair that is incredibly thick but lays very flat.  I was afraid it would take forever to dry as I use a much more powerful regular blowdryer.  This takes no time at all and I usually turn it down before I am finished.  I get all day body and shine that is amazing without using any other products except hair spray to finish it off.  It only took a few times to figure out how to best use it but I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Did a good job straightening one of my clients hair, she has naturally curly hair, but it is not as powerful as I expected it to be. It gets louder on the cool and high setting but blows about equally as hard as it does in the low setting which was disappointing, but over all its a great purchase and makes round brushing a lot easier.</li>
            <li> This is a great smoothing product for frizzy and thick hair. The final result is a smooth, soft finsihed look without the use of additional styling tools like hot rollers or a curling iron. You can go from damp hair to the best look possible in half the time with this Revolon ionizer. The ion aspect helps keep hair from dryness and breakage. Also, this product has a super high wattage comapaired to those I have found in discount stores. It is 1500 watts compared to the typical 500-700 watts in stores. It is great if you have a thick, wavy or frizzy hairstyle and works well if let your hair air dry and want to style it and skip the hair drying process.</li>
            <li> Great product for as long as it lasted. part that holds brushes in place broke after only l month use</li>
            <li> This brush dries my hair faster than any other hair dryer I&#x27;ve used and also makes my frizzy/unruly/curly hair completely smooth.  It straightens my hair but still gives it more volume than when I use a flatiron to straighten it.</li>
            <li> Bristles are too short.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used many of these &amp; felt Revlon offered the best. They generally lasted 2 yrs. Then the past couple years they deteriorated more quickly, from brushes slipping off to just burning out. This one now takes the take. Purchased in March 2015, as of Aug 18, 2015, the electrical box that plugs into the wall completely fell apart with pieces falling out everywhere. On closer look it almost appears some of the plastic had been melting so clearly this was defective from the start. Who knows where these are made but clearly QC has plummeted &amp; how they kept the price down. Time to try a new brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this contraption for, not kidding, at least 10 years, and it has never crapped out on me. I&#x27;ve been using it with the 1.5-inch barrel, and it&#x27;s just great. I recently took it on a business trip and while in my checked bag, it got broken. By that I mean the the clip that holds the barrel onto the base broke, so the barrel won&#x27;t stay on the base. I put a ton of super glue on it and am waiting for it to dry. If that doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll absolutely order another one.</li>
            <li> This is the best invention ever.  It is super easy to get the height and curl I want without a lot of effort.  The secret is using it correctly.  Use a blow dryer (or air dry your hair) to about 75% dry, then switch to the hot air brush to style.  Your hair will take the curl as it finishes drying in no time.  My hair is super thick, and I ONLY use the low setting.  Not only is the volume lower, but there is still plenty of hot air and I am not burning anything - meaning my hair or the motor.  This model is great because you are also getting the ionic technology which helps keep your hair from becomming frizzy.  This is a win-win all the way around.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Target to replace my brush-styling iron that broke.  I hated this right away but have continued to use it to try to learn to like it.  It&#x27;s not working.  I&#x27;m going to have to give it away and replace it with another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it does very well is dry your hair, add volume and smooth it.  So it&#x27;s probably great for thick, curly hair.  What it does poorly is curl.  When I try to curl my hair, it tends to just blow the hair sections away from the wand.  The plastic brush bristles are too soft to hold my thin, fine hair securely so I miss more than I can curl.  It takes FOREVER to curl my hair because I have to keep going over and over it to get all the places that blew away from the wand.  The finished style has nice volume but pretty darned straight.  Since my hair is straight to begin with, that&#x27;s not helpful to me.</li>
            <li> ok, i ordered this product and never once received it, so i wanted a refund but never once got it back. so disappointed, this product would be rated a 5 because i used to have this product when i was back in high school but the expeirence i could do without!</li>
            <li> The whole unit is really bulky and quite large.  I tried it once and put it away.  Maybe some day when I have a lot of time to mess with my hair, I&#x27;ll take another stab at it.  Kinda funny..I bought this to save me time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer over a year ago and that dryer was terrible - even dangerous !&lt;br /&gt;The switch just would not shut off most of the time. It would get stuck and you couldn&#x27;t lower the heat or turn it off when you had your hair wound up in it.  Really drove me nuts and burned me a few times. I mean you couldn&#x27;t even shut the switch off sometimes using two hands, or two thumbs!&lt;br /&gt; I finally ditched that one and was hesitant to by another one but couldn&#x27;t find any others with the round brush that had at least 1000 watts so it could actually dry your hair instead of just blowing warm air.&lt;br /&gt;Read some positive reviews on this and thought I&#x27;d give it another try.  Glad I did because the second one I purchased actually works great and has no problems with the switch.  I can thumb the switch easily to low or cold, or on or off, while rolling my hair up in it, straight drying, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This is the way it&#x27;s supposed to work!  I&#x27;ve actually just ordered a third one so I have a spare for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I like this dryer because you can dry hair with it as well as style it.  And  you can dry your hair straight or style and curl it while drying.  Great for traveling when you don&#x27;t have room for packing a set of curlers too!</li>
            <li> LOVE!  This replaces my blow dryer and curling iron!  Love how it dries, curls, and gives my hair volume with just ONE tool.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, down to my shoulder blades, and it&#x27;s pretty curly.  I used to have to blow it out and then curl it to make sure I didn&#x27;t look like a troll doll.  And it would take me AN HOUR to do that.  AN HOUR.  This cuts my styling time down to a half hour.  My curls aren&#x27;t as perfect as if I use a curling iron, but I still look pretty fab if I do say so myself.  And I don&#x27;t get bored and stop halfway through, the way I do when I have to blow it out and curl it.  Bonus.  UPDATE: I bought this about a month or two ago and it just died.  Its cheaper than a blowout, so I&#x27;m buying again, but buyer beware...</li>
            <li> I bought my Revlon styler after being tired of having to blow dry my hair with a regular hair dryer, it would take ages.&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I was affraid it would not work out for my hair, my hair is thin, but I have a lot of hair and pretty curly.&lt;br /&gt;In the 1st use I was in love with it, my mom used mine and ended up buying on for herself, I also had 2 other friends who liked mine and decided to purchase one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly indicate this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I got my dryer on time and as described. It works great,the heating is great and it dries my hair evenly. The styles last and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry like other dryers i have used. I am really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the same model number as described in the product description.  I received the RV-7497 which does not have an ION on/off switch with light.  It does have the ION technology and am happy with it. I purchased this as a replacement for the same brand/styler which wore out after several years of daily use.  I believe this is a newer model than the one shown in the product description as the one I had purchased several years ago was the model with the ION switch. This is the best of the hot air styling brushes I have tried and it is a good value.  I was happy to find it on Amazon.com after not being able to find it at my local retailer.  I deducted one star from my rating because it is a bit louder than I would like it to be.  Since you have to hold it closer to your head than a regular hair dryer and especially when you are holding it near the ear....it would be nice if they could reduce the sound.</li>
            <li> Its good to see the shape / Curls this product gives.&lt;br /&gt;I am not getting a proper blowdry as i haven&#x27;t tried to blowdry before. I have done only once or twice my lifetime but this product gives more interest to try it out.</li>
            <li> Works Great also great for short hair.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair styling hot air dryer.</li>
            <li> I have used several of these curler/blow dryer products over the years and have really liked them. As a mater of fact I have had a hard time replacing the one I blew out in Europe.  My hair is short curly and the latest products blow so hard the curling element can&#x27;t hold the hair on the brush.  One I had to return overheated to a dangerous point.  I would love it if  someone put out the older style.</li>
            <li> wish there was an option of giving 0 stars..........The bristles got burnt the moment i switched it on............terrible product........was so looking forward to using it........very dissapointed</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot. Really dries and curls fast, so using it saves lots of time and gives good results.</li>
            <li> I swear by this hair styling tool. It is fairly easy to get used to handling, and you accomplish drying and curling at the same time.  I like that the cord swivels so it doesn&#x27;t get it the way as you move around using it.  I make soft, shiny waves with the larger barrel brush, which I prefer for myself.  I also like the COOL shot after I&#x27;ve done styling, which locks in the curl.  Well, that plus a little hairspray :-)  I had to buy a whole new one after I messed up my kit&#x27;s larger barrel brush while trying to clean it (I pulled the bristles out of place).  My point is, Revlon does not sell the parts separately, so if that is one is messed up or lost, you have to purchase a whole new kit.  I don&#x27;t really know if the &amp;#34;Ionic&amp;#34; feature is real or just marketing, but I don&#x27;t really care - this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> How it works:  3 settings: High, Low and Cool (the high and low are warm air and the cool blows out the same amount of air as the high setting, but it&#x27;s cool air, not warm).  3 attachments:  small brush, large brush and hard plastic &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; (focus attachment).  Use the High with the focus attachment to dry your hair.  Use the low with the small brush for making curls (use when hair is damp, not wet).  Use the low with the large brush for styling, volumizing, larger curls or waves or for straightening.  I don&#x27;t know when you would ever use the cool setting, but I suppose some people might find a use for it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this as an &amp;#34;at-home&amp;#34; styler or as a &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; styler and dryer.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a dryer unless you didn&#x27;t have a normal hair dryer.  Even though air comes out faster on the high speed than on the low speed, it doesn&#x27;t blow your hair as well as a real hair dryer.  BUT it would definitely be a life saver if you were on vacation and had a hotel with no hair dryer in the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like about it:  Easy to attach and unattach the attachments.  Cord swivels as you turn the main part.  2 speeds,  Doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair.  The Low setting doesn&#x27;t blow your hair every which way while you are setting it.  The temperature is perfect.  Not too hot, but just warm enough.  Doesn&#x27;t overheat your hair like a curling iron can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had an earlier model of this one, but I melted the bristles when I accidentally plugged it in to my power adapter in Germany, instead of my power converter.  So if you travel out of the country, don&#x27;t use a power adapter.  An adapter just changes the plug so you can use their plugs.  You would need a power converter which steps down the power from 220 to 110.  (I take one converter and 2 or 3 adapters when I travel), plus 2 of those plugs that turn one plug into 3 - off subject, I know. Sorry.</li>
            <li> I use this every day!  Depending on how long your hair is you can blowdryer and style all at the same time and not have to curl!!</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s old Hair Dryer died one day and I hear her say, Honey &amp;#34;Buy me a new one&amp;#34;. So what does a good husband say??? You find it, I&#x27;ll buy it&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon to the rescue once again.  And yes, the wife loves it.</li>
            <li> good. no problem.like it</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it was delivered on time. So useful for me because it gives me the opportunity to blow dry my hear with style, not just being flat.</li>
            <li> This hot air kit is even more functional than a hair dryer! By switching to the come like tools, you could style your hair more effectively!</li>
            <li> Adds a lot of fullness to my style.</li>
            <li> It is awesome.  I love it.</li>
            <li> After using the new red model on high the plastic melted. The older blue model is fantastic, get that instead.</li>
            <li> My husband actually complimented my hair.  This product can give your hair as much or as little drama as you are looking for.  I&#x27;m trying to treat my hair a little more gently these days, so I mostly use the cooler setting, but if I&#x27;m in a hurry I can kick up the heat.  The brushes catch my thin hair just enough without tangling.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s salon quality, but it makes my hair look natural, only better.  Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> My old one broke and so I read all the reviews for the different brands of this type of hot air curler and was totally confused.  This one did not get high ratings but I went with it because it is the same brand as my old one.  I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is the noise but then this of type of curler is always loud especially on high.</li>
            <li> This thing is just way too hot ! It steam burned my scalp on just damp hair , I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Worst ever!  The heat is way too high.  Burns my hair.  If I use a different setting, it doesn&#x27;t even do anything for my hair!  Was away, and now I can&#x27;t return it.  Very upset with myself!  Do not buy this, unless you want to cry your hair and hand!</li>
            <li> As always with Amazon, order processing was fast and item was received within estimated time.  I&#x27;ve had a number of these blow dryers but this one Is my favorite..  I would recommend to one &amp; all.</li>
            <li> This type of brush works best for me to have smooth straight hair. But the quality of the product is worse than ever expected- it falls apart before even me touching it: the plastic tip on the brush would not hold at all And the brush hardly stays in its place while I dry my hair: I have to hold it from the plastic tip by my other hand so that it does not fall down, and every minute I have to bend down to the floor in order to pick up the plastic tip. It has to be there, otherwise the brush is too hot  to touch. My first same item broke quickly, so I have been using this one for about a year. I and get nervous each time I have to use it. Unfortunately there are no many alternative products with the same brush. I hope I find a better brand some day (currently looking).</li>
            <li> I had a previous version of this item (same brand, same style)that worked great for years.  It finally died and I ordered this one.  Two weeks after the return window expired, it stopped putting out heat completely.  Now I&#x27;m out $23, sadly.</li>
            <li> This dryer does work very well. I like to use a larger diameter curling brush otherwise I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> The rotating barrel doesn&#x27;t lock in place - or slips and starts spinning without pressing the unlock button.  Not very warm,takes quite a long time to get a strong curl on even dry hair. Fine for super-fast touch ups, but that&#x27;s about it.  Happy it was only $20, but I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought it!</li>
            <li> Terrible quality. I took this out of the box and turned it on. It over-heated within a minute. I could smell it. I unplugged it and put it up til the next day. When I plugged it in, it would not even turn on. UGH what a waste of time. I should have believed the reviews from others.</li>
            <li> I first bought the Infinitipro Spin Air Rotating Styler.  What it came down to was the bristles didnt grab my hair and I didnt care for the rotator. Anyway, I returned it and bought this one. Its not perfect, but I like it enough to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked about this dryer is the extra nozzle attachment.  With this, you could potentially get rid of any other dryer you have. Use this nozzle first, as you would your normal dryer, to remove alot of the moisture. Just a quick dry. Then install the barrel. The nozzle gets VERY HOT. Removing it right after using it is dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles on the barrel are separated enough to grab my hair (and I have fine hair-doesnt take much). I do find myself using my hand to wrap the ends just where I want them - the bristles could be a little longer. I also wish the barrel were bigger. The bigger one is the smallest brush I would buy. The mini barrel is useless. I threw it away as soon as I opened the package.  I&#x27;m hoping the manufacturer will come out with some larger barrel attachments - 2\\&quot; would be great.  I get more voulme using the traditional brush/dryer method, but this is a little easier to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ergonomics of it. Unlike the bulky Spin Brush, its shaped well to fit your hand.  And you aren&#x27;t accidently pushing buttons.  The heat selector is a bit tough to push. At first I had to stop and put it down to change the heat setting, but after a few pushes back and forth, it doesn&#x27;t require quite as much thumb power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can dry my hair pretty fast - about 20 minutes from start to finish. I have relatively straight, fine hair and I still need several small sections to dry properly, but it does dry quickly. Most likely because of the heat - this thing is HOT. I put it on low once I get to the fragile ends. Low is still pretty hot. I suggest you spray heat protectant on your hair first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is loud as some reviewers suggested, but I wouldn&#x27;t say itsear piercing and compared to my old dryer, I don&#x27;t notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this little dryer. It&#x27;s not too expensive, and does a good job of drying my hair fast while still giving me volume.  I hope Revlon improves the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! It is the best hair dryer ever for thin, limp hair. I have purchased this four times already over the last ten years. Three out of four worked fine and for quite a long time. One of them had a tendency to shut itself off, meaning it was overheating, so I tossed it, but the others have been fantastic. It is very lightweight and for me, that is a bonus since I have had rotator cuff surgery on both shoulders. The curling while drying eliminates the curling iron out of my morning routine and that sure saves a lot of time. It lends limp air a lot of body, since you can hold the curler part very close to your scalp and lift the hair easily. I highly recommend this and am about to buy another to keep on hand in case my current one dies after being used daily for over two years.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchase for my wife. The first one lasted 2 years and finally overheated and died.&lt;br /&gt;Two years looked fine, so I decided to purchase a new one, despite of the bad reviews. But this time it only lasted two months, until it overheated and died too.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the money, even if it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I got it since my bff recommended, ( I have medium thick to coarse loose curly and wavy hair prone to immense frizz) but I don&#x27;t like it for the following reason -&lt;br /&gt;1. It is super noisy.&lt;br /&gt;2. The bristles on the brush are tiny, wiggly and cheaply made and wont hold my hair and the bristles just slide on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;3. Since it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair it doesn&#x27;t flip the edges.&lt;br /&gt;4. The heat setting is hot or cold no warm setting. The hot setting can go slow and fast but the cold setting doesn&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;5. I have always used it on my 80 % dry hair and it took me forever to set my hair. Not sure if it is capable of drying towel dried hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Conair instant heat hot brush for past 7 years and it is a better buy than this, coz it doesn&#x27;t make any noise and the bristles are sturdy and long enough to hold my hair and does the job in under 10 min.</li>
            <li> I had been using a blow dry and a brush. The process was very awkward,  The RV 440 C 1200 Watt Iconic Hot Air Dryer is not only offers a much easier technique, it also achieves the straight (no curls) effect I like.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product because a friend at work had one and told me how great it was, and she was not lying..it&#x27;s the fastest way to blow dry and style my hair at the same time....love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this thing!  I use the bigger brush attachment in lieu of the hair dryer and brush I used to use.  Once I got the hang of using it (there was a little bit of a learning curve), it was much faster than the dryer.  More body, less mousse and root lifter.  My husband says my hair looks like my stylist has done it every day!  I have recommended it already to others!</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair cut - it is a pretty short bob - just below my chin. I was having a hard time getting the lift by my roots with just a hairdryer and a brush. I found this item and wasn&#x27;t sure about it - I was scared my hair might get tangled in the brush and that the heat would be too much by my scalp. None of this happened. I keep it on the medium setting and have gotten that great lift and bounce that I was looking for. My hair is super straight and pretty thick and very very flat, it&#x27;s hard for me to get any sort of volume to it - and this hot air brush fully did the trick. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> My Wife loves it.&lt;br /&gt;She no longer has to put up her hair in curlers etc etc.&lt;br /&gt;She has had so many comments about how lovely her hair looks.</li>
            <li> What this thing does for you is more than amazing.  it smooths your hair out and takes away all the frizz in seconds..  It looks like you had your hair done professionally every single day.  Now that is worth every single penny.  I don&#x27;t know how I ever managed without this thing.</li>
            <li> It creates the same style as my flat iron but without drying out my hair or frizzing it out. My hair is soft and shiny and I am 50. So I would really recommend this item. Great quality too! Great prize! A+++++++++</li>
            <li> Great for shoulder length, layered hair. One accessory does it all - dries, curls, smooths and provides volume. The 1200 watts is great for gettng hair &amp;#34;damp dry&amp;#34;, then pop on the proper brush size and style away. Quality product, great price and fast delivery...AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> Works great for styling and drying your hair, the multiple settings and different attachments are a plus. I  am very pleased with this products performance and would highly recommend it to anyone lookinig for a hot air brush.</li>
            <li> She loves it! She had one before it broke and she was devastated. But then I just got Her a new one.</li>
            <li> It is too hot for me.</li>
            <li> Great tool! So much easier than using both hands- one for hair dryer &amp; the other for a brush!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it  she started to use it the very day she got it .. Compact stylish... working fine.to her...</li>
            <li> This Dryer and Styler is absolutely amazing! It is so easy to to dry with this light weight dryer and a round brush to smooth my hair. Then the styler brush is great for adding a little curl. I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a few years, it is awesome! I have thick curly hair, this does a great job of minimizing the time I spend to straighten it. I cannot say enough good things about mine. I really recommend this to my curly haired sisters that have felt the pain of having to hold up the hair dryer and the round brush for what seems like hours. This cuts time in half for me!</li>
            <li> This hot air dryer is a great deal....price is great &amp; it works great...gives my hair extra volume when I use it....I did try one more expensive brand (where the brush actually spins....but my hair got caught in it too often so I returned it).  I like that this one comes with 2 different barrel sizes....great buy.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and could not find in my local stores.  Great price, works on any length of hair for blow drying and styling. Very fast shipping.  I was very pleased!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference until the 5th sweep. :(</li>
            <li> A friend had this on vacation and I had to have it It is a great product have to be careful as it gets hot on high</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!  Not only does it work amazingly, it&#x27;s fun to work with.  I have long thick and somewhat unruly hair and this works like a charm.  I don&#x27;t use this to dry my hair - rather I use it to style.  I just light mist my hair so it&#x27;s not completely dry.  It tames the unruly parts and leaves my hair smoothe and shiny.  It&#x27;s also easy to use - if you can use a curling iron, you can use this.  And it is fun - you can curl one way then another and it acutally changes the curl vs. leaving some weird mix that just makes your hair stick straight out as it will if you try this with a curling or flat iron.  Totally worth the price and I have already recommended this product to my daughters and several friends.  I just wish they had invented this sooner.</li>
            <li> It is great, better than anything else I own. Easy to use, and I highly recommend this product. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> It takes so much longer to dry your hair with this thing than it does to blow dry it with the Revlon Ion Dryer and then straighten your hair with a straightner.  I really do not think that this is a good purchase because it takes so much time to dry your hair.  (it took me 25 min. to dry my hair and it doesn&#x27;t even go past my ears)</li>
            <li> The first day I used this brand new dryer, it overheated after 5 minutes and never turned back on.  Blow in it to cool it down?  Forget it!  I&#x27;d hyperventilate trying to cool it off enough to use it again.  It would be easier to grow an extra arm and be able to hold a regular dryer in one hand and a round brush in the other, and use the new hand to separate the sections.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by the negative reviews that this dryer has gotten.  I bought it at Target a little over a month ago and so far, it&#x27;s the best 20 bucks I ever spent.  It was between this one and the Conair version...I went with the Revlon one because of the higher wattage and bigger brush size.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have long (halfway past the shoulders), thick Asian hair and it takes about 30 minutes to completely dry which is a miracle.  Like any new hair appliance, it took some practice/experimenting to style my hair the way I wanted it.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There was an instance where the dryer wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all, but that was because I accidentally hit the reset button on the dryer&#x27;s plug so it took a bit for it to come back on again (this is indicated on the Notice tag attached to the dryer).  I haven&#x27;t touched the reset button since then and the dryer has worked fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, I haven&#x27;t had the overheating issue described by some of the users.  I use the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting in the initial \\&quot;brush-through\\&quot; and then I leave it on \\&quot;low\\&quot; after that...maybe that&#x27;s why it hasn&#x27;t overheated?  I try to leave it on \\&quot;low\\&quot; because the \\&quot;high\\&quot; and \\&quot;cool\\&quot; settings are quite loud, which is why I&#x27;ve rated it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at the negative reviews this products has received. I, too, purchased this item at Target, but I could not be happier with the results. I have very thick, curly hair and it usually takes me at least a half hour to get it dry with a normal hairdryer.  Usually by the time I did the front and sides the back had dryed in an unflattering shape. No more...with this little gem, I simply wind the hair around the brush and roll it up to my scalp, hold it for a few seconds then roll it out. It works more like a curling iron than a brush, and I wonder if some of the folks who have rated it badly were using it incorrectly. With this tool, it takes less than 10 minutes to fully dry my hair (which goes well past my shoulders), and turns out perfectly every time. My hair used to be flat and lifeless, and now feels soft and moisturized...it reminds of a few years ago when those caruso steam curlers were in fashion (remember those?) and they made your hair super soft. It&#x27;s the same feeling with this brush, but much easier to manage, and quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tip for those who complained about overheating...after I was done with the initial styling, I turned the brush off, waited about a minute, then turned it on to the \\&quot;cool setting\\&quot; and lightly brushed my hair with it. That seemed to give me the blast of cool air I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t stress enough that this product is a miracle in a box, five stars are not enough. If you are at all on the fence about buying it, get it immediately! I have been recommending it to every woman I know. I just wish I had discovered it sooner.</li>
            <li> I am now on my second one.  I love the results it gives me, and it&#x27;s easy to use--though I agree, seriously, that if you are using the high setting you should wear earplugs--it really is that loud.  But the first one died after maybe 3 months, and the second one, after a few months, now only heats a little bit, so I guess it&#x27;s dying too.  I asked my hairdresser, and she said Revlon appliances were known for not lasting.  Frustrating!  I want to find something that works well, has no animal bristles (let&#x27;s not kill them for fashion!), and will LAST.  At least this has a one-year warranty, but I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to get them to honor it.  Made by Helen of Troy, so I don&#x27;t want to buy Helen of Troy products now either.  Oh well...</li>
            <li> Avoid this product - it cannot be used for more than 3 minutes without overheating. I used mine twice - for about 3.5 minutes each time. This includes shutting the unit off and on to reposition it. The third day I used it, it started to smoke! It is a piece of junk made with poor quality parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this before and should have known this wouldn&#x27;t last any longer, there would be no improvements. The top piece has already been popping off andthe attachment has already started falling off like my last one. It is such a good dryer for my hair to dry and style at the same time, but they don&#x27;t last. I&#x27;ve only had this one a little over a month and it&#x27;s already probably on numbered days.  Wish they would pay attention to complaints and improve on the item.</li>
            <li> A Hot Air Brush will help in controlling the frizz.  Using a flat iron afterwards makes a huge difference.  I had to return this Hot air brush after two weeks because it no longer heated.  The fellow at the store told me that they have had problems with this item.  I purchased a different brand after the return.</li>
            <li> This Hot Air Kit was given for Christmas to a family member who had requested it. She loves it and raves about how it saves her so much time styling her hair and doesn&#x27;t need to have anymore additional &amp;#34;toys&amp;#34; to fix her hair.  It&#x27;s everything she needs wrapped into one great product.  Way to go, Revlon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third one of these.  The question is why do I keep buying it?  Well, the attachments are great, the hot and cool settings are perfect and (when it works) it does a great job styling my hard-to-style hair.    The first one I bought didn&#x27;t work right out of the package and I returned it.  The second one worked for about 4 months, then finally died while I was on vacation.  The one I have now screams louder than any hair dryer you&#x27;ve ever heard, and after about three minutes you can see a bright flare-up inside the unit and the heating element is done for the day.  It still blows cool air, but it would take about 20 minutes to do the other half of my head that isn&#x27;t styled yet.  A half-done head of hair doesn&#x27;t really suit my sense of style.    Great product design, lousy innards.  I&#x27;m off on a search to find one that actually works.  If I&#x27;d bought a more expensive one off the bat, would I have actually saved?  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> It was good just not for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> It is very suitable for my hair curly but in my electricity will become 220-250 volts instead of 110 volts could not be used</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years!...I am no good with the blow dryer in one hand and a brush in the other....not happening!!,......love this thing!</li>
            <li> would buy again and again. really great for styling.</li>
            <li> Curling iron and hair dryer in one. It&#x27;s really brilliant. Works like a charm. I&#x27;ll never use a curling iron again.</li>
            <li> Nice item but not what I needed. It&#x27;s difficult to separate and wind hair on it. Maybe good for someone who is extremely good with their hands - I&#x27;m good but found this difficult.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but has blown a fuse ever 1/4 times of use. I do like it, I am upset that I accidentally stepped on one of the attachments and it&#x27;s ruined.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that the round brush spinned while drying.  It doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this styler; although doesn&#x27;t give very smooth and freeze free results it is a nice tool to get great volume and very nice and defined curls.&lt;br /&gt;The only think I can complain about is that the motor is quite noisy; you have to use it closed doors or without anyone in the house; I wonder if the manufacturer could add a better motor or less noisy; I have not seen any other styling tools like this one.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to prep your hair with the right products; for curl definition I really like Aussie Curl Define mousse; very niche and light weight product that doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> I hate almost all hair dryers; I love this one! It&#x27;s fast, it doesn&#x27;t require much coordination (great for the mornings...yawn!) and when I&#x27;m done, my hair has volume and shine.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to get good with this new hair dryer/curling iron, but with more use I am getting better....</li>
            <li> I like this product as a blow dryer. The brushes didn&#x27;t work quite well for me as I have tones of wavy hair. Perhaps I don&#x27;t have enough practice using this with brushes that don&#x27;t roll on their own so it was unpractical to dry my hair using the attachable stationery brushes. I&#x27;m assuming it works well for folks with fine and straight hair, but for gals like me, with tones of wavy hair, the brushes just couldn&#x27;t handle my hair. But is a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I adore this hairdryer!  For someone like me who isn&#x27;t a very good stylist, this dryer with a brush makes an enormous difference!  I have two!</li>
            <li> great product. I would tell a friend about this product. this is awesome its a great gift it does what is says</li>
            <li> Takes a little more time to dry my hair but it&#x27;s smoother and I don&#x27;t need the flat iron anymore.</li>
            <li> Live it, it is Easy to use, convenient ,efficient ,fast&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate for support after purchase&lt;br /&gt;I would be a forever customer</li>
            <li> This Dryer and Styler is ideal for my hair. It is much easier to use than a round brush and dryer separately like the professional stylists do. I could not do without it.</li>
            <li> This hot air dryer brush does add shine to my hair,easy to hold and is well made..I purchased this one and a similar Revlon brush which I also like but this is my favorite..</li>
            <li> I had a hot air brush simular to this one years ago. I had it for at least 5 years, but when I moved out I left it for my mom who shared it with me. I wanted to get another one so I started shopping for one. I saw that the John Frieda hot air brush had good reviews so I went with it. I got it and was trying to like it but it took such a long time to dry my thick curly hair and when I was done it looked frizzy and dry. So I returned it and went with this one (which is much simular to the one I had years back. It works great. Gets pretty hot and drys my hair quickly. When complete my hair is left shiny and has some body and curl. I purchased this tool because I have 2 kids and one on the way, I don&#x27;t have time to spend on my hair. It does what I need it to. I wait for my hair to be almost dry and then I blow dry it. Takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Awesome for getting a near salon blow out! I have slightly wavy hair and have always dealt with some frizz but with this dryer you can get a near perfect blow out. My attachments stay on. I blow dry the roots of my hair first with a regular hair dryer and then finish the rest of my hair with the Revlon tool. I agree that on the highest setting the dryer is way too loud and you cannot move the switch with one finger. That being said it&#x27;s an excellent value and for the first time in my life I have straight frizz-free hair on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> I have this brush dryer. I have been using brush dryers for 16 years and have owned several different brands and types. All tend to overheat and don&#x27;t last as long as regular dryers, but this one is the worst one I have owned. It tends to over heat and just shut down. Then one cannot use it until it cools down. If you use it, turn it off and then try to use it again, it often won&#x27;t turn back on. It is also often difficult to hold because it gets so hot. I have even smelled burning hair even though I clean it. If I take the brush off and use the \\&quot;dryer,\\&quot; my hair gets sucked into it. When I can use it, it styles beautifully though.</li>
            <li> It works to straighten, and curl long wavy hair.  It is hotter than other brands (conair), which is why I buy it  But it does get VERY hot and has burned my skin.  Also, the handle can feel a bit loose from the hot wand part.</li>
            <li> I really thought the brushes were harder, that was a dissapointment, but in all it gets the job done. drys my hair well</li>
            <li> I love the fact that my hair doesn&#x27;t blow all over the place when trying to dry it anymore.  I also love that it takes about half the time to dry now. AND I can get a little style in it at the same time.  Great item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this curling iron/blowdryer!  Great curls, no tangling .... and I always get mine from Amazon!</li>
            <li> From the Mrs. here--This little hair tool is great!  I read many of the reviews saying that theirs was over-heating and I see now why.  The way this hair tool is designed could be improved.  If you put your hand over the end that needs to suck air--then yes--it will over-heat because it needs to push a lot of air into your hair.  It&#x27;s easy to do too.  I found myself covering that part as I was styling my hair, but it can also be easily avoided too.  Otherwise, this should work great if you don&#x27;t cover the air suction with your hand and it should never over-heat.  I had no problem with this at all once I realized I just had to hold it more towards the heated end rather than the base where it needs to suck air.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> i love the attachments but the handle is too short and your hand ends up on the air flow vents</li>
            <li> I do not have any hair volume, this gave me a healthy amount of volume, I love it! So much easier to use instead of using a hair dryer and a round brush. Usually my arm gets tired once I get to the crown and kind of give up. This dryer/styler is very light weight and really easy to use. My hair looks so good when I use this to dry and style.</li>
            <li> When I first got this brush, I really liked it. My hair never got tangled and the brush gave my hair lots of volume. Unfortunately, it stopped working after a month. When the cord would rotate around the base of the brush, there would be a blue spark in the base and it would randomly shut off. Not great quality.</li>
            <li> I can blow-dry my hair in 10 minutes with this dryer. I watched the reviews on YouTube and glad I invested in this affordable product. Does a great job and leaves my hair in great condition I get so many compliments when I use this to dry my hair now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my hair is pretty long, just below my chest.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as  the result of a &amp;#34;dual voltage&amp;#34; search.  I needed one for European travel.  While I love it here at home......it is very easy to use and reliable........BUT.........it is not dual voltage.  so.....5 stars for the item........1 star for the search engine</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else!  I have relatively thin hair and it dries and styles it within 5 mins.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Best style tool for anyone with thin/medium/thick hair. This tool is not a straightener, but as it dries your hair it creates lots of volume. I buy 2 at a time, I can&#x27;t live without it. It does break after a year or two but that should be expected with every day use. This product is definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had more hot air stylers than hot dinners, but this one beats the lot!  It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry my pretty thick hair, and does such a good job that I don&#x27;t need to re-do my hair the following day - what a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> I was hopping to be able to do my hair with the air brush with one hand. It takes me two hands. Gets a little to hot for my liking. Works well. I like my hair after using this hot air brush. Came on time. Works well.</li>
            <li> I found it a little heavy and awkward to use, and it really gets hot.  I am not yet used to it.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this blow dryer.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  Drys the hair fast and really straight.......and having the brush piece attached helps make the process easier than using a brush and blow dryer separately.  Blows my hair so straight I thought I was born with white womens hair, but I wasn&#x27;t because I&#x27;m a black woman. No racial pun intended.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a big advocate on blow drying the hair but when you have to have your hair just right or have someplace special to go.......I blow dry because I can control the styling better when I blow dry.  I&#x27;m not a hair dresser, just a woman that knows how to do her own hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;A great product for sure........for everyone!</li>
            <li> I use it everytime I wash my hair and think it works great!!!</li>
            <li> Product arrived today.  I washed my hair and couldn&#x27;t wait to dry/curl my hair.  It didn&#x27;t work!! Actually, it did.  I had to press the reset button although my GCFI was showing all was set to go. No matter, I don&#x27;t like the product.  It is VERY LOUD and VERY HOT even on the low setting.  It only has a high and low setting. But, no fear, Amazon is the BEST as far as returns go! I&#x27;ll keep shopping!</li>
            <li> The item description states that this hot brush has an ion on/of switch. I can&#x27;t use ion-generating tools on my hair because they DESTROY my hair in a way that my hair must be cut off. They basically turn my stick-straight hair into coarse, curly hair from down there. I&#x27;ve used previous models of this hot brush for about 15 years and love it, when I can turn off the ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning this item, and the search will go on for a non-ionic hot brush. Oh well.</li>
            <li> No I didnt work and it had a American plug on it so it will cost me 12.00 pound to send it back waste of money</li>
            <li> I love this hot air brush and have used one for years. It straightens or curls and you don&#x27;t need a flat iron, curling iron and/or curlers. Just this one tool. It works for long or short hair. Just change the end as needed.  It cools quickly so it is great for travel and is so inexpensive. Hurray!!</li>
            <li> My WAHL blower brush finally died. The same one is no longer available. This looked similar. But it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s flimsier. Not as strong so you can&#x27;t blow and pull hair hard enough to make it dry and straight. I have to use a flat iron after this. A bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have extensions that get super frizzy and unsightly when I blow dry them, so I decided to try this. It works great and leaves my extensions silky and smooth! It really is a great product &lt;3</li>
            <li> This product does not last long, keep that in mind if you have past shoulder length hair. Worked well for a few weeks and eventually the bristles started to bend.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this dryer. Wish that it didn&#x27;t get quite so hot but overall great value!! No more struggling to get hair dry.</li>
            <li> Its decent and does the job, but it does not have teh same punch as my original one. even though its the same model number i guess its the luck of the draw!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s perfect for volumizing your hair. I take it with me whenever I go. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with it</li>
            <li> Difficult to use for curling. Made a great general hair dryer though.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at CVS pharmacy, but it is this exact product.  I came to Amazon to purchase a second one to keep at my boyfriend&#x27;s place.  I have difficult hair which is not quite straight but not quite curly.  It does not smooth out well, it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well, and it lacks volume.  I&#x27;ve tried a multitude of styling techniques and products, and nothing really looks that good. Plus, it takes a long time to blow dry with a round brush, and it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it when the results aren&#x27;t that great.  I&#x27;ve tried curling irons, curling brushes, even flat irons (which totally scorched the ends of my hair).  I decided to try this tool because it was inexpensive and I thought what the heck.  I LOVE IT.  I have had it for a week and every day has been a GREAT hair day.  Here is the technique that I use- after shampooing, I use a leave in Garnier product for smoothing split ends, then I blow dry with a regular vented brush (not a round brush) until my hair is just damp.  Then I section my hair (top, middle, bottom).  I start at the bottom and use the Revlon tool to flip the bottom up.  When that part is dry, I let the middle section down and direction that area towards the back and bottom of my head.  Finally, I direct the top section back.  I smooth through the style with my fingers and use a mist of hairspray- it stays wavy, bouncy, the ends of my hair look smooth, and it holds the style ALL DAY LONG.  The whole process including blow drying and then using the Revlon tool once hair is just damp is about 20 minutes, as my hair is shoulder length.  I have had no issues with this over heating.  I use it on the low heat setting and it gets plenty hot to style my stubborn hair.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great for traveling.  I use it every day, traveling or ot.  It is lightweight and dries my hair quickly.  I want to get another one.</li>
            <li> product is as described</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this item but I am sending it back.  Why?  The bristles on both brush attachments are way too short and flimsy, making it almost impossible to get a good grip on your hair as you are styling it.  My hair is of medium thickness and slightly wavy -- normally very easy to work with -- but the bristles go flat when I try to grab even a small section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appliance also gets extremely hot and the &#x27;cool touch tip&#x27; is not long enough to protect your fingers when you try to hold it.  Plus, the air flow at the base of the brush goes out in all directions, completely undoing any previous styling efforts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a lot to like about this dryer.  The design is good -- lightweight, easy to use, I like that it doesn&#x27;t spin like other models and it has never gotten tangled in my hair, and you can change out the size of the brush (although, I almost always use only the larger brush).  I have long, thick, coarse, naturally curly/frizzy hair, and this dryer makes my hair shiny, smooth, and with a perfect curled-end flip.  It&#x27;s magazine-hair that is second only to my stylist&#x27;s blow outs.  I used to spend about 45 minutes blow drying my hair with a more typical dryer, then using either a flat iron or a curling iron to smooth it out...took forever.  This dryer saves a lot of time (it still takes me 25-30 minutes, but I have a lot of hair), and I love that it does two steps in one.  However, Amazon should put this item on their automatic shipping program!  The dryer has what seems to me to be a short lifespan -- I&#x27;m buying my third in two years.  I can only get a few good, perfectly functioning months out of one of these things, and after that it smokes and overheats so I have to keep switching back and forth to the &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting to keep it from scorching my hands and hair.  And let&#x27;s be clear: even though it takes 30 minutes to dry my hair, the dryer is hardly getting a workout.  I use it no more than once a week, so all told I get maybe 40 uses out of the thing before I have to replace it.  For now, I&#x27;ll keep buying it as the good outweighs the bad....but you better have a back-up dryer on hand for when this one dies halfway through the drying process!</li>
            <li> I generally like this, but I recommend getting the more expensive model as this one has metal which burns your skin if you touch it while styling your hair.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair. It has grown past my shoulder blades, near to my bra band.  I love this tool! It styled my hair in half the time. My sister has one and she loves hers, too. I wish I had bought it sooner</li>
            <li> My all-time favorite hair dryer.  I can style my hair very quickly and easily and it looks like I&#x27;ve stepped out of a salon.  It arrived quickly and as expected.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does and I get my hair dried pretty quickly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very useful, gives my hair more volume, everybody thinks my hair is thicker then it really is!&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is it gets very hot, even on the lower heat level, so I&#x27;m just careful with it, but otherwise it&#x27;s great.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased this hot air dryer &amp; styler.  I have had my original one for 5 or more years and it is great - this one that I just purchased has an added wand which is great too and I also purchased one for my daughter who loved mine and is so happy to have her own.  The reason I purchased a second one for myself is for a reserve, just in case something happens to the one I have.  Plus the new is a dryer also, so I quickly dry my hair that style it with the large attachment......My daughter and I have purchased others and they are not worth two cents.....I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> Use the thick brush and works great.</li>
            <li> Wished I could keep it, but even small curling barrel would not be awkward for me to use.  Good price.</li>
            <li> I am also surprised at the negative comments this has received.&lt;br /&gt;We (my daughter and I) purchased one each about 5 months ago from RiteAide and we have been so happy with this unit. We both have LONG (mine down to my waist, hers to 3/4 back) hair. Mine is fine and board straight, hers is thick and wavy.&lt;br /&gt;I use this unit to give some body and life to my hair and it works wonderfully!! I used to spend 30-45 minutes drying with a blow-dryer and round brush; setting it in hot rollers and then styling - total time took about an 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Now I spend 15-20 minutes and my hair looks amazing. I do use a syrum in the ends, but that is more to prevent split ends as my hair is very long.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter used to spend up to an hour drying her hair and then another 30-45 minutes using a straight iron; then another 30 minutes with a curling iron... Now she spends about 30-40 minutes and she has the same effect with out all the damage and all she uses is a little mousse.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Revlon!!!</li>
            <li> Gift for Mom for Christmas and she loves it! Move than what she asked for, but exactly what she needed.</li>
            <li> Replaced identical one that stopped working. On this one, the off/on control switch is very hard operate. Used WD40, sewing machine oil and silicone spray but nothing loosens it up. I have to take it out of my hair and sit it on my lap and press hard to change temperature.</li>
            <li> I had read it makes your hair smooth and shiny.  It left my hair frizzy and I still had to style my hair with something else.  So whats the point!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Because of the brush you are able to get better control and focus on the hot air flow. It does get very hot on the hottest setting, but dries hair quicker than most others and with less frizz. You can lower the settings as well. Someone with fine straight hair would probably be better with another dryer. For anyone with thick, coarse, curly hair like mine it&#x27;s the best. I love that it is a brush and dryer in one. Leaves hair smooth and can also curl if that is what you like. One hand is all you need. Love this styler.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Works awesome! Good heat and wattage</li>
            <li> I wish there were a barrel size between the two.  For my hair, the small one is too small and the big one is too big.</li>
            <li> The brush is great, does a great job. The button for the heat settings needs to be improved, hard to move.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Revlon styling tools like this one before and love them.  Its much easier to use than a hairdryer and brush to get a smooth blow out.  This one works fine, but you can tell they&#x27;ve changed the quality a little.  It doesn&#x27;t feel as durable as the previous ones I&#x27;ve owned did.  I still will not use anything else.  I can&#x27;t find anything like it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually works. Unfortunately, my hair is too thick for it. But I wonder how thin of hair you have to actually have to get it to not be completely frustrating. When I was able to actually get hair to stay on the brush, it worked really well and very fast. But, that was rare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several hot air brushes over the years, but this is the first I couldn&#x27;t use at all. The high heat and powerful blow dryer aren&#x27;t of much use if the plastic tips on the barrels are too short to hold without fingers touching the metal and getting burned - especially the 1.5\\&quot; which has an even shorter tip than the 1\\&quot; (the photo doesn&#x27;t show this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the hot air dryers I&#x27;ve owned in the past had plastic tips that were longer, could be removed, and had a grooved texture and narrower width -- they were easy to grasp and easy to distinguish from the barrel without looking.  The tips on these barrels are permanently attached, too short to grasp well, and made of smooth plastic that feels the same and is the same width as the metal barrel. You can&#x27;t telll where the plastic ends and the metal barrel starts -- until you feel the burning of your fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very powerful dryer and gets very hot. The bristles are very short and don&#x27;t catch the hair easily (which is also a postive feature because my hair didn&#x27;t get easily tangled). But when I tried to use both my hands to try to turn the barrel, catch my hair on the bristles, and wrap my hair around it, I burned my fingers holding the tip.  When I tried to use fingers/palm hold to my hair in place over the bristles so I could wrap it around the barrel, after a minute of running, even on low, the barrel became too handle or even bring near my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent considerable time trying to figure how to use this successfully, but no matter how I tried, I ended up burning my fingers and scalp.</li>
            <li> Was lookingfor something to replace my Wahl brand for ionic stick blow dryer that Wahl no longer makes. This was the best product I could find closest to what I had prior.</li>
            <li> ordered as a backup...  just opened it to find the brush will not stay in the dryer portion.  and I missed the return window by one day!&lt;br /&gt;I am very unhappy with this!!!!!</li>
            <li> This little thing is awesome gives great shine never going to use a reg. blow dryer again. Great for blow outs and so easy to use. The attachments are easy to change. So happy with this product!</li>
            <li> A really good hair setting tool. It has a cool shot which is also very helpful as it gets hot. It&#x27;s ionic air which also helps with frizz. I&#x27;d buy another.&lt;br /&gt;anne</li>
            <li> I love this even better than my last one! I think that one was by Conair. This one is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen the older generation with their pink sleep-in curlers and blue-rod perms.  The hot air styling wand is one of those products I just assumed belonged to that category of woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then, sharing a hotel room with my co-writer, I noticed something astounding!  This beautiful trend-setting blonde uses a hot air brush!  Was it her mother&#x27;s?  Curious, I asked to try it out.  Even though I was on 2nd day hair (shampooed the day before with no intention of a shampoo that morning before an early conference), I tried it out to smooth out some indentations in my straightened hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that surprised me was that it gave me more volume at the roots!  It also gave a soft bevel to the ends.  For a person with fine hair, it is superior to a curling iron when smoothing and styling hair because it doesn&#x27;t smash hair down but provides a refining lift.  I vowed to get one myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair in its natural state of wavy chaos, I bought the Revlon Shine Enhancing Hot Air Kit, for special occasions.  However, after using it to sculpt my bangs, I started using it after every shampoo.  In fact, it works so well, I can go the second day without doing anything to my bangs. It&#x27;s speedy and doesn&#x27;t leave me with a wad of frizz like blow drying sometimes does. Score!</li>
            <li> I love this item.  It is great.  It leaves my hair nice and smooth and no frizz.  Just perfect!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Good but with thin hair you definitely need to use a water bottle to dampen your hair before using it...if not curls won&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> I ordered the Revlon Shine Enhancing Kit about 6 months ago, it definitely works! I see a clear difference in my hair, it feels softer and shines after a blow dry. Before I blow dry, I comb Biotin &amp; collagen oil treatment through my hair which promotes more shine! I would recommend!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job on your hair, and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this tool for about 6-7 years. I have very fine hair and this give me volume and some curl IT WILL NOT GIVE A TIGHT CURL(for that you have to use a curling iron). The best way to use it is to wait until your hair is almost dry but still a little damp. If you use it when your hair is too wet, it will take too long. Roll the air on the brush and roll and use the medium or high heat depending on your preference, then without releasing the hair switch to the cool option to set the curl/hair then release. But overall for the price it is good to have handy and it has three heads. Ive had mine for a long time. I am not sure it it will work if you have really natural curly hair but I think it will help with the frizz.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work doesn&#x27;t even deserve one start wouldn&#x27;t even turn on</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well. Or maybe it&#x27;s just I don&#x27;t know how to work it very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brush/dryer for almost two months and I&#x27;m really glad I decided to try it. I no longer have two steps in styling my hair. I dry and style with this in half the time. No need to use curling iron after blow dry. It does get pretty hot even on the lower setting. I wear a glove on the opposite hand as the tip of the brush is not long enough to grip. Overall,I&#x27;m pleased with the brush/dryer. So far so good, hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase. Now I can dry my hair and style it in 10 min + it gives volume and nice curls. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to blow dry my hair for the past 14 years. I have thick frizzy &amp; curly hair- I used to put it in curlers then blowdry. This product takes less time and makes my hair wavy and manageable. I hope this product stays available. Only giving it 4 stars because first time I ordered it the wiring was faulty and it would turn off at different times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several different versions of this type of hair appliance over the years. My favorite brand has been the Conair but it just wasn&#x27;t giving me the results I wanted lately due to changes in my hair. I thought I would give the Revlon brand a try since I do like their hair dryers. First off the pros for this appliance: Smooths the hair nicely as it dries, also if you hold it in one spot long enough (15-20 seconds you can create a nice bend or wave) it&#x27;s lightweight and the extra attachments give you some options, excellent price. The Cons: It heats up way too fast, honestly I was worried it would overheat and damage my hair. The top end where you place your fingers for add support while styling can get too hot to touch. The switch is insanely annoying, very difficult to manipulate/change temps while styling and for my standards it didn&#x27;t provide enough power to use the \\&quot;air flow attachment.\\&quot; One more thing it&#x27;s quite loud, not a huge deal but just thought I would mention it.  I went to my local beauty supply store and bought a Helen of Troy hot air brush with a 1 1/2 \\&quot; barrel and it&#x27;s working well for me so far.</li>
            <li> I like it but my daughter did not. I use it most every day now. It is fast and fun to use. Works well on wet of dry hair.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as other older models of this brush I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter. She uses it daily. Doesn&#x27;t burn her hair and gets it nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> It really makes my life easier, but it takes a long time to dry my hair and obtain a good result.</li>
            <li> i love this styler. it&#x27;s easy to handle and it blows alot of air for good drying. i have tried other stylers but they were too &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; and i took them all back. but not this one. it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Seller is excellent, fast shipping but product itself is not meeting my expectations. I have same product that I purchase many years ago in the store and this new one is not as good as the old one.</li>
