            <li>adorable ears.</li>
            <li>These are so cute</li>
            <li>Arrived on time, and looked just like the picture, my boyfriend thinks they&#x27;re adorable.</li>
            <li>I could have made them myself and done better and is what I will do from now on.</li>
            <li>I gotta say these ears are adorable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather longer ribons :)</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still really cute and the bells are very charming and musical, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Came early, great service, super cute head band, great quality, fuzzy and soft, love the bells!~ :3</li>
            <li>The ears are adorable, durable, and cheap.</li>
            <li>Great for cosplay and everyday wear ^-^&lt;br /&gt;Really cheap great price&lt;</li>
            <li>The bells are a special touch!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m getting the white ones with the bells soon too, so I hope they&#x27;re as good quality as these!</li>
            <li>They are cute, but I&#x27;m thinking about modifying the ribbons to look more like the photo because they were hot glued on.</li>
            <li>These are super cute and so comfy to wear.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super cute, but...</li>
            <li>Super product for the price!</li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>overall great</li>
            <li>They fit well and jingle as you walk around.</li>
            <li>But if you aren&#x27;t crafty, this will do.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy my ears.</li>
            <li>Double win.</li>
            <li>They are super cute and fun.  </li>
            <li>I got these ears in less then a week, and they are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really soft and the bells are a nice touch.</li>
            <li>i suggest getting quick shipping ^.^&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>If you cant take the jingle noise dont buy this but its very cute smaller than you would expect and</li>
            <li>Very cute, but to my personal opinion</li>
            <li>They fit adult heads just fine too.</li>
            <li>Really cute and nice, heavy material.</li>
            <li>Adorable and soft...</li>
            <li>If you are a cosplayer, it probably be cheaper overall just to make your own headband.</li>
            <li>They are incredibly soft and the quality is okay for the price.</li>
            <li>The ears are really soft and the headband is comfortable, the bells and ribbons feel like they&#x27;re gonna stay on for awhile!  </li>
            <li>Fur the price though, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Other than that they are pretty cute :)</li>
            <li>These cat ears are adorable, soft, and decent quality~</li>
            <li>Great for people with black hair since it&#x27;s so natural!</li>
            <li>I love the small bells as well :)</li>
            <li>I love these and am planning on purchasing the white ones as well!</li>
            <li>Ears were a bit smaller than I thought but they still look cute.</li>
            <li>overall i love it</li>
            <li>Very cute, happy with shipping time, the ears were a little bit smaller than expected but</li>
            <li>The ribbons are actually much shorter than they appear, and are just hot glued on, as are the bells.</li>
            <li>Could have been packaged better but the shipping wasnt as long as I thought</li>
            <li>They got right back to me, said it would be no problem, and were so intent on making sure I got my order that they sent it three times so far.</li>
            <li>The overall quality of the headband is pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Just like in picture thanks</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>They look very sturdy &amp;&lt;br /&gt;elegant</li>
            <li>I took them off and replaced them with smaller bells with a prettier sound.</li>
            <li>Just play gently.</li>
            <li>My 13 yr.old daughter is really into anime.</li>
            <li>I can see where the bows and bells of the product are held together with hot glue, and it came squished into a small box, with no plastic or protective wrap of any kind, otherwise they would have gotten 5 stars.</li>
            <li>perfect, just what i expected, the band seems small but its only to hold the ears in the right place.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would change is the ears should have the ability to open up more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know it had little bells. :)</li>
            <li>I definitely did not at first.</li>
            <li>The ear&#x27;s are only hot glued on though</li>
            <li>but it always slips off because the headband is much too large or loose for my head.</li>
            <li>but you can fix that with a clear piece of tape over the bell opening.</li>
            <li>Had so much compliments when I used it at the last Animation Convention.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Laid sideways on the head with adorable pink bows and little bells.</li>
            <li>The bells make a cute little jingle but it isn&#x27;t too loud even though the bells are located right behind your human ears.</li>
            <li>, I was really dissatisfied when I opened them simply because it wasn&#x27;t what I had expected.</li>

            <li> Great for people with black hair since it&#x27;s so natural!</li>
            <li> I love the small bells as well :)</li>
            <li> I love these and am planning on purchasing the white ones as well!</li>
            <li> Ears were a bit smaller than I thought but they still look cute.</li>
            <li> overall i love it</li>
            <li> Very cute, happy with shipping time, the ears were a little bit smaller than expected but</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Just like in picture thanks</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> They look very sturdy &amp;&lt;br /&gt;elegant</li>
            <li> I took them off and replaced them with smaller bells with a prettier sound.</li>
            <li> Just play gently.</li>
            <li> My 13 yr.old daughter is really into anime.</li>
            <li> I can see where the bows and bells of the product are held together with hot glue, and it came squished into a small box, with no plastic or protective wrap of any kind, otherwise they would have gotten 5 stars.</li>

            <li> The ear&#x27;s are only hot glued on though</li>

            <li> but you can fix that with a clear piece of tape over the bell opening.</li>
            <li> Had so much compliments when I used it at the last Animation Convention.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Laid sideways on the head with adorable pink bows and little bells.</li>
            <li> The bells make a cute little jingle but it isn&#x27;t too loud even though the bells are located right behind your human ears.</li>
            <li> , I was really dissatisfied when I opened them simply because it wasn&#x27;t what I had expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doubtful an onlooker would be able to tell they&#x27;re held together with hot glue, but if I notice it, I write about it.</li>
            <li> They seem so sturdy too, I think they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> My only problem with them is that the bells that come attached are really loud and kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> I didnt like it immediately, only due to my expectations that it would be larger and sturdier than it actually was.</li>
            <li> and the bells are a little bit too loud.</li>
            <li> the ribbon isnt that long.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife for our cosplay dress up sessions, also have the pair in white and pink.  </li>
            <li> the only reason i did not give it a 5 star is because the ribbons are shown to be pink here</li>
            <li> /&gt;(Although takes A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered black, not PINK.</li>
            <li> The ears in the picture match the ribbons, the ears I got have the same pretty pink ribbons, but the inside of the ears are an atrocious hot pink.</li>
            <li> I expected the ears to be a bit bigger, and positioned a little lower on the headband - it&#x27;s probably a manufacturing inconsistency.</li>
            <li> /&gt;ALSO was extremely late, by nearly a week.</li>
            <li> Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this game  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the product is just like the picture except the pink bows are tied in a tighter knot than the display picture.</li>
            <li> It was delivered faster then expected.</li>
            <li> so if you have a hard time with headbands in general you might run into a problem.</li>
            <li> Looks like the ears will be a few inches long, which they are not.</li>
            <li> I have no practical use for it, besides a funny drunk purchase story.</li>
            <li> I ordered black and received pink.</li>
            <li> Not too small, not too loose.</li>
            <li> I needed a pair of ears to go with my black cosplay tail and these will not do.</li>
            <li> but my ribbons were black.</li>
            <li> Since I was a little worried that they&#x27;d not get here in time, I shot a message off to the seller.</li>
            <li> The headband might be too small for some people though</li>
            <li> The ears are closer together, &amp; the ribbons are less thick also shorter, &amp; the band is really thin.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the ears to be sewn shut though, and the tips of the headband are glued so they are hard.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the product of drinking wine and surfing Amazon late at night.</li>

            <li> Great and comfortable! Had so much compliments when I used it at the last Animation Convention.</li>
            <li> Adorable! The bells are a special touch! My daughter looks so cute in these! Amazing. She had to have them for cosplay. Well made and durable. The head band fit perfectly! Not too small, not too loose. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I didnt like it immediately, only due to my expectations that it would be larger and sturdier than it actually was. Looks like the ears will be a few inches long, which they are not. The ribbons are actually much shorter than they appear, and are just hot glued on, as are the bells. Over all, I got what I paid for. -.-&lt;br /&gt;ALSO was extremely late, by nearly a week.</li>
            <li> perfect, just what i expected, the band seems small but its only to hold the ears in the right place.</li>
            <li> Good. Item was as expected.</li>
            <li> Just like in picture thanks</li>
            <li> If you cant take the jingle noise dont buy this but its very cute smaller than you would expect and the ribbon isnt that long.</li>
            <li> I really like this game  er ert e rert ert ert er ert ert e er e te ter e r</li>
            <li> I love them! The only thing that I could say that is negitive is that the ribbon is ALOT shorter than what it appears as in the photo. Other than that they are pretty cute :)</li>
            <li> Very cute, happy with shipping time, the ears were a little bit smaller than expected but overall great</li>
            <li> Love these ears! They are incredibly cute. Well made. Could have been packaged better but the shipping wasnt as long as I thought so that was a plus and well they are just so perfectly cute.</li>
            <li> I expected the ears to be a bit bigger, and positioned a little lower on the headband - it&#x27;s probably a manufacturing inconsistency. They&#x27;re still really cute and the bells are very charming and musical, in my opinion. They&#x27;re not clunky sounding and annoying like some decorative bells can be. I can see where the bows and bells of the product are held together with hot glue, and it came squished into a small box, with no plastic or protective wrap of any kind, otherwise they would have gotten 5 stars. It&#x27;s doubtful an onlooker would be able to tell they&#x27;re held together with hot glue, but if I notice it, I write about it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute on me. Now if only if had come with a tail then I&#x27;d be even more happier, Haha</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. Since I was a little worried that they&#x27;d not get here in time, I shot a message off to the seller. They got right back to me, said it would be no problem, and were so intent on making sure I got my order that they sent it three times so far. The ears are adorable, durable, and cheap. What more do you need?</li>
            <li> The picture of these ears is completely false advertisement, I wouldn&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t like them still,&lt;br /&gt;but I definitely did not at first. They look very sturdy &amp;&lt;br /&gt;elegant here in the advertisement, compared to what you receive, which looks pathetic in comparison. The ears are closer together, &amp; the ribbons are less thick also shorter, &amp; the band is really thin. They are cute, but I&#x27;m thinking about modifying the ribbons to look more like the photo because they were hot glued on. Besides that they&#x27;re okay, I was really dissatisfied when I opened them simply because it wasn&#x27;t what I had expected.</li>
            <li> These ears are cute and lightweight. They fit well and jingle as you walk around. The only thing that would change is the ears should have the ability to open up more. I fear if I try to strip the sewing out, it would ruin the ears.</li>
            <li> Adorable and soft...I wear it around the house but it always slips off because the headband is much too large or loose for my head. The bells do tend to get stuck once in a while.</li>
            <li> This purchase was the product of drinking wine and surfing Amazon late at night. I thought it was cute and I bought it on a whim. I have no practical use for it, besides a funny drunk purchase story. Anyway, the product is just like the picture except the pink bows are tied in a tighter knot than the display picture. The bells on the ears actually work. The overall quality of the headband is pretty cheap. If you are a cosplayer, it probably be cheaper overall just to make your own headband. But if you aren&#x27;t crafty, this will do. On time shipping was a plus.</li>
            <li> I love they bells they are so cute. &amp;#60;3 the ears match my cosplay outfit so well!! for the price these ears are the best you can buy.</li>
            <li> These are super cute and so comfy to wear. I love them!</li>
            <li> I wear these ears all the time and I&#x27;ve never felt cuter! They&#x27;re really soft and the bells are a nice touch.</li>
            <li> They are incredibly soft and the quality is okay for the price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting the ears to be sewn shut though, and the tips of the headband are glued so they are hard. I had to put some felt on the tips so they wouldn&#x27;t hurt my head behind my ears. Otherwise they are really cute and will work great for cosplaying!</li>
            <li> Very Cute! Great for people with black hair since it&#x27;s so natural! I love the small bells as well :)</li>
            <li> I got these ears in less then a week, and they are gorgeous! The band is soft and fits perfectly. The bells make a cute little jingle but it isn&#x27;t too loud even though the bells are located right behind your human ears. The ribbons are good quality and have stayed on through many cosplays and festival shows. I love these and am planning on purchasing the white ones as well!</li>
            <li> My grand daughter loves these. she looks very cute in them..very nice , love the color..look so cute. will wear them a lot.</li>
            <li> It was for my daughter and she loved them.</li>
            <li> these were so perfect for Halloween. I looked just like a kitten and they are not skanky or cheesy looking.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wife for our cosplay dress up sessions, also have the pair in white and pink.  While not the most well made product, does the job for the price. Was the perfect accessory for that added touch of cuteness to make my wife look cute as a button.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super cute, but... I ordered black and received pink. I needed a pair of ears to go with my black cosplay tail and these will not do.</li>
            <li> Cute. :) I like it. I didn&#x27;t know it had little bells. :)</li>
            <li> Very small, not recommended for adults.</li>
            <li> These are adorable! The headband might be too small for some people though so if you have a hard time with headbands in general you might run into a problem. The bells are wonderful. Super product for the price!</li>
            <li> adorable ears. They look good and where a great price for the quality pof product that we recieved. thank you</li>
            <li> These are so cute wow. The ears are really soft and the headband is comfortable, the bells and ribbons feel like they&#x27;re gonna stay on for awhile!  I almost want to wear these all day honestly... both bells jingle, it&#x27;s quite amusing~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m getting the white ones with the bells soon too, so I hope they&#x27;re as good quality as these! *crossing fingers*</li>
            <li> These cat ears are adorable, soft, and decent quality~</li>
            <li> I really enjoy my ears. They are super cute and fun.  My only problem with them is that the bells that come attached are really loud and kind of annoying. I took them off and replaced them with smaller bells with a prettier sound. Now they are perfect.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, and looked just like the picture, my boyfriend thinks they&#x27;re adorable. They seem so sturdy too, I think they&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> Really cute and nice, heavy material. Good quality!</li>
            <li> I saw the picture and assumed that the product shown was what I was going to get. The ears in the picture match the ribbons, the ears I got have the same pretty pink ribbons, but the inside of the ears are an atrocious hot pink. If the ears and the ribbons matched i could have made a different costume, but they don&#x27;t. I cannot use them for my cosplay outfit so I feel ripped off. I could have made them myself and done better and is what I will do from now on.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these ears! especially for the price! the only reason i did not give it a 5 star is because the ribbons are shown to be pink here but my ribbons were black. and the bells are a little bit too loud. but you can fix that with a clear piece of tape over the bell opening. either way they are great!</li>
            <li> Ears were a bit smaller than I thought but they still look cute. Nothing outrageous, a simple headband with ears and tassels. Fur the price though, definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Came early, great service, super cute head band, great quality, fuzzy and soft, love the bells!~ :3 Definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> The ears were in good condition and so cute, I love them, they&#x27;re simply awesome</li>
            <li> I gotta say these ears are adorable. Laid sideways on the head with adorable pink bows and little bells. Super cute. The ear&#x27;s are only hot glued on though and I foresee my having to glue them back on. They fit adult heads just fine too. So it works as a toy or as a cosplay accessory. Double win. Just play gently.</li>
            <li> Very cute, but to my personal opinion I&#x27;d rather longer ribons :) but the best part is the jingly bells</li>
            <li> ADORABLE! These are great, good priced kitty ears and are so cute! My boyfriend loves them too!!</li>
            <li> My 13 yr.old daughter is really into anime. she bugged me for 2 wks.to order her these cat ears. Now I have a hard time keeping her from wearing them everywhere!! It&#x27;s all good!!!</li>
            <li> These are absolutely adorable and delightful!!!! Great for cosplay and everyday wear ^-^&lt;br /&gt;Really cheap great price&lt;br /&gt;(Although takes A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE)&lt;br /&gt;So i suggest getting quick shipping ^.^&lt;br /&gt;But overall i love it</li>
            <li> I ordered black, not PINK. And its falling apart at the seams. Its a crappy made product. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> It was delivered faster then expected. &amp;#60;3</li>
