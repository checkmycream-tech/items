            <li>Great realistic Fir smell.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s also easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Love  the smell and clean feel after showering</li>

            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>Almost don&#x27;t want to use it because it is pretty too!</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and it lathers very well.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is some Dam good Soap Really helps my Dry Skin</li>
            <li>but am pleased to report that I placed no expectations on this bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;In general soap has escaped my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Bought my first bar of Frasier Fir at one of the Biltmore Estate gift shops in Ashville, NC three years ago.</li>
            <li>I first purchased this soap at the Sugar Plum market in Houston.</li>
            <li>I had recently added this to an order but after using it a few times I liked it so much that I just bought three more bars which I&#x27;ll now give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>In additional to its strong pine fir scent, it has a gritty texture that feels like you&#x27;re getting some defoliation in the shower.</li>
            <li>I will certainly order this again for myself.</li>
            <li>The bar itself is very high quality (must be triple-milled) and</li>
            <li>I have a huge living room area and even the smallest candle of the Frasier Fur managed to fill the entire room!</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a change in my skin appearance.</li>
            <li>The apricot exfoliates in the Frasier Fur soap are very thorough.</li>
            <li>My son likes it enough that he asked if I would buy some more for him - that&#x27;s a strong testament to the appeal of this soap, as 16 year old boys don&#x27;t usually make soap requests.</li>
            <li>There are some exfoliates out there that turn into a gentle soft scrub at the end of using it but not this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is not to harsh but probably would not be good if you have dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Very classy.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Coming from someone who has tried everything from St. Ives to Bath Junkie to Lush Cosmetics, this soap takes the cake!</li>
            <li>I wash my mouth with it frequently as punishment for cursing aloud.</li>
            <li>I nearly levitated when I smelled this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of balsam pine, but think that most pine-scented products are pale imitations at best, and horrid, harsh chemical concoctions at worst.  </li>
            <li>Grate Smelling , there are other Soaps worth Checking out</li>
            <li>The shape of the soap is unique ( A large cube) but can be a bit awkward when new.</li>

            <li> Smells so good. Almost don&#x27;t want to use it because it is pretty too!</li>
            <li> Yum! This smells so good in my guest bath.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.  It smells fantastic and it lathers very well.  I use this soap every day.</li>
            <li> This is the best tasting soap I&#x27;ve ever had. I wash my mouth with it frequently as punishment for cursing aloud. Just kidding. It&#x27;s great soap and timeless. Very classy.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this!</li>
            <li> Great realistic Fir smell.  I had tried a fir type soap from someone else but it smelled more of pine than fir.  This Thymes Fraisier soap has just a great Fir smell.  I had recently added this to an order but after using it a few times I liked it so much that I just bought three more bars which I&#x27;ll now give as gifts.  This soap is not to harsh but probably would not be good if you have dry skin.  I will certainly order this again for myself.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I smell like a Christmas Tree every day of the  year.  It&#x27;s earned a permanent spot in our shower.</li>
            <li> This is some Dam good Soap Really helps my Dry Skin&lt;br /&gt;And Grate Smelling , there are other Soaps worth Checking out</li>
            <li> I got it for a friend and he already found it somewhere else, so I used it myself. It&#x27;s a nice creamy soap and it smells great! I really love it!</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, natural pine needle scent that is always welcome whether in the morning or the night. The bar itself is very high quality (must be triple-milled) and the bar lasts a good amount of time. The shape of the soap is unique ( A large cube) but can be a bit awkward when new. May buy again next year for the holidays but a bit on the expensive side to use year round. Also exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> This is my go to bar soap for the holidays! I love the smell of the lather. It&#x27;s also easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Ohhhhh, if I had not already smelled this in person, I wouldn&#x27;t have believed how great it could be!!!  I came across it in a gift shop while traveling, and immediately had to get it.  I love the smell of balsam pine, but think that most pine-scented products are pale imitations at best, and horrid, harsh chemical concoctions at worst.  I nearly levitated when I smelled this soap.  And wonder of wonders, the scent lasted throughout the entire bar!  It made me happy every time I walked into the bath, because I would catch a whiff from the soap dish.  Never one for using scented candles or reeds in oil, I took a risk and bought the Thymes Frasier Fir scented oil and reed diffuser.  Wow!  Fabulous!  Smells as good as the soap, and as realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a person who suffers from chemical sensitivities and asthma myself, I am very careful about using fragrance and fragranced products.  This passes the test for great scent, and it does _not_ trigger any wheezing or headaches.  Granted, I only insert a few reeds into the diffuser, because I don&#x27;t want an overpowering layer of fragrance, but, it is terrific!  So, 5 stars to both the Thymes Frasier Fir and it&#x27;s Reed Diffuser counterpart.</li>
            <li> We love  the smell and feel of this soap. Will buy it again in spite of price. Great for gift too.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas smell...it .will last a long time.  Smells like I am in the forest, very nice gentle soap.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap!  It was fairly long-lasting and I loved that it had exfoliating bits similar to sand in texture embedded throughout the bar.  The smell was a very pleasant fir scent.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent!!  A prefect transaction!  Many thanks!</li>
            <li> Bought my first bar of Frasier Fir at one of the Biltmore Estate gift shops in Ashville, NC three years ago. Have used it around Christmas and the winter months ever since. In fact, the end of this month, I&#x27;ll be opening my &amp;#34;Christmas 2013 bar!&amp;#34; Thoroughly enjoy it. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. In additional to its strong pine fir scent, it has a gritty texture that feels like you&#x27;re getting some defoliation in the shower. My son likes it enough that he asked if I would buy some more for him - that&#x27;s a strong testament to the appeal of this soap, as 16 year old boys don&#x27;t usually make soap requests.</li>
            <li> Amazon has inquired. via email.  Did the Fir soap meet my expectations? Where I am&lt;br /&gt;able I try and lower my expectations and by doing so raise my serenity.  I don&#x27;t often&lt;br /&gt;succeed but am pleased to report that I placed no expectations on this bar of soap.&lt;br /&gt;In general soap has escaped my expectations.  People, myself included, have not been as lucky.&lt;br /&gt;I would say however, that post my routine threesome with aqua &amp; soap, I was pleasantly&lt;br /&gt;surprised.  Life is short.  Amazon, you now owe me five minutes.  How do you wish to reimburse me?</li>
            <li> So I never write reviews on Amazon but this product is so phenomenal I wanted to share. I first purchased this soap at the Sugar Plum market in Houston. I immediately loved the scent and purchased the candle also. I use the soap in the bathtub a few times week. I&#x27;ve really noticed a change in my skin appearance. The exfoliation feels like HEAVEN! There are some exfoliates out there that turn into a gentle soft scrub at the end of using it but not this soap. The apricot exfoliates in the Frasier Fur soap are very thorough. Coming from someone who has tried everything from St. Ives to Bath Junkie to Lush Cosmetics, this soap takes the cake! I purchased the small votive candle because the larger ones were pretty expensive but also because I wanted to see how strong the fragrance would rise in my home. I have a huge living room area and even the smallest candle of the Frasier Fur managed to fill the entire room! I just purchased the larger one today. Magnificent product! I am a VERY satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Love  the smell and clean feel after showering</li>
