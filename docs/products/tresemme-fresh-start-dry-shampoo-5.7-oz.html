    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The BEST one I&#x27;ve used is PSSSSST!</li>
            <li>Nothing is going to make your hair feel perfect.</li>
            <li>I thought it worked great!  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li>This would be very good for that.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I was happy for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>When I see online reviews claiming this product is great, I now feel like I can&#x27;t trust the judgment of the bloggers.  </li>
            <li>and it works great...</li>
            <li>can of this at a drug store, thinking it would be a great thing to have on hand in an emergency.  </li>
            <li>I get oily hair after 1 day and wanted to try something that would allow me to look ok if I couldn&#x27;t shower in the morning (4 kids!!)</li>
            <li>Batiste, Klorane, heck, even Psst, are all superior to this stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks good all</li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, good luck getting it to wash out of your hair in one wash.</li>
            <li>However, it looks good &amp; smells good.</li>
            <li>It smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>and the result was not even looking good.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it; I wasn&#x27;t horrified, but i wasn&#x27;t impressed either; so I put it on the bathroom shelf</li>
            <li>It works 100 times better than this junk!</li>
            <li>To anyone who is hesitant to try this u def should, its amazing.</li>
            <li>I did use up the bottle I bought, but would never buy this kind again.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and my hair was revived and smelled nice.</li>
            <li>Honestly, did this product even need a fragrance?</li>
            <li>The volumizing kind leaves a residue, which is what helps it add volume.</li>
            <li>This one has a nice smell, the bottle lasts forever, and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>Is this some kind of defect?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My bottle had a nice fragrant smell.</li>
            <li>I love the Tresemme heat protectant, so I bought this thinking it would be good too.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Smells very strong, so beware- breath holding and fan use ensues after use (did I just type that?).</li>
            <li>I have no idea why so many people dislike this product because I love it!</li>
            <li>It also works best when you use absolutely no other product in your hair that day - no mousse or gel or serum of any kind.</li>
            <li>I  am able to use it semi effectively if I spritz at night and do not try to brush it out until morning.</li>
            <li>a lot of people, my hair is very fine and gets oily after one day-</li>
            <li>I spray wherever it looks oily, then a very light layer all over, wait a couple minutes, and brush out.</li>
            <li>It made my hair more greasy and it smells very cheaply.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part about this, though, is that my hair feels like it has a ton of volume when I use</li>
            <li>After putting this in my hair i have not been able to get it out.  </li>
            <li>HOW MANY TIMES I WASH MY HAIR</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I found with me that it worked much better.</li>
            <li>It did indeed give my hair more volume and made it feel cleaner.</li>
            <li>It looked and felt more greasy, if anything.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using nothing than to use this.</li>
            <li>and it was still ok.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work better.</li>
            <li>so I can work with it better.</li>
            <li>and I love it , but</li>
            <li>; brand worked much better for me, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more, because I usually love Tresemme.</li>
            <li>I love my Batiste.  </li>
            <li>I love this product..</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, but not anything of note.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more to get a quality product that works.</li>
            <li>Point being, if your hair is greasy, better to just wash it than to use this product.</li>
            <li>and I love it, so</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>I sprayed more on, almost choked, and went to go scare my brothers.</li>
            <li>everyone said this was second best.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the girl there said that that is the product that they all use and love it.  </li>
            <li>if you remove the top and soak it in water it MIGHT help\\</li>
            <li>OKAY...</li>
            <li>To me, that feels like, how many products am I putting in my hair just because the power of advertisement?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s potent too.</li>
            <li>I am a college student and I go to the gym for an intensive workout most days of the week.</li>
            <li>I also agree with another reviewer whp mentioned it can work for styles that you don&#x27;t plan on touching throughout the day.</li>
            <li>As many others here have said, it made my hair greasier than it started out, and it smelled and felt like I had just used a bunch of heavy-chemical hairspray.  </li>
            <li>I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li>This product also gives my hair more body and lift which I consider a bonus benefit.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using corn starch.</li>
            <li>The reviews are much better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Not Your Mother&#x27;s brand works better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many dry shampoos and this one works the best.  </li>
            <li>and my hair looked pretty good</li>
            <li>Do not stock up because it&#x27;s a good price until you try it first.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve both had impressive results with Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Then, what you do have is a silky, perfectly non-sticky powder (all the dry shampoos work under a powder principle, I think).  </li>
            <li>If anyone leaves a review that is more than 2 stars for this POS product, I would have STRONG reasons to suspect that they&#x27;re paid by the company to do so.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair try it after washing your hair and see if it gives your hair more body..</li>
            <li>The fact that it is now made so easily, and cheaply, available is simply the best thing since &#x27;sliced bread&#x27;.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it because it is a good price point</li>
            <li>actually looks good!  </li>
            <li>You can try to comb it out and watch how it holds the exact impression of the teeth of your comb like magic!  </li>
            <li>I have a FULL bottle of this stuff and nothing comes out!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Tresemme products, but they should pull this one from the market.  </li>
            <li>Great, just what I wanted, more of this gunk in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I had to shower and wash my hair after using this stuff just to be presentable.</li>
            <li>It brushes out fairly easily, but didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair cleaner.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;clay veil\\&quot; is easily removed with hairbrushing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is overwhelmingly strong and lasts in your hair all day.</li>
            <li>The strong fragrance made me have a sore throat all day.</li>
            <li>Recently I shared this with my favorite hair stylist and she did my hair very nicely and put this spray in and recommended I buy it (from Target or Walmart</li>
            <li>I VERY LIGHTLY spritz the shampoo on &amp; follow with quick brushes &amp; so on.</li>
            <li>I bought this one because it was the best price I could find, but I guess it&#x27;s not really worth the $5 for just one use.</li>
            <li>Still, I liked it so much that I bought another can!</li>
            <li>The new one smelled fruity and good.</li>
            <li>I used that and LOVED It, but I ran out of that and thought I might as well try a new one.</li>
            <li>It gets greasy which causes my fine hair to plaster to my scalp &amp; at some point you can just see my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that needs washed every day or</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I bought it because I have fine hair</li>
            <li>I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, a little baby powder rubbed into my scalp along the part line works best.</li>
            <li>Though the scent on this one isn&#x27;t as nice as the foam, it&#x27;s bearable, and my hair feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li>and once that alcohol dissipates or is absorbed then the scalp just produces more oil to compensate for the alcohol.     </li>
            <li>There is a reason this is so cheap.</li>
            <li>I bought this since it was cheap and a well-known brand, and now I just have 2 bottles of this stuff that I will never use.</li>
            <li>&quot; Don&#x27;t buy this product just because it&#x27;s cheap because in the end... your hair will look cheap.</li>
            <li>I have bought it 2 different places (Safeway and Target) and 4 times I have experienced that sprayer not working.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and smooth too.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I couponed and got this stuff for 50 cents because in my opinion, that is all it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I get my hair cut very rarely and know almost nothing about hair or styling it</li>
            <li>son was excited about the idea of not washing his hair.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw the commercials for this.</li>
            <li>this stuff isn&#x27;t worth the container that it&#x27;s in!</li>
            <li>It honestly smells like a normal hairspray.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product because of the commercials and thinking I need it.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this because after one day of not washing my hair it gets greasy.</li>
            <li>To top it off, the spray part broke and wouldn&#x27;t work after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>my search continues for a dry shampoo I can be happy with again.</li>
            <li>Even if you try to clean it, it no longer works again.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean your hair AT ALL.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo works great getting me through washes.</li>
            <li>I literally have no idea how this product went through testing in such a huge company and someone thought it was a good idea to sell.  </li>
            <li>It somewhat has a clean smelling aroma</li>
            <li>It kept my hair looking &#x27;clean&#x27; and non greasy and if I had to, I could probably go another day with it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This worked great for my hair, I used it a day after I showered and it made my hair look just like when I dry it after my shower.</li>
            <li>No residue that others mentioned or dandruff like flakes, just clean lookiing hair.</li>
            <li>In other words, its best for a style that you won&#x27;t touch very much--put in a headband or a barrette &amp; leave it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It would look good right after styling, but after a few hours of wear, my hair looked oily again and needed refreshing once more.</li>
            <li>I helped him spray it on, trying to get a nice even layer near his roots.</li>
            <li>Making sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li>I continued to get ready and would spray more in my hair,</li>
            <li>It worked really well, but if you can only get one good spray out of the can before it stops working, you&#x27;re better off just shampooing your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried waiting a full two minutes and then tossling around hair with a towel, brushing out, using my fingers --</li>
            <li>(Provided, of course, you fit the strange hair type that apparently manages it best.)</li>
            <li>A good, cheap dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is by far not the best dry shampoo, but it does have some pros:</li>
            <li>With that said, it works great with creating the volume I crave in my fine and usually limp hair.</li>
            <li>Also, when I use it my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very clean or silky, which I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel clean, fresh</li>
            <li>If you want your hair to get a quick spruce-up at the roots after a workout or if you oversleep and can&#x27;t shampoo, this is NOT the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Luckily, the body powder saved the situation.</li>
            <li>I pick up sections and give a quick half-second spray, and that is all you need.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would be nice to be able to skip washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li>When sprayed lightly, it dries up oils and refreshes the hair at first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally get that many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, spraying more, rubbing into my scalp more, brushing my hair more.</li>
            <li>I was told to try this first by my Stylist before purchasing their own dry shampoo to see if I liked it, my stylist has really great thick hair</li>
            <li>I would very highly recommend tigi rock-a- holic to anyone looking for a great dry shampoo-</li>
            <li>It actually makes your hair looks dirtier and more greasy!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this will make my review any more believable over the others, but let me just say that I am a dry shampoo enthusiast.</li>
            <li>recently decided to try another brand because I figured if this cheap brand worked this well, then Nexxus surely would be a good 3 days if I ever needed that long to not wash my hair.</li>
            <li>It did make my hair feel clean at first (and it gave me some volume too),</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with Batiste and have been a loyal customer, but because of the price of TRESseme&#x27;s dry shampoo, I purchased a bottle to try it out.  </li>
            <li>But since his hair is fine, I think I overdid it a bit and got way more of the white powdery spray on than I needed.</li>
            <li>Your hair will not look freshly shampooed, but it does eliminate the greasies when used correctly.  </li>
            <li>Sooo worth it though.    </li>
            <li>I also sleep with my hair in a bun (to keep it looking somewhat fresh).  </li>
            <li>I used to use a name brand that you could only by from a popular shop from home channel.</li>
            <li>but clearly worth it.  </li>
            <li>I picked this up loving the idea of having a lot of product for like only $5.    </li>
            <li>they say this stuff gives you a fresh start</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had purchased this for my sister since she had been using my shampoo and only tried it out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having used a dry shampoo that has worked wonderfully, I know that this is not how dry shampoo should be.</li>
            <li>I have given this can a good shake for a solid 15 seconds and still get mostly hairspray that just coats my hair in this strange residue.</li>
            <li>and I found this product not only smells better but works better and is MUCH more budget-friendly than the high-end dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>Tried it a couple of times thinking maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I have long straight hair and a product to freshen up between shampoos sounds good.</li>
            <li>I have fairly oily hair and wanted to be able to skip a day of shampooing, but using this makes my hair a strange combination of both dry/brittle and very, very oily at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets oily pretty quickly (after a day or so) and this doesn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li>Its really a shame that no mainstream company has made a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>You have to shake it pretty well before use, but besides that, it covers up all the grease and makes your hair look like it is freshly washed.</li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t know what happened, but the more I used this product, the more it worked, so by the end of the can, I had it down to a science and it made my third and fourth day hair look great.</li>
            <li>I pumped 2 squirts on to my roots, massaged it in; dried it as best as i could with a towel, and then combed my hair and left the house.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend trying Pssst instead for a good low-cost dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used to be able to wash my hair every other day and it would be fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t leave reviews very much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different dry shampoos, and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Like a good little consumer, I immediately went and bought some.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say that I have the type of fine hair that is completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about some other brands of dry shampoo, so maybe I&#x27;ll give those a try, unless Tresemme can start getting the cans to work for more than one spray.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after I saw it noted as an Allure beauty award winner and decided it was worth a try since it was so much cheaper than the Klorane I was using.</li>
            <li>This works okay, but I couldn&#x27;t help feeling that the spray itself, at times, only made my hair greasier.  </li>
            <li>yet so hopefully they can only get better from here.</li>
            <li>The Batiste spray comes out of the can at what seems a much higher velocity, and there is no wetness detectable.  </li>
            <li>it looked and felt more greasy than before I put the stuff in, it also coated my brush with white dust (probably the \\&quot;mineral clay\\&quot; that was supposed to absorb the oil).</li>
            <li>product is pretty inexpensive too--</li>
            <li>I bought this and the refreshing mist to help my color last longer.</li>
            <li>First off, it discolors your hair.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on the can exactly, but I didn&#x27;t like how my hair looked.</li>
            <li>First off it leaves your hair feeling like you have tons of product in it.</li>
            <li>I took the nozzle off and ran it under hot water.  </li>
            <li>so it was only about $2 more than this.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t enough to keep me from throwing this in the trash and running out to buy more of my Alterna, which I should have bought in the first place.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it looks freshly-washed, but it does look passable enough that I wouldn&#x27;t be mortified if I ran into a cute ex-boyfriend at the grocery store.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only use it on the roots. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>, I was very excited not to worry about washing my hair on a daily basis, I thought this product would work, but I guess you get what you paid</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, in the twenty minutes since I put this on, I was also able to flat iron and style my hair.</li>
            <li>good for dark hair!!</li>
            <li>I wish it had a nicer scent to it, but it leaves my hair feeling much less oily and looking much better!</li>
            <li>There is nothing positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I go to the rest room and sure enough, the light misting I did before leaving the house left a residue on my skin</li>
            <li>first, yea I probably used too much.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands before and have been very happy, but I use this stuff (as directed) and my hair is stiff and looks greasier than before I used the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Smells good but is very heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to use dry shampoo more than once a day.</li>
            <li>It just made my hair more sticky and dry.  </li>
            <li>The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it one star is because the smell was pleasant and there seemed to be a lot of product in the bottle (some dry shampoos really skimp).  </li>
            <li>that if you spray dry shampoo on the roots it will help create volume, so I got it more for volume than to combat greasiness.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did a light mist over my roots, waited, then brushed it out.  </li>
            <li>will say this:  the instructions for many of those pretty and elaborate updo hairstyles on Pinterest call for backcombing and adding dry shampoo to help keep the hair from slipping out of the style or keep the bobby pins from falling out.  </li>
            <li>This smells sooooooo strong like alcohol that you would have to literally go outside if you have any interest in breathing...  </li>
            <li>Overall I think this is a good dry shampoo-</li>
            <li>I have medium-blonde fine hair, and I&#x27;m approaching 40</li>
            <li>I have fine, oily hair, and it is obvious by Day 2 that I haven&#x27;t shampooed.</li>
            <li>It worked great &amp; didn&#x27;t leave white residue in my dark hair or weight my very fine hair down.</li>
            <li>Until then I thought it would be nice to use this in the locker room after my workout to make my hair look a little nicer for the rest of the day until I shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s not a smell I&#x27;d consider good.</li>
            <li>I laughed so hard when I sprayed it on.</li>
            <li>I am not one to come and write reviews very often</li>
            <li>this product really does the trick and its a bit cheaper than Rockaholic by comparison.</li>
            <li>So much for saving $3.  </li>
            <li>I could not get it out, no matter how much I brushed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second day after shampoo I spray it on the roots, wait about 5 min and lightly brush it.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is blond-brown, and the spray doesn&#x27;t really show up unless I put too much in one place.</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m back to Klorane which isn&#x27;t cheap...</li>
            <li>I am very picky about smells and</li>
            <li>but it really didnt do anything to my hair except made it look greaser than before i sprayed it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work</li>
            <li>It mitigates the greasiness for only a few hours, at best, and then it looks the same.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t seem to really absorb any oil and just sat on my hair and made it clumpy.</li>
            <li>so I thought I was really going to like it.</li>
            <li>(very backwards)&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I can see where your hair could get oiler if you use to much.</li>
            <li>okay, not really)</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think it does anything it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>The can I bought is going straight into the garbage.</li>
            <li>It cost 5 times as much as the Tresemme and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact I have used it 3 times (to really give it the benefit of doubt...) and just threw it away.  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel cleaner, it just looks like it is.</li>
            <li>No matter how much I brush/rub my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li>it makes my hair heavier but doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the oil very well.  </li>
            <li>It made the top layer look ok, but the rest was just made worse.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look any better, but it&#x27;s okay for the weekends when I&#x27;m just heading out to the store or somewhere unimportant.</li>
            <li>, it feels good on my scalp (no itching or irritation), it sucks up oil and gives me volume.</li>
            <li>I tried it out, and it worked really well for me, so I came to Amazon expecting to find good reviews and found a slew of negative ones instead.  </li>
            <li>I have medium blonde fine long hair and it works fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, the only good thing I can say about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I don&#x27;t even know how this product came to be on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried to use this product 3 times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t some sort of fluke the other two times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos successfully (Ojon, Batiste), but this one just does not work.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel like I don&#x27;t know how to use it right, even though the instructions are pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I have used every dry shampoo on the market, this is by far my favorite for the price.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a combination of a stiff hair spray and some kind of powder rather than just a fine powder with a propellant like other dry shampoos are (and which absorb oil and then brush or shake out easily).  </li>
            <li>I have very light blonde hair and the powder was obvious.</li>
            <li>First off, this was the very first dry shampoo I ever bought.</li>
            <li>Sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li>I used it once and thought OK it works, my hair smelled good and didn&#x27;t look super bad but the next time I tried it......</li>
            <li>This was a more affordable option compared to the more expensive brands I had tried at Sephora.  </li>
            <li>My main problem area is the crown of my head.</li>
            <li>I have tried Oscar Blandi which is more expensive but works better than this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work, I hear everyone talking about not washing their hair everyday and how healthy it looks/</li>
            <li>I have tried about ten different ways to do this, and no matter what, my hair ends up looking  and  feeling  more oily than before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m reviewing this product for three main reasons:    1)</li>
            <li>and I try to do/use anything I can to keep the color looking decent.  </li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for two stars vs. just one is because the product actually smells okay.</li>
            <li>I got the volumizing version of this and tried it on second day hair, which, for me, is fairly greasy and limp.</li>
            <li>I decided to cheap out and not buy my favorite Alterna Dry Shampoo since I just moved and was tight on money.</li>
            <li>Having fine, yet heavy wavy hair, I find dry shampoo to be my favorite styling product.</li>
            <li>I strayed from my favorite dry shampoo \\&quot;Pssst\\&quot; because Tresemme is now sold in place of it in Walgreens stores near me, and WOW.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because I think it could smell a little better.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to hear about this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was really excited when this product came out because my hair gets oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day, but it gets dry and damaged if I do.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that this dry shampoo would make my hair feel clean...</li>
            <li>My husband and I are both kind of sensitive to chemical smells, and this product goes overboard.</li>
            <li>First off, I felt like no matter how much I shook the container or brushed</li>
            <li>I have normal hair, i dont use products except shampoo and conditioner and yet, my hair still gets oily the morning after i wash it.  </li>
            <li>Twenty minutes with normal shampoo would have me just out of the shower, so I think I&#x27;ll use it sparingly &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone and then never purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo made my hair wet first, and then so greasy I had to put it in a pony tail and put some body powder on top to take away the greasy shine.</li>
            <li>They ALL (even the baby powder) work ten times better than Tresemme dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i had never used a Waterless Shampoo before, only baby powder, and aerosol dry shampoos (which i LOVE but are too pricey for not alot of product)</li>
            <li>I am Asian and have long, fine, straight hair that becomes oily at the roots at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap, lasts longer than most other dry shampoos, and doesn&#x27;t have an obvious or offending scent.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it is pretty easy to burn through the whole bottle quickly, and if done incorrectly, your hair will look white/gray, but that is really the personal user&#x27;s issue.</li>
            <li>But the final issue that really did me in was that I only used it 4 times and the sprayer stopped working even though the can was almost full</li>
            <li>Usually I will still finish the can even if i&#x27;m not crazy about it, but this went right into the trash!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not worth it for the price when you can get nicer dry shampoo for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li>Again, it left it so gummy and stiff and honestly still oily to the touch.</li>
            <li>After you brush it through after one-two minutes of dry time, your ends will hold that grey color because your ends are more porous than your roots.</li>
            <li>Steer clear!</li>
            <li>But his first and only use of this was a disaster.</li>
            <li>also after washing i lost hair more than usual</li>
            <li>the exact same places I already sprayed it</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my hair turning white since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>And I had to brush out the white flakes first</li>
            <li>Once I had all the white brushed out, my hair didn&#x27;t look oily, but it sure felt GROSS.  </li>
            <li>Whatever you do don&#x27;t smoke or go near a candle!  </li>
            <li>Stay far away!</li>
            <li>I will never use this product again and will be sure I always have another can of my usual product on hand.</li>
            <li>So the next few times I&#x27;ve been a lot more cautious about how much I spray in my hair.</li>
            <li>This method didn&#x27;t really work, my hair would look ok but feel gross and by midday it was really heavy and started to look greasy.     </li>
            <li>I had to use a lot more product which then made my head feel very heavy</li>
            <li>I decided to try Tresemme Fresh Start Dry Shampoo because I&#x27;ve started growing my hair out and am trying to not wash my hair so often.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that&#x27;s dyed dark red.</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s an inexpensive dry shampoo, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>There is a kind that comes in a white bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure of the brand.  </li>
            <li>If you spray really lightly and really far from your head, your hair will look less oily for some of the day.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping to add a cheap but good-quality dry shampoo into my regular routine</li>
            <li>So for the past few months, I&#x27;ve been on a mission to try as many different brands (of the drugstore variety) until I find my favorite.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it does add body and dries up oil all day long, and other times it looks okay for a couple hours</li>
            <li>The product is not a miracle worker, but I do think it does the job better than other dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so many bad reviews of this product, but most of them said they had oily hair.  </li>
            <li>HUGE WASTE.</li>
            <li>I sprayed a very liberal amount in my hair and it smelled like either a bottle of old lady&#x27;s perfume or like a hair dresser unloaded an entire can of hairspray on my head.</li>
            <li>so I like to keep the natural oils in it.</li>
            <li>I work in a professional environment</li>
            <li>and she said she used it frequently and for around $4</li>
            <li>I had to be up really early for work</li>
            <li>Not shaking enough, using too much, etc.</li>
            <li>I use this frequently to refresh my hair</li>
            <li>After an unexpected invitation for Christmas shopping today, I decided to touch up the roots of my hair with this shampoo, since by the end of a day without showering they tend to get a bit oily.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>The white powder shows up no matter how much you use....</li>
            <li>Those who aren&#x27;t having luck or say it leaves their hair white are using waaaay too much.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>So if u want to get rid of that natural oil..pat some baby powder on the head.</li>
            <li>If you are not meticulous rubbing this in VERY thoroughly, you will have white tints and streaks in your hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t trust spraying this stuff directly into my hair</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Product went directly in the trash can after one use.</li>
            <li>I was shopping one day and this was the only brand the store carried, so I purchased it not expecting much.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and really wanted this to work, but it made my hair worse after using it.  </li>
            <li>I mean if so many people are having a problem with your product wouldn&#x27;t that be an incentive to Change the canister???    </li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m not the exact target audience for dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>-look that it would have been faster to wash and blow dry my hair, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was my first try at a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a perfect product and it is very easy to use too much of it, but if you want to salvage the bottle I recommend this method.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo has a great scent and it feels good on my scalp (no irritation), but it makes my hair feel absolutely disgusting just an hour later.</li>
            <li>I even pulled out my compact powder and sprinkled a little on the roots around my forehead to soak up the oily mess that this product was supposed to make it better, not worse...     </li>
            <li>Not awful, but not good.</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it would work the same way as Tigi Rock-a-holic which I normally buy</li>
            <li>I normally would use a different brand, but my store was out</li>
            <li>I have fine blonde hair that looks greasy if not washed everyday.</li>
            <li>However, if I let it dry then blend the powdery residue into my scalp with my fingers, it really does take away the oily root look.</li>
            <li>I have a layered bob, and while my hair is dark, it is more of a dark auburn with highlights.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it did not brush out of my hair and left a grey dust.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it left a gross, gray dust in my hair that absolutely would not brush or blow out.</li>
            <li>I have used other dry shampoo products in the past, and even have used good ole&#x27; fashion baby powder in a pinch.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it looked like I had a major dandruff</li>
            <li>The purpose is not to clean your hair, but to refresh, and that small amount hides the grease and leaves my hair touchable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brunette and recently switched to a straight, flat iron style.</li>
            <li>This is the least effective dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried--in fact, my hair was greasier than if I&#x27;d left it alone.</li>
            <li>I really like this dry shampoo, I have used several other brands including Rockaholic by Tigi, Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s dry shampoo spray, and a cheap drugstore brand, Pssst is what I think it is named.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t let the spray dry along my part (takes 3-5 minutes), I get a similar result as many of the dissatisfied reviewers: stiff, dirtier-looking hair.</li>
            <li>I have dark brown hair and this dry shampoo does not leave my hair with a powdered look like most dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li>I have tried more than half a dozen different dry shampoos and this is the one I end up coming back to.  </li>
            <li>I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At least it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the buildup because I am barely using any</li>
            <li>I normally use Oscar Blandi dry shampoo which smells decent, but I am blonde and it&#x27;s a white powder</li>
            <li>Not worth it, go for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the dry shampoo is decent, nothing to rave or rant about.</li>
            <li>This product leaves weight in my hair, and does not really freshen it up much.  </li>
            <li>In the end, I spent so much time trying to rid myself of the gray-greasy-weighed down-stiff hair</li>
            <li>He ended up washing most of it out with water and his hair looked worse than it did to begin</li>
            <li>I usually just buy the Pssst brand of dry shampoo which I love, but I decided that since this would cost me next to nothing I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it helps tame my hair enough so it at least looks good in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A big thing that makes me prefer this one is that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, especially in comparrison to the terrible, overwhelming, cheap perfume type smell that most other dry shampoos have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid ten times as much for dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I spent a significant amount of time trying to brush it out with no success, and eventually just started dousing my hair with water.  </li>
            <li>I typically do not write reviews on products, but for some reason, I felt compelled because TRESemme has traditionally been a brand I trust to provide quality/value products.  </li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is nothing like the Batiste that I&#x27;ve been using, which was the first dry shampoo I ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Usually my hair still looks clean the next day.  </li>
            <li>They absolutely despise this one and tell me they are not interested in it.</li>
            <li>I bought TRESemme Fresh Start Dry Shampoo hoping that it would get rid of the oil and allow me to wash my hair every other day but,</li>
            <li>I hope that spray will at least work on clean hair as a volumizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not a replacement for regular shampoo or better quality dry shampoos, but if you happen to wake up late</li>
            <li>No dry shampoo can substitute for washing hair.</li>
            <li>It makes it super stiff, it takes no oil away, and leaves flakes in your hair!</li>
            <li>I do this after exercising when my hair is a little sweaty or right before I go to bed knowing I will not wash my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li>And not just a little bit -- everywhere I had used it turned the color of clay, which is probably exactly what it was.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this dry shampoo since the only brand of hair spray I use is Tresemme.</li>
            <li>Please note: this stuff has to be constantly shaken between quick sprays, so if you are lazy, do not buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several expensive brands, popular brands, etc and all left me wanting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After weighing the good and the bad,  I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li>I found some good and bad reviews before I bought it, but gave it a chance anyways.</li>

            <li> Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The BEST one I&#x27;ve used is PSSSSST!</li>
            <li> Nothing is going to make your hair feel perfect.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked great!  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t the best</li>
            <li> This would be very good for that.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I was happy for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li> When I see online reviews claiming this product is great, I now feel like I can&#x27;t trust the judgment of the bloggers.  </li>
            <li> and it works great...</li>
            <li> can of this at a drug store, thinking it would be a great thing to have on hand in an emergency.  </li>
            <li> I get oily hair after 1 day and wanted to try something that would allow me to look ok if I couldn&#x27;t shower in the morning (4 kids!!)</li>
            <li> Batiste, Klorane, heck, even Psst, are all superior to this stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks good all</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, good luck getting it to wash out of your hair in one wash.</li>
            <li> However, it looks good &amp; smells good.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> and the result was not even looking good.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it; I wasn&#x27;t horrified, but i wasn&#x27;t impressed either; so I put it on the bathroom shelf</li>
            <li> It works 100 times better than this junk!</li>
            <li> To anyone who is hesitant to try this u def should, its amazing.</li>
            <li> I did use up the bottle I bought, but would never buy this kind again.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and my hair was revived and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> Honestly, did this product even need a fragrance?</li>
            <li> The volumizing kind leaves a residue, which is what helps it add volume.</li>
            <li> This one has a nice smell, the bottle lasts forever, and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Is this some kind of defect?&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My bottle had a nice fragrant smell.</li>
            <li> I love the Tresemme heat protectant, so I bought this thinking it would be good too.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Smells very strong, so beware- breath holding and fan use ensues after use (did I just type that?).</li>
            <li> I have no idea why so many people dislike this product because I love it!</li>
            <li> It also works best when you use absolutely no other product in your hair that day - no mousse or gel or serum of any kind.</li>
            <li> I  am able to use it semi effectively if I spritz at night and do not try to brush it out until morning.</li>
            <li> a lot of people, my hair is very fine and gets oily after one day-</li>
            <li> I spray wherever it looks oily, then a very light layer all over, wait a couple minutes, and brush out.</li>
            <li> It made my hair more greasy and it smells very cheaply.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it works fine for me.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part about this, though, is that my hair feels like it has a ton of volume when I use</li>
            <li> After putting this in my hair i have not been able to get it out.  </li>
            <li> HOW MANY TIMES I WASH MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I found with me that it worked much better.</li>
            <li> It did indeed give my hair more volume and made it feel cleaner.</li>
            <li> It looked and felt more greasy, if anything.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using nothing than to use this.</li>
            <li> and it was still ok.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work better.</li>
            <li> so I can work with it better.</li>
            <li> and I love it , but</li>
            <li> ; brand worked much better for me, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more, because I usually love Tresemme.</li>
            <li> I love my Batiste.  </li>
            <li> I love this product..</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, but not anything of note.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more to get a quality product that works.</li>
            <li> Point being, if your hair is greasy, better to just wash it than to use this product.</li>
            <li> and I love it, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> I sprayed more on, almost choked, and went to go scare my brothers.</li>
            <li> everyone said this was second best.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the girl there said that that is the product that they all use and love it.  </li>
            <li> if you remove the top and soak it in water it MIGHT help\\</li>
            <li> OKAY...</li>
            <li> To me, that feels like, how many products am I putting in my hair just because the power of advertisement?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s potent too.</li>
            <li> I am a college student and I go to the gym for an intensive workout most days of the week.</li>
            <li> I also agree with another reviewer whp mentioned it can work for styles that you don&#x27;t plan on touching throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As many others here have said, it made my hair greasier than it started out, and it smelled and felt like I had just used a bunch of heavy-chemical hairspray.  </li>
            <li> I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> This product also gives my hair more body and lift which I consider a bonus benefit.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using corn starch.</li>
            <li> The reviews are much better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Not Your Mother&#x27;s brand works better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this one works the best.  </li>
            <li> and my hair looked pretty good</li>
            <li> Do not stock up because it&#x27;s a good price until you try it first.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve both had impressive results with Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Then, what you do have is a silky, perfectly non-sticky powder (all the dry shampoos work under a powder principle, I think).  </li>
            <li> If anyone leaves a review that is more than 2 stars for this POS product, I would have STRONG reasons to suspect that they&#x27;re paid by the company to do so.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair try it after washing your hair and see if it gives your hair more body..</li>
            <li> The fact that it is now made so easily, and cheaply, available is simply the best thing since &#x27;sliced bread&#x27;.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like it because it is a good price point</li>
            <li> actually looks good!  </li>
            <li> You can try to comb it out and watch how it holds the exact impression of the teeth of your comb like magic!  </li>
            <li> I have a FULL bottle of this stuff and nothing comes out!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Tresemme products, but they should pull this one from the market.  </li>
            <li> Great, just what I wanted, more of this gunk in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I had to shower and wash my hair after using this stuff just to be presentable.</li>
            <li> It brushes out fairly easily, but didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair cleaner.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;clay veil\\&quot; is easily removed with hairbrushing.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is overwhelmingly strong and lasts in your hair all day.</li>
            <li> The strong fragrance made me have a sore throat all day.</li>
            <li> Recently I shared this with my favorite hair stylist and she did my hair very nicely and put this spray in and recommended I buy it (from Target or Walmart</li>
            <li> I VERY LIGHTLY spritz the shampoo on &amp; follow with quick brushes &amp; so on.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because it was the best price I could find, but I guess it&#x27;s not really worth the $5 for just one use.</li>
            <li> Still, I liked it so much that I bought another can!</li>
            <li> The new one smelled fruity and good.</li>
            <li> I used that and LOVED It, but I ran out of that and thought I might as well try a new one.</li>
            <li> It gets greasy which causes my fine hair to plaster to my scalp &amp; at some point you can just see my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs washed every day or</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have fine hair</li>
            <li> I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing.</li>
            <li> Honestly, a little baby powder rubbed into my scalp along the part line works best.</li>
            <li> Though the scent on this one isn&#x27;t as nice as the foam, it&#x27;s bearable, and my hair feels much cleaner.</li>
            <li> and once that alcohol dissipates or is absorbed then the scalp just produces more oil to compensate for the alcohol.     </li>
            <li> There is a reason this is so cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it was cheap and a well-known brand, and now I just have 2 bottles of this stuff that I will never use.</li>
            <li> &quot; Don&#x27;t buy this product just because it&#x27;s cheap because in the end... your hair will look cheap.</li>
            <li> I have bought it 2 different places (Safeway and Target) and 4 times I have experienced that sprayer not working.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shiny and smooth too.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I couponed and got this stuff for 50 cents because in my opinion, that is all it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I get my hair cut very rarely and know almost nothing about hair or styling it</li>
            <li> son was excited about the idea of not washing his hair.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the commercials for this.</li>
            <li> this stuff isn&#x27;t worth the container that it&#x27;s in!</li>
            <li> It honestly smells like a normal hairspray.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of the commercials and thinking I need it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this because after one day of not washing my hair it gets greasy.</li>
            <li> To top it off, the spray part broke and wouldn&#x27;t work after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> my search continues for a dry shampoo I can be happy with again.</li>
            <li> Even if you try to clean it, it no longer works again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean your hair AT ALL.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works great getting me through washes.</li>
            <li> I literally have no idea how this product went through testing in such a huge company and someone thought it was a good idea to sell.  </li>
            <li> It somewhat has a clean smelling aroma</li>
            <li> It kept my hair looking &#x27;clean&#x27; and non greasy and if I had to, I could probably go another day with it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This worked great for my hair, I used it a day after I showered and it made my hair look just like when I dry it after my shower.</li>
            <li> No residue that others mentioned or dandruff like flakes, just clean lookiing hair.</li>
            <li> In other words, its best for a style that you won&#x27;t touch very much--put in a headband or a barrette &amp; leave it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It would look good right after styling, but after a few hours of wear, my hair looked oily again and needed refreshing once more.</li>
            <li> I helped him spray it on, trying to get a nice even layer near his roots.</li>
            <li> Making sure not to use too much.</li>
            <li> I continued to get ready and would spray more in my hair,</li>
            <li> It worked really well, but if you can only get one good spray out of the can before it stops working, you&#x27;re better off just shampooing your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried waiting a full two minutes and then tossling around hair with a towel, brushing out, using my fingers --</li>
            <li> (Provided, of course, you fit the strange hair type that apparently manages it best.)</li>
            <li> A good, cheap dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is by far not the best dry shampoo, but it does have some pros:</li>
            <li> With that said, it works great with creating the volume I crave in my fine and usually limp hair.</li>
            <li> Also, when I use it my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very clean or silky, which I don&#x27;t really mind</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel clean, fresh</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to get a quick spruce-up at the roots after a workout or if you oversleep and can&#x27;t shampoo, this is NOT the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Luckily, the body powder saved the situation.</li>
            <li> I pick up sections and give a quick half-second spray, and that is all you need.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would be nice to be able to skip washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> When sprayed lightly, it dries up oils and refreshes the hair at first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally get that many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, spraying more, rubbing into my scalp more, brushing my hair more.</li>
            <li> I was told to try this first by my Stylist before purchasing their own dry shampoo to see if I liked it, my stylist has really great thick hair</li>
            <li> I would very highly recommend tigi rock-a- holic to anyone looking for a great dry shampoo-</li>
            <li> It actually makes your hair looks dirtier and more greasy!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will make my review any more believable over the others, but let me just say that I am a dry shampoo enthusiast.</li>
            <li> recently decided to try another brand because I figured if this cheap brand worked this well, then Nexxus surely would be a good 3 days if I ever needed that long to not wash my hair.</li>
            <li> It did make my hair feel clean at first (and it gave me some volume too),</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with Batiste and have been a loyal customer, but because of the price of TRESseme&#x27;s dry shampoo, I purchased a bottle to try it out.  </li>
            <li> But since his hair is fine, I think I overdid it a bit and got way more of the white powdery spray on than I needed.</li>
            <li> Your hair will not look freshly shampooed, but it does eliminate the greasies when used correctly.  </li>
            <li> Sooo worth it though.    </li>
            <li> I also sleep with my hair in a bun (to keep it looking somewhat fresh).  </li>
            <li> I used to use a name brand that you could only by from a popular shop from home channel.</li>
            <li> but clearly worth it.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up loving the idea of having a lot of product for like only $5.    </li>
            <li> they say this stuff gives you a fresh start</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had purchased this for my sister since she had been using my shampoo and only tried it out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having used a dry shampoo that has worked wonderfully, I know that this is not how dry shampoo should be.</li>
            <li> I have given this can a good shake for a solid 15 seconds and still get mostly hairspray that just coats my hair in this strange residue.</li>
            <li> and I found this product not only smells better but works better and is MUCH more budget-friendly than the high-end dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Tried it a couple of times thinking maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I have long straight hair and a product to freshen up between shampoos sounds good.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily hair and wanted to be able to skip a day of shampooing, but using this makes my hair a strange combination of both dry/brittle and very, very oily at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets oily pretty quickly (after a day or so) and this doesn&#x27;t really help much.</li>
            <li> Its really a shame that no mainstream company has made a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> You have to shake it pretty well before use, but besides that, it covers up all the grease and makes your hair look like it is freshly washed.</li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t know what happened, but the more I used this product, the more it worked, so by the end of the can, I had it down to a science and it made my third and fourth day hair look great.</li>
            <li> I pumped 2 squirts on to my roots, massaged it in; dried it as best as i could with a towel, and then combed my hair and left the house.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend trying Pssst instead for a good low-cost dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to wash my hair every other day and it would be fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave reviews very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different dry shampoos, and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Like a good little consumer, I immediately went and bought some.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I have the type of fine hair that is completely unmanageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about some other brands of dry shampoo, so maybe I&#x27;ll give those a try, unless Tresemme can start getting the cans to work for more than one spray.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after I saw it noted as an Allure beauty award winner and decided it was worth a try since it was so much cheaper than the Klorane I was using.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but I couldn&#x27;t help feeling that the spray itself, at times, only made my hair greasier.  </li>
            <li> yet so hopefully they can only get better from here.</li>
            <li> The Batiste spray comes out of the can at what seems a much higher velocity, and there is no wetness detectable.  </li>
            <li> it looked and felt more greasy than before I put the stuff in, it also coated my brush with white dust (probably the \\&quot;mineral clay\\&quot; that was supposed to absorb the oil).</li>
            <li> product is pretty inexpensive too--</li>
            <li> I bought this and the refreshing mist to help my color last longer.</li>
            <li> First off, it discolors your hair.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the can exactly, but I didn&#x27;t like how my hair looked.</li>
            <li> First off it leaves your hair feeling like you have tons of product in it.</li>
            <li> I took the nozzle off and ran it under hot water.  </li>
            <li> so it was only about $2 more than this.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t enough to keep me from throwing this in the trash and running out to buy more of my Alterna, which I should have bought in the first place.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it looks freshly-washed, but it does look passable enough that I wouldn&#x27;t be mortified if I ran into a cute ex-boyfriend at the grocery store.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only use it on the roots. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li> , I was very excited not to worry about washing my hair on a daily basis, I thought this product would work, but I guess you get what you paid</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, in the twenty minutes since I put this on, I was also able to flat iron and style my hair.</li>
            <li> good for dark hair!!</li>
            <li> I wish it had a nicer scent to it, but it leaves my hair feeling much less oily and looking much better!</li>
            <li> There is nothing positive to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I go to the rest room and sure enough, the light misting I did before leaving the house left a residue on my skin</li>
            <li> first, yea I probably used too much.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands before and have been very happy, but I use this stuff (as directed) and my hair is stiff and looks greasier than before I used the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Smells good but is very heavy on your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to use dry shampoo more than once a day.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair more sticky and dry.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it one star is because the smell was pleasant and there seemed to be a lot of product in the bottle (some dry shampoos really skimp).  </li>
            <li> that if you spray dry shampoo on the roots it will help create volume, so I got it more for volume than to combat greasiness.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did a light mist over my roots, waited, then brushed it out.  </li>
            <li> will say this:  the instructions for many of those pretty and elaborate updo hairstyles on Pinterest call for backcombing and adding dry shampoo to help keep the hair from slipping out of the style or keep the bobby pins from falling out.  </li>
            <li> This smells sooooooo strong like alcohol that you would have to literally go outside if you have any interest in breathing...  </li>
            <li> Overall I think this is a good dry shampoo-</li>
            <li> I have medium-blonde fine hair, and I&#x27;m approaching 40</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair, and it is obvious by Day 2 that I haven&#x27;t shampooed.</li>
            <li> It worked great &amp; didn&#x27;t leave white residue in my dark hair or weight my very fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Until then I thought it would be nice to use this in the locker room after my workout to make my hair look a little nicer for the rest of the day until I shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s not a smell I&#x27;d consider good.</li>
            <li> I laughed so hard when I sprayed it on.</li>
            <li> I am not one to come and write reviews very often</li>
            <li> this product really does the trick and its a bit cheaper than Rockaholic by comparison.</li>
            <li> So much for saving $3.  </li>
            <li> I could not get it out, no matter how much I brushed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second day after shampoo I spray it on the roots, wait about 5 min and lightly brush it.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is blond-brown, and the spray doesn&#x27;t really show up unless I put too much in one place.</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m back to Klorane which isn&#x27;t cheap...</li>
            <li> I am very picky about smells and</li>
            <li> but it really didnt do anything to my hair except made it look greaser than before i sprayed it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work</li>
            <li> It mitigates the greasiness for only a few hours, at best, and then it looks the same.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t seem to really absorb any oil and just sat on my hair and made it clumpy.</li>
            <li> so I thought I was really going to like it.</li>
            <li> (very backwards)&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I can see where your hair could get oiler if you use to much.</li>
            <li> okay, not really)</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think it does anything it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> The can I bought is going straight into the garbage.</li>
            <li> It cost 5 times as much as the Tresemme and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact I have used it 3 times (to really give it the benefit of doubt...) and just threw it away.  </li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel cleaner, it just looks like it is.</li>
            <li> No matter how much I brush/rub my fingers through my hair</li>
            <li> it makes my hair heavier but doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the oil very well.  </li>
            <li> It made the top layer look ok, but the rest was just made worse.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look any better, but it&#x27;s okay for the weekends when I&#x27;m just heading out to the store or somewhere unimportant.</li>
            <li> , it feels good on my scalp (no itching or irritation), it sucks up oil and gives me volume.</li>
            <li> I tried it out, and it worked really well for me, so I came to Amazon expecting to find good reviews and found a slew of negative ones instead.  </li>
            <li> I have medium blonde fine long hair and it works fantastic for me.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, the only good thing I can say about this product is the smell.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I don&#x27;t even know how this product came to be on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product 3 times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t some sort of fluke the other two times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos successfully (Ojon, Batiste), but this one just does not work.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like I don&#x27;t know how to use it right, even though the instructions are pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I have used every dry shampoo on the market, this is by far my favorite for the price.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a combination of a stiff hair spray and some kind of powder rather than just a fine powder with a propellant like other dry shampoos are (and which absorb oil and then brush or shake out easily).  </li>
            <li> I have very light blonde hair and the powder was obvious.</li>
            <li> First off, this was the very first dry shampoo I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Sometimes less is more.</li>
            <li> I used it once and thought OK it works, my hair smelled good and didn&#x27;t look super bad but the next time I tried it......</li>
            <li> This was a more affordable option compared to the more expensive brands I had tried at Sephora.  </li>
            <li> My main problem area is the crown of my head.</li>
            <li> I have tried Oscar Blandi which is more expensive but works better than this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work, I hear everyone talking about not washing their hair everyday and how healthy it looks/</li>
            <li> I have tried about ten different ways to do this, and no matter what, my hair ends up looking  and  feeling  more oily than before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this product for three main reasons:    1)</li>
            <li> and I try to do/use anything I can to keep the color looking decent.  </li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for two stars vs. just one is because the product actually smells okay.</li>
            <li> I got the volumizing version of this and tried it on second day hair, which, for me, is fairly greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> I decided to cheap out and not buy my favorite Alterna Dry Shampoo since I just moved and was tight on money.</li>
            <li> Having fine, yet heavy wavy hair, I find dry shampoo to be my favorite styling product.</li>
            <li> I strayed from my favorite dry shampoo \\&quot;Pssst\\&quot; because Tresemme is now sold in place of it in Walgreens stores near me, and WOW.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because I think it could smell a little better.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear about this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when this product came out because my hair gets oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day, but it gets dry and damaged if I do.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this dry shampoo would make my hair feel clean...</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both kind of sensitive to chemical smells, and this product goes overboard.</li>
            <li> First off, I felt like no matter how much I shook the container or brushed</li>
            <li> I have normal hair, i dont use products except shampoo and conditioner and yet, my hair still gets oily the morning after i wash it.  </li>
            <li> Twenty minutes with normal shampoo would have me just out of the shower, so I think I&#x27;ll use it sparingly &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone and then never purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo made my hair wet first, and then so greasy I had to put it in a pony tail and put some body powder on top to take away the greasy shine.</li>
            <li> They ALL (even the baby powder) work ten times better than Tresemme dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i had never used a Waterless Shampoo before, only baby powder, and aerosol dry shampoos (which i LOVE but are too pricey for not alot of product)</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have long, fine, straight hair that becomes oily at the roots at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap, lasts longer than most other dry shampoos, and doesn&#x27;t have an obvious or offending scent.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it is pretty easy to burn through the whole bottle quickly, and if done incorrectly, your hair will look white/gray, but that is really the personal user&#x27;s issue.</li>
            <li> But the final issue that really did me in was that I only used it 4 times and the sprayer stopped working even though the can was almost full</li>
            <li> Usually I will still finish the can even if i&#x27;m not crazy about it, but this went right into the trash!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not worth it for the price when you can get nicer dry shampoo for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> Again, it left it so gummy and stiff and honestly still oily to the touch.</li>
            <li> After you brush it through after one-two minutes of dry time, your ends will hold that grey color because your ends are more porous than your roots.</li>
            <li> Steer clear!</li>
            <li> But his first and only use of this was a disaster.</li>
            <li> also after washing i lost hair more than usual</li>
            <li> the exact same places I already sprayed it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my hair turning white since the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> And I had to brush out the white flakes first</li>
            <li> Once I had all the white brushed out, my hair didn&#x27;t look oily, but it sure felt GROSS.  </li>
            <li> Whatever you do don&#x27;t smoke or go near a candle!  </li>
            <li> Stay far away!</li>
            <li> I will never use this product again and will be sure I always have another can of my usual product on hand.</li>
            <li> So the next few times I&#x27;ve been a lot more cautious about how much I spray in my hair.</li>
            <li> This method didn&#x27;t really work, my hair would look ok but feel gross and by midday it was really heavy and started to look greasy.     </li>
            <li> I had to use a lot more product which then made my head feel very heavy</li>
            <li> I decided to try Tresemme Fresh Start Dry Shampoo because I&#x27;ve started growing my hair out and am trying to not wash my hair so often.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that&#x27;s dyed dark red.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s an inexpensive dry shampoo, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> There is a kind that comes in a white bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure of the brand.  </li>
            <li> If you spray really lightly and really far from your head, your hair will look less oily for some of the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to add a cheap but good-quality dry shampoo into my regular routine</li>
            <li> So for the past few months, I&#x27;ve been on a mission to try as many different brands (of the drugstore variety) until I find my favorite.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it does add body and dries up oil all day long, and other times it looks okay for a couple hours</li>
            <li> The product is not a miracle worker, but I do think it does the job better than other dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so many bad reviews of this product, but most of them said they had oily hair.  </li>
            <li> HUGE WASTE.</li>
            <li> I sprayed a very liberal amount in my hair and it smelled like either a bottle of old lady&#x27;s perfume or like a hair dresser unloaded an entire can of hairspray on my head.</li>
            <li> so I like to keep the natural oils in it.</li>
            <li> I work in a professional environment</li>
            <li> and she said she used it frequently and for around $4</li>
            <li> I had to be up really early for work</li>
            <li> Not shaking enough, using too much, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this frequently to refresh my hair</li>
            <li> After an unexpected invitation for Christmas shopping today, I decided to touch up the roots of my hair with this shampoo, since by the end of a day without showering they tend to get a bit oily.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> The white powder shows up no matter how much you use....</li>
            <li> Those who aren&#x27;t having luck or say it leaves their hair white are using waaaay too much.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> So if u want to get rid of that natural oil..pat some baby powder on the head.</li>
            <li> If you are not meticulous rubbing this in VERY thoroughly, you will have white tints and streaks in your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trust spraying this stuff directly into my hair</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Product went directly in the trash can after one use.</li>
            <li> I was shopping one day and this was the only brand the store carried, so I purchased it not expecting much.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and really wanted this to work, but it made my hair worse after using it.  </li>
            <li> I mean if so many people are having a problem with your product wouldn&#x27;t that be an incentive to Change the canister???    </li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not the exact target audience for dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> -look that it would have been faster to wash and blow dry my hair, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was my first try at a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect product and it is very easy to use too much of it, but if you want to salvage the bottle I recommend this method.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has a great scent and it feels good on my scalp (no irritation), but it makes my hair feel absolutely disgusting just an hour later.</li>
            <li> I even pulled out my compact powder and sprinkled a little on the roots around my forehead to soak up the oily mess that this product was supposed to make it better, not worse...     </li>
            <li> Not awful, but not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work the same way as Tigi Rock-a-holic which I normally buy</li>
            <li> I normally would use a different brand, but my store was out</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair that looks greasy if not washed everyday.</li>
            <li> However, if I let it dry then blend the powdery residue into my scalp with my fingers, it really does take away the oily root look.</li>
            <li> I have a layered bob, and while my hair is dark, it is more of a dark auburn with highlights.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it did not brush out of my hair and left a grey dust.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it left a gross, gray dust in my hair that absolutely would not brush or blow out.</li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoo products in the past, and even have used good ole&#x27; fashion baby powder in a pinch.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it looked like I had a major dandruff</li>
            <li> The purpose is not to clean your hair, but to refresh, and that small amount hides the grease and leaves my hair touchable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brunette and recently switched to a straight, flat iron style.</li>
            <li> This is the least effective dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried--in fact, my hair was greasier than if I&#x27;d left it alone.</li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo, I have used several other brands including Rockaholic by Tigi, Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s dry shampoo spray, and a cheap drugstore brand, Pssst is what I think it is named.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t let the spray dry along my part (takes 3-5 minutes), I get a similar result as many of the dissatisfied reviewers: stiff, dirtier-looking hair.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and this dry shampoo does not leave my hair with a powdered look like most dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I have tried more than half a dozen different dry shampoos and this is the one I end up coming back to.  </li>
            <li> I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the buildup because I am barely using any</li>
            <li> I normally use Oscar Blandi dry shampoo which smells decent, but I am blonde and it&#x27;s a white powder</li>
            <li> Not worth it, go for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the dry shampoo is decent, nothing to rave or rant about.</li>
            <li> This product leaves weight in my hair, and does not really freshen it up much.  </li>
            <li> In the end, I spent so much time trying to rid myself of the gray-greasy-weighed down-stiff hair</li>
            <li> He ended up washing most of it out with water and his hair looked worse than it did to begin</li>
            <li> I usually just buy the Pssst brand of dry shampoo which I love, but I decided that since this would cost me next to nothing I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it helps tame my hair enough so it at least looks good in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A big thing that makes me prefer this one is that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, especially in comparrison to the terrible, overwhelming, cheap perfume type smell that most other dry shampoos have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid ten times as much for dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I spent a significant amount of time trying to brush it out with no success, and eventually just started dousing my hair with water.  </li>
            <li> I typically do not write reviews on products, but for some reason, I felt compelled because TRESemme has traditionally been a brand I trust to provide quality/value products.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is nothing like the Batiste that I&#x27;ve been using, which was the first dry shampoo I ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Usually my hair still looks clean the next day.  </li>
            <li> They absolutely despise this one and tell me they are not interested in it.</li>
            <li> I bought TRESemme Fresh Start Dry Shampoo hoping that it would get rid of the oil and allow me to wash my hair every other day but,</li>
            <li> I hope that spray will at least work on clean hair as a volumizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a replacement for regular shampoo or better quality dry shampoos, but if you happen to wake up late</li>
            <li> No dry shampoo can substitute for washing hair.</li>
            <li> It makes it super stiff, it takes no oil away, and leaves flakes in your hair!</li>
            <li> I do this after exercising when my hair is a little sweaty or right before I go to bed knowing I will not wash my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> And not just a little bit -- everywhere I had used it turned the color of clay, which is probably exactly what it was.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this dry shampoo since the only brand of hair spray I use is Tresemme.</li>
            <li> Please note: this stuff has to be constantly shaken between quick sprays, so if you are lazy, do not buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several expensive brands, popular brands, etc and all left me wanting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After weighing the good and the bad,  I give it 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I found some good and bad reviews before I bought it, but gave it a chance anyways.</li>
            <li> This is the first dry shampoo that works better than baby powder without a bad odor or any visible residue.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I also spray a quick few blasts near the roots, wait a few minutes for it to dry, then flip my head upside-down and brush it out.  </li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been trying different dry shampoos and decided to share my experience in hopes that it will help others find the right one for their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff adheres the powder to your hair and makes your hair into, essentially, a sort of sticky, fused, extra-matte, flat solid.  </li>
            <li> Not only that, but the product adds weight to hair, causing your hair to fall flat.   </li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps I just used too much, so I considerably scaled back the amount the next time I used it (just once over with the spray for about half a second.)  </li>
            <li> I have had no trouble with any white residue on my dark hair.</li>
            <li> Either they turned my dark hair into a white powdery mess or the cans would clog after the first use, or they just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin blonde/dirty blonde hair (and not a lot of it either), and when my hair is greasy or wet, it turns dark brown.</li>
            <li> I kept myself busy in my little corner cubical and barely came out from it all day long avoiding everyone when i&#x27;d pop out for a bathroom break.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo goes for about $10 a bottle at my local grocery store (Harris Teeter), but I only have to use it once in the morning</li>
            <li> I have used several different dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have used several dry shampoos, and this was such a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of dry shampoos, including more expensive varieties from salons and department stores.</li>
            <li> It does seems to take some practice, but I&#x27;ve gotten it to work pretty well on days when I wake up late or don&#x27;t want to take the time</li>
            <li> It left a residue in my hair and left my hair even more dirty.</li>
            <li> (I used Pantene Flat to Volume if that helps).</li>
            <li> I manage to work with it after using A LOT of product and brushing my hair for a LONG time to get all the white out.</li>
            <li> hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same as when its been freshly washed; when I run my hands through it&#x27;s a little stiff from the clay.  </li>
            <li> It weighed down my hair considerably (even though I didn&#x27;t use much)-I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair because it was so stuck together and clumpy.  </li>
            <li> But for those folks with regular to thick hair that is lighter or highlighted, it&#x27;s a decent product that actually works as well as more expensive dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have fine brown hair that&#x27;s very thick, and it usually gets oily near the roots the day after I shampoo.</li>
            <li> I initially got this product for younger son who at the time would only wash his hair every other day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In other words, if you want to have enough texture, moldability, and solidity in your hair to tease it up into a massive matte white curled beehive and then put a miniature four-masted ship in it for decoration à la Marie Antoinette, this product will facilitate that.  </li>
            <li> In fairness, this is the only dry shampoo product I&#x27;ve tried so can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.  </li>
            <li> Before that time, hair will be oily and unmanageable on the second day no matter which dry shampoo you use.</li>
            <li> I no longer use this dry shampoo because it didn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> This is the dry shampoo I currently use.</li>
            <li> feeling about the low reviews is that, if you are not in a position where you need dry shampoo, don&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> Today I had the opportunity to finally try this dry shampoo the way the directions say to use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only drugstore brand of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Dry Shampoo, Instant, 5.3 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I plan on trying Suave dry shampoo next.  </li>
            <li> gave it 4 tries at different times over the last couple of months.  </li>
            <li> What I hate the most about this product though is how much it REEKS.</li>
            <li> I have used other dry shampoos before and this product absorbed very little oil from my hair.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will get a burst of the powder, indicated by the sudden coat of whiteness in a single spot on my head.</li>
            <li> If you use too much, your hair will be left feeling greasy, maybe even waxy, dirty &amp; in need of a wash which is the exact opposite of what we are going for by purchasing dry shampoo to begin with.</li>
            <li> [...] I mean, really nauseatingly gross.  </li>
            <li> As such, I find it extremely difficult to find hair products for myself and have gone through a number of shampoos that leave my hair dry, greasy, gummy, and about pretty much every other adjective out there.</li>
            <li> and it does not brush out easily, instead it brushes down the hair shaft and clings so my hair is left heavy and dull looking.  </li>
            <li> but there was a little shine near the roots that i wanted to diminish.</li>
            <li> My hair is also more on the dry side than oily and washing it alot can be pretty brutal.</li>
            <li> I was desperate this morning, and decided to give it one more try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a lot of horror stories about dry shampoo scents, Tresemme&#x27;s scent is pretty subtle.</li>
            <li> This made my hair even more dirty looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> I look forward to weekends or long weekends when I don&#x27;t wash it.  </li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t be on the shelves long.</li>
            <li> However, it does not absorb the oil for long and your head will start looking greasy/oily again.</li>
            <li> all day long i felt greasy, looked greasy, and also felt like i had an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t the aerosol will be used up long before the liquid inside.  </li>
            <li> Once you spray it on, your hair turns grey.</li>
            <li> I still had the grey dust problem.  </li>
            <li> but now there&#x27;s a strange gray tint to it and</li>
            <li> It goes a long way in curing the bed-head when pieces of hair stand up at strange angles in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily hair and have used dry shampoos before to help make it an extra day without shampooing, but this is the worst by far.</li>
            <li> He has straight hair that is on the oily side, but his hair is also very dark, nearly black.</li>
            <li> It often can be found in all the same stores and actually runs $1-3 less than this one.</li>
            <li> Not only did it leave this dust, but my hair only looked *slightly* less oily.  </li>
            <li> (It definitely did not look less oily enough to skip a day of washing.)  </li>
            <li> I looked up this product and there is a place where you can read reviews by other consumers and about 75% of the people who have left a review have had the same issue I had with the product where the nozzle gets jammed or something is defective.</li>
            <li> Not great but just all right.</li>
            <li> This Tresemme dry shampoo is comparable to Rockaholic in the fact that it is a white powder and they smell similar, fruity slightly citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I like using a dry shampoo both th extend life of a style and add volume at the roots on my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair, and this product enables me to only wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I used it one morning before leaving for work; this product left my hair feel extremely gummy and oily.  </li>
            <li> just to echo the other reviews: this left my hair greasier than before, plus my head feeling like I dipped it in</li>
            <li> product leaves a white residue on my hair due to the fact it does contain talc.</li>
            <li> I find the smell to be very similar to other Tresemme styling products and the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I am mulatto and have a mixed hair type that is both very thick and very curly.</li>
            <li> I have only used 2 other Dry Shampoo&#x27;s in my lifetime - both of them no-name-brands.  </li>
            <li> I have tried Suave and store-bought brand, and this dry shampoo definitely knocks the other two out of the ballpark.</li>
            <li> only powdery dry shampoos soak up oil instead of just disperseing it around your head!!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, since I tried this dry shampoo, I tried another one.</li>
            <li> A couple years ago, I purchased a dry shampoo from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply called Batiste.</li>
            <li> done.[[ASIN:B000N5S0KE Batiste Dry Shampoo]]</li>
            <li> Here began my quest to find a dry shampoo that worked for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suave dry shampoo:</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun to consider myself an expert at dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Before I used Batiste dry shampoo</li>
            <li> It does seem to dry hair out over time, as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  </li>
            <li> After this, I discovered the Suave dry shampoo, which ROCKS, and is even cheaper.  </li>
            <li> For those who did not like the product, you may not have seen in the directions that you are suppose to BRUSH this product out, which is not always the case with dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and it cannot be styled with heat while it&#x27;s totally dry</li>
            <li> blow dry it then apply this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> so I used this product on dry, unwashed hair</li>
            <li> I will not consider purchasing any Tresemme products after using this one and will be immediately returning this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have never used a dry shampoo fancier than Pssst brand, but cheapo Pssst blows this crud out of the water.  </li>
            <li> I tried this after using Batiste dry shampoo as an alternative.</li>
            <li> My friends had raved about using dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I have started using another dry shampoo</li>
            <li> I went to Sally Beauty Supply to see what they suggested, and I bought Beyond The Zone Rock On Dry Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> sometimes I need a dry shampoo to help.</li>
            <li> you have hair like mine then maybe give the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Style Texture Series Energizing Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I thought that&#x27;s how all dry shampoo was until I tried</li>
            <li> I read about dry shampoos and thought I&#x27;d try one.</li>
            <li> There are dry shampoos that work out there</li>
            <li> I read and followed the instructions on the can, using very short sprays in just a few key places at the roots, waiting a minute, then working it through my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li> the white powdery residue several other commenters have reported, though I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> 3 brief sprays on my roots, 3 minutes waiting, and now my hair is stiff, lifeless, dull-colored (I&#x27;m dark blonde), and feels like I used an entire bottle of hairspray on it.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and whenever I use this product my sister asks me why my hair is white.</li>
            <li> very dark brown hair and this white powder just added this dull gray cast to it, no matter how much time I spent rubbing it in and brushing it out.</li>
            <li> It totally weighed my hair down.</li>
            <li> The powder brushes out well when I brush back across the hair instead of down.</li>
            <li> Another reviewer said it was impossible to remove, but I was able to wash my hair once to get it out</li>
            <li> Tresemme dry shampoo comes out of the can wet, and dries into a sticky, gummy powder.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can do with my hair if I use this is slick it back into a ponytail.</li>
            <li> I tried it again for a second time and put less on my hair after watching some tips from YouTube.</li>
            <li> It takes a little trial and error to see how much/little of the product your hair needs, but I would definitely recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I also think if your hair is thin or fine, it might be a bit hard to use, as it was with my son.</li>
            <li> If I spray a lot I have to brush my hair a little longer, but the white powder has always gone away.</li>
            <li> This gives me a little body back, and it gets rid of greasy looks.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight brown hair that has always been oily.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it, I haven&#x27;t tried other dry shampoos</li>
            <li> I recommend Dove&#x27;s version of dry shampoo over all the other department store ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely oily scalp and use dry shampoos to freshen up my bangs and roots.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the bad reviews on here, I love this product.</li>
            <li> If your hair is like mine, though, spend a few extra bucks and get a product that works.  </li>
            <li> Tried to use it several times just to give it the benefit of a doubt, but it was just a waste of time.</li>
            <li> With this in mind I would take a shower, get my hair wet (and not wash it)</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> The bottle was empty.</li>
            <li> I was unpleasntly surprised to find out that this made my hair have MORE oil and left it feely greasy and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently growing my hair out and wanted something that would allow me to style my hair without washing and drying it everyday.</li>
            <li> i looked like i have aged 40 yrs.</li>
            <li> So this stuff seems to coat my hair in grease, make it stringy and wet looking.</li>
            <li> Absolutely not using this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only Batiste brand works - don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else.</li>
            <li> I spent about two bucks getting it off the clearance rack</li>
            <li> Such a waste.</li>
            <li> wear hats outside when it&#x27;s cold, and my hair gets flat and full of flyaways, while still looking flat and icky.  </li>
            <li> That said, it has taken me several uses to get the right amount of product in my hair without making it sticky and dirty feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with even dark blonde hair (let alone brown or black) could use this.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Absolutely no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was the only dry shampoo in my common drugstore/super market.</li>
            <li> every other shampoo I can think of.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty.</li>
            <li> I was a bit pessimistic due to the other reviews, but it has not made my hair greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d do my hair a favor and try washing my crisco-hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I have long, brown hair that I can not wash everyday or it gets dry/brittle</li>
            <li> It just works sometimes and doesn&#x27;t work other times, and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing differently.</li>
            <li> Extremely combustible.</li>
            <li> the other people who like it though</li>
            <li> I usually run a bit oily on my second day and this takes care of that.</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair every other day with this product.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so greasy and messy when I used even a little that I couldn&#x27;t even just throw it in a ponytail and wash it later.</li>
            <li> I know a few other women who are fanatics about dry shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> do not recommend FreshStart Dry Shampoo for those with very dark hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying dry shampoos for a few years now</li>
            <li> This makes me think that this relies heavily on the alcohol to dry out the roots</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers mentioned this definitely made my hair worse the second day - what a complete waste!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair look cleaner/drier like other dry shampoos - I felt weighed down and my hair was limp and seemed</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have extremely oily hair, even after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;The product removed some of the oil, but turned my dark brown hair gray and it looked as if I had dandruff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos that are a bit more expensive and decided to try this because its always on TV and not as expensive.</li>
            <li> For example, this is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that my husband hasn&#x27;t remarked on the smell- all the others he has (and definitely not in a good way).  </li>
            <li> It totally weighs your hair down and only makes your hair situation worse.  </li>
            <li> , I had a hard time brushing out the white color.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and when I spray this in, yes, it is visible initally</li>
            <li> I thought I must have done something wrong, since I can&#x27;t imagine how a popular hair brand could knowingly put such a horrible product on the market, but I see that I&#x27;m in good (bad?)</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and use it when my hair is starting to look dirty</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good and it gave my hair a disgusting feel.</li>
            <li> It does extend the life of the style but it is heavy and rough in the hair.  </li>
            <li> I can still style my hair, up or down, without any problem.  </li>
            <li> so I have to hunt it down online.</li>
            <li> WHILE THE WINDOWS WERE DOWN.  </li>
            <li> : Quick if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the mornings, cheap&lt;br /&gt;Cons: unpleasant waxy residue, results not guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ugh, it turns my dark brown hair white (even from far away), and it stinks like sulphur and mineral clay.  </li>
            <li> It actually makes my hair a little lighter in color and it looks thick.  </li>
            <li> Typically, I wash my hair every morning, but</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for, or in this case, less than you payed for.</li>
            <li> It just made my hair so greasy feeling (although it did appear less oily somehow) and it did nothing to lift my roots as promised.</li>
            <li> less than 5 at target at less than 6 here on amazon.</li>
            <li> but I color it black</li>
            <li> It does, however, make hair look less shiny, as it is a powdery substance meant to absorb shiny</li>
            <li> I ran out of Psst and decided to give this a shot - threw it out in less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not worth even a fraction of the few bucks I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo, it takes your hair at least a week to adjust to washing it less often.</li>
            <li> also completely covered my brush with nasty white layers of extra that was brushed out.</li>
            <li> It is a little stickier and heavier in your hair than others</li>
            <li> but the little I use helps to remove some of the buildup at my crown</li>
            <li> or I have a staticky mess - even with heavy humidity.</li>
            <li> She had dark brown hair like me, so hopefully I can trust her suggestion!</li>
            <li> but you can smell a little bit of baby powder/talc too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t overuse the product, I just use little spurts at the roots and massage the roots after a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> It has a green lid and costs around $7.  </li>
            <li> The powder left hair dusty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> The oiliness returns within a few minutes after use.  </li>
            <li> I even read the reviews that liked this product and tried to do what they said worked for them, but it was awful.</li>
            <li> My hair was stringy for a few washes in the places I used the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash and style it everyday.</li>
            <li> my hair was maleable like a clay pot that hadn&#x27;t dried yet.  </li>
            <li> even though it runs about $4, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money.</li>
            <li> save yourself the trouble and buy another brand.</li>
            <li> It does not work and it will be waste of money...</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> well if I spray it into my round brush and then brush it into my scalp.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I leaves my hair sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> and my hair went limp.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed because I have used other products by them and love it.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I would use baby powder to soak up any oiliness in between washes, but I got sick up smelling like a freshly-changed baby and Fresh Start</li>
            <li> I used this before brunch with some friends and someone mentioned my forehead looked pale.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day, it gets oily and gross and looks super thin, but I&#x27;m also very lazy and hate taking showers.  </li>
            <li> My hair was stiff and unwieldy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible - it does nothing buy weigh my hair down, make it more oily, and hhheeeaavvvvvyyyyy  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, dark brown, but I do get greasy at the scalp.</li>
            <li> In fact, it made my hair look even WORSE by making it smellier and dirtier than before, and it even seemed to make my hair stiff and clump together as if I had just used hairspray instead of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I hate having to wash my hair every day - it destroys my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> However, my hair did look a little dull and I needed to follow up with a shine spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not healthy to wash your hair every day, so</li>
            <li> Even with a small amount sprayed, you will want to wash it all out ASAP.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to shampoo my hair every day</li>
            <li> Before this product, I was not able to go a day without a shampoo, but now I can go 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> Big FAIL.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying this instead of my usual Klorane spray....</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s usually flipped out all over the place</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they released this....</li>
            <li> i was so horrified when anyone would come up to me to ask a question, or walk past my desk and upon looking at me</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband to use on lazy weekends when he doesn&#x27;t feel like showering, but I also thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> On my husband, his hair merely looked the same afterward; just as oily as before.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on darker hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> The cons of this product is that I don&#x27;t like the way it smells, I usually spritz my hair with some perfume to mask the smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells terrible and often makes my hair look even more greasy.</li>
            <li> I usually grab the batiste from Sallys but got this instead.  </li>
            <li> I picked up a small (2 oz)</li>
            <li> What I found was when I used this product my hair felt thicker and fuller than usual.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t brush it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> My roots looked more disgusting than they&#x27;ve ever looked!</li>
            <li> I have tried several brands in search of one that I can call &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; and this one is so bad at the &#x27;dry shampoo&#x27; concept that I can&#x27;t be bothered to finish the can off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair does have a thin layer of somewhat unpleasant residue on it, but I don&#x27;t touch my hair very much out of the shower</li>
            <li> seriously... please don&#x27;t waste your money on waterless shampoos...</li>
            <li> Leaves behind white powder that looked worse than your unclean hair.</li>
            <li> Not a very good move.  </li>
            <li> All the reasons that are given as to why the product is horrible, are ALL TRUE!</li>
            <li> application of the dry shampoo is difficult in that the contents inside the can don&#x27;t seem to want to spray together (the powder and the hairspray).</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Suave dry shampoo and saw Tresemme in a store (where I couldn&#x27;t check Amazon reviews, alas!).  </li>
            <li> I am very surprised by all of the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Not your Mother&#x27;s dry shampoo and its awful, but that has high reviews on here!</li>
            <li> If you try to run your fingers through it to shake it out, you&#x27;ll have a hard time of it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to brush out also.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note when you first spray this on  (36\\&quot;away) you will notice this white residue, if you than comb your hair it gets into your brush, the smell is awful, the hair feels greasy, stiff, dry UNMANAGEABLE :(.....</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li> (I wich there was an option to give this product a negative star rating...)    </li>
            <li> i woke up late for work and having had washed my hair yesterday</li>
            <li> I used it about five times before the spray stopped working entirely, leaving me with a half-full can of disappointment.</li>
            <li> this one sucks and does NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li> I should have known because all tresemme products are horrible and cheap.</li>
            <li> I also did not develop the greasy look that seems common.</li>
            <li> When it came time to brush it out, it proved to be a messy experience and in the end his hair looked like a dusty gray color.</li>
            <li> It dried clumpy and made my hair feel worse than it was before I sprayed the product in it.</li>
            <li> Waste of five bucks!!</li>
            <li> It also leaves white residue which is annoying because I have dark hair.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and by far the worst.</li>
            <li> This is by far the WORST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Wow, was I shocked to read such bad reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> Also, it was nearly impossible to brush out all of the white stuff, even with a boar bristle brush.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, try the Suave.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend anyone seriously using this product.</li>
            <li> It actually thickens my hair (in a gross way) and makes it smell like a disgusting maple syrup or something.  </li>
            <li> I said, judging by the terrible reviews, I might have gotten lucky.  </li>
            <li> Like, it burns your nostrils to spray even a little bit of it in your hair, and unfortunately, your hair will continue to smell for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Well this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> I have a disability such that it is painful to get in the shower to wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I had to do one for this because I hated it that much.  </li>
            <li> Having tried others, I can definitely say this is the WORST dry shampoo on the market,</li>
            <li> the texture of my hair becomes stiff and difficult to manage.</li>
            <li> Makes the hair very hard and stiff and hair looks worse than before putting product in!</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the nasty smell....</li>
            <li> This product is not only ineffective, but it makes my head itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> Before this product, I was so frustrated with dry shampoo that I just put baby powder in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s tough to find in my country</li>
            <li> I have tried three other dry shampoos and this is the worst of the three.</li>
            <li> Aside from the very unpleasant smell, the product barely did what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I also have quite a bit of hair, not at all like the thin head of hair my son has.</li>
            <li> My hair was worse than before.</li>
            <li> It made it WORSE.  </li>
            <li> All it does is coat my hair with a dusty powder.  </li>
            <li> Makes it look worse than before.  </li>
            <li> And it looks worse than it did before I tried it.   </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, and my hair, if anything, was WORSE -</li>
            <li> It does nothing to refresh you hair, in fact it looks worse with this product.</li>
            <li> The white clay color eventually brushes out, but hair still looks filthy.</li>
            <li> It does not absorb the oil, in fact, makes my hair look worse.</li>
            <li> The product makes your hair worse.</li>
            <li> Overall I hate this product.</li>
            <li> I ended up washing my hair to get the dusty residue out.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps even worse than all that, though, was that it made my medium-blonde hair look gray.  </li>
            <li> It just makes things worse - my hair still looks greasy</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel worse, oilier.</li>
            <li> Also, I have thin, wavy, oily hair</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling dirty, greasy, and stiff.  </li>
            <li> As a dry shampoo it is utterly worthless.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I had to pull my hair up in a bun to try to conceal the mess this created.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty :(</li>
            <li> Well, this one is by far the worst.</li>
            <li> Still leaves hair somewhat greasy, and leaves behind HORRIBLE white powder!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After this disastrous experience, I&#x27;m not sure why I decided to give it a try, but I did.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells weird.</li>
            <li> I so wanted it to work, but it failed on all counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vaguely citrusy with a chemical after-smell.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair 10x worse than it was!</li>
            <li> Well, I got what I paid for, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> It completely failed for both of us.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything but leave its nasty white residue in my brush and make my hair look unwashed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the smell seemed to linger as I could catch whiffs of it during the day.</li>
            <li> for all that ill wash my hair.</li>
            <li> leaves residue and makes your hair feel weird</li>
            <li> So now I have to wash my hair and my brush and throw away this useless product.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t heard a word from them not even a \\&quot;sorry our product didn&#x27;t work\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> Overall terrible purchase.</li>
            <li> so i thought i couldnt go wrong with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Wrong</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it depends on hair type as to how well this product works, but I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> , I have very thin hair that gets oily after a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The worst product I ever came across, my hair feels dry looks ashy and feels like hay when i washed it off.</li>
            <li> dry shampoo - Worst one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of dry shampoos and this is the worst.</li>
            <li> I tried it this morning and it left my hair feeling dirty and disgusting.</li>

            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo ever.</li>
            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This is probably the worst dry shampoo I have ever tried...</li>
            <li> When I received it there was a hole in the can which made it impossible to get out and useless.</li>
            <li> (I only started blow drying two years ago), because I have horrible thin hair that always makes me feel like no matter what I do to it, it looks terrible.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels dirty and sticky with this product in.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your hair dirty and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> then becomes dirty and oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s horrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Also after using it for two days, my head is itching like crazy.</li>
            <li> Also the product was disappointing.</li>
            <li> but this was a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> After using per instructions, my hair felt heavy, sticky, greasy, goopy... disgusting.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend walked past the bathroom after I sprayed this in my hair and exclaimed at how disgusting the smell was.</li>
            <li> I usually trust Tresemme products, but this has got to be the worst thing I have ever put on my head.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is lighter in color, I don&#x27;t have the powdery look as bad as darker haired women might get.  </li>
            <li> It is so bad.</li>
            <li> the smell of this wasnt bad</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just not an option for me, too bad.</li>
            <li> Bad product.</li>
            <li> The powder residue was ridiculously bad.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not obnoxiously bad</li>
            <li> and I looked like I had really bad dandruff ):</li>
            <li> I was frustrated and had to wash it again.  </li>
            <li> I was frustrated but in a ditch effort I decided to try to email tressemme to get a refund or</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed after trying this product and wish I read reviews before purchasing.</li>
            <li> My hair looks dirty and greasier AFTER I spray this than before I used it!</li>
            <li> Boy was I disappointed.</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t leave that gray crap in my hair.</li>

            <li> I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that being said, this product is unfortunately the worst of the worst.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m shocked at the terrible reviews on this, but I understand that this probably doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried more than half a dozen different dry shampoos and this is the one I end up coming back to.  I am very surprised by all of the bad reviews.  A big thing that makes me prefer this one is that it doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, especially in comparrison to the terrible, overwhelming, cheap perfume type smell that most other dry shampoos have.  For example, this is the only dry shampoo I have ever used that my husband hasn&#x27;t remarked on the smell- all the others he has (and definitely not in a good way).  It is a little stickier and heavier in your hair than others but I don&#x27;t mind that as a trade off to the smell issue.  I can still style my hair, up or down, without any problem.  I have dark brown hair and when I spray this in, yes, it is visible initally but after I brush my hair it is not.  Overall I think this is a good dry shampoo- I do wish it sprayed lighter (in regards to weight, not color), though.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m shocked at the terrible reviews on this, but I understand that this probably doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. I&#x27;ve been using this (and the foam version) for quite a while, so I came here to review it.&lt;br /&gt;Like a lot of people, my hair is very fine and gets oily after one day- but it&#x27;s not healthy to wash your hair every day, so during breaks I&#x27;ll only do so every two days. I like to use this if I&#x27;m going out. Though the scent on this one isn&#x27;t as nice as the foam, it&#x27;s bearable, and my hair feels much cleaner. My favorite part about this, though, is that my hair feels like it has a ton of volume when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, judging by the terrible reviews, I might have gotten lucky.  But it did happen to work out for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Tresemme Fresh Start Dry Shampoo because I&#x27;ve started growing my hair out and am trying to not wash my hair so often.  I have medium-blonde fine hair, and I&#x27;m approaching 40 so my hair is drier than it used to be so I like to keep the natural oils in it. I started using this product on the third day after a shampoo.  Honestly, it works fine for me.  Your hair will not look freshly shampooed, but it does eliminate the greasies when used correctly.  Since my hair is lighter in color, I don&#x27;t have the powdery look as bad as darker haired women might get.  It also works best when you use absolutely no other product in your hair that day - no mousse or gel or serum of any kind. In fairness, this is the only dry shampoo product I&#x27;ve tried so can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.  I&#x27;ll keep using it as long as it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> After putting this in my hair i have not been able to get it out.  NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I WASH MY HAIR ITS STICKY LIKE THERE IS GLUE IN IT.  I&#x27;ve tried everything I can to try and get it out - dish soap, baking soda, clarifying shampoo, every other shampoo I can think of.  NOTHING WORKS.  I look horrible.  This stuff RUINED MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> I am not one to come and write reviews very often but I had to after trying this product. It is so bad. All the reasons that are given as to why the product is horrible, are ALL TRUE! There is nothing positive to say about this product. I was desperate this morning, and decided to give it one more try. What a MISTAKE! Again, it left it so gummy and stiff and honestly still oily to the touch. It&#x27;s gross and I will throw it and never ever use it again.</li>
            <li> I get my hair cut very rarely and know almost nothing about hair or styling it (I only started blow drying two years ago), because I have horrible thin hair that always makes me feel like no matter what I do to it, it looks terrible.  If I don&#x27;t wash my hair every single day, it gets oily and gross and looks super thin, but I&#x27;m also very lazy and hate taking showers.  I look forward to weekends or long weekends when I don&#x27;t wash it.  Recently I shared this with my favorite hair stylist and she did my hair very nicely and put this spray in and recommended I buy it (from Target or Walmart, she carried a more expensive brand version), now I only wash my hair every 3 days!!!!!  It&#x27;s such a time saver and my hair actually looks good!  I love it.  Saves me a lot of time.</li>
            <li> This is the least effective dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried--in fact, my hair was greasier than if I&#x27;d left it alone. Batiste, Klorane, heck, even Psst, are all superior to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this dry shampoo, I have used several other brands including Rockaholic by Tigi, Bumble and Bumble&#x27;s dry shampoo spray, and a cheap drugstore brand, Pssst is what I think it is named. This Tresemme dry shampoo is comparable to Rockaholic in the fact that it is a white powder and they smell similar, fruity slightly citrus smell. this product really does the trick and its a bit cheaper than Rockaholic by comparison. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to hear about this dry shampoo. I straighten my hair a lot and I thought it would be nice to be able to skip washing my hair every other day. Well this is not a good product. It turns my hair a grayish color and takes forever to brush out. After I FINALLY got it out it looked no different then when I put it in. I was totally unsatisfied. Also, it smells weird. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s not a smell I&#x27;d consider good. Anyway, since I tried this dry shampoo, I tried another one. The new one smelled fruity and good. It also didn&#x27;t leave that gray crap in my hair. All in all, I would never reccomend this to someone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hated this stuff. Leaves white flakes in hair and all in brush that looks like dandruff.  Hair feels dirty and sticky with this product in.  Even with a small amount sprayed, you will want to wash it all out ASAP.  Worst stuff to put in your hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight brown hair that has always been oily.  Typically, I wash my hair every morning, but some mornings I just don&#x27;t have time.  A couple years ago, I purchased a dry shampoo from Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply called Batiste. It has a green lid and costs around $7.  This was a more affordable option compared to the more expensive brands I had tried at Sephora.  I have been very pleased with Batiste and have been a loyal customer, but because of the price of TRESseme&#x27;s dry shampoo, I purchased a bottle to try it out.  I would not recommend TRESemme&#x27;s product to anyone.  It was a complete waste of money and I ended up throwing the bottle away after two uses.  The product does not work as it claims.  So much for saving $3.  It makes the texture of my hair feel grimy and the white residue does not go away even after combing it through continuously.  I typically do not write reviews on products, but for some reason, I felt compelled because TRESemme has traditionally been a brand I trust to provide quality/value products.  If your hair is like mine, though, spend a few extra bucks and get a product that works.  Try Batiste if you want a value brand that will also get the job done.[[ASIN:B000N5S0KE Batiste Dry Shampoo]]</li>
            <li> I initially got this product for younger son who at the time would only wash his hair every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son was excited about the idea of not washing his hair. But his first and only use of this was a disaster. He has straight hair that is on the oily side, but his hair is also very dark, nearly black. I helped him spray it on, trying to get a nice even layer near his roots. But since his hair is fine, I think I overdid it a bit and got way more of the white powdery spray on than I needed. When it came time to brush it out, it proved to be a messy experience and in the end his hair looked like a dusty gray color. He ended up washing most of it out with water and his hair looked worse than it did to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this disastrous experience, I&#x27;m not sure why I decided to give it a try, but I did. I have a layered bob, and while my hair is dark, it is more of a dark auburn with highlights. I also have quite a bit of hair, not at all like the thin head of hair my son has. I sprayed it through my layers, and then brushed it out. I found with me that it worked much better. It did indeed give my hair more volume and made it feel cleaner. However, my hair did look a little dull and I needed to follow up with a shine spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend FreshStart Dry Shampoo for those with very dark hair. I also think if your hair is thin or fine, it might be a bit hard to use, as it was with my son. But for those folks with regular to thick hair that is lighter or highlighted, it&#x27;s a decent product that actually works as well as more expensive dry shampoos. 3 stars.</li>
            <li> The worst product I ever came across, my hair feels dry looks ashy and feels like hay when i washed it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying dry shampoos for a few years now and I found this product not only smells better but works better and is MUCH more budget-friendly than the high-end dry shampoos. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s tough to find in my country so I have to hunt it down online. Sooo worth it though.    NOTE: If you&#x27;ve never used dry shampoo, it takes your hair at least a week to adjust to washing it less often. Before that time, hair will be oily and unmanageable on the second day no matter which dry shampoo you use. You&#x27;ll notice that all the low-ratings for this product are a result of not accounting for this adjustment period.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw the commercials for this. Like a good little consumer, I immediately went and bought some. I so wanted it to work, but it failed on all counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It doesn&#x27;t smell good. Not awful, but not good. Vaguely citrusy with a chemical after-smell.&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair was worse than before. It looked and felt more greasy, if anything.&lt;br /&gt;3) It totally weighed my hair down. I swear my head felt heavier.&lt;br /&gt;4) My hair was stiff and unwieldy.&lt;br /&gt;5) The mineral compound was white and looked like the grossest dandruff in my brown hair. I could not get it out, no matter how much I brushed.&lt;br /&gt;6) And speaking of brushes, mine was coated with the stuff, and I couldn&#x27;t wash it off. The only way it finally came out was as I was brushing my hair the next day. Great, just what I wanted, more of this gunk in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I had to shower and wash my hair after using this stuff just to be presentable. I think I&#x27;ll try to get my money back. Like many other reviewers, I don&#x27;t even know how this product came to be on the market. Don&#x27;t they do testing? It&#x27;s awful stuff.</li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been trying different dry shampoos and decided to share my experience in hopes that it will help others find the right one for their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Relevant about me: I have twin babies and don&#x27;t have time to shower and wash my hair in the mornings like I used to. I quickly found that even though I showered and washed my hair every night, by morning my hair was somewhat oily and needed refreshing. Here began my quest to find a dry shampoo that worked for me. I have shoulder length, straight, fine, color treated blonde hair and I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: I usually pull up most of my hair with a clasp, spray the roots, use flat iron, let down a little more of my hair, spray the roots, use flat iron, and keep repeating until I&#x27;ve sprayed and styled all my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like: It has a pleasant smell and goes on smoothly. When sprayed lightly, it dries up oils and refreshes the hair at first. It blends in well with my blonde hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like: I no longer use this dry shampoo because it didn&#x27;t last all day. It would look good right after styling, but after a few hours of wear, my hair looked oily again and needed refreshing once more. I had high hopes for this dry shampoo since the only brand of hair spray I use is Tresemme. Needless to say, I was quite disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After weighing the good and the bad,  I give it 2 stars. I did use up the bottle I bought, but would never buy this kind again. I don&#x27;t have time to use dry shampoo more than once a day. I am currently using Salon Grafix - Play it Big. (You can see my review of this one on its product page). This dry shampoo goes for about $10 a bottle at my local grocery store (Harris Teeter), but I only have to use it once in the morning and my hair looks good all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re interested, here are the other brands I&#x27;ve tried. You can find a more in depth review that I&#x27;ve done of these on their amazon product pages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pantene dry shampoo - Worst one I&#x27;ve tried. Didn&#x27;t refresh hair. Smelled awesome though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salon Grafix Play It Big - This is the dry shampoo I currently use. I like that it has color tinted options, refreshes hair well, and smells fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave dry shampoo: This was the one I used before finding Salon Grafix. It worked well, but the smell was AWFUL.</li>
            <li> I bought this dry shampoo so I could get some of the grease out of my layered hair the day after I wash.  It made it WORSE.  It made the top layer look ok, but the rest was just made worse.  I was frustrated and had to wash it again.  I would never buy this again.  I wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I saw it noted as an Allure beauty award winner and decided it was worth a try since it was so much cheaper than the Klorane I was using. This product is horrible! It actually makes your hair looks dirtier and more greasy! I was extremely disappointed. Tried to use it several times just to give it the benefit of a doubt, but it was just a waste of time. You&#x27;re better off using nothing than to use this.</li>
            <li> I did not like this AT ALL!!! The smell is horrendous! The powder left hair dusty. The BEST one I&#x27;ve used is PSSSSST! for brunettes...and they stopped making it! ARGG!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money...it costs $3 at the local supermarket...you get what you pay for, or in this case, less than you payed for.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with this product whatsoever.  I followed the directions and my hair was revived and smelled nice.</li>
            <li> I actually saw this product advertised in a magaizine and thought I would try it out.  I have medium blonde fine long hair and it works fantastic for me.  The second day after shampoo I spray it on the roots, wait about 5 min and lightly brush it. It actually makes my hair a little lighter in color and it looks thick.  I have even been in a jam and had to use it an extra day and it was still ok.  The thing with this is that I do not use any product on my hair, no hairspray, gel, mousse, etc. I think thats why it works for me.  I also sleep with my hair in a bun (to keep it looking somewhat fresh).  Its just not for everyone.</li>
            <li> My mom and I both have problems with greasy hair if we do not wash it daily. We&#x27;ve both had impressive results with Tresemme&#x27;s dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of horror stories about dry shampoo scents, Tresemme&#x27;s scent is pretty subtle. It takes a little trial and error to see how much/little of the product your hair needs, but I would definitely recommend this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair, and up until recently, have shampooed it everyday. I&#x27;ve been trying different dry shampoos, and this one is the best so far. I wish it had a nicer scent to it, but it leaves my hair feeling much less oily and looking much better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve begun to consider myself an expert at dry shampoo. I used to use a name brand that you could only by from a popular shop from home channel. It worked great &amp; didn&#x27;t leave white residue in my dark hair or weight my very fine hair down. Then they discontinued it &amp; I have been searching ever since. I&#x27;ve tried several expensive brands, popular brands, etc and all left me wanting. Either they turned my dark hair into a white powdery mess or the cans would clog after the first use, or they just didn&#x27;t work. I decided to give this drugstore brand a try. Here is what I have found. If you use too much, your hair will be left feeling greasy, maybe even waxy, dirty &amp; in need of a wash which is the exact opposite of what we are going for by purchasing dry shampoo to begin with. My main problem area is the crown of my head. It gets greasy which causes my fine hair to plaster to my scalp &amp; at some point you can just see my scalp. Not pretty. Sometimes less is more. I have found this will work if I take a brush &amp; going in sections I VERY LIGHTLY spritz the shampoo on &amp; follow with quick brushes &amp; so on. Making sure not to use too much. This seems to work better. I don&#x27;t get the buildup because I am barely using any but the little I use helps to remove some of the buildup at my crown so I can work with it better. I won&#x27;t buy again though... my search continues for a dry shampoo I can be happy with again.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice much of a difference when using this product. Honestly, a little baby powder rubbed into my scalp along the part line works best.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are both kind of sensitive to chemical smells, and this product goes overboard. I can&#x27;t use it unless my husband has already left for the morning. Honestly, did this product even need a fragrance? Blech.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have long, fine, straight hair that becomes oily at the roots at the end of the day.  I usually have to shampoo my hair every day, otherwise it&#x27;s too oily for my liking.  I bought TRESemme Fresh Start Dry Shampoo hoping that it would get rid of the oil and allow me to wash my hair every other day but, unfortunately, this product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  The oiliness returns within a few minutes after use.  I have tried Oscar Blandi which is more expensive but works better than this product.</li>
            <li> I have used a number of dry shampoos and this is the worst. I even read the reviews that liked this product and tried to do what they said worked for them, but it was awful. My hair felt like clay. I tried to brush it out, or even in but it did not work. I had to wash it out.</li>
            <li> Before I used Batiste dry shampoo and I love it , but because I couldnot buy this product in store but only on amazon(+ shipping) , I bought THIS brand (3 items!). O my goodness, what a mistake . My hair looked terrible , feels terrible when i touch them ,ofcouse I could not wait to come home and wash my head .And also after washing i lost hair more than usual</li>
            <li> This does seem to absorb oil from the hair. The volumizing kind leaves a residue, which is what helps it add volume. It does seem to dry hair out over time, as well. I like the texture it provides. My hair is blond-brown, and the spray doesn&#x27;t really show up unless I put too much in one place. On darker hair, it shows up as gray, so beware! I keep buying this over and over, so I must like it!</li>
            <li> This stuff sucks.  All it does is coat my hair with a dusty powder.  Makes it look worse than before.  Never again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.  I was a bit pessimistic due to the other reviews, but it has not made my hair greasy at all.  It does what it is intended to do.  I used as directed on the can.  Before this product, I was not able to go a day without a shampoo, but now I can go 2-3 days.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This works okay, but I couldn&#x27;t help feeling that the spray itself, at times, only made my hair greasier.  The &amp;#34;Not Your Mother&#x27;s&amp;#34; brand worked much better for me, so I probably wouldn&#x27;t order this again.</li>
            <li> I get oily hair after 1 day and wanted to try something that would allow me to look ok if I couldn&#x27;t shower in the morning (4 kids!!) I tried it this morning and it left my hair feeling dirty and disgusting. And it looks worse than it did before I tried it.   This product won&#x27;t be on the shelves long. Big FAIL.</li>
            <li> Yea this product is absolutely awful.  It did nothing at all for my oily smelly hair.  It just made my hair more sticky and dry.  Returning this ASAP.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of trying this instead of my usual Klorane spray....and it made my hair look so greasy I had to come up with an impromptu updo at work to hide my gross scalp.  Guess I&#x27;m back to Klorane which isn&#x27;t cheap...but clearly worth it.  I was expecting more, because I usually love Tresemme.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers mentioned this definitely made my hair worse the second day - what a complete waste!!! Don&#x27;t buy it, I haven&#x27;t tried other dry shampoos yet so hopefully they can only get better from here.</li>
            <li> This is terrible! It makes my hair 10x worse than it was! It makes it super stiff, it takes no oil away, and leaves flakes in your hair! Do not buy! I had to wash my hair after using this!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t cost a fortune.  Well, I got what I paid for, unfortunately.  This stuff left my hair gummy!  Also, it was nearly impossible to brush out all of the white stuff, even with a boar bristle brush.  The only reason that I didn&#x27;t give it one star is because the smell was pleasant and there seemed to be a lot of product in the bottle (some dry shampoos really skimp).  After this, I discovered the Suave dry shampoo, which ROCKS, and is even cheaper.  Seriously, try the Suave.  I&#x27;ve paid ten times as much for dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to use this product 3 times just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t some sort of fluke the other two times. My hair looked and felt like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in weeks instead of helping it look cleaner. I have fairly oily hair and have used dry shampoos before to help make it an extra day without shampooing, but this is the worst by far.</li>
            <li> I have a disability such that it is painful to get in the shower to wash my hair.  I have oily hair, and this product enables me to only wash my hair every other day. Before this product, I was so frustrated with dry shampoo that I just put baby powder in my hair.  This is the first dry shampoo that works better than baby powder without a bad odor or any visible residue.&lt;br /&gt;My feeling about the low reviews is that, if you are not in a position where you need dry shampoo, don&#x27;t use it.  No dry shampoo can substitute for washing hair. For people who cannot wash every day, such as people with disabilities, campers, and double-shift workers, this is a life saver.</li>
            <li> If you spray really lightly and really far from your head, your hair will look less oily for some of the day. However, it does not absorb the oil for long and your head will start looking greasy/oily again. If you spray too close to your head or too much, your hair will look oilier than before and feel yucky and heavy. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> For those who did not like the product, you may not have seen in the directions that you are suppose to BRUSH this product out, which is not always the case with dry shampoo.  I have used every dry shampoo on the market, this is by far my favorite for the price.  I spray it in my hair THE NIGHT BEFORE when I go to bed and then I brush it out in the morning, it gives me Beyonce hair.  No joke, I get nothing but compliments every time I use this product.  I don&#x27;t normally get that many compliments on my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would work the same way as Tigi Rock-a-holic which I normally buy and this one is quite a bit cheaper. I am very picky about smells and the smell of this wasnt bad but it really didnt do anything to my hair except made it look greaser than before i sprayed it. I have blonde hair and i noticed after i sprayed this it left a white residue on my head- almost like daundruff. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I would very highly recommend tigi rock-a- holic to anyone looking for a great dry shampoo- I am on my 6th can of it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work but it didn&#x27;t. I have fine hair that needs washed every day or else it&#x27;s oily and obvious I didn&#x27;t shampoo - I work in a professional environment so going to work with greasy hair is not an option. I was told to try this first by my Stylist before purchasing their own dry shampoo to see if I liked it, my stylist has really great thick hair and she said she used it frequently and for around $4 I thought I&#x27;d give it a go.     First off, let me say that I have the type of fine hair that is completely unmanageable. When I wake up in the morning it&#x27;s usually flipped out all over the place and it cannot be styled with heat while it&#x27;s totally dry or I have a staticky mess - even with heavy humidity. With this in mind I would take a shower, get my hair wet (and not wash it) blow dry it then apply this dry shampoo. This method didn&#x27;t really work, my hair would look ok but feel gross and by midday it was really heavy and started to look greasy.     Today I had the opportunity to finally try this dry shampoo the way the directions say to use it. I had to be up really early for work and my hair looked pretty good so I used this product on dry, unwashed hair and I was happy for about 10 minutes but after that 10 minutes it started to feel and look greasy. I continued to get ready and would spray more in my hair, the exact same places I already sprayed it but again, it would start to look and feel gross again. This makes me think that this relies heavily on the alcohol to dry out the roots and once that alcohol dissipates or is absorbed then the scalp just produces more oil to compensate for the alcohol.     I really wanted this product to work, I hear everyone talking about not washing their hair everyday and how healthy it looks/feels but that&#x27;s just not an option for me, too bad. One star.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not worth even a fraction of the few bucks I paid for it. I have used other dry shampoo products in the past, and even have used good ole&#x27; fashion baby powder in a pinch. They ALL (even the baby powder) work ten times better than Tresemme dry shampoo. This product will leave your hair greasy, grimey, and crunchy. As another reviewer stated, good luck getting it to wash out of your hair in one wash. My hair was stringy for a few washes in the places I used the product. Don&#x27;t waste your money or your time on this product.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is nothing like the Batiste that I&#x27;ve been using, which was the first dry shampoo I ever tried.  Tresemme dry shampoo comes out of the can wet, and dries into a sticky, gummy powder.  Yuck!  The Batiste spray comes out of the can at what seems a much higher velocity, and there is no wetness detectable.  Then, what you do have is a silky, perfectly non-sticky powder (all the dry shampoos work under a powder principle, I think).  I love my Batiste.  I will never buy the Tresemme again; in fact, I threw it away.</li>
            <li> Ugh, it turns my dark brown hair white (even from far away), and it stinks like sulphur and mineral clay.  It doesn&#x27;t so much absorb oil as just transfer it and make your hair heavy and look like you sprayed stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth it for the price when you can get nicer dry shampoo for a few bucks more.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I hate having to wash my hair every day - it destroys my hair quickly. I have fine, oily hair, and it is obvious by Day 2 that I haven&#x27;t shampooed. I followed the directions, and my hair, if anything, was WORSE - it looked and felt more greasy than before I put the stuff in, it also coated my brush with white dust (probably the \\&quot;mineral clay\\&quot; that was supposed to absorb the oil). TOTAL WASTE of money.</li>
            <li> Having fine, yet heavy wavy hair, I find dry shampoo to be my favorite styling product. So for the past few months, I&#x27;ve been on a mission to try as many different brands (of the drugstore variety) until I find my favorite. Well, this one is by far the worst. It just made my hair so greasy feeling (although it did appear less oily somehow) and it did nothing to lift my roots as promised. Usually I will still finish the can even if i&#x27;m not crazy about it, but this went right into the trash!</li>
            <li> This is the 4th dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried and by far the worst. It does nothing to refresh you hair, in fact it looks worse with this product. I&#x27;m not sure how they released this....did they not test it??? I really wanted to like it because it is a good price point but it was terrible.</li>
            <li> (I wich there was an option to give this product a negative star rating...)    I bought this because i had never used a Waterless Shampoo before, only baby powder, and aerosol dry shampoos (which i LOVE but are too pricey for not alot of product) I picked this up loving the idea of having a lot of product for like only $5.    The first time i used it; I wasn&#x27;t horrified, but i wasn&#x27;t impressed either; so I put it on the bathroom shelf and there it sat until this morning. i woke up late for work and having had washed my hair yesterday i wasn&#x27;t all that \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; looking but there was a little shine near the roots that i wanted to diminish. I pumped 2 squirts on to my roots, massaged it in; dried it as best as i could with a towel, and then combed my hair and left the house. all day long i felt greasy, looked greasy, and also felt like i had an itchy scalp. i was so horrified when anyone would come up to me to ask a question, or walk past my desk and upon looking at me their eyes would instantly shoot up to my shiny greasy looking roots. I kept myself busy in my little corner cubical and barely came out from it all day long avoiding everyone when i&#x27;d pop out for a bathroom break. I even pulled out my compact powder and sprinkled a little on the roots around my forehead to soak up the oily mess that this product was supposed to make it better, not worse...     this stuff isn&#x27;t worth the container that it&#x27;s in! seriously... please don&#x27;t waste your money on waterless shampoos... only powdery dry shampoos soak up oil instead of just disperseing it around your head!!!</li>
            <li> I agree with the majority of reviews. I&#x27;m brunette and recently switched to a straight, flat iron style. Thought I&#x27;d do my hair a favor and try washing my crisco-hair every other day. This is the only drugstore brand of dry shampoo I could even find. Waste of five bucks!! Makes my hair look and feel dirtier than it was to start with. Tried it a couple of times thinking maybe I&#x27;m not doing something right. Not shaking enough, using too much, etc. Nope, this stuff is just junk. The white clay color eventually brushes out, but hair still looks filthy. I spoke with a clerk at Sephora and he recommended a silica version instead of a clay based.</li>
            <li> I have fine blonde hair that looks greasy if not washed everyday. I&#x27;ve been using this now a couple times a week for about 4 months.  It does seems to take some practice, but I&#x27;ve gotten it to work pretty well on days when I wake up late or don&#x27;t want to take the time to re-style.&lt;br /&gt;My hair doesn&#x27;t feel the same as when its been freshly washed; when I run my hands through it&#x27;s a little stiff from the clay.  However, it looks good &amp; smells good. In other words, its best for a style that you won&#x27;t touch very much--put in a headband or a barrette &amp; leave it.&lt;br /&gt;The product is pretty inexpensive too--less than 5 at target at less than 6 here on amazon. One thing to be careful of--shake it well and frequently while you are using it. If you don&#x27;t the aerosol will be used up long before the liquid inside.  And...use it on your roots only.</li>
            <li> I use this frequently to refresh my hair so I don&#x27;t have to wash and style it everyday.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed after trying this product and wish I read reviews before purchasing. The fragrance is overwhelmingly strong and lasts in your hair all day. I sprayed a very liberal amount in my hair and it smelled like either a bottle of old lady&#x27;s perfume or like a hair dresser unloaded an entire can of hairspray on my head. Aside from the very unpleasant smell, the product barely did what it claims to do. I have used other dry shampoos before and this product absorbed very little oil from my hair. Aside from the headache I got from the odor, I saw almost no change after using this product. I will not consider purchasing any Tresemme products after using this one and will be immediately returning this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is the worst hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried. I bought it for my husband to use on lazy weekends when he doesn&#x27;t feel like showering, but I also thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It completely failed for both of us. On my husband, his hair merely looked the same afterward; just as oily as before. But for me, it totally ruined my hair for the day. After an unexpected invitation for Christmas shopping today, I decided to touch up the roots of my hair with this shampoo, since by the end of a day without showering they tend to get a bit oily. 3 brief sprays on my roots, 3 minutes waiting, and now my hair is stiff, lifeless, dull-colored (I&#x27;m dark blonde), and feels like I used an entire bottle of hairspray on it. No amount of brushing is helping to get this stuff out of my hair! I thought I must have done something wrong, since I can&#x27;t imagine how a popular hair brand could knowingly put such a horrible product on the market, but I see that I&#x27;m in good (bad?) company. I guess it&#x27;s a ponytail for me today.</li>
            <li> I have tried three other dry shampoos and this is the worst of the three. It does not absorb the oil, in fact, makes my hair look worse. Do not stock up because it&#x27;s a good price until you try it first.</li>
            <li> I have used several different dry shampoos. I decided to try this one because it was on sale and I had a coupon. HORRIBLE!!! Still leaves hair somewhat greasy, and leaves behind HORRIBLE white powder! Its just awful. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> There is a reason this is so cheap. It doesn&#x27;t work. Leaves behind white powder that looked worse than your unclean hair.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the nasty smell....eeeeewww[...] I mean, really nauseatingly gross.  Then I noticed that the build up from one usage was insane....my hair was maleable like a clay pot that hadn&#x27;t dried yet.  But the final issue that really did me in was that I only used it 4 times and the sprayer stopped working even though the can was almost full so I dumped it.  I normally use Oscar Blandi dry shampoo which smells decent, but I am blonde and it&#x27;s a white powder so I&#x27;m not sure how it would work on darker hair. It&#x27;s also $20 for the larger bottle but I will using the Oscar and not going back to the Tresemme grossness.</li>
            <li> I used it once and thought OK it works, my hair smelled good and didn&#x27;t look super bad but the next time I tried it...... The bottle was empty. I bought another one thinking it a fluke, happened again. Worst ever. Complete waste of money!</li>
            <li> When I see online reviews claiming this product is great, I now feel like I can&#x27;t trust the judgment of the bloggers.  This is by far the WORST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  It weighed down my hair considerably (even though I didn&#x27;t use much)-I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair because it was so stuck together and clumpy.  It just made me want to wash my hair.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything but leave its nasty white residue in my brush and make my hair look unwashed. Another reviewer said it was impossible to remove, but I was able to wash my hair once to get it out (I used Pantene Flat to Volume if that helps). Overall, it&#x27;s not worth it so try a different product.</li>
            <li> Not only did this not make my hair look any cleaner... it smells awful!  The strong fragrance made me have a sore throat all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other dry shampoos successfully (Ojon, Batiste), but this one just does not work.  It leaves your hair dirty and greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this since it was cheap and a well-known brand, and now I just have 2 bottles of this stuff that I will never use. It just doesn&#x27;t work and leaves your hair all nasty. I would recommend Batiste! Batiste was a no name for me but it works!</li>
            <li> I love this product..I will only go one day without washing my hair and when I do I use this and it works great... I   also like to use after washing and drying my hair.. I have really fine hair and it gives my hair a lot of body and helps get rid of the frizzys.. If you have fine hair try it after washing your hair and see if it gives your hair more body..</li>
            <li> I have never used a dry shampoo fancier than Pssst brand, but cheapo Pssst blows this crud out of the water.  It seems to be a combination of a stiff hair spray and some kind of powder rather than just a fine powder with a propellant like other dry shampoos are (and which absorb oil and then brush or shake out easily).  This stuff adheres the powder to your hair and makes your hair into, essentially, a sort of sticky, fused, extra-matte, flat solid.  If you try to run your fingers through it to shake it out, you&#x27;ll have a hard time of it.  You can try to comb it out and watch how it holds the exact impression of the teeth of your comb like magic!  It also leaves a persistent white residue (I&#x27;m blonde) that doesn&#x27;t want to brush or shake off.  In other words, if you want to have enough texture, moldability, and solidity in your hair to tease it up into a massive matte white curled beehive and then put a miniature four-masted ship in it for decoration à la Marie Antoinette, this product will facilitate that.  If you want your hair to get a quick spruce-up at the roots after a workout or if you oversleep and can&#x27;t shampoo, this is NOT the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say this:  the instructions for many of those pretty and elaborate updo hairstyles on Pinterest call for backcombing and adding dry shampoo to help keep the hair from slipping out of the style or keep the bobby pins from falling out.  This would be very good for that.  In which case they should rename and sell this as a styling tool rather than a shampoo.  I will keep my can around specifically for that purpose.  As a dry shampoo it is utterly worthless.</li>
            <li> I tried this after using Batiste dry shampoo as an alternative. It&#x27;s awful. I have long, brown hair that I can not wash everyday or it gets dry/brittle so after seeing the commercials for this, I decided to give it a try. I was unpleasntly surprised to find out that this made my hair have MORE oil and left it feely greasy and disgusting. The smell is okay, but not anything of note. I used it about five times before the spray stopped working entirely, leaving me with a half-full can of disappointment. Having tried others, I can definitely say this is the WORST dry shampoo on the market, even though it runs about $4, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time or money. Go with Batiste, this is NO comparison.</li>
            <li> A good, cheap dry shampoo. Nothing is going to make your hair feel perfect. This one has a nice smell, the bottle lasts forever, and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> The product makes your hair worse. It feels gritty, and like your hair could stand up on it&#x27;s own. The white powder shows up no matter how much you use.... and I have strawberry blonde hair. The only thing I can do with my hair if I use this is slick it back into a ponytail. Your hair is basically immobile when you use this product. Do yourself a favor and spend $5 more to get a quality product that works.</li>
            <li> First off, this was the very first dry shampoo I ever bought. I bought it because I have fine hair and I read somewhere that if you spray dry shampoo on the roots it will help create volume, so I got it more for volume than to combat greasiness. With that said, it works great with creating the volume I crave in my fine and usually limp hair. I spray it on my roots a section at a time, let it sit for about and minute and then I brush through it. I have had no trouble with any white residue on my dark hair. If I spray a lot I have to brush my hair a little longer, but the white powder has always gone away. The cons of this product is that I don&#x27;t like the way it smells, I usually spritz my hair with some perfume to mask the smell. Also, when I use it my hair doesn&#x27;t feel very clean or silky, which I don&#x27;t really mind, it&#x27;s the lesser of two evils, I&#x27;d rather have the volume it creates. So for this price, I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that&#x27;s dyed dark red. By day 2, my bangs and my part start to look oily. I bought this and the refreshing mist to help my color last longer. The results have been inconsistent. Sometimes it does add body and dries up oil all day long, and other times it looks okay for a couple hours then becomes dirty and oily. I feel like I don&#x27;t know how to use it right, even though the instructions are pretty simple. I spray wherever it looks oily, then a very light layer all over, wait a couple minutes, and brush out. The powder brushes out well when I brush back across the hair instead of down. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with my hair turning white since the first time I used it. It just works sometimes and doesn&#x27;t work other times, and I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;m doing differently.</li>
            <li> I have friends who swear by dry-shampoo so that they don&#x27;t have to wash their hair daily, but I don&#x27;t think this product does the trick. It mitigates the greasiness for only a few hours, at best, and then it looks the same. Point being, if your hair is greasy, better to just wash it than to use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently growing my hair out and wanted something that would allow me to style my hair without washing and drying it everyday. This product is simply awful. First off, it discolors your hair. Once you spray it on, your hair turns grey. After you brush it through after one-two minutes of dry time, your ends will hold that grey color because your ends are more porous than your roots. Not only that, but the product adds weight to hair, causing your hair to fall flat.   Overall I hate this product. You know what they say, \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot; Don&#x27;t buy this product just because it&#x27;s cheap because in the end... your hair will look cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to add a cheap but good-quality dry shampoo into my regular routine but I was very disappointed. I followed the instructions on the can exactly, but I didn&#x27;t like how my hair looked. I have very dark brown hair and this white powder just added this dull gray cast to it, no matter how much time I spent rubbing it in and brushing it out. It didn&#x27;t seem to really absorb any oil and just sat on my hair and made it clumpy. I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, which to me, smelled like generic, unscented hairspray. Unfortunately, the smell seemed to linger as I could catch whiffs of it during the day. Although it&#x27;s an inexpensive dry shampoo, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is not only ineffective, but it makes my head itch like crazy! Not worth it, go for a higher quality product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I purchased this product. My friends had raved about using dry shampoo so I thought I was really going to like it. First off, I felt like no matter how much I shook the container or brushed I could not get the white powder out of my hair. It dried clumpy and made my hair feel worse than it was before I sprayed the product in it. It made my hair stringy and stick together. I have started using another dry shampoo and I love it, so I am not sure what is wrong with this product. Very disappointed because I have used other products by them and love it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even deserve one star.  I have tried about ten different ways to do this, and no matter what, my hair ends up looking  and  feeling  more oily than before.  It&#x27;s horrible, don&#x27;t waste your money.  There is a kind that comes in a white bottle, but I&#x27;m not sure of the brand.  It works 100 times better than this junk!</li>
            <li> the sprayer thing keeps on not working for this product. I have bought it 2 different places (Safeway and Target) and 4 times I have experienced that sprayer not working. I have literally had to thrown it away. Is this some kind of defect?&lt;br /&gt;The product itself works - it&#x27;s lovely. It makes my hair shiny and smooth too. Tresemme is cheaper but I have given up on their brand since this keeps happening to me.</li>
            <li> I went out and purchased two bottles of this, because the store was running a promotion. This is the worst dry shampoo ever. First off it leaves your hair feeling like you have tons of product in it. Also after using it for two days, my head is itching like crazy. Today was the day to finally wash my hair and after washing it twice, my head is still itching. I will not use this again, and I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Unlike other reviewers, the only good thing I can say about this product is the smell. My bottle had a nice fragrant smell. Never again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this will make my review any more believable over the others, but let me just say that I am a dry shampoo enthusiast. The fact that it is now made so easily, and cheaply, available is simply the best thing since &#x27;sliced bread&#x27;. With that being said, this product is unfortunately the worst of the worst. I have tried several brands in search of one that I can call &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; and this one is so bad at the &#x27;dry shampoo&#x27; concept that I can&#x27;t be bothered to finish the can off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application of the dry shampoo is difficult in that the contents inside the can don&#x27;t seem to want to spray together (the powder and the hairspray). I have given this can a good shake for a solid 15 seconds and still get mostly hairspray that just coats my hair in this strange residue. It&#x27;s not powdery by any means, but instead almost waxy. Sometimes I will get a burst of the powder, indicated by the sudden coat of whiteness in a single spot on my head. There&#x27;s just no chance at an even coverage with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the dry shampoo is decent, nothing to rave or rant about. It honestly smells like a normal hairspray. I have found that the scent of this one lingers longer than others, so if smell bothers you, that&#x27;s another con to add to the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I can&#x27;t give this product away. I know a few other women who are fanatics about dry shampoo as well. They absolutely despise this one and tell me they are not interested in it. I&#x27;ll probably stash it away in the back of the bathroom cabinet for emergency purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just save yourself the trouble and buy another brand. I recommend Dove&#x27;s version of dry shampoo over all the other department store ones I have tried. It often can be found in all the same stores and actually runs $1-3 less than this one.</li>
            <li> I laughed so hard when I sprayed it on. It&#x27;s comparable to using a white spray-on temporary hairdye, except with added dandruff!! I sprayed more on, almost choked, and went to go scare my brothers. I would not recommend anyone seriously using this product. Just awful.</li>
            <li> DIdnt work. I am blond with wavy/fine hair and my hair looks greasy after 1 day. I tried this one cause the Dove one was out and everyone said this was second best. Phfft. this one sucks and does NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo made my hair wet first, and then so greasy I had to put it in a pony tail and put some body powder on top to take away the greasy shine. And I had to brush out the white flakes first that looked like dandruff. Luckily, the body powder saved the situation. Bad product.</li>
            <li> i do not like this.  for all that ill wash my hair. leaves residue and makes your hair feel weird</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m not the exact target audience for dry shampoo. My hair is thick, curly, dark brown, but I do get greasy at the scalp. Those who aren&#x27;t having luck or say it leaves their hair white are using waaaay too much. I pick up sections and give a quick half-second spray, and that is all you need. The purpose is not to clean your hair, but to refresh, and that small amount hides the grease and leaves my hair touchable.</li>
            <li> This product leaves weight in my hair, and does not really freshen it up much.  It smells good, but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> It clogs after one use. Even if you try to clean it, it no longer works again. It also doesn&#x27;t work at all to begin with.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when this product came out because my hair gets oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day, but it gets dry and damaged if I do.  For the longest time I would use baby powder to soak up any oiliness in between washes, but I got sick up smelling like a freshly-changed baby and Fresh Start sounded like a godsend.  The first time I used it, I did a light mist over my roots, waited, then brushed it out.  My hair was no different.  So I started spraying my roots until they turned white.  Not only did I have to do it in another room while holding my breath then run somewhere else so I could actually breathe, I had a hard time brushing out the white color.  Once I had all the white brushed out, my hair didn&#x27;t look oily, but it sure felt GROSS.  I think I&#x27;ll just stick with an unscented baby powder from now on.</li>
            <li> If I could give this no stars I would.  I love the smell and really wanted this to work, but it made my hair worse after using it.  I have fairly oily hair and wanted to be able to skip a day of shampooing, but using this makes my hair a strange combination of both dry/brittle and very, very oily at the same time.  I used is 4 or 5 times and finally threw it away.</li>
            <li> It seems like this product was created on a whim, as it&#x27;s not even coming close to what it sais it does. It leaves your hair with a powder residue and even after I brushed it out, it was still visible...making my hair ashy. Also, the spray stopped working after 3 uses! Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I have long straight hair and a product to freshen up between shampoos sounds good. Not this though. Frankly, it reminds me of one of those spray products sold at Halloween to color hair. Instant gray hair! It brushes out fairly easily, but didn&#x27;t seem to make my hair cleaner.  The smell is dreadful- all I picked up was chemical cloud. Perhaps a bit of gas propellant? Whatever you do don&#x27;t smoke or go near a candle!  Alberto-Culver, please take this one off the market!</li>
            <li> I just bought a can of this from Target.  I thought it worked great!  However, I cannot get the can to spray again.  I took the nozzle off and ran it under hot water.  I shook the can vigorously (as stated in the instructions), and still nothing.  It worked really well, but if you can only get one good spray out of the can before it stops working, you&#x27;re better off just shampooing your hair.  I&#x27;ve heard good things about some other brands of dry shampoo, so maybe I&#x27;ll give those a try, unless Tresemme can start getting the cans to work for more than one spray.  I bought this one because it was the best price I could find, but I guess it&#x27;s not really worth the $5 for just one use.</li>
            <li> Recently my hair has become rather oily for some reason.  I used to be able to wash my hair every other day and it would be fine.  Now the day after I wash my hair, it looks oily and greasy at the roots.  I saw a commercial for this product and so the next time I was at the store I bought it.  The first time I used it, it did not brush out of my hair and left a grey dust.  Not only did it leave this dust, but my hair only looked *slightly* less oily.  (It definitely did not look less oily enough to skip a day of washing.)  I ended up washing my hair to get the dusty residue out.  I thought that perhaps I just used too much, so I considerably scaled back the amount the next time I used it (just once over with the spray for about half a second.)  I still had the grey dust problem.  Not only was the dust in my hair, but in my brush and it wouldn&#x27;t come out.  So now I have to wash my hair and my brush and throw away this useless product.  I went to Sally Beauty Supply to see what they suggested, and I bought Beyond The Zone Rock On Dry Shampoo.  It was on sale so it was only about $2 more than this.  I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but the girl there said that that is the product that they all use and love it.  She had dark brown hair like me, so hopefully I can trust her suggestion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing this product for three main reasons:    1) THIS DOESN\\&quot;T WORK--I&#x27;m not saying the actual spray doesn&#x27;t work I dont know if it does or not because the can and the nozzle are defective and it doesn&#x27;t even spray I have a FULL bottle of this stuff and nothing comes out!    2)I tried to return this to my local drugstore, they told me it was a manufactures problem and they couldn&#x27;t do anything about it. I was frustrated but in a ditch effort I decided to try to email tressemme to get a refund or maybe even a replacement can mailed to me by the company. I went to their website and told them my problem and five days have gone by since then and I haven&#x27;t heard a word from them not even a \\&quot;sorry our product didn&#x27;t work\\&quot;    3)When I went back to their website I looked up this product and there is a place where you can read reviews by other consumers and about 75% of the people who have left a review have had the same issue I had with the product where the nozzle gets jammed or something is defective. And each review that was given has a comment left by it from a representative of the company thats says \\&quot;Oh if you remove the top and soak it in water it MIGHT help\\&quot; thats SOOOO annoying I mean if so many people are having a problem with your product wouldn&#x27;t that be an incentive to Change the canister???    SO please I&#x27;m warning you now if your thinking about purchasing this DON&#x27;T!!!! It does not work and it will be waste of money...</li>
            <li> OKAY... they say this stuff gives you a fresh start but all it gives you is gross and greesy hair... im warning you, DONT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I hate it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• The scent was terrible so I had to spray my head with body spray since I was in a pinch&lt;br /&gt;• It didn&#x27;t make my hair look cleaner/drier like other dry shampoos - I felt weighed down and my hair was limp and seemed oiler (very backwards)&lt;br /&gt;• I manage to work with it after using A LOT of product and brushing my hair for a LONG time to get all the white out. Otherwise it looked like I had a major dandruff and/or stuck my head in a bag of flour.&lt;br /&gt;• My hairbrush was covered in the white residue so that had to get cleaned - and nobody likes cleaning hairbrushes because they are a pain in the butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for the best dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> has to be applied from a distance and must be massaged into hair or will leave a white resedue</li>
            <li> Might be the worst product! Makes the hair very hard and stiff and hair looks worse than before putting product in! Hard to brush out also. Stay far away!</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars, I would.  Absolutely no redeeming qualities to it whatsoever and a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had a severe allergic reaction to this product. Anyone else have a reaction? Also the product was disappointing. I would not have used it a 2nd time, even without the ER visit.</li>
            <li> Does what it purports to do. Gets me out of an oily state, and adds a bit of \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;. Smells very strong, so beware- breath holding and fan use ensues after use (did I just type that?). Please note: this stuff has to be constantly shaken between quick sprays, so if you are lazy, do not buy. The \\&quot;clay veil\\&quot; is easily removed with hairbrushing. Has not ruined my hair or hairbrush as of yet. Extremely combustible. Needed, but not totally embraced.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product because of the commercials and thinking I need it. I followed the instructions and applied it on my head my hair turned white...i looked like i have aged 40 yrs. To me, that feels like, how many products am I putting in my hair just because the power of advertisement? So I will not buy this product again. When I combed out the product it looked like residue from when you apply baby powder..I looked at the ingredients and it has the or if not similar stuff as baby powder! So if u want to get rid of that natural oil..pat some baby powder on the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dry shampoos that are a bit more expensive and decided to try this because its always on TV and not as expensive. Worst mistake ever! It made my hair oily, turned it white, and it gets on everything and makes it white as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusting. I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews but I had to do one for this because I hated it that much.  It doesn&#x27;t clean your hair AT ALL. In fact, it made my hair look even WORSE by making it smellier and dirtier than before, and it even seemed to make my hair stiff and clump together as if I had just used hairspray instead of dry shampoo. In addition, it left a gross, gray dust in my hair that absolutely would not brush or blow out. I had to wash and rinse my hair twice to get the stink and gunkiness out. I would imagine that if you had coarser hair this stuff probably wouldn&#x27;t come out.   What I hate the most about this product though is how much it REEKS. Like, it burns your nostrils to spray even a little bit of it in your hair, and unfortunately, your hair will continue to smell for the rest of the day. The smell resembled something like ammonia, hairspray, and rubbing alcohol. It&#x27;s potent too. My boyfriend walked past the bathroom after I sprayed this in my hair and exclaimed at how disgusting the smell was. It didn&#x27;t help that we had somewhere to go and he had to breathe out of his mouth in the car...WHILE THE WINDOWS WERE DOWN.  The makers of this product should be ashamed of themselves. If anyone leaves a review that is more than 2 stars for this POS product, I would have STRONG reasons to suspect that they&#x27;re paid by the company to do so.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few weeks now and I really like it. I have blond hair but I color it black and I try to do/use anything I can to keep the color looking decent.  My hair is also more on the dry side than oily and washing it alot can be pretty brutal. This dry shampoo works great getting me through washes. I use it just as it tells you to on the can and I haven&#x27;t had a problem. I can see where your hair could get oiler if you use to much. I give it 4 stars because I think it could smell a little better.</li>
            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I have ever used.  It only received one star from me because zero stars was not an option.  I have an extremely oily scalp and use dry shampoos to freshen up my bangs and roots.  I normally would use a different brand, but my store was out so I decided to try this one.  I used it one morning before leaving for work; this product left my hair feel extremely gummy and oily.  It was so bad that I had to pull my hair up in a bun to try to conceal the mess this created.  I will never use this product again and will be sure I always have another can of my usual product on hand.</li>
            <li> I found some good and bad reviews before I bought it, but gave it a chance anyways. I am a college student and I go to the gym for an intensive workout most days of the week. So I obviously sweat a lot and have to go to classes afterwards and must put off showering until the end of the day. Until then I thought it would be nice to use this in the locker room after my workout to make my hair look a little nicer for the rest of the day until I shower. It doesn&#x27;t smell good and it gave my hair a disgusting feel. Overall terrible purchase. I tried it again for a second time and put less on my hair after watching some tips from YouTube. Still got terrible results and threw it out.</li>
            <li> This is the worst hair product I think I have ever tried!  I strayed from my favorite dry shampoo \\&quot;Pssst\\&quot; because Tresemme is now sold in place of it in Walgreens stores near me, and WOW.  I&#x27;d rather just not wash my hair, PERIOD.  I literally have no idea how this product went through testing in such a huge company and someone thought it was a good idea to sell.  It actually thickens my hair (in a gross way) and makes it smell like a disgusting maple syrup or something.  I have tried waiting a full two minutes and then tossling around hair with a towel, brushing out, using my fingers -- NOTHING makes this product do anything but disgustisize (it&#x27;s a word... okay, not really) your hair.  Steer clear!</li>
            <li> I love the Tresemme heat protectant, so I bought this thinking it would be good too. I stretch my washes to about twice a week as I&#x27;m letting my hair grow, so sometimes I need a dry shampoo to help. This stuff smells terrible and often makes my hair look even more greasy. It also leaves white residue which is annoying because I have dark hair. I really don&#x27;t think it does anything it&#x27;s supposed to. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> When I received it there was a hole in the can which made it impossible to get out and useless.</li>
            <li> just to echo the other reviews: this left my hair greasier than before, plus my head feeling like I dipped it in toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Suave dry shampoo and saw Tresemme in a store (where I couldn&#x27;t check Amazon reviews, alas!).  I like Tresemme products a lot but this was a disappointment.  Using the same quantity of Tresemme as I did with Suave I saw no results.  I had to use a lot more product which then made my head feel very heavy and the result was not even looking good.</li>
            <li> I decided to cheap out and not buy my favorite Alterna Dry Shampoo since I just moved and was tight on money. Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves a white residue on my hair due to the fact it does contain talc. If you are not meticulous rubbing this in VERY thoroughly, you will have white tints and streaks in your hair. I used this before brunch with some friends and someone mentioned my forehead looked pale. I go to the rest room and sure enough, the light misting I did before leaving the house left a residue on my skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for two stars vs. just one is because the product actually smells okay. Not great but just all right. It somewhat has a clean smelling aroma but you can smell a little bit of baby powder/talc too. This wasn&#x27;t enough to keep me from throwing this in the trash and running out to buy more of my Alterna, which I should have bought in the first place.</li>
            <li> This product DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, I was very excited not to worry about washing my hair on a daily basis, I thought this product would work, but I guess you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Please note when you first spray this on  (36\\&quot;away) you will notice this white residue, if you than comb your hair it gets into your brush, the smell is awful, the hair feels greasy, stiff, dry UNMANAGEABLE :(.....</li>
            <li> My hair looks dirty and greasier AFTER I spray this than before I used it! I have very fine, thin blonde/dirty blonde hair (and not a lot of it either), and when my hair is greasy or wet, it turns dark brown. So this stuff seems to coat my hair in grease, make it stringy and wet looking. It is disgusting. My third day hair ends up looking like I haven&#x27;t washed it in WEEKS. Absolutely not using this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have hair like mine then maybe give the L&#x27;Oreal Ever Style Texture Series Energizing Dry Shampoo. I used that and LOVED It, but I ran out of that and thought I might as well try a new one. BAD IDEA! Now today i&#x27;m sitting at working looking so gross because of this tresemme trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, this is after the product has been used as directed.)</li>
            <li> I got this on a whim at my local grocery store, before looking at the reviews on Amazon.  I tried it out, and it worked really well for me, so I came to Amazon expecting to find good reviews and found a slew of negative ones instead.  I&#x27;m surprised!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the other people who like it though, I have very thin hair that gets oily after a day.  I also use no product in my hair whatsoever, except for shampoo and occasionally conditioner.  I also spray a quick few blasts near the roots, wait a few minutes for it to dry, then flip my head upside-down and brush it out.  I won&#x27;t say it looks freshly-washed, but it does look passable enough that I wouldn&#x27;t be mortified if I ran into a cute ex-boyfriend at the grocery store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear hats outside when it&#x27;s cold, and my hair gets flat and full of flyaways, while still looking flat and icky.  This gives me a little body back, and it gets rid of greasy looks.  It does, however, make hair look less shiny, as it is a powdery substance meant to absorb shiny stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problems with this and I hope it works for someone else.  Don&#x27;t use a lot, and brush it out.  Only use it on the roots. :)</li>
            <li> I have only used 2 other Dry Shampoo&#x27;s in my lifetime - both of them no-name-brands.  I have normal hair, i dont use products except shampoo and conditioner and yet, my hair still gets oily the morning after i wash it.  I remember using Tresemme alot a few years ago (the real shampoo/condtioner) so i thought i couldnt go wrong with this product!&lt;br /&gt;Wrong&lt;br /&gt;Very Wrong&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 tries at different times over the last couple of months.  I might as well have just put Aquanet in my hair.  This stuff is horrible - it does nothing buy weigh my hair down, make it more oily, and hhheeeaavvvvvyyyyy  oh my gosh heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Never again.&lt;br /&gt;Back to the no-name brands!</li>
            <li> This is by far not the best dry shampoo, but it does have some pros: it&#x27;s cheap, lasts longer than most other dry shampoos, and doesn&#x27;t have an obvious or offending scent. That said, it has taken me several uses to get the right amount of product in my hair without making it sticky and dirty feeling. I don&#x27;t trust spraying this stuff directly into my hair but it works well if I spray it into my round brush and then brush it into my scalp. I do this after exercising when my hair is a little sweaty or right before I go to bed knowing I will not wash my hair the next morning. I also agree with another reviewer whp mentioned it can work for styles that you don&#x27;t plan on touching throughout the day. It&#x27;s not a perfect product and it is very easy to use too much of it, but if you want to salvage the bottle I recommend this method.</li>
            <li> I like using a dry shampoo both th extend life of a style and add volume at the roots on my long hair.  I usually grab the batiste from Sallys but got this instead.  Not a very good move.  It does extend the life of the style but it is heavy and rough in the hair.  The smell is a bit chemical, a bit citrus and it does not brush out easily, instead it brushes down the hair shaft and clings so my hair is left heavy and dull looking.  I  am able to use it semi effectively if I spritz at night and do not try to brush it out until morning.</li>
            <li> I picked up a small (2 oz) can of this at a drug store, thinking it would be a great thing to have on hand in an emergency.  My experience using it was a disaster.  I read and followed the instructions on the can, using very short sprays in just a few key places at the roots, waiting a minute, then working it through my hair with my fingers. As many others here have said, it made my hair greasier than it started out, and it smelled and felt like I had just used a bunch of heavy-chemical hairspray.  I spent a significant amount of time trying to brush it out with no success, and eventually just started dousing my hair with water.  Perhaps even worse than all that, though, was that it made my medium-blonde hair look gray.  And not just a little bit -- everywhere I had used it turned the color of clay, which is probably exactly what it was.  I can only imagine what it would do to someone with darker hair than mine.  In the end, I spent so much time trying to rid myself of the gray-greasy-weighed down-stiff hair-look that it would have been faster to wash and blow dry my hair, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been very happy with other Tresemme products, but they should pull this one from the market.  The can I bought is going straight into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have extremely oily hair, even after a wash.&lt;br /&gt;The product removed some of the oil, but turned my dark brown hair gray and it looked as if I had dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;It also completely covered my brush with nasty white layers of extra that was brushed out. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I ran out of Psst and decided to give this a shot - threw it out in less than two weeks. It made my hair so greasy and messy when I used even a little that I couldn&#x27;t even just throw it in a ponytail and wash it later. It looked like I&#x27;d just finished a marathon or something. Not pretty :(</li>
            <li> This stuff is NASTY. Leaves a film on your hair that leaves it feeling even dirtier than you started. Gross gross gross. I thought that&#x27;s how all dry shampoo was until I tried [[ASIN:B001JTICF6 KMS California Hair Play - Makeover Spray]], and then I realized that nope it&#x27;s just the Tresemme version that&#x27;s gross. Don&#x27;t buy this. Go get the KMS one, stat.</li>
            <li> This made my hair even more dirty looking. I should have known because all tresemme products are horrible and cheap. You get what you paid for</li>
            <li> Wow. What can I say. I usually trust Tresemme products, but this has got to be the worst thing I have ever put on my head. After using per instructions, my hair felt heavy, sticky, greasy, goopy... disgusting. Ugh. Product went directly in the trash can after one use.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because it was in a discount outlet store. IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK! Not only did it not help the oiliness around my hairline, it actually made it oilier! Only Batiste brand works - don&#x27;t waste your money on anything else. I even tried the expensive Alterna brand, which was OK, but still no comparison.</li>
            <li> Wow, was I shocked to read such bad reviews of this product. I bought it because I have long, thick hair and it gets oily looking at the end of one day. I read about dry shampoos and thought I&#x27;d try one. I was shopping one day and this was the only brand the store carried, so I purchased it not expecting much. What I found was when I used this product my hair felt thicker and fuller than usual. It kept my hair looking &#x27;clean&#x27; and non greasy and if I had to, I could probably go another day with it in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently decided to try another brand because I figured if this cheap brand worked this well, then Nexxus surely would be a good 3 days if I ever needed that long to not wash my hair. Boy was I disappointed. It cost 5 times as much as the Tresemme and it doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it depends on hair type as to how well this product works, but I can&#x27;t find anything wrong with it. I plan on buying more. I wish Amazon sold it via their Prime membership because I&#x27;d be buying it from here all of the time.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  It leaves your hair feeling dirty, greasy, and stiff.  I would NOT recommend this to anyone.  In fact I have used it 3 times (to really give it the benefit of doubt...) and just threw it away.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Left my hair oilier than before. There are dry shampoos that work out there but this is not one of them!</li>
            <li> I have tried many dry shampoos and this one works the best.  I was surprised to see so many bad reviews of this product, but most of them said they had oily hair.  I have normal hair and use it when my hair is starting to look dirty and I don&#x27;t have time to wash it.  Usually my hair still looks clean the next day.  This product also gives my hair more body and lift which I consider a bonus benefit.  I have dark brown hair and this dry shampoo does not leave my hair with a powdered look like most dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the bad reviews on here, I love this product. It makes my hair feel clean, fresh and it smells amazingggg. I&#x27;ve tried the Not your Mother&#x27;s dry shampoo and its awful, but that has high reviews on here! To anyone who is hesitant to try this u def should, its amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I couponed and got this stuff for 50 cents because in my opinion, that is all it&#x27;s worth. I usually just buy the Pssst brand of dry shampoo which I love, but I decided that since this would cost me next to nothing I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, yea I probably used too much. It felt like caked on hairspray that just accentuated the oiliness of my hair. So the next few times I&#x27;ve been a lot more cautious about how much I spray in my hair. Still, my hair is just as oily and it feels stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having used a dry shampoo that has worked wonderfully, I know that this is not how dry shampoo should be. I would highly recommend trying Pssst instead for a good low-cost dry shampoo. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every penny.[[ASIN:B003NW8M1Q Pssssst! Dry Shampoo, Instant, 5.3 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I cannot believe this is allowed to be sold to the public.  This smells sooooooo strong like alcohol that you would have to literally go outside if you have any interest in breathing...  It totally weighs your hair down and only makes your hair situation worse.  I don&#x27;t leave reviews very much but I needed to warn the world...DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this because after one day of not washing my hair it gets greasy. But this just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times, spraying more, rubbing into my scalp more, brushing my hair more. Nothing works. It just makes things worse - my hair still looks greasy but now there&#x27;s a strange gray tint to it and the texture of my hair becomes stiff and difficult to manage. You&#x27;re better off using corn starch.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible dry shampoo.  I have used other brands before and have been very happy, but I use this stuff (as directed) and my hair is stiff and looks greasier than before I used the shampoo.  Also leaves a white coating on my hair that looks like dandruff and coats my hair brush.  Yuck.  At least it was cheap.  I plan on trying Suave dry shampoo next.  The reviews are much better.</li>
            <li> Smells good but is very heavy on your hair. Use in a pinch but not if I a have time to rewash</li>
            <li> This worked great for my hair, I used it a day after I showered and it made my hair look just like when I dry it after my shower. No residue that others mentioned or dandruff like flakes, just clean lookiing hair. I usually run a bit oily on my second day and this takes care of that. Spray in and brush, can&#x27;t get any easier than that. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used several dry shampoos, and this was such a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It made my hair feel worse, oilier. When I went to rub it in, as per the instructions, my hair actually felt wet.&lt;br /&gt;2. The powder residue was ridiculously bad. I have very light blonde hair and the powder was obvious. I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with even dark blonde hair (let alone brown or black) could use this.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a definite chemical smell. And it lingers all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this. HUGE WASTE.</li>
            <li> Its really a shame that no mainstream company has made a good dry shampoo. I bought this because it was the only dry shampoo in my common drugstore/super market. HORRIBLE. It left a residue in my hair and left my hair even more dirty. Gross.</li>
            <li> I use this product when my hair is starting to get that oily/greasy look; not when I definitely need to wash my hair. This wasn&#x27;t meant to replace washing your hair. I&#x27;ve followed the directions exactly and my hair looks like it does after it dries from being washed. I don&#x27;t overuse the product, I just use little spurts at the roots and massage the roots after a couple of minutes. Then I style my hair (which consists of just brushing it). Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;My hair starts getting oily by the second day and has the grunge look by the third. I&#x27;ve used this product on the third day of not washing if I&#x27;m in a time crunch and it helps tame my hair enough so it at least looks good in a pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I have fine brown hair that&#x27;s very thick, and it usually gets oily near the roots the day after I shampoo. I have tried a number of dry shampoos, including more expensive varieties from salons and department stores. This product works really well for me, with a few caveats:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If I don&#x27;t let the spray dry along my part (takes 3-5 minutes), I get a similar result as many of the dissatisfied reviewers: stiff, dirtier-looking hair. However, if I let it dry then blend the powdery residue into my scalp with my fingers, it really does take away the oily root look. I usually don&#x27;t brush it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The product doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel cleaner, it just looks like it is. I prefer to wear my hair up or out of my face on days I use it in lieu of shampooing. The spray also gives a very (very) low level of hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like the product a lot. It goes a long way in curing the bed-head when pieces of hair stand up at strange angles in the morning. I find the smell to be very similar to other Tresemme styling products and the price can&#x27;t be beat. The product is not a miracle worker, but I do think it does the job better than other dry shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> I am mulatto and have a mixed hair type that is both very thick and very curly. As such, I find it extremely difficult to find hair products for myself and have gone through a number of shampoos that leave my hair dry, greasy, gummy, and about pretty much every other adjective out there. To be honest, I had purchased this for my sister since she had been using my shampoo and only tried it out of curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s okay. I spent about two bucks getting it off the clearance rack so I can&#x27;t complain about it being overpriced. My hair does have a thin layer of somewhat unpleasant residue on it, but I don&#x27;t touch my hair very much out of the shower so I can deal with it for a day--it is definitely getting washed out either this evening or tomorrow morning. I have yet to develop (I put it on about twenty minutes ago) the white powdery residue several other commenters have reported, though I have dark brown hair. I also did not develop the greasy look that seems common. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but it&#x27;s not obnoxiously bad and there&#x27;s things I can put over it to cover it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, in the twenty minutes since I put this on, I was also able to flat iron and style my hair. Twenty minutes with normal shampoo would have me just out of the shower, so I think I&#x27;ll use it sparingly &#x27;til it&#x27;s gone and then never purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Quick if you&#x27;re in a hurry in the mornings, cheap&lt;br /&gt;Cons: unpleasant waxy residue, results not guaranteed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a replacement for regular shampoo or better quality dry shampoos, but if you happen to wake up late and you&#x27;re in a rush, it&#x27;ll do. (Provided, of course, you fit the strange hair type that apparently manages it best.)</li>
            <li> This is probably the worst dry shampoo I have ever tried... I leaves my hair sticky and heavy. No matter how much I brush/rub my fingers through my hair the product doesn&#x27;t go away. I have dark brown hair and whenever I use this product my sister asks me why my hair is white. Once I used a towel to rub it out (about 15-20 minutes) and I looked like I had really bad dandruff ):&lt;br /&gt;Not good for dark hair!! Possibly not for any hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drugstore, and it doesn&#x27;t help at all! My hair feels just as oily. To top it off, the spray part broke and wouldn&#x27;t work after the first time I used it. I DID shake it vigorously like the bottle suggested. Nothing happened. Such a waste.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why so many people dislike this product because I love it! I have tried Suave and store-bought brand, and this dry shampoo definitely knocks the other two out of the ballpark. You have to shake it pretty well before use, but besides that, it covers up all the grease and makes your hair look like it is freshly washed. The only complaint I have is that it is pretty easy to burn through the whole bottle quickly, and if done incorrectly, your hair will look white/gray, but that is really the personal user&#x27;s issue. I recommend this product to everyone. Also, I have thin, wavy, oily hair and I wash my hair every other day with this product.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! That spray just doesn&#x27;t work at all! It made my hair more greasy and it smells very cheaply. I hope that spray will at least work on clean hair as a volumizer.</li>
            <li> Initial Impression (2 stars): This was my first try at a dry shampoo. I got the volumizing version of this and tried it on second day hair, which, for me, is fairly greasy and limp. I was hoping that this dry shampoo would make my hair feel clean... It did make my hair feel clean at first (and it gave me some volume too), but then it made my hair feel even greasier an hour later and my hair went limp. My roots looked more disgusting than they&#x27;ve ever looked! This dry shampoo has a great scent and it feels good on my scalp (no irritation), but it makes my hair feel absolutely disgusting just an hour later. No way am I going to reapply this product every hour! I&#x27;m not returning this product because I can use it when I put my hair up... It doesn&#x27;t make my hair look any better, but it&#x27;s okay for the weekends when I&#x27;m just heading out to the store or somewhere unimportant. I&#x27;ll be trying Batiste next. I&#x27;m very disappointed in this dry shampoo.  Final impression after emptying can (4 stars): I don&#x27;t know what happened, but the more I used this product, the more it worked, so by the end of the can, I had it down to a science and it made my third and fourth day hair look great. I like the smell, it feels good on my scalp (no itching or irritation), it sucks up oil and gives me volume. It doesn&#x27;t stay like that all day (boo), so I&#x27;ll have to reapply if I&#x27;m at work or something. Still, I liked it so much that I bought another can!</li>
            <li> yuck.  I have fine hair that gets oily pretty quickly (after a day or so) and this doesn&#x27;t really help much. it makes my hair heavier but doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb the oil very well.  Not Your Mother&#x27;s brand works better.</li>
