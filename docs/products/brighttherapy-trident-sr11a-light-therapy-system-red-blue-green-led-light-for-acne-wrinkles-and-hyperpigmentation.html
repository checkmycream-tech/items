            <li>It is somewhat time consuming and the treatment is best done while you are watcing t.v., reading, etc.  </li>

            <li>I love this device!</li>
            <li>I definitely love this therapy!</li>
            <li>, I changed my mind, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li>more mom hands!</li>
            <li>Great product easy to use</li>
            <li>I have to say I love my Bright Therapy Trident.</li>
            <li>amazing product.</li>
            <li>Well...it worked and was amazing</li>
            <li>I bought this system and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has a nice handle that I can hold or I can prop on my shoulder/chest if I need to use my hand for a minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s handy to have  when things come up.</li>
            <li>After a good 2 or 3 weeks the redness and scarring on my cheeks lightened and well, my skin tone is just brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li>All three of the heads heat up nicely</li>
            <li>I also noticed my face is showing a nice glow and</li>
            <li>(I just gave my Mom her own for Christmas this year.)</li>
            <li>It does get rather warm too as its working.</li>
            <li>Very nice system for light therapy.  </li>
            <li>First of all this light therapy product is very very bright and works great on my shoulder.  </li>
            <li>I was so tickled to receive this awesome device &amp; 2 days early!</li>
            <li>I love this product and am so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li>Furthermore, Bright Therapy makes both a corded version and a cordless version of the Trident Light Therapy System.</li>
            <li>This does come with a eye mask cover just in case the light is to bright for you.</li>
            <li>I like to buy beauty gadgets, and after great success with the Silk&#x27;n Hair remover, and the Zeno acne machine</li>
            <li>This is the first time I ever used light therapy on my skin, and I&#x27;m so impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>Everything about this is so easy!  </li>
            <li>This is great for acne, wrinkles, fine lines, or just need some therapy light for your body.</li>
            <li>two weeks later, I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never been so impressed.  </li>
            <li>This device feels very light and flimsy.</li>
            <li>its seem OK..</li>
            <li>You are better off buying Olay products.</li>
            <li>but I need more time to use and see is</li>
            <li>and thats more than others that cost more.</li>
            <li>This makes it work even better.</li>
            <li>I love that I get 3 treatment disks in one unit</li>
            <li>The video is on my blog -Lori&#x27;s blog reviews and more.  .</li>
            <li>gifted to my daughter per her request</li>
            <li>Started to feel desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began using this light therapy three weeks ago with amazing results.</li>
            <li>It works well for tightening the skin and gives your skin a  healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>So I went away from it for it for a good week to let things calm</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin for more than 20 years</li>
            <li>On the nights I use this, the next day, my skin is just awesome, as opposed to when I use the Blue/Green attachments.</li>
            <li>Finally found the best treatment for hormonal acne &amp; hyperpigmentation!!!!</li>
            <li>This light is made well and it seems to be helping my daughters acne!</li>
            <li>She says thecwarmth of the light relaxes her!</li>
            <li>The section treated looked SO MUCH Better than the untreated area.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have to wear a bang now to cover up my forehead! :-)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep using it more on those areas and try my neck and around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li>I noticed a glow and more</li>
            <li>I have been using the lights for more than two months .&lt;br</li>
            <li>continue with the treatment because the directions say that 3 months of&lt;br /&gt;Continues use or 7 times a week, as they begin to see the results of these two latest lights  </li>
            <li>Together my acne has cleared up and become much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Maybe it needs more time.</li>
            <li>I did not notice the wrinkles getting any better after a couple of sessions, but, what I did notice was the raised wart like bump on my side of nose was shrinking.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I used it as directed and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li>worked in the sun for many years.  </li>
            <li>It was more noticeable than ever.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks more radiant and youthful, so</li>
            <li>I am using it with a cream that has vitamin C in it as suggested by someone, they said it would help to accelerate the cream to work better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This bright therapy system that cost a good chunk out your wallet, although it is on sell right now for $120 bucks originally $230 bucks on amazon and if you have prime you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>First it works perfectly, the bulbs are bright and its built to last!  </li>
            <li>most people.&lt;br /&gt;The discs and handle felt very cheap and light</li>
            <li>but people do compliment me more after I started using and it does help with some fine lines I have.</li>
            <li>so I bought it at the Bright Therapy website straight and thought I would write the review here as this is where I found the product and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>this makes it a huge value for me as I do want to treat more than one problem .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I really do love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for light therapy for home use .</li>
            <li>This was the best money spent for the variety of skin issues that are on my face and body.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for the infrared light and should be more patient</li>
            <li>Works better than any antibiotics or topical products I have tried and great value.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has three lenses that are easy to change.</li>
            <li>And an hour doing all three is easy.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I can say it is easy to use and not at all</li>
            <li>Strong do not recommend anyone to purchase this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in the market for some nice LED therapy light this is right up your alley.</li>
            <li>THIS was True Pleasure to review its a fantastic product !</li>
            <li>This product is light weight, easy to operate, and delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Did not notice any difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I really think it&#x27;s clearing and skin looks better!</li>
            <li>When I use the blue light for the required 20 minutes per area, my break outs are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of any thing I don&#x27;t like about this light.</li>
            <li>Being light makes it easier to use since you have to hold it for a period of time.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>you get 3 light disks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for light therapy</li>
            <li>After three to four treatments with the red/infrared light, I saw results.  </li>
            <li>I have used laser light therapy on my face and neck  for about a year .  </li>
            <li>light stopped working after five months</li>
            <li>I still tried it and confirmed to myself it does nothing.</li>
            <li>Now won&#x27;t charge, and won&#x27;t light up the heads at all.</li>
            <li>Not by a lot but with free shipping I saved probably 9 dollars.</li>
            <li>So no, using the light therapy alone may not do, if your acne is severe.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC, MY FACE AND NECK LOOK</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford lazer and heard about light therapy on tv.</li>
            <li>SR11A Light Therapy is programmable with a 10 minute timer and auto shutoff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So now, close to 3 times a week in the evening, I will do this light therapy with my under eye wrinkle reducing cream.</li>
            <li>but I suppose that would help because you have to put the lights on your face for about 20 minutes for each colored light.  </li>
            <li>This light system, however doesn&#x27;t mention any FDA clearing.  </li>
            <li>SR11A Light Therapy System</li>
            <li>Try to consider that our mothers didn&#x27;t have this option available to them.</li>
            <li>I received the Trident Light Therapy System to review free of charge.  </li>
            <li>, I thought that this Light System would work too.  </li>
            <li>Should buy directly from Bright Therapy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because there were many things I liked about the unit; it&#x27;s lightweight and therefore easy to use and move over the treatment area, the light heads interchanged easily and attached securely, the unit got warm but only pleasantly so, and the little beeping timer was convenient.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;would recommend highly!!!!</li>
            <li>At first I wasn’t too sure about this handheld device and did some research on light therapy.  </li>
            <li>is one awesome little tool!</li>
            <li>Seems to be making a mild difference on fine lines and wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li>The change was truly amazing, I was able to stop wearing makeup on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>Second I use this Bright Therapy system once a day and then apply Proactiv advanced blemish treatment.</li>
            <li>If that doesn&#x27;t really affect you, then I guess this light system would be okay.</li>
            <li>At first I figured there was no way it could actually be doing anything than just giving me a nice warm glow.  </li>
            <li>I received the product on time , excited I would be getting a good deal (as similar units sell for 2 -3x the cost).  </li>
            <li>(food alergies was the main culprit)  and this light has helped my skin look better than ever.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Hello Ladies,  I will be posting a better review for this product very soon.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this the full 8 weeks</li>
            <li>It did seem to decrease the oil production &amp; help large pimples disappear more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Using the nightly treatments of Bright Therapy Trident has really tightened my pores, reduced breakouts AND fixed the all over tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>great on bruises too), and the green light is for skin quality like softening or evening</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s also known that blue and red lights are great for the skin and sends signals to the brain helping with depression and anxiety!</li>
            <li>These little LED oval shaped lights are very bright and they only get a wee bit warm, and thats about it.</li>
            <li>but I like my high frequency machine better, and my micro needle.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with it, I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 weeks now and see a lot of results, almost no acne, only once in a while will get one pimple that will go away quicker and very improved skin complexion.</li>
            <li>The dark spots on my face have faded and my face looks heathier which makes me happy.</li>
            <li>This product is so easy to use , works very well and its chargeable</li>
            <li>(dry skin using each color a good 6 minutes)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very well made, and the heads can be switched easily.  </li>
            <li>but overall my skin looks and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>I like how easy this device can be used and how fast you&#x27;re done using it.</li>
            <li>I received it really quick and started using it right away, I&#x27;m always using skin care products that help me with my acne</li>
            <li>What I read said that the light has to be at a certain frequency in order to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to move it around as much or worry if the light is getting that zit that popped up.</li>
            <li>But next to taking lots of harmful antibiotics, this has been the most effective method to clear my face.</li>
            <li>Once I added this light therapy I got real results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful to not have to put fade cream on my sensitive skin and risk more breakouts, the green light does the job and I saw results within one week after daily use.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>useful.  </li>
            <li>well worth</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth it, it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has a nice big treatment area</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I do the treatments my own way instead of following directions....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Mostly I&#x27;ve used the red light.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I had relatively low hopes for this product, but I&#x27;m a skin care device junkie, and after hearing a lot about LED light therapy I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I use the blue light mostly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good things about the effectiveness of product but probably not smart to order from a Quantum.</li>
            <li>The competitive product didn&#x27;t have the right frequency, but the Trident does,</li>
            <li>highly recommend this light therapy wand.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how powerful the light can be for breakouts and blemishes, my skin is getting brighter and glowing.</li>
            <li>This wand really just gives more leverage to the rest of my regimen (natural cleansers, zinc supplements, immune boosters, glycolic peels, etc.)  </li>
            <li>I have always wanted a light therapy device but with the prices on most of those so high it was not possible for me .</li>
            <li>(I use the blue light every night and the red light most mornings.)  </li>
            <li>The Red &amp; Infrared SUPER BRIGHT LED treatment head (660nm Red &amp; 880nm Infrared)</li>
            <li>The Blue SUPER BRIGHT LED Treatment Head (415nm Blue)</li>
            <li>the information on them suggests they are useful for treating a large variety of conditions.  </li>
            <li>I’m just so excited about the new Cordless BrightThreapy Trident</li>
            <li>Its OK.. &#x60;m using it from time to time.. not regular..</li>
            <li>even more if my stress and anxiety levels are up, I use the red (on occasion).</li>
            <li>They give you a blindfold, but who wants spend their evenings blindfolded for 30 minutes?!</li>
            <li>Here we go: I&#x27;ve been using the light therapy for nearly three months.  </li>
            <li>I had been getting the professional red/blue light treatments for 250 dollars a session, and although I did see results, I could not afford to do one treatment every week.</li>
            <li>I should start doing it to myself to get first hand but haven&#x27;t had time</li>
            <li>At first I used it every day; now I&#x27;m using it every two or three days.</li>
            <li>even color by the first week.  </li>
            <li>The most surprising is how well the green light works at fading dark pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li>It cost too much not to be a reliable product!</li>
            <li>With 3 detachable LED Cluster heads.&lt;br /&gt;The RED &amp; INFRARED treatment head the BT-SR11A is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Some lighter spots disappeared completely and the darker spots are now light to medium.  </li>
            <li>I guess the biggest drawback of this device is the time commitment to using it, especially if you have more than one area to work on.</li>
            <li>I had a Tanda system before with the blue light only and used it until the light ran out and stopped working, it worked so great (in combination with other medications and treatments) that I had no acne at all</li>
            <li>I have also used the blue light for an infection on my dog and it seemed to resolve quickly  </li>
            <li>I have had many positive feed back on the way that it make the skin feel.</li>
            <li>first tried using the light with serums, but found it would hinder it gliding across my face, so I started using it on a clean dry face after my shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very light if you are worried about holding your arm up for long periods at a time for treatment.  </li>
            <li>Before I was just washing with clean and clear and using the proactive blemish treatment alone and it did NOTHING for my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Need to use it more consistently to really tell anything..Will send a later review..</li>
            <li>Not so sure about the green light because I don&#x27;t use that often.</li>
            <li>the reviews seemed so positive</li>
            <li>The only thing I have noticed is that the RED LED is definitely the most effective for me.</li>
            <li>So far it has helped me tremendously to reduce my acne level.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s silent, easy to charge, I don&#x27;t use the eye mask</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks straight now, pretty much every morning.  </li>
            <li>have been using this BrightTheraphy on my whole face and guess what the embarrassing spot is nearly gone and the rest of my face is not bleached out and there was no bad reaction at all.  </li>
            <li>Your pretty much  getting four different light therapies in one.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to use, the  positive effects are noticeable within a few weeks!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need the red light</li>
            <li>I use the blue light if I feel I am getting ready to break out or feel a blemish coming</li>
            <li>Having only used this product for about three weeks, it is too soon to give it an accurate review.  </li>
            <li>I have two weeks using this device and it really works.</li>
            <li>Blue light</li>
            <li>I really have nothing else to say.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>All the reviews here were very helpful to me on deciding which to buy.</li>
            <li>They really need to work on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Now since I&#x27;ve been using the BrighTherapy trident my oily skin has cleared along with the pimples I  use the blue light for that.</li>
            <li>I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use the blue light for acne or &amp;#34;sterilizing&amp;#34;, I use the red light for wrinkles or healing(works</li>
            <li>this really make a difference in my face ,come on time</li>
            <li>i use the red light (which is infrared) for arthritis pain in my fingers</li>
            <li>and it really helps.</li>
            <li>In sum, I would not recommend the red light part of the device and cannot say about the others.</li>
            <li>The red light helps to rebuild</li>
            <li>I tried the red light for wrinkles and it likewise did not affect my skin at all.</li>
            <li>&gt;  Red light has firmed up &amp; healed my skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This product has infared as well as red light</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend this light enough!</li>
            <li>I do not want to jinx the effects of this product by saying this, but in the month that I have been using this product, it has absolutely transformed my skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really helps.  </li>
            <li>The product is also very well made.</li>
            <li>which I like, I find the heat to be very soothing and it makes me sleepy before bedtime.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really follow the directions.  </li>
            <li>I like the way it feels--the gentle warmth is relaxing.</li>
            <li>My skin really does well with this</li>
            <li>My daughter has used the blue light for some acne</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s been developing as she heads into puberty, and it&#x27;s really helped that too.  </li>
            <li>What really amazes me moreis</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it to my daughter for the blue light use, to see if it helps with her acne problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Red Light Treatments in my area that cost me $99 a month.  </li>
            <li>Instructions for use very unclear.</li>
            <li>and it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Well Obagi bleached out my whole face except the embarrassing spot on my nose.  </li>
            <li>This box arrived pretty fast and was already charged a bit, and when I turned it on, it nearly blinded me, I am used to these sorts of things needing to be charged first.</li>
            <li>This device charges in about a couple of hours fully and can run for days depending how much you use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and eventually use the red light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the red light on my foot that has plantar fasciitis and my doctor said it might help increase blood flow to the area.</li>
            <li>but honestly I think it&#x27;s a waste of $98.</li>
            <li>collagen &amp; you can&#x27;t go wrong with that!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bright Skin!</li>
            <li>Because my results are so good i am not starting in with the green light and red light for my deep frown lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne pretty much my adult life, very oily and that would cause the acne</li>
            <li>This particular machine works well and seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>Even if I have a few breakouts, the light clears it up fast and fades the scars quickly, which is unheard of for me.  </li>
            <li>Let me first say that I wash my face once in the morning and again at night with Clean and Clear continuous control, with a facial scrubbing sponge.</li>
            <li>Zap any new spots w/ blue light</li>
            <li>I bought this product after having expensive red light therapy (without infrared) on my face and saw great results.  </li>
            <li>Have had great success with a larger infrared LED light unit for the past few weeks, and wanted a more portable version with blue light - the green being a bonus.  </li>
            <li>The green light is what I&#x27;m mostly counting on as I have hyper pigmentation left from the acne scars</li>
            <li>use this pretty frequently, and I like the fact that it is non-chemical.</li>
            <li>So far I am really liking this product!  </li>
            <li>I can see where someone with acne or acne dark spots would love this.  </li>
            <li>I have read other reviews about this feeling cheep because it is light weight, but it only has 1 purpose, to emit light.</li>
            <li>The red light surprised me as I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well</li>
            <li>Only thing is it is very time consuming, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Non-invasive, non-thermal, single frequency light energy.</li>
            <li>Using this wand once a night with the blue light has transformed my skin from oily and full of deep red pimples to a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin level (not oily or dry) that is much clearer and nearly free of acne.</li>
            <li>I had tried many lotions and serums with only about a 5% improvement--and I spent more on serums than I spent on this device.</li>
            <li>And in an effort of full disclosure, when I ordered this I also ordered a couple of different serums which I&#x27;ve been using as well, however I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every serum on the market and have never actually seen miraculous results, just softer</li>
            <li>Trident’s High Power High Output LEDs will never burnout.</li>
            <li>I mainly use the red right since I wanted my face to increase collagen production</li>
            <li>I have had discoloration on my face as a result of too much sun at a young age.  </li>
            <li>Blue and red light therapy is really working for me.</li>
            <li>After 4 to 6 weeks, in combination with taking vitamin D gelcaps, using the red and blue light really seems to help.  </li>
            <li>I use the green light and follow with the red light.  </li>
            <li>I expected something with a bit of weight to it, though I suppose if you are holding it up to your face for 20 minutes at a time you my want something light.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give 4 stars is because the material is really lite but is exactly like in the picture</li>
            <li>It is time consuming and the fact it&#x27;s not cordless is a draw back, but if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working I would say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>started to research possible LED skin therapy, found this on Amazon and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>My problem areas are the parallel lines on my forehead and laugh lines around eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions but also use it more or less frequently</li>
            <li>I noticed results right away for my moderate acne.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to sit right next to the outlet either.</li>
            <li>I have researched other light labeled for skincare rejuvenation, whether it is for acne or wrinkles and some of these products were FDA cleared.  </li>
            <li>This product is still new to me in a combo with using proactiv I have cleared up from my acne scars and my breakouts...</li>
            <li>but I sent an email to the company and they had me a new one within two business days.  </li>
            <li>and it has become my new habit.</li>
            <li>So I can live with that.</li>
            <li>While the acne itself is usually mild (spots clear up in a few days), my skin is easily prone to scarring (actually called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation).</li>
            <li>I use both the red and blue light attachments and saw results in my skin tone and texture within a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li>The blue and green light help the redness of my skin ( probably mild roseasa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had sun damage on my chest and the green light has really lightened them to the point where I don&#x27;t see them anymore.</li>
            <li>The only problem I encountered was a toe nail split after using the blue light on my feet.  </li>
            <li>The article talks about how the blue and red light therapy is so beneficial for the skin, where it kills the bacteria and accelerates wound healing.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least is the Green SUPER BRIGHT LED Treatment Head (525nm Green)</li>
            <li>I was not holding out much hope (despite the other positive reviews), as I&#x27;ve been let down so many times before.</li>
            <li>The product appeared to work well, but I only got to use it for one day, it began turning itself off on the first day I received it.</li>
            <li>The first week I&#x27;d put lotion and oil on and use the lights and after several days it looked like I had sunburn/heat rash.  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t have the kind of time it takes to do a treatment when a topical solution does about the same thing, so I spent $115 for it to collect dust.</li>
            <li>This has helped dry up the grease, stop new spots in their tracks - and I swear, that red light DOES plump your skin.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to just sit and mindlessly go over my skin.</li>
            <li>Which makes sense since the blue light does dry things out.  </li>
            <li>I have some white patches on my hand and arm and the pigment seems to be coming back fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t necessarily a believer in light therapy until I bought a small, handheld zit zapper that used blue light and heat to treat the pimple.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 LED Light Therapy treatments in this 1 little handheld</li>
            <li>Plus the lights are so bright and uncomfortable to see.</li>
            <li>daughter hopes to use it to clear some of her acne but hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>One star for the crappy cord issue and three because it did clear up acne, hence the two-star rating.</li>
            <li>I received the corded model although the product description clearly states the product cordless.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much acne, but when I used the blue light on a spot I had, I did notice improvement in a few days.</li>
            <li>I am hoping to keep using it to completely even my skintone.  </li>
            <li>I am 35 years old ice been using this product for one month now.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I use the red light for acne scars, and I can tell the next morning that the healing process has been expedited.</li>
            <li>I tried the green light for skin dis colorations and it didn&#x27;t make any changes,  </li>
            <li>This product is not wireless as it states and completely did not work when I plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li>far, this product has given me better results than I expected and sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li>No change yet in the tone or fading of old acne spots</li>
            <li>After 56 minutes of use, the product stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>Considering the instructions state 24 minutes a day x 7 days x 8 weeks -that is completely unacceptable .  </li>
            <li>My husband is now using the green light on his sun damaged face.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen as much benefit with my lower lip and chin as I did with my upper lip--</li>
            <li>Decided to try it on half my face to see if there was any difference, and after using the red light twice (both pulsating and steady, according to the instructions)</li>
            <li>I circulate each lit panel for around 15 minutes directly on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin reacts just like having sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very time consuming to actually do the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I really need all 3 colors for different things and it is just time consuming to get them all worked in.  </li>
            <li>So far I cannot detect any change in my age spots but I will keep trying.</li>
            <li>Lately i have had so many people make comments on how well my skin looks.</li>
            <li>However, for now I have tried the product for 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li>I read an article called, Use Blue and Red Light Therapy for Multiple Skin Care Benefits.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li>The problem seemed to have been an internal wiring thing, and for reasons of hygiene, this unit didn&#x27;t really qualify to be returned.  </li>
            <li>I really would like to send it back for a replacement!</li>
            <li>So far it has worked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too early to see any difference yet.</li>
            <li>After 9 days of using the green light on both my face and hands, my sunspots are 50% improved.  </li>
            <li>I decided to try this as it seemed like I had exhausted every OTC product available, with some success, but nothing life-changing.  </li>
            <li>second favorite head is the green.</li>
            <li>Others say its expensive, but so is good foundation or a night out on the town, and its probably cheaper than the cleansers and facemasks you&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t work on your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the blue light on my face but noticed very minimal improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to more improvement over the next few months!</li>
            <li>Turns out other reviewers&#x27; were right.</li>
            <li>I used the green light on the top of my arms from the elbow down to my wrist to fade the dark spots, freckles, etc.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what they are, not pimples, but it&#x27;s like a small light rash on the sides of my chin by my mouth that have almost gone away since using this for a week.  </li>
            <li>After only 2 weeks, I can&#x27;t belive the results - all of my marks are considerably faded, so much so that I can look at myself in the mirror and not cringe at any red marks.</li>
            <li>I bought this, and I don&#x27;t use it very often because it takes too long.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is too soon to review as I have only used the green light so far.  </li>
            <li>the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the blue and can see the impact the next day; the blemish will be noticeably smaller and the pain is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early forties and have just some slight wrinkles on the forehead and smile lines, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li>I ordered and paid for the new one, but received a used one, open box.</li>
            <li>and so I decided to buy it again as I know it works wonders, but this time I wanted to try also the red and maybe the green light and this brand</li>
            <li>have not seem results even with the red and with the green light</li>
            <li>so I tried the BrightTherapy Trident SR11A Light Therapy System (blue) on my feet and the itching went away within a few days.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are correct, you must be consistent.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it to stimulate tear production in my dogs who had extreme dry eye.  </li>
            <li>I used the red light and even after following all of the above directions, I did not see any improvement and was not inclined to try the other heads.  </li>
            <li>I use one different light everyday, only need to charge every four or five days.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write reviews often, and it&#x27;s only for the products I&#x27;m wild about.  </li>
            <li>I started by using the red, then the green led light panel on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the red light (although I&#x27;ve been meaning to try the green for hyperpigmentation and varicose veins; I&#x27;ll update if I ever get around to it).  </li>
            <li>So far, I have not seen any results, but I will continue to use it as the manufacturer suggests continuous daily treatments as sometimes it takes up to eight weeks to see a result.  </li>
            <li>Red Blue Green LED Light therapy</li>
            <li>Have not been using this system for very long, but initial results seem promising.  </li>
            <li>Green light improving old dark scars and sun</li>
            <li>Then after a month I developed multiple deep cysts.  </li>
            <li>I just use it while I&#x27;m sitting at the computer reading blogs or social media.</li>
            <li>After using a gazillion different topical acne treatments, seeing a dermatologist, and using only natural products on my face, I didn&#x27;t know what else was left for me to do to combat my acne.</li>
            <li>My dark spots have dramatically cleared up, I use the green light.</li>
            <li>Although these improvements aren&#x27;t really drastic, I wear less foundation now.</li>
            <li>I saw my results the first day, I use the blue then the green about 3-4 times a week,</li>
            <li>I rarely break out anymore, and when I do, it&#x27;s only a small blemish that&#x27;s gone within a couple</li>
            <li>The green light has helped my dark spots left from my acne and my acne has improved.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know yet as I only have had it for a little over a week</li>
            <li>The directions are a little complicated and it takes about 25 minutes per light per day but definitely worth it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I continue using the Bright Therapy Trident on a weekly basis.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> had the three of them for a good price.</li>
            <li> DOES GOOD THINGS</li>
            <li> loved when it worked.</li>
            <li> Loved the results but now when I turn the lights on it shuts off after 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li> Well, the lights were very bright and strong.  </li>
            <li> I am super happy with this therapy!  </li>
            <li> Very pleased with it</li>
            <li> After reading about it, I decided to give it a try and was very pleased on how it made my skin look.  </li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with my purchase and quality of item.</li>
            <li> This can also run off the cord giving you more exploring room which &amp;nbsp;is very nice, cause</li>
            <li> If you watch my video review you will see genuine enthusiasm on my face while I talk about its many awesome features.</li>
            <li> Nothing better for acne!</li>
            <li> I love this device!</li>
            <li> I definitely love this therapy!</li>
            <li> , I changed my mind, this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> more mom hands!</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use</li>
            <li> I have to say I love my Bright Therapy Trident.</li>
            <li> amazing product.</li>
            <li> Well...it worked and was amazing</li>
            <li> I bought this system and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has a nice handle that I can hold or I can prop on my shoulder/chest if I need to use my hand for a minute.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s handy to have  when things come up.</li>
            <li> After a good 2 or 3 weeks the redness and scarring on my cheeks lightened and well, my skin tone is just brighter and more even.  </li>
            <li> All three of the heads heat up nicely</li>
            <li> I also noticed my face is showing a nice glow and</li>
            <li> (I just gave my Mom her own for Christmas this year.)</li>
            <li> It does get rather warm too as its working.</li>
            <li> Very nice system for light therapy.  </li>
            <li> First of all this light therapy product is very very bright and works great on my shoulder.  </li>
            <li> I was so tickled to receive this awesome device &amp; 2 days early!</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so glad I purchased it!</li>
            <li> Furthermore, Bright Therapy makes both a corded version and a cordless version of the Trident Light Therapy System.</li>
            <li> This does come with a eye mask cover just in case the light is to bright for you.</li>
            <li> I like to buy beauty gadgets, and after great success with the Silk&#x27;n Hair remover, and the Zeno acne machine</li>
            <li> This is the first time I ever used light therapy on my skin, and I&#x27;m so impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> Everything about this is so easy!  </li>
            <li> This is great for acne, wrinkles, fine lines, or just need some therapy light for your body.</li>
            <li> two weeks later, I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never been so impressed.  </li>
            <li> This device feels very light and flimsy.</li>
            <li> its seem OK..</li>
            <li> You are better off buying Olay products.</li>
            <li> but I need more time to use and see is</li>
            <li> and thats more than others that cost more.</li>
            <li> This makes it work even better.</li>
            <li> I love that I get 3 treatment disks in one unit</li>
            <li> The video is on my blog -Lori&#x27;s blog reviews and more.  .</li>
            <li> gifted to my daughter per her request</li>
            <li> Started to feel desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began using this light therapy three weeks ago with amazing results.</li>
            <li> It works well for tightening the skin and gives your skin a  healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> So I went away from it for it for a good week to let things calm</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin for more than 20 years</li>
            <li> On the nights I use this, the next day, my skin is just awesome, as opposed to when I use the Blue/Green attachments.</li>
            <li> Finally found the best treatment for hormonal acne &amp; hyperpigmentation!!!!</li>
            <li> This light is made well and it seems to be helping my daughters acne!</li>
            <li> She says thecwarmth of the light relaxes her!</li>
            <li> The section treated looked SO MUCH Better than the untreated area.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have to wear a bang now to cover up my forehead! :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it more on those areas and try my neck and around my eyes as well.</li>
            <li> I noticed a glow and more</li>
            <li> I have been using the lights for more than two months .&lt;br</li>
            <li> continue with the treatment because the directions say that 3 months of&lt;br /&gt;Continues use or 7 times a week, as they begin to see the results of these two latest lights  </li>
            <li> Together my acne has cleared up and become much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Maybe it needs more time.</li>
            <li> I did not notice the wrinkles getting any better after a couple of sessions, but, what I did notice was the raised wart like bump on my side of nose was shrinking.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I used it as directed and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> worked in the sun for many years.  </li>
            <li> It was more noticeable than ever.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks more radiant and youthful, so</li>
            <li> I am using it with a cream that has vitamin C in it as suggested by someone, they said it would help to accelerate the cream to work better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This bright therapy system that cost a good chunk out your wallet, although it is on sell right now for $120 bucks originally $230 bucks on amazon and if you have prime you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> First it works perfectly, the bulbs are bright and its built to last!  </li>
            <li> most people.&lt;br /&gt;The discs and handle felt very cheap and light</li>
            <li> but people do compliment me more after I started using and it does help with some fine lines I have.</li>
            <li> so I bought it at the Bright Therapy website straight and thought I would write the review here as this is where I found the product and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> this makes it a huge value for me as I do want to treat more than one problem .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I really do love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for light therapy for home use .</li>
            <li> This was the best money spent for the variety of skin issues that are on my face and body.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for the infrared light and should be more patient</li>
            <li> Works better than any antibiotics or topical products I have tried and great value.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has three lenses that are easy to change.</li>
            <li> And an hour doing all three is easy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I can say it is easy to use and not at all</li>
            <li> Strong do not recommend anyone to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market for some nice LED therapy light this is right up your alley.</li>
            <li> THIS was True Pleasure to review its a fantastic product !</li>
            <li> This product is light weight, easy to operate, and delivers what it promises.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Did not notice any difference in fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I really think it&#x27;s clearing and skin looks better!</li>
            <li> When I use the blue light for the required 20 minutes per area, my break outs are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any thing I don&#x27;t like about this light.</li>
            <li> Being light makes it easier to use since you have to hold it for a period of time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> you get 3 light disks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for light therapy</li>
            <li> After three to four treatments with the red/infrared light, I saw results.  </li>
            <li> I have used laser light therapy on my face and neck  for about a year .  </li>
            <li> light stopped working after five months</li>
            <li> I still tried it and confirmed to myself it does nothing.</li>
            <li> Now won&#x27;t charge, and won&#x27;t light up the heads at all.</li>
            <li> Not by a lot but with free shipping I saved probably 9 dollars.</li>
            <li> So no, using the light therapy alone may not do, if your acne is severe.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC, MY FACE AND NECK LOOK</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t afford lazer and heard about light therapy on tv.</li>
            <li> SR11A Light Therapy is programmable with a 10 minute timer and auto shutoff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now, close to 3 times a week in the evening, I will do this light therapy with my under eye wrinkle reducing cream.</li>
            <li> but I suppose that would help because you have to put the lights on your face for about 20 minutes for each colored light.  </li>
            <li> This light system, however doesn&#x27;t mention any FDA clearing.  </li>
            <li> SR11A Light Therapy System</li>
            <li> Try to consider that our mothers didn&#x27;t have this option available to them.</li>
            <li> I received the Trident Light Therapy System to review free of charge.  </li>
            <li> , I thought that this Light System would work too.  </li>
            <li> Should buy directly from Bright Therapy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because there were many things I liked about the unit; it&#x27;s lightweight and therefore easy to use and move over the treatment area, the light heads interchanged easily and attached securely, the unit got warm but only pleasantly so, and the little beeping timer was convenient.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;would recommend highly!!!!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn’t too sure about this handheld device and did some research on light therapy.  </li>
            <li> is one awesome little tool!</li>
            <li> Seems to be making a mild difference on fine lines and wrinkles too.  </li>
            <li> The change was truly amazing, I was able to stop wearing makeup on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Second I use this Bright Therapy system once a day and then apply Proactiv advanced blemish treatment.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t really affect you, then I guess this light system would be okay.</li>
            <li> At first I figured there was no way it could actually be doing anything than just giving me a nice warm glow.  </li>
            <li> I received the product on time , excited I would be getting a good deal (as similar units sell for 2 -3x the cost).  </li>
            <li> (food alergies was the main culprit)  and this light has helped my skin look better than ever.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Hello Ladies,  I will be posting a better review for this product very soon.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this the full 8 weeks</li>
            <li> It did seem to decrease the oil production &amp; help large pimples disappear more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Using the nightly treatments of Bright Therapy Trident has really tightened my pores, reduced breakouts AND fixed the all over tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> great on bruises too), and the green light is for skin quality like softening or evening</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s also known that blue and red lights are great for the skin and sends signals to the brain helping with depression and anxiety!</li>
            <li> These little LED oval shaped lights are very bright and they only get a wee bit warm, and thats about it.</li>
            <li> but I like my high frequency machine better, and my micro needle.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with it, I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 weeks now and see a lot of results, almost no acne, only once in a while will get one pimple that will go away quicker and very improved skin complexion.</li>
            <li> The dark spots on my face have faded and my face looks heathier which makes me happy.</li>
            <li> This product is so easy to use , works very well and its chargeable</li>
            <li> (dry skin using each color a good 6 minutes)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very well made, and the heads can be switched easily.  </li>
            <li> but overall my skin looks and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like how easy this device can be used and how fast you&#x27;re done using it.</li>
            <li> I received it really quick and started using it right away, I&#x27;m always using skin care products that help me with my acne</li>
            <li> What I read said that the light has to be at a certain frequency in order to diminish wrinkles.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to move it around as much or worry if the light is getting that zit that popped up.</li>
            <li> But next to taking lots of harmful antibiotics, this has been the most effective method to clear my face.</li>
            <li> Once I added this light therapy I got real results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful to not have to put fade cream on my sensitive skin and risk more breakouts, the green light does the job and I saw results within one week after daily use.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> useful.  </li>
            <li> well worth</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth it, it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has a nice big treatment area</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I do the treatments my own way instead of following directions....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Mostly I&#x27;ve used the red light.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I had relatively low hopes for this product, but I&#x27;m a skin care device junkie, and after hearing a lot about LED light therapy I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I use the blue light mostly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about the effectiveness of product but probably not smart to order from a Quantum.</li>
            <li> The competitive product didn&#x27;t have the right frequency, but the Trident does,</li>
            <li> highly recommend this light therapy wand.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how powerful the light can be for breakouts and blemishes, my skin is getting brighter and glowing.</li>
            <li> This wand really just gives more leverage to the rest of my regimen (natural cleansers, zinc supplements, immune boosters, glycolic peels, etc.)  </li>
            <li> I have always wanted a light therapy device but with the prices on most of those so high it was not possible for me .</li>
            <li> (I use the blue light every night and the red light most mornings.)  </li>
            <li> The Red &amp; Infrared SUPER BRIGHT LED treatment head (660nm Red &amp; 880nm Infrared)</li>
            <li> The Blue SUPER BRIGHT LED Treatment Head (415nm Blue)</li>
            <li> the information on them suggests they are useful for treating a large variety of conditions.  </li>
            <li> I’m just so excited about the new Cordless BrightThreapy Trident</li>
            <li> Its OK.. &#x60;m using it from time to time.. not regular..</li>
            <li> even more if my stress and anxiety levels are up, I use the red (on occasion).</li>
            <li> They give you a blindfold, but who wants spend their evenings blindfolded for 30 minutes?!</li>
            <li> Here we go: I&#x27;ve been using the light therapy for nearly three months.  </li>
            <li> I had been getting the professional red/blue light treatments for 250 dollars a session, and although I did see results, I could not afford to do one treatment every week.</li>
            <li> I should start doing it to myself to get first hand but haven&#x27;t had time</li>
            <li> At first I used it every day; now I&#x27;m using it every two or three days.</li>
            <li> even color by the first week.  </li>
            <li> The most surprising is how well the green light works at fading dark pigmentation on my face.</li>
            <li> It cost too much not to be a reliable product!</li>
            <li> With 3 detachable LED Cluster heads.&lt;br /&gt;The RED &amp; INFRARED treatment head the BT-SR11A is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Some lighter spots disappeared completely and the darker spots are now light to medium.  </li>
            <li> I guess the biggest drawback of this device is the time commitment to using it, especially if you have more than one area to work on.</li>
            <li> I had a Tanda system before with the blue light only and used it until the light ran out and stopped working, it worked so great (in combination with other medications and treatments) that I had no acne at all</li>
            <li> I have also used the blue light for an infection on my dog and it seemed to resolve quickly  </li>
            <li> I have had many positive feed back on the way that it make the skin feel.</li>
            <li> first tried using the light with serums, but found it would hinder it gliding across my face, so I started using it on a clean dry face after my shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also very light if you are worried about holding your arm up for long periods at a time for treatment.  </li>
            <li> Before I was just washing with clean and clear and using the proactive blemish treatment alone and it did NOTHING for my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Need to use it more consistently to really tell anything..Will send a later review..</li>
            <li> Not so sure about the green light because I don&#x27;t use that often.</li>
            <li> the reviews seemed so positive</li>
            <li> The only thing I have noticed is that the RED LED is definitely the most effective for me.</li>
            <li> So far it has helped me tremendously to reduce my acne level.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s silent, easy to charge, I don&#x27;t use the eye mask</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks straight now, pretty much every morning.  </li>
            <li> have been using this BrightTheraphy on my whole face and guess what the embarrassing spot is nearly gone and the rest of my face is not bleached out and there was no bad reaction at all.  </li>
            <li> Your pretty much  getting four different light therapies in one.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use, the  positive effects are noticeable within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need the red light</li>
            <li> I use the blue light if I feel I am getting ready to break out or feel a blemish coming</li>
            <li> Having only used this product for about three weeks, it is too soon to give it an accurate review.  </li>
            <li> I have two weeks using this device and it really works.</li>
            <li> Blue light</li>
            <li> I really have nothing else to say.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> All the reviews here were very helpful to me on deciding which to buy.</li>
            <li> They really need to work on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> Now since I&#x27;ve been using the BrighTherapy trident my oily skin has cleared along with the pimples I  use the blue light for that.</li>
            <li> I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use the blue light for acne or &amp;#34;sterilizing&amp;#34;, I use the red light for wrinkles or healing(works</li>
            <li> this really make a difference in my face ,come on time</li>
            <li> i use the red light (which is infrared) for arthritis pain in my fingers</li>
            <li> and it really helps.</li>
            <li> In sum, I would not recommend the red light part of the device and cannot say about the others.</li>
            <li> The red light helps to rebuild</li>
            <li> I tried the red light for wrinkles and it likewise did not affect my skin at all.</li>
            <li> &gt;  Red light has firmed up &amp; healed my skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This product has infared as well as red light</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend this light enough!</li>
            <li> I do not want to jinx the effects of this product by saying this, but in the month that I have been using this product, it has absolutely transformed my skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it really helps.  </li>
            <li> The product is also very well made.</li>
            <li> which I like, I find the heat to be very soothing and it makes me sleepy before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really follow the directions.  </li>
            <li> I like the way it feels--the gentle warmth is relaxing.</li>
            <li> My skin really does well with this</li>
            <li> My daughter has used the blue light for some acne</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s been developing as she heads into puberty, and it&#x27;s really helped that too.  </li>
            <li> What really amazes me moreis</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it to my daughter for the blue light use, to see if it helps with her acne problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Red Light Treatments in my area that cost me $99 a month.  </li>
            <li> Instructions for use very unclear.</li>
            <li> and it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Well Obagi bleached out my whole face except the embarrassing spot on my nose.  </li>
            <li> This box arrived pretty fast and was already charged a bit, and when I turned it on, it nearly blinded me, I am used to these sorts of things needing to be charged first.</li>
            <li> This device charges in about a couple of hours fully and can run for days depending how much you use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and eventually use the red light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the red light on my foot that has plantar fasciitis and my doctor said it might help increase blood flow to the area.</li>
            <li> but honestly I think it&#x27;s a waste of $98.</li>
            <li> collagen &amp; you can&#x27;t go wrong with that!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bright Skin!</li>
            <li> Because my results are so good i am not starting in with the green light and red light for my deep frown lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne pretty much my adult life, very oily and that would cause the acne</li>
            <li> This particular machine works well and seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> Even if I have a few breakouts, the light clears it up fast and fades the scars quickly, which is unheard of for me.  </li>
            <li> Let me first say that I wash my face once in the morning and again at night with Clean and Clear continuous control, with a facial scrubbing sponge.</li>
            <li> Zap any new spots w/ blue light</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having expensive red light therapy (without infrared) on my face and saw great results.  </li>
            <li> Have had great success with a larger infrared LED light unit for the past few weeks, and wanted a more portable version with blue light - the green being a bonus.  </li>
            <li> The green light is what I&#x27;m mostly counting on as I have hyper pigmentation left from the acne scars</li>
            <li> use this pretty frequently, and I like the fact that it is non-chemical.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this product!  </li>
            <li> I can see where someone with acne or acne dark spots would love this.  </li>
            <li> I have read other reviews about this feeling cheep because it is light weight, but it only has 1 purpose, to emit light.</li>
            <li> The red light surprised me as I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well</li>
            <li> Only thing is it is very time consuming, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Non-invasive, non-thermal, single frequency light energy.</li>
            <li> Using this wand once a night with the blue light has transformed my skin from oily and full of deep red pimples to a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin level (not oily or dry) that is much clearer and nearly free of acne.</li>
            <li> I had tried many lotions and serums with only about a 5% improvement--and I spent more on serums than I spent on this device.</li>
            <li> And in an effort of full disclosure, when I ordered this I also ordered a couple of different serums which I&#x27;ve been using as well, however I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every serum on the market and have never actually seen miraculous results, just softer</li>
            <li> Trident’s High Power High Output LEDs will never burnout.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the red right since I wanted my face to increase collagen production</li>
            <li> I have had discoloration on my face as a result of too much sun at a young age.  </li>
            <li> Blue and red light therapy is really working for me.</li>
            <li> After 4 to 6 weeks, in combination with taking vitamin D gelcaps, using the red and blue light really seems to help.  </li>
            <li> I use the green light and follow with the red light.  </li>
            <li> I expected something with a bit of weight to it, though I suppose if you are holding it up to your face for 20 minutes at a time you my want something light.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give 4 stars is because the material is really lite but is exactly like in the picture</li>
            <li> It is time consuming and the fact it&#x27;s not cordless is a draw back, but if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working I would say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> started to research possible LED skin therapy, found this on Amazon and decided it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> My problem areas are the parallel lines on my forehead and laugh lines around eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions but also use it more or less frequently</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away for my moderate acne.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to sit right next to the outlet either.</li>
            <li> I have researched other light labeled for skincare rejuvenation, whether it is for acne or wrinkles and some of these products were FDA cleared.  </li>
            <li> This product is still new to me in a combo with using proactiv I have cleared up from my acne scars and my breakouts...</li>
            <li> but I sent an email to the company and they had me a new one within two business days.  </li>
            <li> and it has become my new habit.</li>
            <li> So I can live with that.</li>
            <li> While the acne itself is usually mild (spots clear up in a few days), my skin is easily prone to scarring (actually called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation).</li>
            <li> I use both the red and blue light attachments and saw results in my skin tone and texture within a couple of uses.  </li>
            <li> The blue and green light help the redness of my skin ( probably mild roseasa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had sun damage on my chest and the green light has really lightened them to the point where I don&#x27;t see them anymore.</li>
            <li> The only problem I encountered was a toe nail split after using the blue light on my feet.  </li>
            <li> The article talks about how the blue and red light therapy is so beneficial for the skin, where it kills the bacteria and accelerates wound healing.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least is the Green SUPER BRIGHT LED Treatment Head (525nm Green)</li>
            <li> I was not holding out much hope (despite the other positive reviews), as I&#x27;ve been let down so many times before.</li>
            <li> The product appeared to work well, but I only got to use it for one day, it began turning itself off on the first day I received it.</li>
            <li> The first week I&#x27;d put lotion and oil on and use the lights and after several days it looked like I had sunburn/heat rash.  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the kind of time it takes to do a treatment when a topical solution does about the same thing, so I spent $115 for it to collect dust.</li>
            <li> This has helped dry up the grease, stop new spots in their tracks - and I swear, that red light DOES plump your skin.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to just sit and mindlessly go over my skin.</li>
            <li> Which makes sense since the blue light does dry things out.  </li>
            <li> I have some white patches on my hand and arm and the pigment seems to be coming back fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t necessarily a believer in light therapy until I bought a small, handheld zit zapper that used blue light and heat to treat the pimple.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 LED Light Therapy treatments in this 1 little handheld</li>
            <li> Plus the lights are so bright and uncomfortable to see.</li>
            <li> daughter hopes to use it to clear some of her acne but hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> One star for the crappy cord issue and three because it did clear up acne, hence the two-star rating.</li>
            <li> I received the corded model although the product description clearly states the product cordless.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much acne, but when I used the blue light on a spot I had, I did notice improvement in a few days.</li>
            <li> I am hoping to keep using it to completely even my skintone.  </li>
            <li> I am 35 years old ice been using this product for one month now.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I use the red light for acne scars, and I can tell the next morning that the healing process has been expedited.</li>
            <li> I tried the green light for skin dis colorations and it didn&#x27;t make any changes,  </li>
            <li> This product is not wireless as it states and completely did not work when I plugged in the wall.</li>
            <li> far, this product has given me better results than I expected and sooner than I expected.  </li>
            <li> No change yet in the tone or fading of old acne spots</li>
            <li> After 56 minutes of use, the product stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> Considering the instructions state 24 minutes a day x 7 days x 8 weeks -that is completely unacceptable .  </li>
            <li> My husband is now using the green light on his sun damaged face.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen as much benefit with my lower lip and chin as I did with my upper lip--</li>
            <li> Decided to try it on half my face to see if there was any difference, and after using the red light twice (both pulsating and steady, according to the instructions)</li>
            <li> I circulate each lit panel for around 15 minutes directly on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin reacts just like having sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very time consuming to actually do the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I really need all 3 colors for different things and it is just time consuming to get them all worked in.  </li>
            <li> So far I cannot detect any change in my age spots but I will keep trying.</li>
            <li> Lately i have had so many people make comments on how well my skin looks.</li>
            <li> However, for now I have tried the product for 3 weeks so far</li>
            <li> I read an article called, Use Blue and Red Light Therapy for Multiple Skin Care Benefits.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.  </li>
            <li> The problem seemed to have been an internal wiring thing, and for reasons of hygiene, this unit didn&#x27;t really qualify to be returned.  </li>
            <li> I really would like to send it back for a replacement!</li>
            <li> So far it has worked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too early to see any difference yet.</li>
            <li> After 9 days of using the green light on both my face and hands, my sunspots are 50% improved.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this as it seemed like I had exhausted every OTC product available, with some success, but nothing life-changing.  </li>
            <li> second favorite head is the green.</li>
            <li> Others say its expensive, but so is good foundation or a night out on the town, and its probably cheaper than the cleansers and facemasks you&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t work on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the blue light on my face but noticed very minimal improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to more improvement over the next few months!</li>
            <li> Turns out other reviewers&#x27; were right.</li>
            <li> I used the green light on the top of my arms from the elbow down to my wrist to fade the dark spots, freckles, etc.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what they are, not pimples, but it&#x27;s like a small light rash on the sides of my chin by my mouth that have almost gone away since using this for a week.  </li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks, I can&#x27;t belive the results - all of my marks are considerably faded, so much so that I can look at myself in the mirror and not cringe at any red marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and I don&#x27;t use it very often because it takes too long.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is too soon to review as I have only used the green light so far.  </li>
            <li> the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the blue and can see the impact the next day; the blemish will be noticeably smaller and the pain is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early forties and have just some slight wrinkles on the forehead and smile lines, but nothing major.  </li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for the new one, but received a used one, open box.</li>
            <li> and so I decided to buy it again as I know it works wonders, but this time I wanted to try also the red and maybe the green light and this brand</li>
            <li> have not seem results even with the red and with the green light</li>
            <li> so I tried the BrightTherapy Trident SR11A Light Therapy System (blue) on my feet and the itching went away within a few days.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are correct, you must be consistent.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it to stimulate tear production in my dogs who had extreme dry eye.  </li>
            <li> I used the red light and even after following all of the above directions, I did not see any improvement and was not inclined to try the other heads.  </li>
            <li> I use one different light everyday, only need to charge every four or five days.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often, and it&#x27;s only for the products I&#x27;m wild about.  </li>
            <li> I started by using the red, then the green led light panel on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the red light (although I&#x27;ve been meaning to try the green for hyperpigmentation and varicose veins; I&#x27;ll update if I ever get around to it).  </li>
            <li> So far, I have not seen any results, but I will continue to use it as the manufacturer suggests continuous daily treatments as sometimes it takes up to eight weeks to see a result.  </li>
            <li> Red Blue Green LED Light therapy</li>
            <li> Have not been using this system for very long, but initial results seem promising.  </li>
            <li> Green light improving old dark scars and sun</li>
            <li> Then after a month I developed multiple deep cysts.  </li>
            <li> I just use it while I&#x27;m sitting at the computer reading blogs or social media.</li>
            <li> After using a gazillion different topical acne treatments, seeing a dermatologist, and using only natural products on my face, I didn&#x27;t know what else was left for me to do to combat my acne.</li>
            <li> My dark spots have dramatically cleared up, I use the green light.</li>
            <li> Although these improvements aren&#x27;t really drastic, I wear less foundation now.</li>
            <li> I saw my results the first day, I use the blue then the green about 3-4 times a week,</li>
            <li> I rarely break out anymore, and when I do, it&#x27;s only a small blemish that&#x27;s gone within a couple</li>
            <li> The green light has helped my dark spots left from my acne and my acne has improved.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know yet as I only have had it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> The directions are a little complicated and it takes about 25 minutes per light per day but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> so far, only gave it 4 stars due to the somewhat flimsy plastic construction.</li>
            <li> Using it for 6 weeks and show a little improvement - not as well as I had hoped but maybe with older skin it does not work as well.  </li>
            <li> I usually just focus on areas that are starting to break out as opposed to following the directions that include over 45 minutes of the whole face.</li>
            <li> I have been using the green light nearly daily for the past 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Plus this was only $119.00 and can be used for a long time to come and for various issues.  </li>
            <li> Plus with Obagi you are to expect a terrible allergic reaction which last 6 weeks and turns your whole face bright red.  </li>
            <li> There was a dark spot I have been attempting to clear for 8 years</li>
            <li> I can use it as long as I want on each spot without worrying about having to cycle through any settings to get back to the one</li>
            <li> It only took a few days for me to start seeing results, and a month after use, I&#x27;m nearly clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blue &amp; red lights for the past month, and I&#x27;ve noticed clear improvements in stubborn redness and oiliness</li>
            <li> A few drawings and non detailed directions, that&#x27;s just not good enough for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> It worked for a little while and then stopped completely.</li>
            <li> It plugs in and has a really long cord.</li>
            <li> The cord is like, 5-6 feet long.</li>
            <li> I also tried it on some minor acne and that also worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got lazy and didn&#x27;t buy the new replacement head.</li>
            <li> In the past everytime my skin got clear something came up either stress or my period and BAM!</li>
            <li> My skin is still threatened by the occasional pimple or under the surface bump, but I concentrate the wand on the blemish for a little extra time and the pimple disappears in a day or so.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews that said the same thing.</li>
            <li> So I bought this to use in combination, since there&#x27;s not a lot of spot treatments you can combine with glycolic acid that won&#x27;t have side effects like dry skin, etc.  </li>
            <li> I really am frustrated not to be able to use my device properly.</li>
            <li> , if you use it everyday you&#x27;ll see what a big difference it makes, you start to have less and less acne coming out and the ones that come out go away much faster.</li>
            <li> no new acne!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I bought this several weeks ago to help minimize dark spots.</li>
            <li> anyone is like me and suffers from acne and post-acne hyperpigmentation, I strongly encourage you to give this a try.</li>
            <li> have only been using this for a week but already my little skin issues seem to be soothed</li>
            <li> When I use the red on my forehead wrinkles, it seems to &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; them out a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Love the light therapy, hate the fact it worked for less than 24 hours - was hoping for a few months at least.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping for at least some fading results and have been pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this after reading about red light therapy and figured it wasn&#x27;t too expensive to at least give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I am currently trying out the green disk for hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Using the red and green lights on my face</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s harder to see the improvements, but I do feel some dryness on my skin</li>
            <li> and I was crushed...</li>
            <li> The few times I did use it I found it helped to reduce the discolorations I had from scrapes on my leg and a brown spot on the back on my hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and our processes can give us zinc deficiencies sometimes, but please be careful taking zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next up is the GREEN LED treatment head, wait</li>
            <li> well absolutely no improvement.  </li>
            <li> After 4 weeks there was absolutely NO change in the appearance of my skin on either arm.  </li>
            <li> I use routinely (like 10 minutes or so every other day) to improve rough and patchy skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been suffering from mild-moderate adult acne and oily skin for the past few months.</li>
            <li> Over the last couple years, the number of discolored marks on my face got so bad, it started to affect my self-esteem and even created mild depression for me.</li>
            <li> I was so hopeful when I read the reviews from the other folks with acne.</li>
            <li> but I use for about 10-15 minutes every other day while watching TV</li>
            <li> Also, there are some grammitical errors in the directions which made me wonder if this is a foreign made product.</li>
            <li> I took other photos to compare</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the other colors though, so I can&#x27;t speak to those.  </li>
            <li> I used the blue panel behind my ears and on bumps on my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> then I would have dark marks (hyperpigmentation)</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my dark spots or tightening of my skin after a month.  </li>
            <li> This is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Dark scarring &amp; sun spots about 50% improved after three weeks&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male in my mid-twenties and have suffered from acne since my late teens.</li>
            <li> Takes patience to see a difference in slight wrinkles</li>
            <li> It makes my skin tighter and less wrinkles are now visible.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the unit only lit up the heads for my initial testing of all 3 heads.</li>
            <li> I almost bought a competitor&#x27;s product that I saw at Sam&#x27;s Club for a slightly lower price, but I did some internet research to find out what the scientific studies showed.</li>
            <li> My cheeks are undeniably fuller, and my nasolabial folds are significantly less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My skin is ALOT less oily also.</li>
            <li> I have noticed  now, that the skin appears thicker and some of the less noticeable wrinkles are faded.  </li>
            <li> I would have hoped to have seen some slight improvement by now.</li>
            <li> Some reviews claim its time consuming because it takes a little less than a half hour for a session</li>
            <li> I decided to use the green panel on my dark elbows and knees.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with products being sealed if they are labeled brand new.  </li>
            <li> I had the T zone acne with tons of little pustuals on my cheeks along with roscea.</li>
            <li> so maybe I&#x27;m being a little hasty, but this product has not made a drastic change in my skin.</li>
            <li> It was extremely frustrating and made me very self conscious to the point of not leaving my house during a bad breakout.</li>
            <li> I use the green lens every night</li>
            <li> I had an ANSR beam device, but after 2 years, and a few drops on tile, it wasn&#x27;t charging anymore and the lens was cracked.</li>
            <li> A Korean friend of mine even asked me about my skin care routine after using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I saw progress when I used it, but the cord seems to have a broken wire or short.  </li>
            <li> Targeting trouble areas for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> have had trouble skin for over 11 years now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> After a few days, my dad comment that my face looked heathier and clearer.  </li>
            <li> I am seriously addicted to this device and only wish I would have started it years ago</li>
            <li> I could see the result after a few times of using this machine.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 3 1/2 months and now I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Stop groaning you do not have to use this product everyday for the rest of your lives.  </li>
            <li> In just a few days it had decreased the wrinkles on my upper lip by about 50%.</li>
            <li> Still have acne, no more or less but definately not  </li>
            <li> The other product &amp;#34;Lightstim&amp;#34; worked but not only tooo expensive the cord broke twice on me</li>
            <li> (really not easy to get a replacment cord) after five weeks of using the lightstim I looked</li>
            <li> Having a very pale complection I had to cake on pore clogging foundation to try to hide the redness, which only spread bacteria and made things worse.</li>
            <li> Not sure the green is fading anything, but hey....</li>
            <li> I used it according to the directions and have notice very little difference.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product I was ready to use it, return it and write a bad review if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I had a breakout of severe hormonal cystic acne that I was desperately trying to clear up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the power cord or the lights.  </li>
            <li> Struggling with hormonal acne for the past year.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even begin to describe the change in my mood over the past couple of weeks - a couple of people have even asked if I did something to face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> Pustuals are almost all dried up!</li>
            <li> Amazon says I&#x27;m not able to return this item....</li>
            <li> I thought it made me look old and angry!</li>
            <li> CHEAP AND DISAPPOINTING!!</li>
            <li> A range of under the skin painful gross postules to annoying little tiny surface pimples appeared constantly even with antibiotics, nothing helped.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to say how</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to say it&#x27;s this as I&#x27;m also using a scar cream to treat the pinkish/red marks.</li>
            <li> and yet it is not effective...</li>
            <li> I was afraid she would not take the time to use it since she is only 14, but she does every night while she is lying in bed too go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I Recieved it LATE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39, so lately I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of volume loss in my cheeks and deepening nasolabial folds (ugh).  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t I at least get a replacement?</li>
            <li> I use a couple of times a day and find it is slowly reducing the area affected.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as time went on, I started developing small pimples in spots</li>
            <li> but the results are so slow that I got bored of using it and so stopped before I could see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> It came in a thin box, with nothing accompanying the &#x27;system.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> I think it made it even worse, although that could have been coincidence.  </li>
            <li> so I have seen dramatic at my jaw line which had started to sag quite noticeably.  </li>
            <li> I hate being tied down to beauty products.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to learn that you must use the device for 24 minutes and that you must keep the device in constant motion while you use it.  </li>
            <li> Its an expensive product</li>
            <li> for the price you cant go wrong</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this item does not do anything.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> uncomfortable having just a bit of a warming sensation.  </li>
            <li> The skin tightening also failed.  </li>
            <li> So maybe I am doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work on hormonal acne.  </li>
            <li> Really skeptical, but desperate - still getting zits at 60.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried desperately to find solutions (i.e. chemical peels, healthier eating) and nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY cheesy, all the way around.</li>
            <li> Once I had this in my hand, I realized it was  impossible for this device to do anything claimed.</li>
            <li> Bad Product.</li>
            <li> I have, or HAD really ugly freckles on my hands (just like my mom)</li>
            <li> Call me crazy!  </li>
            <li> I used this product 1-3 times a wk on each blemished problem area for the amount of time the trident allowed between the extended beeps and still have not seen any results or improvement as a result of usage. :-(</li>
            <li> These were painful &amp; took forever to heal!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disgusting breakout.</li>
            <li> It was nasty.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Need to use it more consistently to really tell anything..Will send a later review..</li>
            <li> My wife likes this product as it meets her expectations.</li>
            <li> It has not made a difference at all for acne.  There is no color/age mark difference and the skin tightness MIGHT be visible.  I have been using it for 3 months now and I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its OK.. &#x60;m using it from time to time.. not regular.. its seem OK.. nothing show a miracle yet.</li>
            <li> Very nice system for light therapy.  Your pretty much  getting four different light therapies in one.  I found the red/ infrared to be the&lt;br /&gt;most useful.  Have not been using this system for very long, but initial results seem promising.  Very effective at controlling itchiness.  I have some white patches on my hand and arm and the pigment seems to be coming back fairly quick.  Did some research on red LED lights and the information on them suggests they are useful for treating a large variety of conditions.  If this system does what it promises then the price paid is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I have had discoloration on my face as a result of too much sun at a young age.  Hyperpigmentation according to the dermatologist.  I tried chemical peels but no improvement and it returns darker every summer even with sunscreen.  I bought this hoping for at least some fading results and have been pleasantly surprised.  I use the green lens every night and I believe it is definitely helping to fade some of the darkness.  I am hoping to keep using it to completely even my skintone.  Time will tell and so will the upcoming summer.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter hopes to use it to clear some of her acne but hasn&#x27;t tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;I will post an update...</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I have two weeks using this device and it really works. Especially for acne..... yessssss! Nothing better for acne! Blue light it&#x27;s the best way to kill the bacteria.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. So far it has helped me tremendously to reduce my acne level. I really have nothing else to say. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> It worked for a little while and then stopped completely. I got a refund for the product.  When I did use it, it did nothing for my complexion.</li>
            <li> I ordered and paid for the new one, but received a used one, open box. Not too happy about it.</li>
            <li> I noticed results right away for my moderate acne. The directions are a little complicated and it takes about 25 minutes per light per day but definitely worth it. Works better than any antibiotics or topical products I have tried and great value.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the difference is. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. You are better off buying Olay products.</li>
            <li> This product is still new to me in a combo with using proactiv I have cleared up from my acne scars and my breakouts...you have to keep up with the regimen though...my goal of never wearing makeup again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is easy to use and works as advertised.  I use both the red and blue light attachments and saw results in my skin tone and texture within a couple of uses.  It is a bit time consuming but well worth it considering how well it works,</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this at amazon as it didn&#x27;t deliver to my country so I bought it at the Bright Therapy website straight and thought I would write the review here as this is where I found the product and decided to buy it. All the reviews here were very helpful to me on deciding which to buy. I had a Tanda system before with the blue light only and used it until the light ran out and stopped working, it worked so great (in combination with other medications and treatments) that I had no acne at all so once it ran out I got lazy and didn&#x27;t buy the new replacement head. My acne came back about a year later and so I decided to buy it again as I know it works wonders, but this time I wanted to try also the red and maybe the green light and this brand had the three of them for a good price. I received it really quick and started using it right away, I&#x27;m always using skin care products that help me with my acne so this is just an extra for me but it does a lot, if you use it everyday you&#x27;ll see what a big difference it makes, you start to have less and less acne coming out and the ones that come out go away much faster. The red light surprised me as I didn&#x27;t think it would work as well but I felt it improved my skin a lot, it&#x27;s hard to say how but people do compliment me more after I started using and it does help with some fine lines I have. The green light is what I&#x27;m mostly counting on as I have hyper pigmentation left from the acne scars and it seems to be helping, I&#x27;m taking a picture every week to see the improvement, it&#x27;s helping but it&#x27;s hard to say it&#x27;s this as I&#x27;m also using a scar cream to treat the pinkish/red marks. I don&#x27;t have any brown or sun spots so I can&#x27;t say if it works for that. I use one different light everyday, only need to charge every four or five days. I got the cordless model, it&#x27;s silent, easy to charge, I don&#x27;t use the eye mask it came with as I had googles from my last Tanda so I can see some while doing. So far I&#x27;m very happy with it, I&#x27;ve been using for about 5 weeks now and see a lot of results, almost no acne, only once in a while will get one pimple that will go away quicker and very improved skin complexion. I recommend to anyone wondering if it&#x27;s worth it, it is.</li>
            <li> The product appeared to work well, but I only got to use it for one day, it began turning itself off on the first day I received it. They really need to work on the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne pretty much my adult life, very oily and that would cause the acne then I would have dark marks (hyperpigmentation) the acne would leave. Now since I&#x27;ve been using the BrighTherapy trident my oily skin has cleared along with the pimples I  use the blue light for that. up I don&#x27;t have to apply my makeup all the time. My dark spots have dramatically cleared up, I use the green light. Don&#x27;t really need the red light but I use it anyway for future lines or wrinkles. I am 35 years old ice been using this product for one month now. Only thing is it is very time consuming, but definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any difference.  I won&#x27;t be using it again and wish I could get my money back!</li>
            <li> I had an ANSR beam device, but after 2 years, and a few drops on tile, it wasn&#x27;t charging anymore and the lens was cracked. So I was looking to get something else that would work the same but with a bigger treatment area and didn&#x27;t have a timer limit. I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It has a nice handle that I can hold or I can prop on my shoulder/chest if I need to use my hand for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;-It has a nice big treatment area so I don&#x27;t have to move it around as much or worry if the light is getting that zit that popped up. The ANSR beam had a lens the size of my thumb, while this device has a lens the size of my palm. So great!&lt;br /&gt;-There is no timer. I can use it as long as I want on each spot without worrying about having to cycle through any settings to get back to the one I want.&lt;br /&gt;-It has three lenses that are easy to change. Again, I don&#x27;t have to cycle through settings. I can just switch to the head I want and get to work.&lt;br /&gt;- THREE LENSES. That is three different options for color. I use the blue light for acne or &amp;#34;sterilizing&amp;#34;, I use the red light for wrinkles or healing(works great on bruises too), and the green light is for skin quality like softening or evening tone.&lt;br /&gt;- It is not battery powered or need charging. It plugs in and has a really long cord. No replacing batteries, no charging issues. You don&#x27;t have to sit right next to the outlet either. The cord is like, 5-6 feet long. I can plug it in and sit on my couch, or lay in bed, or make a sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this pretty frequently, and I like the fact that it is non-chemical. I don&#x27;t know of any thing I don&#x27;t like about this light.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give 4 stars is because the material is really lite but is exactly like in the picture&lt;br /&gt;for this moment work like the seller say but I need more time to use and see is this really make a difference in my face ,come on time</li>
            <li> This is working on cystic acne. Takes patience to see a difference in slight wrinkles but you need to be diligent. I have read other reviews about this feeling cheep because it is light weight, but it only has 1 purpose, to emit light. Being light makes it easier to use since you have to hold it for a period of time. I wish I would have found this earlier!</li>
            <li> i use the red light (which is infrared) for arthritis pain in my fingers and it really helps. I use it once or twice a week and it keeps the pain in check.  The infrared stimulates healing.  I have also used the blue light for an infection on my dog and it seemed to resolve quickly  I originally bought it to stimulate tear production in my dogs who had extreme dry eye.  It did seem to help.  It&#x27;s handy to have  when things come up.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to learn that you must use the device for 24 minutes and that you must keep the device in constant motion while you use it.  I used the red light and even after following all of the above directions, I did not see any improvement and was not inclined to try the other heads.  In sum, I would not recommend the red light part of the device and cannot say about the others.</li>
            <li> I saw no difference in my dark spots or tightening of my skin after a month.  I was so hopeful when I read the reviews from the other folks with acne. It did seem to decrease the oil production &amp; help large pimples disappear more quickly.  I was thrilled!  Unfortunately, as time went on, I started developing small pimples in spots I didn&#x27;t get them before.  Then after a month I developed multiple deep cysts.  These were painful &amp; took forever to heal! I don&#x27;t know if suppressing the oil caused the deep cysts but I have stopped using this.</li>
            <li> Using this wand once a night with the blue light has transformed my skin from oily and full of deep red pimples to a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin level (not oily or dry) that is much clearer and nearly free of acne. My skin is still threatened by the occasional pimple or under the surface bump, but I concentrate the wand on the blemish for a little extra time and the pimple disappears in a day or so. This has truly been a lifesaver for my acne-prone skin. It only took a few days for me to start seeing results, and a month after use, I&#x27;m nearly clear. Occasionally I use the red light for acne scars, and I can tell the next morning that the healing process has been expedited. After using a gazillion different topical acne treatments, seeing a dermatologist, and using only natural products on my face, I didn&#x27;t know what else was left for me to do to combat my acne. But next to taking lots of harmful antibiotics, this has been the most effective method to clear my face. I 100% recommend this product if over the counter acne treatments have not worked for you. If you miss a day or two, you will start to see your pores clog up again and your face will get congested, so regular maintenance is necessary.</li>
            <li> This product is a life changer. I never had acne in highschool and beginning at 19 my skin decided to change, now at 23 I&#x27;m over having acne. In the past everytime my skin got clear something came up either stress or my period and BAM! Disgusting breakout. After a study abroad I contracted Staph...on my face. It was nasty. A range of under the skin painful gross postules to annoying little tiny surface pimples appeared constantly even with antibiotics, nothing helped. Having a very pale complection I had to cake on pore clogging foundation to try to hide the redness, which only spread bacteria and made things worse. It was extremely frustrating and made me very self conscious to the point of not leaving my house during a bad breakout. I came across this and I caved, hoping for the best. Honestly, it&#x27;s the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. Some reviews claim its time consuming because it takes a little less than a half hour for a session but when I&#x27;m sitting drinking my coffee in the morning or relaxing watching tv at night or reading a book laying in bed it&#x27;s easy to just sit and mindlessly go over my skin. And an hour doing all three is easy. Others say its expensive, but so is good foundation or a night out on the town, and its probably cheaper than the cleansers and facemasks you&#x27;ve bought that didn&#x27;t work on your skin. I saw my results the first day, I use the blue then the green about 3-4 times a week, even more if my stress and anxiety levels are up, I use the red (on occasion). I follow the directions but also use it more or less frequently so it fits the needs of my skin. My skin is now smoothe and back to it&#x27;s highschool self! Good luck!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this product.  It makes my skin tighter and less wrinkles are now visible. This product has 3 heads - one for wrinkles - one for brown spot - and one for acne or pimples.</li>
            <li> Its an expensive product and yet it is not effective...especially considering the amount of time you have to spend each day using it.  Plus the lights are so bright and uncomfortable to see. They give you a blindfold, but who wants spend their evenings blindfolded for 30 minutes?!</li>
            <li> I was so tickled to receive this awesome device &amp; 2 days early! It worked wonders on my face. A Korean friend of mine even asked me about my skin care routine after using it for a few days. There was a noticeable difference in 2 days. However I had used some Palmers and a 1% Retin A 4 days prior &amp; that may have  explained the peeling &amp; redness I was experiencing. There was a dark spot I have been attempting to clear for 8 years &amp; it&#x27;s almost gone. The red light helps to rebuild collagen &amp; you can&#x27;t go wrong with that!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bright Skin!</li>
            <li> I saw progress when I used it, but the cord seems to have a broken wire or short.  It takes two hands to use this - one to hold the cord and one to hold the device.  One star for the crappy cord issue and three because it did clear up acne, hence the two-star rating.</li>
            <li> I use the blue light if I feel I am getting ready to break out or feel a blemish coming and it is almost gone the next day or two.  Not so sure about the green light because I don&#x27;t use that often.</li>
            <li> I have used it for two weeks, and can&#x27;t tell the difference on my skin. I will like to return this products, and get a refund.</li>
            <li> It keeps shutting off , but the one thing I have noticed is decrease in oiliness, approx use 2 wks.</li>
            <li> Been using around a month now and have seen posi give results.  Skin looks smoother and I will keep using hoping to continue taking years off instead of putting on.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.  I tried the green light for skin dis colorations and it didn&#x27;t make any changes,  I tried the red light for wrinkles and it likewise did not affect my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love my Bright Therapy Trident. for the price you cant go wrong you get 3 light disks and thats more than others that cost more. This product is so easy to use , works very well and its chargeable I am currently trying out the green disk for hyperpigmentation. I like that you can use a skin cream or serum with it . This makes it work even better. I have always wanted a light therapy device but with the prices on most of those so high it was not possible for me . I love that I get 3 treatment disks in one unit this makes it a huge value for me as I do want to treat more than one problem .&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample in order to do a blog post and video review for it but I really do love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for light therapy for home use . If you watch my video review you will see genuine enthusiasm on my face while I talk about its many awesome features. THIS was True Pleasure to review its a fantastic product ! The video is on my blog -Lori&#x27;s blog reviews and more.  .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ts only been a week but i used product similar to this one already. So far I&#x27;m loving it. The other product &amp;#34;Lightstim&amp;#34; worked but not only tooo expensive the cord broke twice on me and I can get a replacement for it. (really not easy to get a replacment cord) after five weeks of using the lightstim I looked ( No lie) 10 years younger... this feels the same as the lightstim so go with this one Promise. I used mine every day and during the five weeks I noticed nothing but that last day when I woke up and looked into the mirror I cried. amazing product. I took before and after pictures.</li>
            <li> Using the red and green lights on my face it&#x27;s harder to see the improvements, but I do feel some dryness on my skin the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the blue and can see the impact the next day; the blemish will be noticeably smaller and the pain is pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> This is not worth the money. It won&#x27;t stay on. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the power cord or the lights.  I feel as if I were ripped off.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but the results are so slow that I got bored of using it and so stopped before I could see noticeable results.</li>
            <li> This product is really low end and low quality.After 2 weeks it stopped working do not recommend this for any customer.Hope to get a refund on this one.</li>
            <li> The jury is still out on this one. I&#x27;m all for light therapy and I hope one day I can see results</li>
            <li> This product is not wireless as it states and completely did not work when I plugged in the wall. Strong do not recommend anyone to purchase this product. I am returning it ASAP! :0(</li>
            <li> gifted to my daughter per her request</li>
            <li> Struggling with hormonal acne for the past year. Researched and tried many...many treatments. Started to feel desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began using this light therapy three weeks ago with amazing results. I do the treatments my own way instead of following directions....i.e. Targeting trouble areas for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Can do therapy while watching tv.&lt;br /&gt;  No side effects&lt;br /&gt;  Within a few days my old cystic acne bumps nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;  Dark scarring &amp; sun spots about 50% improved after three weeks&lt;br /&gt;  Skin smoother, tighter&lt;br /&gt;  Zap any new spots w/ blue light and they are gone in about 2-3 days!!!&lt;br /&gt;  After three weeks- no new acne!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  Red light has firmed up &amp; healed my skin.&lt;br /&gt;  Green light improving old dark scars and sun spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;  I Didn&#x27;t discover it a year ago!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after having expensive red light therapy (without infrared) on my face and saw great results.  This product has infared as well as red light so I have seen dramatic at my jaw line which had started to sag quite noticeably.  After three to four treatments with the red/infrared light, I saw results.  My neck area is also looking tighter and the deep lines around my eyes are smoothing out.  The blue and green light help the redness of my skin ( probably mild roseasa).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this product has given me better results than I expected and sooner than I expected.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have used laser light therapy on my face and neck  for about a year .  It works well for tightening the skin and gives your skin a  healthy glow.  This particular machine works well and seems to be very well made.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this as it seemed like I had exhausted every OTC product available, with some success, but nothing life-changing.  Glycolic acid definitely improved my skin, but I still broke out and my breakouts took forever to heal. So I bought this to use in combination, since there&#x27;s not a lot of spot treatments you can combine with glycolic acid that won&#x27;t have side effects like dry skin, etc.  I started in September and by November, I was 95% clearer.  (I use the blue light every night and the red light most mornings.)  The change was truly amazing, I was able to stop wearing makeup on a daily basis.  I rarely break out anymore, and when I do, it&#x27;s only a small blemish that&#x27;s gone within a couple days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My light stopped working after five months and I was crushed... but I sent an email to the company and they had me a new one within two business days.  I can&#x27;t recommend this light enough!</li>
            <li> Blue and red light therapy is really working for me. I was surprised how powerful the light can be for breakouts and blemishes, my skin is getting brighter and glowing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews often, and it&#x27;s only for the products I&#x27;m wild about.  Here we go: I&#x27;ve been using the light therapy for nearly three months.  The first week I&#x27;d put lotion and oil on and use the lights and after several days it looked like I had sunburn/heat rash.  So I went away from it for it for a good week to let things calm down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then started using it for 20-ish minutes in the morning (dry skin using each color a good 6 minutes), then I&#x27;d wash up and carry on my morning routine.  After a good 2 or 3 weeks the redness and scarring on my cheeks lightened and well, my skin tone is just brighter and more even.  I&#x27;ve had acne prone skin for more than 20 years (food alergies was the main culprit)  and this light has helped my skin look better than ever.  Even if I have a few breakouts, the light clears it up fast and fades the scars quickly, which is unheard of for me.  I&#x27;m going to stick with it, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I do not want to jinx the effects of this product by saying this, but in the month that I have been using this product, it has absolutely transformed my skin!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had trouble skin for over 11 years now. Clogged and enlarged pores, redness and blemishes. I had been getting the professional red/blue light treatments for 250 dollars a session, and although I did see results, I could not afford to do one treatment every week. Using the nightly treatments of Bright Therapy Trident has really tightened my pores, reduced breakouts AND fixed the all over tone of my skin. The only thing I have noticed is that the RED LED is definitely the most effective for me. On the nights I use this, the next day, my skin is just awesome, as opposed to when I use the Blue/Green attachments. Guys, definitely buy this product, it definitely does what it promises and I started seeing results in one week of use.</li>
            <li> This product requires that it is used on each area of your face twice a day.  I don&#x27;t have time to hold this to my face for the time it would take to see a difference.</li>
            <li> This item came with no directions for use.  It came in a thin box, with nothing accompanying the &#x27;system.&#x27;  VERY cheesy, all the way around.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this item does not do anything. It&#x27;s a hand held unit with three different color heads. Once I had this in my hand, I realized it was  impossible for this device to do anything claimed. I still tried it and confirmed to myself it does nothing.</li>
            <li> Finally found the best treatment for hormonal acne &amp; hyperpigmentation!!!!</li>
            <li> Have had great success with a larger infrared LED light unit for the past few weeks, and wanted a more portable version with blue light - the green being a bonus.  Unfortunately the unit only lit up the heads for my initial testing of all 3 heads. Now won&#x27;t charge, and won&#x27;t light up the heads at all. A connectivity problem? Returning as defective. Love the light therapy, hate the fact it worked for less than 24 hours - was hoping for a few months at least.</li>
            <li> First of all this light therapy product is very very bright and works great on my shoulder.  I use the red lens for pain on my shoulder and arm.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but I use for about 10-15 minutes every other day while watching TV and it really helps.  The product is also very well made.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this product!  I wasn&#x27;t necessarily a believer in light therapy until I bought a small, handheld zit zapper that used blue light and heat to treat the pimple.  Well...it worked and was amazing so I bought this!&lt;br /&gt;It is very well made, and the heads can be switched easily.  It is also very light if you are worried about holding your arm up for long periods at a time for treatment.  Everything about this is so easy!  All three of the heads heat up nicely which I like, I find the heat to be very soothing and it makes me sleepy before bedtime.  I use this in front of the tv!&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this for a week but already my little skin issues seem to be soothed and my face seems brighter to me.  I don&#x27;t know what they are, not pimples, but it&#x27;s like a small light rash on the sides of my chin by my mouth that have almost gone away since using this for a week.  No change yet in the tone or fading of old acne spots but overall my skin looks and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> It really works. The green light has helped my dark spots left from my acne and my acne has improved.</li>
            <li> Really skeptical, but desperate - still getting zits at 60.  This has helped dry up the grease, stop new spots in their tracks - and I swear, that red light DOES plump your skin.  Not sure the green is fading anything, but hey....</li>
            <li> I only used this product 3 times before it stopped working. The few times I did use it I found it helped to reduce the discolorations I had from scrapes on my leg and a brown spot on the back on my hand. I recommended it to a friend and then regretted it after it stopped working. It is time consuming and the fact it&#x27;s not cordless is a draw back, but if it hadn&#x27;t stopped working I would say it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;ll give a replacement a second chance but will move on to another brand if it stops working again. Also, there are some grammitical errors in the directions which made me wonder if this is a foreign made product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male in my mid-twenties and have suffered from acne since my late teens. While the acne itself is usually mild (spots clear up in a few days), my skin is easily prone to scarring (actually called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation). Over the last couple years, the number of discolored marks on my face got so bad, it started to affect my self-esteem and even created mild depression for me. I&#x27;ve tried desperately to find solutions (i.e. chemical peels, healthier eating) and nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to research possible LED skin therapy, found this on Amazon and decided it was worth a try. I was not holding out much hope (despite the other positive reviews), as I&#x27;ve been let down so many times before. After only 2 weeks, I can&#x27;t belive the results - all of my marks are considerably faded, so much so that I can look at myself in the mirror and not cringe at any red marks. I can&#x27;t even begin to describe the change in my mood over the past couple of weeks - a couple of people have even asked if I did something to face (meant to be a compliment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone is like me and suffers from acne and post-acne hyperpigmentation, I strongly encourage you to give this a try. I wish I had found this several years back, so as to save myself from the constant stress and depression that I&#x27;ve had to encounter.</li>
            <li> Well, this product works but it is not a miracle cure. I am trying to treat cystic acne that averages out at moderate.  This wand really just gives more leverage to the rest of my regimen (natural cleansers, zinc supplements, immune boosters, glycolic peels, etc.)  I&#x27;m a girl and our processes can give us zinc deficiencies sometimes, but please be careful taking zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I didn&#x27;t have to buy 3 separate wands.  Out of all of the heads, though, I can&#x27;t afford to miss a session or the blue one.  I don&#x27;t really follow the directions.  I concentrate on problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second favorite head is the green. I think it makes my skin chill out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s put it this way: I want to keep this thing because I think it is making a difference.</li>
            <li> I love this device! I bought it to brighten my skin and fade age spots, and to fight wrinkles. But also I have found that the blue lights are curing the acne bacteria I&#x27;ve had on my chin for 25 years! I really think it&#x27;s clearing and skin looks better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the blue &amp; red lights for the past month, and I&#x27;ve noticed clear improvements in stubborn redness and oiliness (I have acne rosacea). Although these improvements aren&#x27;t really drastic, I wear less foundation now.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time , excited I would be getting a good deal (as similar units sell for 2 -3x the cost).  After 56 minutes of use, the product stopped working completely.  Considering the instructions state 24 minutes a day x 7 days x 8 weeks -that is completely unacceptable .  I declined requesting a replacement for fear of receiving a 2nd defective product .</li>
            <li> This light is made well and it seems to be helping my daughters acne! I was afraid she would not take the time to use it since she is only 14, but she does every night while she is lying in bed too go to sleep. She says thecwarmth of the light relaxes her!</li>
            <li> I received the corded model although the product description clearly states the product cordless.  Furthermore, Bright Therapy makes both a corded version and a cordless version of the Trident Light Therapy System.</li>
            <li> I just received it and have been trying it on several clients. I have had many positive feed back on the way that it make the skin feel. This being said I am very happy with the product. I should start doing it to myself to get first hand but haven&#x27;t had time will make another entrance about it later when I do.</li>
            <li> This does not work. DO NOT BUY IT!!! Not only is it hype, mine stopped working just within the 30 days I had in order to return it. I plugged it in the last time it would ever work and it never turned on.  Bad Product. Don&#x27;t waste your money. I read other reviews that said the same thing. Thinking it was just a one-off situation I bought it anyway. Turns out other reviewers&#x27; were right.</li>
            <li> I use all three lights. I had sun damage on my chest and the green light has really lightened them to the point where I don&#x27;t see them anymore. I had treated part of my chest not realizing there was another area which needed treatment as well. The section treated looked SO MUCH Better than the untreated area. Also, I shopped on Ebay and found it cheaper here on Amazon. Not by a lot but with free shipping I saved probably 9 dollars. I shop shop shop before I buy. The other reviews are correct, you must be consistent. I use it everynight while watching TV and it has become my new habit. My husband is now using the green light on his sun damaged face.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Its great! Thank you!! Perfect time, condition and price!!! Recomend it to others!! I will do it again if need it!!</li>
            <li> awesome product!  easy to use.  i like the multiple heads.  helps reduce pain in my hands from crafting.&lt;br /&gt;and the red head made my skin look healthier.  seems to be well made.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend highly!!!!</li>
            <li> I am super happy with this therapy!  First it works perfectly, the bulbs are bright and its built to last!  I use routinely (like 10 minutes or so every other day) to improve rough and patchy skin and my skin is smoother and healthier than it&#x27;s been in years!  I definitely love this therapy!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on others&#x27; great reviews and I would like to thank them! This is the first time I ever used light therapy on my skin, and I&#x27;m so impressed with the results. This product is light weight, easy to operate, and delivers what it promises. I mainly use the red right since I wanted my face to increase collagen production especially I&#x27;m going to be 50 next month. My problem areas are the parallel lines on my forehead and laugh lines around eyes and mouth. I&#x27;m happy to report that the lines on my forehead and around eyes were greatly reduced and my skin has firmed up. I don&#x27;t always have to wear a bang now to cover up my forehead! :-) I also noticed my face is showing a nice glow and complexion has improved. I&#x27;m looking forward to more improvement over the next few months!</li>
            <li> I love this product and am so glad I purchased it! In just a few days it had decreased the wrinkles on my upper lip by about 50%. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for over a month, I think the wrinkles have improved by about 80% on my upper lip. I had tried many lotions and serums with only about a 5% improvement--and I spent more on serums than I spent on this device. I was at a point where my wrinkles were bothering me--I reminded myself of my mother-in-law who had those wrinkles around her mouth. I thought it made me look old and angry! I was contemplating having a series of treatments at a dermatologist that would have cost a couple of thousand dollars, so I&#x27;m SO happy this worked. I almost bought a competitor&#x27;s product that I saw at Sam&#x27;s Club for a slightly lower price, but I did some internet research to find out what the scientific studies showed. What I read said that the light has to be at a certain frequency in order to diminish wrinkles. The competitive product didn&#x27;t have the right frequency, but the Trident does, so I purchased this one. I don&#x27;t get much acne, but when I used the blue light on a spot I had, I did notice improvement in a few days. Mostly I&#x27;ve used the red light. I don&#x27;t use the blinking setting--just the solid. I use it for 9 - 12 minutes just on the area around my mouth. I haven&#x27;t used it on the rest of my face yet. At first I used it every day; now I&#x27;m using it every two or three days. I like the way it feels--the gentle warmth is relaxing. I just use it while I&#x27;m sitting at the computer reading blogs or social media. I haven&#x27;t seen as much benefit with my lower lip and chin as I did with my upper lip--I&#x27;m not sure why. I&#x27;m going to keep using it more on those areas and try my neck and around my eyes as well. I would recommend this product to anyone with fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this device to use on my severe eczema.  After 4 to 6 weeks, in combination with taking vitamin D gelcaps, using the red and blue light really seems to help.  Decided to try it on half my face to see if there was any difference, and after using the red light twice (both pulsating and steady, according to the instructions) I could already see some results, filling in and smoothing a couple stubborn lines and lifting my eyebrow a bit.  Using it on both sides now!  Very pleased with it so far, only gave it 4 stars due to the somewhat flimsy plastic construction.</li>
            <li> I bought this several weeks ago to help minimize dark spots. I took a photo before trying it out. I started by using the red, then the green led light panel on a daily basis.  I circulate each lit panel for around 15 minutes directly on my face. After a few days, my dad comment that my face looked heathier and clearer.  I noticed a glow and more even color by the first week.  I took other photos to compare and I saw improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I decided to use the green panel on my dark elbows and knees.  I used the blue panel behind my ears and on bumps on my upper arms.  The areas have improved and are smoother.  I continue using the Bright Therapy Trident on a weekly basis.  The dark spots on my face have faded and my face looks heathier which makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with skin blemishes during the winter months.  My skin really does well with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  It helps decrease acne.  My skin reacts just like having sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Very time consuming to actually do the treatment.  I usually just focus on areas that are starting to break out as opposed to following the directions that include over 45 minutes of the whole face.</li>
            <li> I Recieved it LATE. When I did recieve it and went to use it...It DIDNT EVEN TURN ON.  Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> I have been using the lights for more than two months .&lt;br /&gt;Light blue has helped me with pimples&lt;br /&gt;I have not seem results even with the red and with the green light&lt;br /&gt;I continue with the treatment because the directions say that 3 months of&lt;br /&gt;Continues use or 7 times a week, as they begin to see the results of these two latest lights  we&#x27;ll see !</li>
            <li> Okay, so I had relatively low hopes for this product, but I&#x27;m a skin care device junkie, and after hearing a lot about LED light therapy I decided to give it a shot.  I wanted to wait a couple of weeks to do my review so I could speak to the results, but the product did arrive on time in perfect condition (it is cordless and rechargeable, unlike a review made by someone else).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks straight now, pretty much every morning.  At first I figured there was no way it could actually be doing anything than just giving me a nice warm glow.  I&#x27;m 39, so lately I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of volume loss in my cheeks and deepening nasolabial folds (ugh).  And in an effort of full disclosure, when I ordered this I also ordered a couple of different serums which I&#x27;ve been using as well, however I&#x27;ve tried pretty much every serum on the market and have never actually seen miraculous results, just softer skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried using the light with serums, but found it would hinder it gliding across my face, so I started using it on a clean dry face after my shower in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And two weeks later, I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never been so impressed.  My cheeks are undeniably fuller, and my nasolabial folds are significantly less noticeable.  And it&#x27;s only been two weeks!!!  I have only used the red light (although I&#x27;ve been meaning to try the green for hyperpigmentation and varicose veins; I&#x27;ll update if I ever get around to it).  My daughter has used the blue light for some acne she&#x27;s been developing as she heads into puberty, and it&#x27;s really helped that too.  I am seriously addicted to this device and only wish I would have started it years ago (incidentally, I&#x27;m getting my mom one for Christmas too... shhhh!).</li>
            <li> This Bright Therapy Trident work perfectly with acne. I could see the result after a few times of using this machine.</li>
            <li> This works! Let me first say that I wash my face once in the morning and again at night with Clean and Clear continuous control, with a facial scrubbing sponge. Second I use this Bright Therapy system once a day and then apply Proactiv advanced blemish treatment. Together my acne has cleared up and become much more manageable. Before I was just washing with clean and clear and using the proactive blemish treatment alone and it did NOTHING for my cystic acne. Once I added this light therapy I got real results. So no, using the light therapy alone may not do, if your acne is severe. I have hormonal cystic acne and have tried everything under the sun.  When I use the blue light for the required 20 minutes per area, my break outs are greatly reduced. The pimple is smaller and doesn&#x27;t become inflamed and turn into a cyst. So I can live with that. The most surprising is how well the green light works at fading dark pigmentation on my face. It&#x27;s wonderful to not have to put fade cream on my sensitive skin and risk more breakouts, the green light does the job and I saw results within one week after daily use. I haven&#x27;t tried the red light.&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE) This product died on me 4 months after purchase! It cost too much not to be a reliable product! CHEAP AND DISAPPOINTING!!! I&#x27;ll try another product from a different company.</li>
            <li> Having only used this product for about three weeks, it is too soon to give it an accurate review.  I can say it is easy to use and not at all uncomfortable having just a bit of a warming sensation.  So far, I have not seen any results, but I will continue to use it as the manufacturer suggests continuous daily treatments as sometimes it takes up to eight weeks to see a result.  It is somewhat time consuming and the treatment is best done while you are watcing t.v., reading, etc.  So, it will take some patience to see if results are forthcoming.</li>
            <li> The blue head definately works to reduce facial oils.  I really need all 3 colors for different things and it is just time consuming to get them all worked in.  I have ended up alternating the red and blue.  Still have acne, no more or less but definately not  the oily shine like I did before.  Seems to be making a mild difference on fine lines and wrinkles too.  Just wish it was quicker.</li>
            <li> This was the best money spent for the variety of skin issues that are on my face and body.  Light weight and easy to use, the  positive effects are noticeable within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know yet as I only have had it for a little over a week</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC, MY FACE AND NECK LOOK GREAT.....DOES GOOD THINGS</li>
            <li> I have been using the green light nearly daily for the past 2-3 weeks. So far I cannot detect any change in my age spots but I will keep trying. Maybe it needs more time. The instructions recommend 8 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Great product easy to use</li>
            <li> Had always wanted to have lazer done on my face. I had the T zone acne with tons of little pustuals on my cheeks along with roscea.Acne scarring and sun spots.I couldn&#x27;t afford lazer and heard about light therapy on tv. I bought this system and it&#x27;s just amazing. I am about 4 weeks into it. Acne is almost gone. Pustuals are almost all dried up! What really amazes me moreis the pore size of years of blackheads and acne. They are so much smaller. Lately i have had so many people make comments on how well my skin looks. I use the blue light mostly and i use it maybe a total of 6 mins. and often forget a day. Because my results are so good i am not starting in with the green light and red light for my deep frown lines. I am 48 and battled acne since a teenager and i have never found anything that has worked. My skin is ALOT less oily also. Give it a try but stay committed. Took a couple weeks before i noticed change! I hope you have the amazing results i have had!</li>
            <li> I used it every night for several weeks.  Did not notice any difference in fine lines.  I&#x27;m going to give it to my daughter for the blue light use, to see if it helps with her acne problem.</li>
            <li> I’m just so excited about the new Cordless BrightThreapy Trident SR11A. I have 3 LED Light Therapy treatments in this 1 little handheld machine!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Red Light Treatments in my area that cost me $99 a month.  Now I have a choice of 3. IN my home. On my schedule. Non-invasive, non-thermal, single frequency light energy. With 3 detachable LED Cluster heads.&lt;br /&gt;The RED &amp; INFRARED treatment head the BT-SR11A is my favorite.  This one tightens your skin and reduces wrinkles, all while tightening your skin. Next up is the BLUE LED treatment head, this one will help you reduce acne and actually heals acne faster by killing the bacteria that causes acne.  Next up is the GREEN LED treatment head, wait, I changed my mind, this one is my favorite! This LED treatment head helps to reduce age spots lightens freckles, and hyper pigmentation!!!  All of that with NO chemicals! BONUS, I can do these treatments while I’m sitting on the couch watching TV. No muss, no fuss.&lt;br /&gt;The Trident’s High Power High Output LEDs will never burnout. They don’t need to be replaced and they are rated at over 10,000 hours of continuous use!!  That’s impressive.  The LED’s are VERY BRIGHT!!  The Red &amp; Infrared SUPER BRIGHT LED treatment head (660nm Red &amp; 880nm Infrared) The Blue SUPER BRIGHT LED Treatment Head (415nm Blue) Last but not least is the Green SUPER BRIGHT LED Treatment Head (525nm Green) The BrightTherapy Trident SR11A Light Therapy is programmable with a 10 minute timer and auto shutoff.&lt;br /&gt;This is one awesome little tool!</li>
            <li> Instructions for use very unclear. I really am frustrated not to be able to use my device properly. A few drawings and non detailed directions, that&#x27;s just not good enough for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> I have, or HAD really ugly freckles on my hands (just like my mom) but this product has lightened them a lot. I don&#x27;t even notice them anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more mom hands! (I just gave my Mom her own for Christmas this year.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help minimize the network of wrinkles that were happening under my eyes. I did not notice the wrinkles getting any better after a couple of sessions, but, what I did notice was the raised wart like bump on my side of nose was shrinking.&lt;br /&gt; So now, close to 3 times a week in the evening, I will do this light therapy with my under eye wrinkle reducing cream. I have noticed  now, that the skin appears thicker and some of the less noticeable wrinkles are faded.  I will continue to use this on my face and on my spider veins.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this light therapy wand.</li>
            <li> loved when it worked. It did help prevent the begining of acne from progressing. It stopped working after 3 1/2 months and now I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Using it for 6 weeks and show a little improvement - not as well as I had hoped but maybe with older skin it does not work as well.  I am 75.</li>
            <li> Bright therapy is an excellent tool  to maintain your skin looking firmed and minimize the appearance of wrinkles. I used it as directed and the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> The only problem I saw with this product, was that it wasn&#x27;t sealed.  I am obsessed with products being sealed if they are labeled brand new.  Call me crazy!  Well, the lights were very bright and strong.  It looks to me that it would work well and based on some of the reviews I read, it works for most people.&lt;br /&gt;The discs and handle felt very cheap and light but I suppose that would help because you have to put the lights on your face for about 20 minutes for each colored light.  The only thing I kept wondering is its safety.  I have researched other light labeled for skincare rejuvenation, whether it is for acne or wrinkles and some of these products were FDA cleared.  This light system, however doesn&#x27;t mention any FDA clearing.  If that doesn&#x27;t really affect you, then I guess this light system would be okay.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and I don&#x27;t use it very often because it takes too long. It does work when I use it though. I just don&#x27;t have the kind of time it takes to do a treatment when a topical solution does about the same thing, so I spent $115 for it to collect dust.</li>
            <li> Hello Ladies,  I will be posting a better review for this product very soon.  However, for now I have tried the product for 3 weeks so far and it really does work.  The only problem I encountered was a toe nail split after using the blue light on my feet.  Which makes sense since the blue light does dry things out.  I had a problem with itching feet for several months so I tried the BrightTherapy Trident SR11A Light Therapy System (blue) on my feet and the itching went away within a few days. I also tried it on some minor acne and that also worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this product I was ready to use it, return it and write a bad review if it didn&#x27;t work.  But it does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked in the sun for many years.  Last year I paid $500.00 for the Obagi skin care system to remove an age spot on my nose and for skin tightnening.  Well Obagi bleached out my whole face except the embarrassing spot on my nose.  It was more noticeable than ever.  Plus with Obagi you are to expect a terrible allergic reaction which last 6 weeks and turns your whole face bright red.  The skin tightening also failed.  I WOULD NEVER USE OBAGI AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However....I &amp;#34;DO&amp;#34; RECOMMEND THE BrightTherapy Trident SR11A Light Therapy System Red Blue Green LED Light therapy system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this BrightTheraphy on my whole face and guess what the embarrassing spot is nearly gone and the rest of my face is not bleached out and there was no bad reaction at all.  Plus this was only $119.00 and can be used for a long time to come and for various issues.  Check back later to see the updates I will be posting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who have groaned that you have to use this produce ever day for the rest of your lives.  Stop groaning you do not have to use this product everyday for the rest of your lives.  You only  have to use it on the days you want results. Try to consider that our mothers didn&#x27;t have this option available to them.</li>
            <li> This bright therapy system that cost a good chunk out your wallet, although it is on sell right now for $120 bucks originally $230 bucks on amazon and if you have prime you get free shipping. This box arrived pretty fast and was already charged a bit, and when I turned it on, it nearly blinded me, I am used to these sorts of things needing to be charged first. These little LED oval shaped lights are very bright and they only get a wee bit warm, and thats about it. This does come with a eye mask cover just in case the light is to bright for you. Each color does something different and stronger. This can also run off the cord giving you more exploring room which &amp;nbsp;is very nice, cause I hate being tied down to beauty products. I like how easy this device can be used and how fast you&#x27;re done using it. This is great for acne, wrinkles, fine lines, or just need some therapy light for your body. This device charges in about a couple of hours fully and can run for days depending how much you use it. I used it twice a day for 20 minutes on my face, fully charged, and it lasted for about 5 days. If you&#x27;re in the market for some nice LED therapy light this is right up your alley. Plus it&#x27;s also known that blue and red lights are great for the skin and sends signals to the brain helping with depression and anxiety!</li>
            <li> I received the Trident Light Therapy System to review free of charge.  At first I wasn’t too sure about this handheld device and did some research on light therapy.  I read an article called, Use Blue and Red Light Therapy for Multiple Skin Care Benefits.  The article talks about how the blue and red light therapy is so beneficial for the skin, where it kills the bacteria and accelerates wound healing.  I was impressed, with what I had read and I also read about the product on Amazon, along with all the reviews.  After reading about it, I decided to give it a try and was very pleased on how it made my skin look.  My skin looks more radiant and youthful, so yes I would have to recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchase this after reading about red light therapy and figured it wasn&#x27;t too expensive to at least give it a try.  I used it according to the directions and have notice very little difference.  When I use the red on my forehead wrinkles, it seems to &amp;#34;iron&amp;#34; them out a little bit.  But eventually, they come back after a day or two.  As for around the &amp;#34;smile&amp;#34; area......well absolutely no improvement.  Mind you, I&#x27;ve used this twice a day, probably for longer than the instructions say to.  So maybe I am doing something wrong.  I&#x27;m in my early forties and have just some slight wrinkles on the forehead and smile lines, but nothing major.  I would have hoped to have seen some slight improvement by now.</li>
            <li> I used the green light on the top of my arms from the elbow down to my wrist to fade the dark spots, freckles, etc.  I did both arms TWICE a day.  Each area got a total of 24 minutes per day for 4 weeks,  After 4 weeks there was absolutely NO change in the appearance of my skin on either arm.  Do not waste your money on this product.  It does not work in the slightest!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the people for whom this device stopped working very shortly after it arrived (a matter of weeks).  It&#x27;s a shame, because there were many things I liked about the unit; it&#x27;s lightweight and therefore easy to use and move over the treatment area, the light heads interchanged easily and attached securely, the unit got warm but only pleasantly so, and the little beeping timer was convenient.  I also saw a visible difference in my skin over the weeks that I used it.&lt;br /&gt;  The problem seemed to have been an internal wiring thing, and for reasons of hygiene, this unit didn&#x27;t really qualify to be returned.  However, Amazon was great about issuing a refund.  I&#x27;ve since replaced this with something from a different company, as I found that LED technology itself did what it promised for me.</li>
            <li> I only used it for 3 days....but I like my high frequency machine better, and my micro needle.  I purchased this for the infrared light and should be more patient but I noticed instant results with micro needling and my hf treatments.</li>
            <li> wife uses it every day.  very good item, would recommend or shall i say my wife would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Do not get this product confused with even coming close to medical grade or spa lighting treatment, as a matter of fact this product is light years away from it. I used this product 1-3 times a wk on each blemished problem area for the amount of time the trident allowed between the extended beeps and still have not seen any results or improvement as a result of usage. :-(</li>
            <li> Amazon says I&#x27;m not able to return this item....can&#x27;t I at least get a replacement? I&#x27;ve used it several times a week for just under 2 months. Loved the results but now when I turn the lights on it shuts off after 5-10 seconds. I really would like to send it back for a replacement!</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my radiation ulcerated area on my chest.  I use the green light and follow with the red light.  I use a couple of times a day and find it is slowly reducing the area affected.  I have had this problem since 2004 and I am hoping in another month or so to finally close this sore.  I also use it to massage my arm with the lymphedema.  Have not had any problem with the system and I use and charge it daily.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. So far it has worked. She hasn&#x27;t yet noticed a big difference in her acne, but it says it can take 8 weeks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this did not work on hormonal acne.  I think it made it even worse, although that could have been coincidence.  I haven&#x27;t tried the other colors though, so I can&#x27;t speak to those.  But it did not seem to have any impact on my acne.  I like to buy beauty gadgets, and after great success with the Silk&#x27;n Hair remover, and the Zeno acne machine, I thought that this Light System would work too.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I just started using it. It&#x27;s too early to see any difference yet. The product did come on time and in working order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about the effectiveness of product but probably not smart to order from a Quantum. Should buy directly from Bright Therapy. Returned as defective. Did not turn on or ever indicate it was being charged after 48 hours</li>
            <li> I am so very pleased with my purchase and quality of item. Also that it came with directions for use,and Eye protection&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Maybe this is too soon to review as I have only used the green light so far.  My experience with it is so great I couldn&#x27;t wait to share.  After 9 days of using the green light on both my face and hands, my sunspots are 50% improved.  Some lighter spots disappeared completely and the darker spots are now light to medium.  I&#x27;m going to continue to use it and eventually use the red light.  I can see where someone with acne or acne dark spots would love this.  I am using it with a cream that has vitamin C in it as suggested by someone, they said it would help to accelerate the cream to work better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this the full 8 weeks so maybe I&#x27;m being a little hasty, but this product has not made a drastic change in my skin. I bought it becauase the reviews seemed so positive but honestly I think it&#x27;s a waste of $98. I&#x27;ve been suffering from mild-moderate adult acne and oily skin for the past few months. While everyone&#x27;s skin is different I recommend trying [[ASIN:B000IOHQ9Q Sircuit Skin Fixzit 0.5 oz.]]for $30 before you spend your money on this like I did - that stuff has worked for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great and do see a change after week or so.</li>
            <li> This device feels very light and flimsy. I expected something with a bit of weight to it, though I suppose if you are holding it up to your face for 20 minutes at a time you my want something light. I like that it has 3 different color heads for different problems. I&#x27;ve used the blue light on my face but noticed very minimal improvement. I&#x27;ve used the red light on my foot that has plantar fasciitis and my doctor said it might help increase blood flow to the area. I guess the biggest drawback of this device is the time commitment to using it, especially if you have more than one area to work on. It does get rather warm too as its working.</li>
            <li> I had a breakout of severe hormonal cystic acne that I was desperately trying to clear up. I used this device diligently twice a day every day for 8 weeks and it didn&#x27;t help at all. I even tried all the colors using multiple colors in one day.</li>
