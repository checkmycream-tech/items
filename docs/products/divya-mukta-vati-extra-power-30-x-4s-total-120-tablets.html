    <ol>
            <li>Thank you  for  very  good  item</li>
            <li>The price was great and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>dose to 2 per day and take my blood pressure tabs with good results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li>Very potent, the way I like it.</li>
            <li>They work better that prescription drugs!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.it works.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff....</li>
            <li>This brand does not seem to be as effective for me as Vita in controlling my HBP.</li>
            <li>Great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Delighted to find there was still some available.</li>
            <li>if used wisely [with a practitioner who can advise how to take this medicine] it can be very useful</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product, as it works as advertised, calming the whole body and feeling good without any side effects.</li>
            <li>On Mukta Vati alone it is lowered to 127 over 75, which is much better.  </li>
            <li>buy  more.</li>
            <li>and I am highly satisfied and will continue until my blood pressure changes.</li>
            <li>This is actually fresher than the bottle form but both work excellent.</li>
            <li>For people who have mild cases of high blood pressure, this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the wait!  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, many thanks for prompt and efficient service.</li>
            <li>Better than High BP.</li>
            <li>They work for her, even though she isn&#x27;t very consistent at taking them  and/or &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; medicine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product arrived promptly and very well packed with additional free samples (soap, tea, ...)</li>
            <li>definitely  worth the  price</li>
            <li>looks fresh.</li>
            <li>You just have to get the dose right for you.  </li>
            <li>I take 2 tablets in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, seems to be just right for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>delivery was quick, I also liked the packaging and tiny peace of soap and couple of aromatic sticks added as extra to the parcel.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Slowing too much of the pulse can be a problem</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li>Based on my own experience as an alternative health care adviser it is the same outstanding quality as the next competitive (IVY) brand for about half of that retail price.</li>
            <li>When I first started taking them, I urinated more for a few days but that effect has gone now.</li>
            <li>I use Mukta Vati to control my high blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>My blood pressure before taking this was as high as 158/125.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone with high blood pressure issues.</li>
            <li>Now headed into normal range.</li>
            <li>If you live in the Netherlands&#x27;do not buy this product;it will be destroyed by the customs.</li>
            <li>I have been using my first bottle since the beginning of April and got this later.</li>
            <li>It has a bitter test but not bad.</li>
            <li>I try to use natural products  when dealing with my health.  </li>
            <li>So far it is doing well</li>
            <li>So far no side effects.i will update the effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a good bp med that wouldn&#x27;t effect my drum playing or my sex drive or some other body function in a negative way.</li>
            <li>A friend that recommended them swears mukta vati returned his blood pressure back to normal years ago</li>
            <li>The main side affect is feeling lethargic, which I got to the extreme, not to mention the earth flavored burps.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

    <ol>
            <li> From 140/90, it came down to 127/80. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Buy these tablets for my mum. They work for her, even though she isn&#x27;t very consistent at taking them  and/or &amp;#34;official&amp;#34; medicine.  A friend that recommended them swears mukta vati returned his blood pressure back to normal years ago and he only takes them once a week now.&lt;br /&gt;The delivery was quick, I also liked the packaging and tiny peace of soap and couple of aromatic sticks added as extra to the parcel.</li>
            <li> Very potent, the way I like it. It &#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product off and on for 2.years. decided to order 90.day supply and take as directed. BP has dropped 40.pts in 2 weeks. Now headed into normal range. I recommend despite some congestion at night. Better than High BP.</li>
            <li> Fabulous.  It doesn&#x27;t make me dizzying and I don&#x27;t have to take a water pill with it. Buy This!</li>
            <li> if used wisely [with a practitioner who can advise how to take this medicine] it can be very useful&lt;br /&gt;Slowing too much of the pulse can be a problem so pay attention</li>
            <li> Mukta Vata Works.  You just have to get the dose right for you.  I took 2 in the morning and 1 at night but I weigh 250lbs so lighter people should need less.  On Dr&#x27;s medications of two blood pressure drugs my pressure is lowered to 140 over 80.  On Mukta Vati alone it is lowered to 127 over 75, which is much better.  They don&#x27;t appear to &amp;#34;interact&amp;#34; and I have found I can lower my Mukta Vata dose to 2 per day and take my blood pressure tabs with good results.  (Why you might ask take the drugs.  The drugs I take are also anti angina.)  Side Effects.  When I first started taking them, I urinated more for a few days but that effect has gone now.</li>
            <li> bought one box worked well got my blood pressure from 150 down to 130.</li>
            <li> If you live in the Netherlands&#x27;do not buy this product;it will be destroyed by the customs.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product, as it works as advertised, calming the whole body and feeling good without any side effects. I take 2 tablets in the morning and 1 in the afternoon, seems to be just right for me.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived promptly and very well packed with additional free samples (soap, tea, ...)</li>
            <li> Amazing product.it works.</li>
            <li> It has lowered my blood pressure but not as well as the Ivy&#x27;s brand. The price was great and it was packaged well. It was shipped from India so it took quite a while to arrive which I knew it would but I can&#x27;t complain. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This brand does not seem to be as effective for me as Vita in controlling my HBP. I may have to go back to my Rx..</li>
            <li> Thank you  for  very  good  item definitely  worth the  price and will  be coming  back  to  buy  more.</li>
            <li> For people who have mild cases of high blood pressure, this is an excellent product. I have ordered this same product four times from Amazon over the past year, and it has always lowered my blood pressure from 170/95, back down to 140/80.</li>
            <li> Hubby was not satisfied,although he didn&#x27;t take it the way he should have,I think it caused him nose bleed. So they are sitting on the shelf.</li>
            <li> 119/67 yesterday!! I am usually between 140/90 and 160/110. NOTHING else has ever worked for me including all those horrible western drugs w their dreadful side effects. NOTHING!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> Based on my own experience as an alternative health care adviser it is the same outstanding quality as the next competitive (IVY) brand for about half of that retail price.</li>
            <li> Delighted to find there was still some available. (Not sure where I&#x27;ll get supplies when this lot has run out.) Meanwhile, many thanks for prompt and efficient service.</li>
            <li> I try to use natural products  when dealing with my health.  I use Mukta Vati to control my high blood pressure.  So far it is doing well and I am highly satisfied and will continue until my blood pressure changes.</li>
            <li> delivered before they promised. looks fresh.Just started taking today. It has a bitter test but not bad. So far no side effects.i will update the effects.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the wait!  They work better that prescription drugs!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help my BP at all. The main side affect is feeling lethargic, which I got to the extreme, not to mention the earth flavored burps.&lt;br /&gt;I would back on my meds.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a good bp med that wouldn&#x27;t effect my drum playing or my sex drive or some other body function in a negative way. My blood pressure before taking this was as high as 158/125. After 3 days of taking this, 2 in the morning and one at night, my bp was at 110/68. All I can say is it works. I have been using my first bottle since the beginning of April and got this later. This is actually fresher than the bottle form but both work excellent. It got my bp regulated so I can pass DOT physical in 3 days time!!! Amazing stuff....</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real. I would recommend it to anyone with high blood pressure issues.</li>
            <li> I got 60 pills in a box, and it should be 120, cheater!</li>
            <li> Great product at a very reasonable price!</li>
