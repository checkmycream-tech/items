            <li>My wife liked how they worked, when they worked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been just as impressed with the Singlepass Twirl as I was with my older molder.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The curls stayed in the entire day too and looked great!!!!</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Better than my 1&amp;#34; and 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I use it way more than my flat iron but am super happy with them both!</li>
            <li>and everything was fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to have my hair grow a little longer for the perfect look with this size.</li>
            <li>It just stopped heating up, although the light indicated it was turned on.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the heat is fully adjustable.</li>
            <li>Amazing iron.&lt;br /&gt;-Makes hair smooth and gives it a nice natural sheen&lt;br /&gt;-Long cord; easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up fast/ stays hot</li>
            <li>Makes beautiful, beachy waves for my super long hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing special about this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Really thought I would love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair is full of volume and shine</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this iron.</li>
            <li>If only I could train my hair to actually hold the gorgeous beachy waves for more than 30 minutes, I&#x27;d be on cloud nine!</li>
            <li>I returned it for a full refund; the refund was quick and easy thanks to amazon</li>
            <li>It did heat up fast and made lovely curls at first.  </li>
            <li>With the T3 not only am I able to quickly produce beautiful curls but my hair is left extremely smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This thing gets hot.</li>
            <li>I tried Conair, Chi, Hot Tools, Babyliss and with every material (titanium, ceramic,tourmaline, etc.).</li>
            <li>I actually purchased the T3 single pass flat iron first and was so impressed I purchased the curling version.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up very quickly, in less than a minute, and creates beautiful curls that last.</li>
            <li>It is not damaging to my long, thick hair and the results are perfect.</li>
            <li>I have been a flat iron chi person for years but was looking for another quick way to produce nice loose curls.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I leave the iron on the normal setting (2 dots) and within 7 seconds, each strand of hair is curled!</li>
            <li>Love this curling iron, but you must be careful not to get it close to the scalp or your ears!</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid place and the curls stay in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Compared to my old revlon curling iron, this one is lightweight and does an amazing job curling my hair in half the time!</li>
            <li>but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it is totally worth the money especially if you buy from amazon.</li>
            <li>I was a little scared cuz some of the comments said it wasn&#x27;t worth the money, didn&#x27;t heat up quickly, etc.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>After my (6+ years) old T3 Twirl curling iron died after an encounter with a faulty electrical adapter on a trip to Europe, I didn&#x27;t even think twice about ordering this new version.</li>
            <li>two busy.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Curls hair really fast; short rebound time in between curls&lt;</li>
            <li>br /&gt;-Larger barrel, gives you Kim Kardashian hair/ natural beach waves</li>
            <li>All round worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for soft, bouncy curls that last.</li>
            <li>I finally decided on this particular one</li>
            <li>They all left my hair dry, frizzy, and my hair rarely held the curl.</li>
            <li>But, they offered to accept them back and give a 50% discount on a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me a few years to find the right curling iron that actually holds my hair.</li>

            <li> Bought a t3 less than a year ago, only use it occasionally. It just stopped heating up, although the light indicated it was turned on.  Sephora would not replace it or give me any store credit because they no longer carried that model, but that&#x27;s another review.  Called t3 customer service and was placed on hold for 15 or 20 minutes, then informed by a recording that I needed to leave a voicemail as they were two busy. This happened TWO times.  Crappy product and crappy customer service.</li>
            <li> I purchased Aug. 2014 and everything was fine. I used it quite often and never dropped. but it quit working today.  I did not even have for one year. I will purchase another brand.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and now it won&#x27;t turn on at all.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a ceramic tourmaline curling iron that wouldn&#x27;t damage my hair and read about the t3 hair styling tools so decided to give this a try! I love it. Compared to my old revlon curling iron, this one is lightweight and does an amazing job curling my hair in half the time! I leave the iron on the normal setting (2 dots) and within 7 seconds, each strand of hair is curled! The curls stayed in the entire day too and looked great!!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little scared cuz some of the comments said it wasn&#x27;t worth the money, didn&#x27;t heat up quickly, etc. but I found this to heat my hair perfectly! I love this and it is totally worth the money especially if you buy from amazon. I can&#x27;t wait to have my hair grow a little longer for the perfect look with this size.</li>
            <li> Makes beautiful, beachy waves for my super long hair. Better than my 1&amp;#34; and 2&amp;#34; irons, it&#x27;s the perfect compromise. If only I could train my hair to actually hold the gorgeous beachy waves for more than 30 minutes, I&#x27;d be on cloud nine!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron, but you must be careful not to get it close to the scalp or your ears! I&#x27;ve made the mistake of burning the tops of my ears several times, and yowza! This thing gets hot. Fortunately, the heat is fully adjustable. I only wish this came in a 1&amp;#34; size as well. I would highly recommend it for soft, bouncy curls that last. It leaves your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Amazing iron.&lt;br /&gt;-Makes hair smooth and gives it a nice natural sheen&lt;br /&gt;-Long cord; easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;-Heats up fast/ stays hot&lt;br /&gt;-Curls hair really fast; short rebound time in between curls&lt;br /&gt;-Larger barrel, gives you Kim Kardashian hair/ natural beach waves&lt;br /&gt;- Hair never feels damaged after&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> After my (6+ years) old T3 Twirl curling iron died after an encounter with a faulty electrical adapter on a trip to Europe, I didn&#x27;t even think twice about ordering this new version. I&#x27;ve been just as impressed with the Singlepass Twirl as I was with my older molder. The iron heats up very quickly, in less than a minute, and creates beautiful curls that last.</li>
            <li> These stopped working after two uses.  My wife liked how they worked, when they worked.  T3 does not warranty anything purchased outside of their site.  But, they offered to accept them back and give a 50% discount on a new one.  Too bad it is 50% off list price ($99).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing special about this curling iron. Doesn&#x27;t get hotter than the others or hold my curls longer, I discovered that the hair spray makes a bigger difference than the iron. I kept it because I needed one and it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed. Did not hold curls even after sprayed with products and started to fall before I left the house within an hour. I returned it for a full refund; the refund was quick and easy thanks to amazon</li>
            <li> I have only had this curling iron for a few weeks but so far I really like it. It leaves my hair shiny &amp; I&#x27;ve received several compliments on my hair since using it.</li>
            <li> Curling Iron keeps shutting off while in use.</li>
            <li> This iron did not work after 5 uses.  I switched to another brand. I don&#x27;t feel it was a quality product for cutting out after so short a time.</li>
            <li> Really thought I would love this curling iron.  It did heat up fast and made lovely curls at first.  After about a month or so I noticed a burnt smell whenever I used it, like burning plastic or something but never noticed anything on it melting.  Unfortunately I was using it last week to style hair for some bridesmaids when the spring mechanism on the clamp just broke off mid curl.  So now it is pretty useless unless I choose to use it as a wand, which is not what I want.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the brand or if I got a dud, either way won&#x27;t be purchasing or recommending again.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It is not damaging to my long, thick hair and the results are perfect. It&#x27;s taken me a few years to find the right curling iron that actually holds my hair. I live in a very humid place and the curls stay in place throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have been researching curling irons for a very long time. I finally decided on this particular one and I love it. I get my long hair styled in 15 minutes. The curl last 2 days and my hair has a lot of shine. My hair is full of volume and shine and I do not use any styling products to get the result. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this iron.</li>
            <li> Wow! I wish I had started with this one! I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;ve tried every curling iron out there before I found this one. I have been a flat iron chi person for years but was looking for another quick way to produce nice loose curls. I tried Conair, Chi, Hot Tools, Babyliss and with every material (titanium, ceramic,tourmaline, etc.). They all left my hair dry, frizzy, and my hair rarely held the curl. With the T3 not only am I able to quickly produce beautiful curls but my hair is left extremely smooth and soft. A bonus is that the clip doesn&#x27;t make it feel like I&#x27;m pulling my hair out of my head but yet my hair also doesn&#x27;t slip out. All round worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron! I have very long, very thick blonde hair and I curl it almost every morning. I actually purchased the T3 single pass flat iron first and was so impressed I purchased the curling version. I HATE clampless wands and was looking for a big barrel and this is it! I use it way more than my flat iron but am super happy with them both!</li>
