            <li>That has proven to be the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tip: For best results, spray your mouth with some water when you apply the gel.</li>
            <li>I find it works best after I brush my teeth and use mouth wash.</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>

            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>This has been a great product for him.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended it, and I am so happy to have found it on Amazon.  </li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>IS WELCOME</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>Biotene has a pleasant taste and does the job -</li>
            <li>The taste, however, is not all that good.</li>
            <li>and I am good until morning.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>ALL THESE PRODUCTS ARE QUITE GOOD.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>delivered in good condition</li>
            <li>and reapply the Oral Balance to keep my mouth in good shape til I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>This is no way to get a good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li>excellent product, well priced and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to find it here, and at a better price.</li>
            <li>Many docs neglect oral health issues for their patients!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and did exactly what it claims it will do.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE TRIED THE ORAL BALANCE SPRAY, BUT HAVE FOUND THE GEL MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL.  </li>
            <li>Great Product and Very Quick Arrival&lt;</li>
            <li>Users can now rely on this spectacular delivery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and nothing comes close to being as effective as Biotene oral gel.  </li>
            <li>I have used and loved Biotene Oral Balance for many years.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it effective for extended use during the day, but at night it&#x27;s irreplaceable.</li>
            <li>If you can stand it, it&#x27;s an effective treatment.</li>
            <li>It has a good flavor as well, I strongly recommend this as a cushion.</li>
            <li>However, the gel can be handy to bring with you, if you won&#x27;t be able to use the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Im so happy to have found this product for her at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>With Oral Balance, it lasts for many hours</li>
            <li>I have tried many others and they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It is used in conjunction with a bPap machine and makes for greater comfort.</li>
            <li>This Biotene gel product works much better than the Biotene mouthwash, for overnight use.</li>
            <li>It helps disperse the gel better.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li>I use a CPAP for &#x27;safe&#x27; sleeping &amp; with Oral Balance my nights are much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most all of the relieving aids on Amazon &amp; drug stores.</li>
            <li>If I use a bit more I wake up with the gel blocking my windpipe 3 to 4 times</li>
            <li>I even told them I&#x27;d pay more for it, but it falls on deaf ears.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the gum do to complications from radiation,not being able to chew gum.  </li>
            <li>The Orajel product has a better tasting mint flavor and works as well.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it was available in a pack of 3</li>
            <li>This gel helps soothe my mouth and feel much better.</li>
            <li>Many of us have written to the company.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep if it wasn&#x27;t for Biotene Oral Balance Gel.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have to add more words to this review</li>
            <li>I can use Oral Balance &amp; have blessed relief for quite some time before I need to use more.  </li>
            <li>She used to be able to find it here in Sao Paulo - Brazil, but all of a sundden it was out of stock.</li>
            <li>Now the company has changed the formula so many times that this product no longer does what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS - 15 YEARS OR MORE.  </li>
            <li>She loves the taste and often asked for more.</li>
            <li>This has to be the most repulsive feeling thing, I have ever placed in my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keping my mouth moist and preventing many dental</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this more than the toothpaste, made mouth feel better immediately.</li>
            <li>If you have dry mouth, this is the best product.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product to date, that I have found for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful for dry mouth people at night.</li>
            <li>I think that Biotene&#x27;s best product for dry mouth is their mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>The porceço is much better than in Brazil and teconologia is the most advanced.</li>
            <li>This product has  made my mother very happy as she has &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; due to Sjrogren&#x27;s syndrome.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other products and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>and it is not always easy to find at drugstores</li>
            <li>this toothpaste as it is easy on the inside of mouth and</li>
            <li>EASY TO APPLY.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the older version for some time and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Barely... the longest I&#x27;ve ever experienced was 3 hrs max...</li>
            <li>ver nice price and exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li>Very good as a remedy for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>The product is fine.  </li>
            <li>Patients can rest assured, because the delivery is accurate.</li>
            <li>Sugar free gum during the day helps and at night, when I awake, I apply Biotene Gel around my gums.  </li>
            <li>This WAS such a Great Product.</li>
            <li>Coupons are often available,  &amp; the Subscribe &amp; Save Amazon offer is also helpful, as the gel can be costly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sugar free.  </li>
            <li>This is an effective gel that is great to have on hand when water is not available or practical to use.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone interested.</li>
            <li>and they tell me they are NO LONGER producing the original formula.</li>
            <li>Originally this product helped me.  </li>
            <li>Classic story, one company buys out a competitor, takes a good product and changes it into a higher profit product by changing the formula and hoping no one will notice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works great in combination with the Biotene spray for heavy-duty dry mouth</li>
            <li>Both are great items for dry mouth sufferers.</li>
            <li>fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
            <li>it works well, but needs a special rinse in the morning..</li>
            <li>It is sort of minty, but more of a medicinal mint taste rather than a real mint taste.</li>
            <li>I am a CPAP patient and wear the full face mask every night to sleep.</li>
            <li>It is like getting a finger full of Vaseline or congealed hamburger grease and putting it in your mouth to spread around with your tongue.</li>
            <li>I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine with a full face mask.  </li>
            <li>and I must wear a full face mask that covers both my nose and mouth while using my BiPap continuous air flow respirator.  </li>
            <li>Were it not for these defects I would have rated this product 5-star because it was the only one whose use allowed me to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>Everything was perfect, as usual!</li>
            <li>My filled teeth also hurt all the time, because of the fillings being right close to my nerve</li>
            <li>The treatment was successful, but a side affect of radiation is dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I had been using the Biotene spray as it is quick &amp; minty, not bad compared to the alternative.</li>
            <li>It was a quick fix for pain along my gum line throughout the course of treatment.</li>
            <li>It quickly becomes liquefied when applied; does not coat the tongue as well; at times, it drains into my windpipe/throat</li>
            <li>Instead it now causes a mild burning sensation on my tongue and dries out my mouth.  </li>
            <li>We appreciate the quick order fulfillment.  </li>
            <li>The old formulation was not only soothing, but contained many enzymes that are found in saliva, so it was good for my mouth as well.  </li>
            <li>the taste is mild and as it is good for dry mouth and works.....</li>
            <li>I have had it on my tonsils and have it start to burn so much that I have strong uncontrollable coughing for hours.</li>
            <li>It has worked really good for my dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li>It  worked well the first time and continues to do so !  </li>
            <li>I sometimes have a hard time getting it so the subscription with Amazon works very good for me.</li>
            <li>This is the only one which seems to effective.</li>
            <li>Now I use Orajel (which is nowhere near as good as the old formula Oral Balance, but far better than this).</li>
            <li>Other Biotene products haven&#x27;t helped me, but this one is good.</li>
            <li>The product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li>Well I threw up the first time I used it, but then after a while I realized it kind of taste like red apples.  </li>
            <li>This product really provides a good amount of dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li>It is much more effective than sucking on hard candies.</li>
            <li>effective for dry mouth and sore mucosa of mouth</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a nice job with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re able to talk longer and more clearly which is particularly good when you&#x27;re trying to explain complicated points to people who are interested but have no background knowledge.  </li>
            <li>They have changed the formula, and this new version is nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li>as many drugstores don&#x27;t have enough in stock.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended by my dentist after my first visit in years with a cavity.  </li>
            <li>I slept like a baby the first night using it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fortunately, using the subscription service makes this more affordable than what I have seen recently in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to the dentist after I started using OralBalance gel</li>
            <li>SO sleeping better and improved tooth and gum health is a definite bonus!</li>
            <li>I told her that I take many medications and a couple are pain pills for my lower back pain.</li>
            <li>Water is okay, but it only quenches until you swallow, right??&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking some medicine that creates a wicked dry-mouth (even while I&#x27;m drinking water you feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I love all the Biotene products especially the toothpaste and mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this product I did not use it as directed.  </li>
            <li>Once more, its expiration date was well into the future</li>
            <li>I have to love it, as it&#x27;s the only product on the market that helps keep my tongue &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;, which means, it keeps</li>
            <li>She used to be able to find it in her local walmart, cvs, walgreens</li>
            <li>If buying in a larger quanity would reduce the price I would be glad to buy</li>
            <li>Great for those who have dry mouth problems, especially those of us with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li>This product diminishes the effect of dry mouth and enhances the ability to produce saliva that is vital to good oral health.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s so right it really helps.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the only thing that can effectively keep my mouth from drying out completely at nighttime.  </li>
            <li>My next check-up was clean!</li>
            <li>It keeps my gums moistened and feeling good - no more &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten by for many years with a condition called dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BEEN TAKING MEDICATIONS FOR MANY YEARS AND SUFFERED DRY MOUTH.</li>
            <li>But, my level of dry mouth may be more severe than others.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective as long as you keep your mouth closed and don&#x27;t swallow much.  </li>
            <li>My wife has a very dry mouth and has tried many things to help.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product after all the stellar reviews.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Much sleep improvement as a result.</li>
            <li>No matter how much water I drank, my mouth remained very unconformably dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While it helped, the relief was very short-lived (about 30 to 60 minutes at best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>in fact i am about ready to reorder this product again soon</li>
            <li>He has really noticed an improvement with the use of this gel when he sleeps.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much that I could tell</li>
            <li>thanks biotene for all your products.</li>
            <li>I get the impression that the company really doesn&#x27;t care, whether it helps or not.</li>
            <li>can use it absolutely  the 100% of it</li>
            <li>This stuff really worked.  </li>
            <li>If you find a product that really works</li>
            <li>Anyway, this works really well</li>
            <li>so I used twice as much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a three because I don&#x27;t really think this helped my drymouth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much happier with the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>is a real problem for people who have gone through radiation treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so ordering this online is much easier.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>IT IS.. THANKS</li>
            <li>I use as directed just before I am ready to go to sleep.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper on this site.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>My dentist wants me to use Biotene Oral Balance Gel.</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for at least 20-30 minutes without me having to reach for my water bottle every couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>due to adnoid cystic carsenoma most of my salivary glands have been removed.</li>
            <li>The tube from my last order was significantly different and much less effective than the Biotene gels I had relied on for many years.  </li>
            <li>The gel is easy to use &amp; helps me avoid dry mouth throughout the night.</li>
            <li>[it really has such a mild hint of taste, that it shouldn&#x27;t stop you].</li>
            <li>Got the wrong one, the liquid is way better and tastes better.</li>
            <li>Different products work for different folks, and it&#x27;s much better that you spend the money to determine if this is the miracle product that works for you.</li>
            <li>having put up with a dry mouth for a long time, I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly approve.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>The price was high.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with the Biotene toothpaste, and mouthwash which I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Is now very runny and has a more minty flavor which actually burns my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Once we administer a little of this gel, she is able to close her mouth and swallow.  </li>
            <li>As far as a mint flavor, about as much as ABC gum.</li>
            <li>the only really good overnight mouth moisturizer is no more.</li>
            <li>Being a gel I thought that the product would be very long lasting as it would stay in the mouth better.</li>
            <li>Dry mouth is a problem for many people ---especially during the night.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>The next time I bought it, the company changed the formula and it was much less effective.  </li>
            <li>As a diabetic with four prescriptions and sometimes more, this is the only dry mouth product that works through the night.  </li>
            <li>I love the Biotene Oral Balance Gel, especially when I wake up at night and my mouth is so dry.  </li>
            <li>I emailed them to ask it if had been discontinued and they replied right away that it would be back in stock at the end of February.</li>
            <li>So, before removing my eyeglasses &amp; fluffing my pillows at night, I squeeze less than a pinkie fingernails worth out right on to my tongue &amp; manipulate it all along my gum-line</li>
            <li>When I want a super clean feel with less plaque, I mix some regular toothpaste in with the biotene toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not sure about this one yet, seems ok</li>
            <li>Sometimes this is not always convenient, especially when sleeping and this works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>Before retiring I apply a small drop to my tongue and coat the areas that bother me most.  </li>
            <li>I did not believe that such a small amount would be effective</li>
            <li>This product is very hard to fine in local stores, so I have ordered multiple packs twice now from Amazon and been pleased.</li>
            <li>I use the gel twice a day along with other Biotene products and my dry mouth condition is much better.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the tubes were only 1.5 oz., guess I&#x27;ll have  to read more carefully in the future.</li>
            <li>and I had to use them frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and find that it works very well.  </li>
            <li>I tried the spray version that Biotene offers to use during the day, but I didn&#x27;t care for the taste.</li>
            <li>Well, thousands have noticed and there are whole compaigns in the autoimmune community to get them to change it back..</li>
            <li>I (used to) use this product every night for dryness related to Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, and it was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Took several weeks to really notice the improvement.</li>
            <li>Will the Amazon company PLEASE stop using the picture of the old formula Biotene oral balance gel in your ads for this product.</li>
            <li>Just tried it one day and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>so there is no concern about receiving an old product.</li>
            <li>really works well especially during the night.</li>
            <li>Product is good but too expensive on line when you can buy in stores for  $8.95 when they have it in stock.</li>
            <li>then tried a variety of rinses from other brands, but none really helped much.</li>
            <li>The last one I bought was the NEW improved version.  </li>
            <li>I recently began having &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; caused by a new medication.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for me in helping to control dry mouth caused by medications.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li>Have a history of dry mouth for years, and Oral Balance really does help alot.</li>
            <li>I use this at night and it works very well, especially because I sleep with my mouth open regretfully.</li>
            <li>I get canker sores, irritation, discomfort and major dryness when I wake up.  </li>
            <li>I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shameful it is that the new formulation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth.</li>
            <li>I hope I have helped at least a couple of people understand how important this is.</li>
            <li>Generally it eases my symptoms till morning.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I wish my regular doctor would have warned me when I started the medications.</li>
            <li>I found the product helped a tiny bit when I applied it with a q-tip directly on my gums vs. putting it on my tonge like suggested and licking where i wanted it.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this product for dry mouth.</li>
            <li>the biotene products are the only ones that really give me relief from dry mouth.</li>
            <li>My dentist recommended this for dry mouth I get from asthma medications; it really works well for me, especially overnight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only one that really provided hours of relief from dry mouth was Biotene Oral Balance Gel.</li>
            <li>My dentist said that when the mouth is dry, then the bacteria, that is normally washed away by saliva, starts to attack the gums &amp; wreak havoc on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I usually order a significant quantity so that I won&#x27;t run short.</li>
            <li>Amazingly just that mere 1/2 inch of gel works wonders at coating the entire mouth and providing the comfort and ingredients needed for saliva to be produced.  </li>
            <li>I still wake up with a dry mouth only now it is also full of this gooey dried stuff.</li>
            <li>Due to prescriptions and sleep apnea my mouth always feels hot and dry.  </li>
            <li>All of my cavities were right on the gumline, as opposed to the usual sides of the teeth.</li>
            <li>She does no produce saliva naturally and her mouth and tongue tends to dry.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t stress enough to use it along with all other Biotene products as directed.  </li>
            <li>I really hope they revert back to the previous version--</li>
            <li>Especially considering how much comfort one can achieve with so little effort.</li>
            <li>I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found that other users got the same issues when I checked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> That has proven to be the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip: For best results, spray your mouth with some water when you apply the gel.</li>
            <li> I find it works best after I brush my teeth and use mouth wash.</li>

            <li> Great product.  </li>

            <li> IS WELCOME</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Biotene has a pleasant taste and does the job -</li>
            <li> The taste, however, is not all that good.</li>
            <li> and I am good until morning.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> ALL THESE PRODUCTS ARE QUITE GOOD.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> delivered in good condition</li>
            <li> and reapply the Oral Balance to keep my mouth in good shape til I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> This is no way to get a good night&#x27;s sleep</li>
            <li> excellent product, well priced and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> so I am happy to find it here, and at a better price.</li>
            <li> Many docs neglect oral health issues for their patients!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and did exactly what it claims it will do.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE TRIED THE ORAL BALANCE SPRAY, BUT HAVE FOUND THE GEL MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL.  </li>
            <li> Great Product and Very Quick Arrival&lt;</li>
            <li> Users can now rely on this spectacular delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and nothing comes close to being as effective as Biotene oral gel.  </li>
            <li> I have used and loved Biotene Oral Balance for many years.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it effective for extended use during the day, but at night it&#x27;s irreplaceable.</li>
            <li> If you can stand it, it&#x27;s an effective treatment.</li>
            <li> It has a good flavor as well, I strongly recommend this as a cushion.</li>
            <li> However, the gel can be handy to bring with you, if you won&#x27;t be able to use the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Im so happy to have found this product for her at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> With Oral Balance, it lasts for many hours</li>
            <li> I have tried many others and they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It is used in conjunction with a bPap machine and makes for greater comfort.</li>
            <li> This Biotene gel product works much better than the Biotene mouthwash, for overnight use.</li>
            <li> It helps disperse the gel better.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found anything better.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP for &#x27;safe&#x27; sleeping &amp; with Oral Balance my nights are much better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most all of the relieving aids on Amazon &amp; drug stores.</li>
            <li> If I use a bit more I wake up with the gel blocking my windpipe 3 to 4 times</li>
            <li> I even told them I&#x27;d pay more for it, but it falls on deaf ears.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the gum do to complications from radiation,not being able to chew gum.  </li>
            <li> The Orajel product has a better tasting mint flavor and works as well.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if it was available in a pack of 3</li>
            <li> This gel helps soothe my mouth and feel much better.</li>
            <li> Many of us have written to the company.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep if it wasn&#x27;t for Biotene Oral Balance Gel.  </li>
            <li> Well, I have to add more words to this review</li>
            <li> I can use Oral Balance &amp; have blessed relief for quite some time before I need to use more.  </li>
            <li> She used to be able to find it here in Sao Paulo - Brazil, but all of a sundden it was out of stock.</li>
            <li> Now the company has changed the formula so many times that this product no longer does what it is advertised to do.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS - 15 YEARS OR MORE.  </li>
            <li> She loves the taste and often asked for more.</li>
            <li> This has to be the most repulsive feeling thing, I have ever placed in my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keping my mouth moist and preventing many dental</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this more than the toothpaste, made mouth feel better immediately.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth, this is the best product.  </li>
            <li> This is the best product to date, that I have found for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for dry mouth people at night.</li>
            <li> I think that Biotene&#x27;s best product for dry mouth is their mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> The porceço is much better than in Brazil and teconologia is the most advanced.</li>
            <li> This product has  made my mother very happy as she has &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; due to Sjrogren&#x27;s syndrome.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other products and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> and it is not always easy to find at drugstores</li>
            <li> this toothpaste as it is easy on the inside of mouth and</li>
            <li> EASY TO APPLY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the older version for some time and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Barely... the longest I&#x27;ve ever experienced was 3 hrs max...</li>
            <li> ver nice price and exactly what i wanted.  </li>
            <li> Very good as a remedy for dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> The product is fine.  </li>
            <li> Patients can rest assured, because the delivery is accurate.</li>
            <li> Sugar free gum during the day helps and at night, when I awake, I apply Biotene Gel around my gums.  </li>
            <li> This WAS such a Great Product.</li>
            <li> Coupons are often available,  &amp; the Subscribe &amp; Save Amazon offer is also helpful, as the gel can be costly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sugar free.  </li>
            <li> This is an effective gel that is great to have on hand when water is not available or practical to use.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone interested.</li>
            <li> and they tell me they are NO LONGER producing the original formula.</li>
            <li> Originally this product helped me.  </li>
            <li> Classic story, one company buys out a competitor, takes a good product and changes it into a higher profit product by changing the formula and hoping no one will notice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works great in combination with the Biotene spray for heavy-duty dry mouth</li>
            <li> Both are great items for dry mouth sufferers.</li>
            <li> fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
            <li> it works well, but needs a special rinse in the morning..</li>
            <li> It is sort of minty, but more of a medicinal mint taste rather than a real mint taste.</li>
            <li> I am a CPAP patient and wear the full face mask every night to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is like getting a finger full of Vaseline or congealed hamburger grease and putting it in your mouth to spread around with your tongue.</li>
            <li> I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine with a full face mask.  </li>
            <li> and I must wear a full face mask that covers both my nose and mouth while using my BiPap continuous air flow respirator.  </li>
            <li> Were it not for these defects I would have rated this product 5-star because it was the only one whose use allowed me to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect, as usual!</li>
            <li> My filled teeth also hurt all the time, because of the fillings being right close to my nerve</li>
            <li> The treatment was successful, but a side affect of radiation is dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Biotene spray as it is quick &amp; minty, not bad compared to the alternative.</li>
            <li> It was a quick fix for pain along my gum line throughout the course of treatment.</li>
            <li> It quickly becomes liquefied when applied; does not coat the tongue as well; at times, it drains into my windpipe/throat</li>
            <li> Instead it now causes a mild burning sensation on my tongue and dries out my mouth.  </li>
            <li> We appreciate the quick order fulfillment.  </li>
            <li> The old formulation was not only soothing, but contained many enzymes that are found in saliva, so it was good for my mouth as well.  </li>
            <li> the taste is mild and as it is good for dry mouth and works.....</li>
            <li> I have had it on my tonsils and have it start to burn so much that I have strong uncontrollable coughing for hours.</li>
            <li> It has worked really good for my dry mouth problem.</li>
            <li> It  worked well the first time and continues to do so !  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have a hard time getting it so the subscription with Amazon works very good for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only one which seems to effective.</li>
            <li> Now I use Orajel (which is nowhere near as good as the old formula Oral Balance, but far better than this).</li>
            <li> Other Biotene products haven&#x27;t helped me, but this one is good.</li>
            <li> The product arrived right on time.</li>
            <li> Well I threw up the first time I used it, but then after a while I realized it kind of taste like red apples.  </li>
            <li> This product really provides a good amount of dry mouth relief.</li>
            <li> It is much more effective than sucking on hard candies.</li>
            <li> effective for dry mouth and sore mucosa of mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a nice job with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re able to talk longer and more clearly which is particularly good when you&#x27;re trying to explain complicated points to people who are interested but have no background knowledge.  </li>
            <li> They have changed the formula, and this new version is nothing like the original.  </li>
            <li> as many drugstores don&#x27;t have enough in stock.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended by my dentist after my first visit in years with a cavity.  </li>
            <li> I slept like a baby the first night using it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, using the subscription service makes this more affordable than what I have seen recently in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to the dentist after I started using OralBalance gel</li>
            <li> SO sleeping better and improved tooth and gum health is a definite bonus!</li>
            <li> I told her that I take many medications and a couple are pain pills for my lower back pain.</li>
            <li> Water is okay, but it only quenches until you swallow, right??&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking some medicine that creates a wicked dry-mouth (even while I&#x27;m drinking water you feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> I love all the Biotene products especially the toothpaste and mouth rinse.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this product I did not use it as directed.  </li>
            <li> Once more, its expiration date was well into the future</li>
            <li> I have to love it, as it&#x27;s the only product on the market that helps keep my tongue &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;, which means, it keeps</li>
            <li> She used to be able to find it in her local walmart, cvs, walgreens</li>
            <li> If buying in a larger quanity would reduce the price I would be glad to buy</li>
            <li> Great for those who have dry mouth problems, especially those of us with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome.</li>
            <li> This product diminishes the effect of dry mouth and enhances the ability to produce saliva that is vital to good oral health.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s so right it really helps.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only thing that can effectively keep my mouth from drying out completely at nighttime.  </li>
            <li> My next check-up was clean!</li>
            <li> It keeps my gums moistened and feeling good - no more &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten by for many years with a condition called dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN TAKING MEDICATIONS FOR MANY YEARS AND SUFFERED DRY MOUTH.</li>
            <li> But, my level of dry mouth may be more severe than others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective as long as you keep your mouth closed and don&#x27;t swallow much.  </li>
            <li> My wife has a very dry mouth and has tried many things to help.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after all the stellar reviews.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Much sleep improvement as a result.</li>
            <li> No matter how much water I drank, my mouth remained very unconformably dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> While it helped, the relief was very short-lived (about 30 to 60 minutes at best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> in fact i am about ready to reorder this product again soon</li>
            <li> He has really noticed an improvement with the use of this gel when he sleeps.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much that I could tell</li>
            <li> thanks biotene for all your products.</li>
            <li> I get the impression that the company really doesn&#x27;t care, whether it helps or not.</li>
            <li> can use it absolutely  the 100% of it</li>
            <li> This stuff really worked.  </li>
            <li> If you find a product that really works</li>
            <li> Anyway, this works really well</li>
            <li> so I used twice as much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a three because I don&#x27;t really think this helped my drymouth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much happier with the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> is a real problem for people who have gone through radiation treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so ordering this online is much easier.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> IT IS.. THANKS</li>
            <li> I use as directed just before I am ready to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on this site.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to use Biotene Oral Balance Gel.</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for at least 20-30 minutes without me having to reach for my water bottle every couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> due to adnoid cystic carsenoma most of my salivary glands have been removed.</li>
            <li> The tube from my last order was significantly different and much less effective than the Biotene gels I had relied on for many years.  </li>
            <li> The gel is easy to use &amp; helps me avoid dry mouth throughout the night.</li>
            <li> [it really has such a mild hint of taste, that it shouldn&#x27;t stop you].</li>
            <li> Got the wrong one, the liquid is way better and tastes better.</li>
            <li> Different products work for different folks, and it&#x27;s much better that you spend the money to determine if this is the miracle product that works for you.</li>
            <li> having put up with a dry mouth for a long time, I am thrilled with this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly approve.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> The price was high.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the Biotene toothpaste, and mouthwash which I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Is now very runny and has a more minty flavor which actually burns my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Once we administer a little of this gel, she is able to close her mouth and swallow.  </li>
            <li> As far as a mint flavor, about as much as ABC gum.</li>
            <li> the only really good overnight mouth moisturizer is no more.</li>
            <li> Being a gel I thought that the product would be very long lasting as it would stay in the mouth better.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is a problem for many people ---especially during the night.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The next time I bought it, the company changed the formula and it was much less effective.  </li>
            <li> As a diabetic with four prescriptions and sometimes more, this is the only dry mouth product that works through the night.  </li>
            <li> I love the Biotene Oral Balance Gel, especially when I wake up at night and my mouth is so dry.  </li>
            <li> I emailed them to ask it if had been discontinued and they replied right away that it would be back in stock at the end of February.</li>
            <li> So, before removing my eyeglasses &amp; fluffing my pillows at night, I squeeze less than a pinkie fingernails worth out right on to my tongue &amp; manipulate it all along my gum-line</li>
            <li> When I want a super clean feel with less plaque, I mix some regular toothpaste in with the biotene toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one yet, seems ok</li>
            <li> Sometimes this is not always convenient, especially when sleeping and this works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> Before retiring I apply a small drop to my tongue and coat the areas that bother me most.  </li>
            <li> I did not believe that such a small amount would be effective</li>
            <li> This product is very hard to fine in local stores, so I have ordered multiple packs twice now from Amazon and been pleased.</li>
            <li> I use the gel twice a day along with other Biotene products and my dry mouth condition is much better.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the tubes were only 1.5 oz., guess I&#x27;ll have  to read more carefully in the future.</li>
            <li> and I had to use them frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and find that it works very well.  </li>
            <li> I tried the spray version that Biotene offers to use during the day, but I didn&#x27;t care for the taste.</li>
            <li> Well, thousands have noticed and there are whole compaigns in the autoimmune community to get them to change it back..</li>
            <li> I (used to) use this product every night for dryness related to Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, and it was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Took several weeks to really notice the improvement.</li>
            <li> Will the Amazon company PLEASE stop using the picture of the old formula Biotene oral balance gel in your ads for this product.</li>
            <li> Just tried it one day and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> so there is no concern about receiving an old product.</li>
            <li> really works well especially during the night.</li>
            <li> Product is good but too expensive on line when you can buy in stores for  $8.95 when they have it in stock.</li>
            <li> then tried a variety of rinses from other brands, but none really helped much.</li>
            <li> The last one I bought was the NEW improved version.  </li>
            <li> I recently began having &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; caused by a new medication.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for me in helping to control dry mouth caused by medications.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> Have a history of dry mouth for years, and Oral Balance really does help alot.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and it works very well, especially because I sleep with my mouth open regretfully.</li>
            <li> I get canker sores, irritation, discomfort and major dryness when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shameful it is that the new formulation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I hope I have helped at least a couple of people understand how important this is.</li>
            <li> Generally it eases my symptoms till morning.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I wish my regular doctor would have warned me when I started the medications.</li>
            <li> I found the product helped a tiny bit when I applied it with a q-tip directly on my gums vs. putting it on my tonge like suggested and licking where i wanted it.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this product for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> the biotene products are the only ones that really give me relief from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this for dry mouth I get from asthma medications; it really works well for me, especially overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only one that really provided hours of relief from dry mouth was Biotene Oral Balance Gel.</li>
            <li> My dentist said that when the mouth is dry, then the bacteria, that is normally washed away by saliva, starts to attack the gums &amp; wreak havoc on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I usually order a significant quantity so that I won&#x27;t run short.</li>
            <li> Amazingly just that mere 1/2 inch of gel works wonders at coating the entire mouth and providing the comfort and ingredients needed for saliva to be produced.  </li>
            <li> I still wake up with a dry mouth only now it is also full of this gooey dried stuff.</li>
            <li> Due to prescriptions and sleep apnea my mouth always feels hot and dry.  </li>
            <li> All of my cavities were right on the gumline, as opposed to the usual sides of the teeth.</li>
            <li> She does no produce saliva naturally and her mouth and tongue tends to dry.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t stress enough to use it along with all other Biotene products as directed.  </li>
            <li> I really hope they revert back to the previous version--</li>
            <li> Especially considering how much comfort one can achieve with so little effort.</li>
            <li> I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found that other users got the same issues when I checked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My mouth is so dry w/o the gum that I try to chew, there is no saliva in my mouth and eating proves to be a task because it&#x27;s hard to chew and swallow.  </li>
            <li> If you take medications that dry your mouth, this gel is a must to not only sleep well at night, but prevent further tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well in keeping dry mouth at bay for a few hours.</li>
            <li> A number of my regular meds cause dry mouth, which is especially a problem at night.  </li>
            <li> I use this gel at night, putting an amount the size of a pea under my tongue for long lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> Provides long lasting relief.</li>
            <li> SO, people who experience your mouth being overly dry really NEED to use these relieving gels, sprays, gum, little patches you attach to the roof of your mouth, dry mouth lozenges, etc.</li>
            <li> Even if this didn&#x27;t work for me, it clearly works for lots of other people and may well be worth a shot if you are struggling with this incredibly frustrating condition.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that could quench the dry mouth problems brought on by chemotherapy.</li>
            <li> I had quite the shock when my dentist said I had six cavities, not from any lack of care on my part, but that I got them from simply having &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;.</li>
            <li> He also finds it helps when he runs cross country so that his mouth doesn&#x27;t get so dry.  </li>
            <li> I recently underwent radiation treatment which damaged my salivary glands causing dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make you gag, but you certainly would not buy any hard candy that tasted like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if you have trouble with dry gums - not just at night but during the day, too!</li>
            <li> and I gave it three stars only because I do not know if it is just not working for me and might work for other people with different reasons for wanting to try it.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the Dentist to alleviate dry mouth symptoms due to medication given and possibly not drinking enough fluids.</li>
            <li> If you think the new stuff is a winner in comparison to the older gel that was discontinued several months ago, you are sadly deluded.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> Stay too long in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If you have unexplained mouth pain, talk to your dentist about Biotene.</li>
            <li> But Oral Balance gel keeps my mouth from drying out all night long</li>
            <li> I simply put a few dabs around the outside of my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> You only want a small amount of water - too much and you&#x27;ll waste the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wished I done that long ago!  </li>
            <li> I tried other gels, but they didn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> When you have dry mouth due to disease situation and/or medication caused, this gel gives immediate relief and last longer than the spray type.  </li>
            <li> and/or were recommended by my dentist, ENR and other medical professionals to provide \\&quot;Hours of relief from dry mouth\\&quot;, to quote one of product blurbs.</li>
            <li> Oral Balance Gel is not perfect but it&#x27;s the best of a bad lot.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP machine nightly for sleep apnea, so my mouth tends to dry out, even with the humidfying feature.</li>

            <li> that&#x27;s difficult to clean off.  </li>

            <li> and if I use the same amount as I did previously</li>

            <li> Completely different than the previous formulation.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this nightly as he wakes up during the night with a very dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Ya know, it&#x27;s possible that I could have lost all of my teeth eventually &#x27;just because I take a few prescriptions&#x27; &amp; have a dry mouth from time to time.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that&#x27;s worked even a little, and it is a relief to find something that will give me some relief.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my Mom who gets dry mouth due to her medications.</li>
            <li> The new formula is very thin, only lasts a couple minutes, and burns the back of my throat, so I end up coughing instead of being soothed.  </li>
            <li> I never had any negative symptoms ever with the old formulation.  </li>
            <li> Not really for daytime use except for those emergency situations where you can&#x27;t get ahold of some water..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral Balance gel for quite a few years now as it was recommended by my dental hygienist because I sleep with my mouth open at night.  </li>
            <li> Recently my mouth and throat dried out when I slept at night but not when I was awake during the day.</li>
            <li> as soon as you realize your mouth is uncomfortably dry!!</li>
            <li> also keeps me from waking at night due to dry mouth!</li>
            <li> Due to very dry mouth from medications, this is what I keep in my purse and use just before going into a doctor&#x27;s office.  </li>
            <li> Surviving toxic cancer meds is hard enough, but the mouth and teeth pain that comes from dry mouth can be almost unbearable.</li>
            <li> , I can see what the other reviewer means about the gel tasting like apples though before reading that I hadn&#x27;t noticed - it isn&#x27;t flavored strongly.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> t works okaybut not exactly all the way.</li>
            <li> I hope to make other purchases on the site.</li>

            <li> He got mouth sores, and this Oral Balance gel was extremely helpful in reducing the pain and discomfort from the mouth sores.</li>
            <li> He no longer has any salivary glands due to chemo/radiation for tonsil cancer that has now spread to his lungs.  </li>
            <li> I was talking about the new formulation which is US made and sold all over the world and customers are not happy with it.</li>
            <li> I use every day at times when my mouth feels especially dry and it helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble for years with extremely dry mouth when sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I have Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and the medication (carbidopa-levidopa) causes serious dry mouth especially at night.</li>
            <li> Not only is dry mouth uncomfortable, it will wreck your teeth long-term if you don&#x27;t take steps to keep saliva present.</li>
            <li> My only complaint</li>
            <li> Relief lasted roughly half an hour with each small dollop, as opposed to the five minutes of other dry mouth products.</li>
            <li> The constant flow of air creates dry mouth worse than the Sahara Desert, so I use the Biotene gel every night before bed.</li>
            <li> There is no saliva to break down the clump in your mouth.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight after-taste, which is why I gave it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> A half inch line of gel lathered on the gums before sleep takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> A small quantity, about the size of a green pea, keeps my mouth moist so that I don&#x27;t wake up during the night with a dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Just use a little less if you don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li> those suffering from dry mouth, I would suggest that you try everything on the market at least once, though.</li>
            <li> spouse has dry mouth secondary to medications and diabetes, he uses this morning and night along with Biotene mouth rinse, he wouldn&#x27;t be without either</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> I dab a little onto my tongue and then swish it around in my mouth</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m dining out I also put a little dab in my mouth when my meals arrive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to find in some of the drug stores and/or big box stores.</li>
            <li> There is help for dry mouth and the serious problems it can cause.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I wake up with  a dried up mouth.</li>
            <li> I have to use this gel everyday, and appreciate the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> so,  this product is a waste of money</li>
            <li> and I bought this in hopes that it would keep me from waking up each morning with a completely dried out mouth</li>
            <li> I had parotid cancer &amp; had to have one of my salivary glands removed then had a round of radiation as follow up.  </li>
            <li> Since my only real complaint concerns sleep apnea, I would have given the gel 5 stars if not for that.</li>
            <li> The product was not pleasant tasting and did very little to relieve my dry mouth.  </li>
            <li> I produce very little moisture in my mouth and throat.  </li>
            <li> After using it I sleep for about three hours before I awake with a dry mouth but not a dry, painful throat.</li>
            <li> Really too bad.  </li>
            <li> You squeeze out a small amount (they recommend about ½ inch) and disperse it throughout your mouth.</li>
            <li> Just a small spray -</li>
            <li> My son is a mouth breather which can be uncomfortable especially at night.  </li>
            <li> Way too small.  </li>
            <li> In order to comply with regulatory restrictions, we are unable to address inquiries from outside the boundaries of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> My only wish is that it was not so expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure who the audience is now.</li>
            <li> One small dollup on my tongue at bedtime, no problem.</li>
            <li> and I was not pleased with the taste.</li>
            <li> No more cotton mouth, no more waking up, no need to keep water at my bedside.  </li>
            <li> The coating disintegrates within a few minutes and I am left with nothing but an unpleasant taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> but it is hard to find at the stores.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding it in our stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there are no real competitors, so don&#x27;t expect the company to fix this anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This stuff tries to be like silicon coating for your mouth (sorry</li>
            <li> I prefer the slow-dissolving lozenges, which at least provide some relief over an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> However, I use this product as toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth horribly dry--my teeth feel clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> You could also take a very small sip of water or use an eye dropper.</li>
            <li> While this product works, it has an after taste that to me is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> and it is GONE -- but the nasty aftertaste lingers a long long time.  </li>
            <li> This product is very hard to find in our area</li>
            <li> I tried to be tough and give it a shot to do</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and leaves you with phlegm in your throat in the morning.</li>
            <li> Very, very thick.  </li>
            <li> so I was tired</li>
            <li> , b/c Biotene Gel is now a disappointment, not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive to have 6 fillings put in.</li>
            <li> a night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s time to start writing to them to tell them their gel is useless.</li>
            <li> It is possible that the med I&#x27;m taking is just so nasty that this won&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> but unfortunately I see no benefit in using this at all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me in any way.</li>
            <li> TO KNOW HOW MISERABLE IT IS, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I ordered 2 tubes of it, which just got taken out with the trash.</li>
            <li> It is expensive though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking meds that give me horrible dry mouth, to the point where it is difficult to speak.</li>
            <li> It is a terrible product for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and has an awful taste, a horrible mouth-feel, and leaves a bad taste in the mouth which lasts much of the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite a disappointing response...</li>
            <li> I needed it because my meds were drying my mouth out so badly</li>
            <li> and I tried Orajel&#x27;s gel product and it tasted so bad I had to toss it.</li>
            <li> The helpful enzymes are gone, the texture is thin and runny, and worst of all, it burns my mouth, tongue and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize the tubes were only 1.5 oz., guess I&#x27;ll have  to read more carefully in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble for years with extremely dry mouth when sleeping.  It would even wake me up and I would feel like I was choking.  I tried other gels, but they didn&#x27;t last very long and I had to use them frequently.  With Oral Balance, it lasts for many hours and I haven&#x27;t had any &amp;#34;choking spells&amp;#34; since I&#x27;ve been using it.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth, this is the best product.  I have tried many others and they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP machine nightly for sleep apnea, so my mouth tends to dry out, even with the humidfying feature. My dentist recommends this product and so do I.</li>
            <li> I use this gel at night, putting an amount the size of a pea under my tongue for long lasting effect.  I use in combination with the spray or liquid throughout the rest of my mouth.  Much sleep improvement as a result.</li>
            <li> I use the gel and the toothpaste.  When I want a super clean feel with less plaque, I mix some regular toothpaste in with the biotene toothpaste.  Even that burns my mouth and gums these days.  So using the gel afterwards helps.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Convenient to send for it as many drugstores don&#x27;t have enough in stock.</li>
            <li> I have  COPD and have to take a lot of medicine.  The spray does not have a very good taste so I was looking for something different and tried the gel.  I love it but it is hard to find at the stores.</li>
            <li> Convenient to use. Provides long lasting relief. It is used in conjunction with a bPap machine and makes for greater comfort.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.  I needed it because my meds were drying my mouth out so badly I was at my wits end.  Its basically denture adhesive so its like rubbing a Vaseline-like texture all over in your mouth and the taste leaves a lot to be desired.  I&#x27;m going to have to stick to chewing gum.</li>
            <li> A small quantity, about the size of a green pea, keeps my mouth moist so that I don&#x27;t wake up during the night with a dry mouth. This Biotene gel product works much better than the Biotene mouthwash, for overnight use. I recommend it to anyone who experiences dry mouth while sleeping.</li>
            <li> If you take medications that dry your mouth, this gel is a must to not only sleep well at night, but prevent further tooth decay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my dentist after my first visit in years with a cavity.  I slept like a baby the first night using it.  My next check-up was clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking meds that give me horrible dry mouth, to the point where it is difficult to speak. No matter how much water I drank, my mouth remained very unconformably dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started off with the spray version by Biotene. While it helped, the relief was very short-lived (about 30 to 60 minutes at best).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried a variety of rinses from other brands, but none really helped much. So I tried the gel. That has proven to be the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is about the consistency of tooth paste. You squeeze out a small amount (they recommend about ½ inch) and disperse it throughout your mouth. It works very well in keeping dry mouth at bay for a few hours. The taste, however, is not all that good. It is sort of minty, but more of a medicinal mint taste rather than a real mint taste. It won&#x27;t make you gag, but you certainly would not buy any hard candy that tasted like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: For best results, spray your mouth with some water when you apply the gel. It helps disperse the gel better. Just a small spray - I used the bottle that the Biotene spray came in which worked great. You could also take a very small sip of water or use an eye dropper. You only want a small amount of water - too much and you&#x27;ll waste the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works great in combination with the Biotene spray for heavy-duty dry mouth situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they would improve the taste, but regardless, it works well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If you have dry mouth (diagnosed by dentist) then this is the product that will help.  I&#x27;ve used this product for several months and find that it works very well.  Dry mouth can cause dental problems so it&#x27;s not a problem to ignore.</li>
            <li> I have gotten by for many years with a condition called dry mouth. On the suggestion by a individual at the VA I decided to try BIOTENE. This was one of my best buys, this product gives me a great deal of relief and I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I take lots of meds that leave me dry-mouthed at night and eager for sips of water several times during the night.  I tried this on a whim.  Well!  Wished I done that long ago!  Sugar free gum during the day helps and at night, when I awake, I apply Biotene Gel around my gums.  It immediately takes away that parched feeling.</li>
            <li> I tried this product for a few days but it does not work long enough to help me. I would not recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have a dry mouth that interferes with sleep.  I use this at bedtime and if I wake up during the night and it helps.  Not a cure all, but good/</li>
            <li> Well I threw up the first time I used it, but then after a while I realized it kind of taste like red apples.  I find it works best after I brush my teeth and use mouth wash. I carry this around everywhere and use it quite often.  8 hrs of relief?? Barely... the longest I&#x27;ve ever experienced was 3 hrs max...</li>
            <li> A number of my regular meds cause dry mouth, which is especially a problem at night.  The discomfort will actually wake me so rather than continually drink water, I keep a tube of Oral Balance on the nightstand and just reach over and grab it when I need it.  Biotene also makes a liquid spray for the same purpose but I find that the relief from the gel lasts longer.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it is not always easy to find at drugstores so I am happy to find it here, and at a better price.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My dentist told me about this and it is great. I use it at night before bed and now I can sleep without waking up with a dry, hacking cough.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that could quench the dry mouth problems brought on by chemotherapy. Relief lasted roughly half an hour with each small dollop, as opposed to the five minutes of other dry mouth products.</li>
            <li> I have dry mouth due to medications and have found that without this product, I have problems sleeping.  I tried the spray version that Biotene offers to use during the day, but I didn&#x27;t care for the taste. Instead I keep Certs in my purse when I don&#x27;t have a drink handy.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, using the subscription service makes this more affordable than what I have seen recently in the stores.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can see what the other reviewer means about the gel tasting like apples though before reading that I hadn&#x27;t noticed - it isn&#x27;t flavored strongly.&lt;br /&gt;- - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/24/12&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still using this product nightly and I haven&#x27;t found anything better. I keep it next to my bed because I do tend to re-apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I went to the dentist after I started using OralBalance gel they asked what I was doing differently because my gums improved - I was told to keep doing what I was doing. SO sleeping better and improved tooth and gum health is a definite bonus!</li>
            <li> ver nice price and exactly what i wanted.  in fact i am about ready to reorder this product again soon</li>
            <li> I choe this product for my extreme dry mouth. t works okaybut not exactly all the way. It&#x27;s very thick and leaves you with phlegm in your throat in the morning. It&#x27;s not for those who suffer from dryness in your throat, eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> Very, very thick.  You can almost chew it.  It does make the mouth moist after radiation and that is the goal.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me in helping to control dry mouth caused by medications.  Highly approve.</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP for &#x27;safe&#x27; sleeping &amp; with Oral Balance my nights are much better.  Helps me to stay asleep longer!!!</li>
            <li> I had quite the shock when my dentist said I had six cavities, not from any lack of care on my part, but that I got them from simply having &#x27;dry mouth&#x27;. I told her that I take many medications and a couple are pain pills for my lower back pain. My mom told me about the mouth dryness being caused by my meds.&lt;br /&gt;  Boy, talk about scrambling to find relief. I had been using the Biotene spray as it is quick &amp; minty, not bad compared to the alternative. It&#x27;s expensive to have 6 fillings put in. My dentist said that when the mouth is dry, then the bacteria, that is normally washed away by saliva, starts to attack the gums &amp; wreak havoc on your teeth.  All of my cavities were right on the gumline, as opposed to the usual sides of the teeth. My filled teeth also hurt all the time, because of the fillings being right close to my nerve endings.&lt;br /&gt;  Wow, I wish my regular doctor would have warned me when I started the medications. I had no clue that my mouth dryness would or even could cause such pain &amp; expense. SO, people who experience your mouth being overly dry really NEED to use these relieving gels, sprays, gum, little patches you attach to the roof of your mouth, dry mouth lozenges, etc. as soon as you realize your mouth is uncomfortably dry!! Water is okay, but it only quenches until you swallow, right??&lt;br /&gt;  Anyway, I said all of that to say this, USE THIS GEL. IT WORKS!! I&#x27;ve tried most all of the relieving aids on Amazon &amp; drug stores. So, before removing my eyeglasses &amp; fluffing my pillows at night, I squeeze less than a pinkie fingernails worth out right on to my tongue &amp; manipulate it all along my gum-line [it really has such a mild hint of taste, that it shouldn&#x27;t stop you]. A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;  I hope I have helped at least a couple of people understand how important this is. Ya know, it&#x27;s possible that I could have lost all of my teeth eventually &#x27;just because I take a few prescriptions&#x27; &amp; have a dry mouth from time to time. I can&#x27;t stress it enough!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be well &amp; stay moist my friends!!</li>
            <li> My son is a mouth breather which can be uncomfortable especially at night.  He has really noticed an improvement with the use of this gel when he sleeps.  He also finds it helps when he runs cross country so that his mouth doesn&#x27;t get so dry.  This has been a great product for him.</li>
            <li> Not sure about this one yet, seems ok</li>
            <li> having put up with a dry mouth for a long time, I am thrilled with this product.  My dentist recommended it, and I am so happy to have found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s tough to find in some of the drug stores and/or big box stores.</li>
            <li> Way too small.  I didn&#x27;t expect that.  However, it is working quite well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this at night the way it&#x27;s recommended on the box but the way my dentist recommended.  She said when you talk a lot it severely aggravate you dry mouth so use this.  She&#x27;s so right it really helps.  You&#x27;re able to talk longer and more clearly which is particularly good when you&#x27;re trying to explain complicated points to people who are interested but have no background knowledge.  A little goes a long way, so the single tube probably last me all semester.  I think that&#x27;s great value for your money.  Especially considering how much comfort one can achieve with so little effort.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much that I could tell</li>
            <li> If you take meds or sleep with a cpap, the gel does help keep your mouth moist. I found the rinse and the spray did not work as well as this gel.</li>
            <li> Biotene for me used to be a life saver because the gel had the correct consistency to stay on my gums all night. In the morning I&#x27;d use water to take it off my preserved gums.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s got the consistency of H2O. I have to sleep on my back and if I use the same amount as I did previously I wake up with  a dried up mouth. If I use a bit more I wake up with the gel blocking my windpipe 3 to 4 times a night.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s time to start writing to them to tell them their gel is useless. I even told them I&#x27;d pay more for it, but it falls on deaf ears. If you think the new stuff is a winner in comparison to the older gel that was discontinued several months ago, you are sadly deluded.</li>
            <li> The gel is easy to use &amp; helps me avoid dry mouth throughout the night.</li>
            <li> due to adnoid cystic carsenoma most of my salivary glands have been removed. the biotene products are the only ones that really give me relief from dry mouth. I have not tried the gum do to complications from radiation,not being able to chew gum.  thanks biotene for all your products.</li>
            <li> Stay too long in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have sjogrens syndrome so my mouth is always dry. I am always drinking water and carry it everywhere I go. Sometimes this is not always convenient, especially when sleeping and this works pretty well for me. I sometimes have a hard time getting it so the subscription with Amazon works very good for me.</li>
            <li> While this product works, it has an after taste that to me is not pleasant.  The Orajel product has a better tasting mint flavor and works as well.</li>
            <li> This product has suffered from a formula change. Classic story, one company buys out a competitor, takes a good product and changes it into a higher profit product by changing the formula and hoping no one will notice. Well, thousands have noticed and there are whole compaigns in the autoimmune community to get them to change it back.. I have had it on my tonsils and have it start to burn so much that I have strong uncontrollable coughing for hours. (after trying everything to wash it out). Unfortunately, there are no real competitors, so don&#x27;t expect the company to fix this anytime soon. I never had any negative symptoms ever with the old formulation.  update 2017:  you might want to try oral7, it is similar without the burning in the throat in my experience</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Australia and I&#x27;ve used Biotene products (imported from the US) for 12 years ever since I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;ve got Sjogren&#x27;s. Biotene products have helped until they changed the formula. I only found that they&#x27;ve changed the formula 2 weeks ago. New mouthwash was burning my tongue and after a week of using it, some of my teeth started to hurt and became very sensitive. I thought, it was me rather the new formulation for awhile until I found that other users got the same issues when I checked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to send an email to Biotene which is owned by GlasoSmithKline to let them know, how shameful it is that the new formulation doesn&#x27;t help sensitive dry mouth. Here&#x27;s the reply I&#x27;ve got from the company;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear,&lt;br /&gt;We have received your e-mail on our Biotène® website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have reached the United States division of GlaxoSmithKline. In order to comply with regulatory restrictions, we are unable to address inquiries from outside the boundaries of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have marketing rights for our products only in the U.S. We would suggest that you speak to your physician.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara&lt;br /&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare&lt;br /&gt;Case # 4265840&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite a disappointing response...Obviously, they&#x27;re not getting it. I wasn&#x27;t talking about marketing or refunds. I was talking about the new formulation which is US made and sold all over the world and customers are not happy with it. I get the impression that the company really doesn&#x27;t care, whether it helps or not. Maybe all they care is cheaper manufacturing costs now. All we can do is that NOT buying their products. I&#x27;ve found that Oral Seven (in Australia) products have identical ingredients. So I&#x27;m switching. Bye bye Biotine...</li>
            <li> Due to very dry mouth from medications, this is what I keep in my purse and use just before going into a doctor&#x27;s office.  It&#x27;s good for at least 20-30 minutes without me having to reach for my water bottle every couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> Surviving toxic cancer meds is hard enough, but the mouth and teeth pain that comes from dry mouth can be almost unbearable. Many docs neglect oral health issues for their patients! I used  Biotene mouthwash morning and night, and kept a tube of Biotene gel on me at all times. It was a quick fix for pain along my gum line throughout the course of treatment. If you have unexplained mouth pain, talk to your dentist about Biotene. It could be the answer you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it&#x27;s pricy stuff if you use it regularly. Buy in bulk to save.</li>
            <li> effective for dry mouth and sore mucosa of mouth</li>
            <li> IS the best product for mouth dryness during sleeping time&lt;br /&gt;You can use it absolutely  the 100% of it&lt;br /&gt;Good price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking some medicine that creates a wicked dry-mouth (even while I&#x27;m drinking water you feel &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;).  This stuff tries to be like silicon coating for your mouth (sorry -- it&#x27;s the only comparison I can make -- and no slam meant to WD-40).  2 minutes later and it is GONE -- but the nasty aftertaste lingers a long long time.  It is possible that the med I&#x27;m taking is just so nasty that this won&#x27;t work.  But I bought both the gel and the liquid mouth &#x27;rinse&#x27; and neither one of them works for me at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the older version for some time and loved it.  My mouth was so dry I&#x27;d have to peel it off the roof of my mouth in the morning and then it was sore.  This stuff really worked.  The last one I bought was the NEW improved version.  It quickly becomes liquefied when applied; does not coat the tongue as well; at times, it drains into my windpipe/throat and I jump out of bed because I get strangled and cough.  I really hope they revert back to the previous version--saw lots of complaints similar to mine on their website.  This WAS such a Great Product.</li>
            <li> The tube from my last order was significantly different and much less effective than the Biotene gels I had relied on for many years.  I see from another A-zon reviewer that the company was sold and a key ingredient removed.  Really too bad.  If you find a product that really works let me know, b/c Biotene Gel is now a disappointment, not nearly as effective.</li>
            <li> The product arrived right on time. He&#x27;s wonderful. The delivery was perfect. Thank you. I hope to make other purchases on the site. Users can now rely on this spectacular delivery. I really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone interested. Patients can rest assured, because the delivery is accurate. The porceço is much better than in Brazil and teconologia is the most advanced.</li>
            <li> They have changed the formula, and this new version is nothing like the original.  I (used to) use this product every night for dryness related to Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, and it was very helpful.  The new formula is very thin, only lasts a couple minutes, and burns the back of my throat, so I end up coughing instead of being soothed.  I will definitely be looking for an alternative and not buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have to use this gel everyday, and appreciate the effectiveness of the product. It would be nice if it was available in a pack of 3</li>
            <li> I recently began having &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; caused by a new medication.  This gel helps soothe my mouth and feel much better.</li>
            <li> This is an effective gel that is great to have on hand when water is not available or practical to use.  I think of it as a lubricant for my tongue.  It is much more effective than sucking on hard candies.</li>
            <li> I am on allergy meds that make my mouth dry.  I use this at night and it works very well, especially because I sleep with my mouth open regretfully.</li>
            <li> This product has  made my mother very happy as she has &amp;#34;dry mouth&amp;#34; due to Sjrogren&#x27;s syndrome.  It has literally saved her.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I use this every night and it helps keep my mouth and gums from drying out and waking me up.</li>
            <li> Thank heavens this product exists.  My husband had a throat cancer and the radiation he received wiped out his saliva.  He carries Oral Balance with him at all times, to help provide moisture in his mouth.  He literally could not get by with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I produce very little moisture in my mouth and throat.  Finding Biotene several years ago has saved my teeth and has enabled me to talk and eat without fear of choking.  I&#x27;ve tried everything on the market and nothing comes close to being as effective as Biotene oral gel.  I now use 1 tube a day.  My only wish is that it was not so expensive.  I look for the &amp;#34;best price&amp;#34; every few days and usually buy in large quantities to take advantage of the cost savings.</li>
            <li> Great for those who have dry mouth problems, especially those of us with Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome. I use it every night.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dry mouth.  Took several weeks to really notice the improvement.</li>
            <li> Will the Amazon company PLEASE stop using the picture of the old formula Biotene oral balance gel in your ads for this product. You are deceiving the public into buying a non-existent product. Biotene is now REFORMULATED and is inferior in quality. Many of us have written to the company. I have also and they tell me they are NO LONGER producing the original formula. Please change your picture and ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I have used and loved Biotene Oral Balance for many years.  I have Sjogren&#x27;s Syndrome, and extreme dry mouth.  The old formulation was not only soothing, but contained many enzymes that are found in saliva, so it was good for my mouth as well.  The formulation has been changed (for this and all Biotene products).  The helpful enzymes are gone, the texture is thin and runny, and worst of all, it burns my mouth, tongue and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what to use as a substitute.  This has been a recommended product for extreme dry mouth sufferers, and now we can no longer use it.  I&#x27;m not sure who the audience is now.</li>
            <li> It  worked well the first time and continues to do so !  I have Parkinson&#x27;s Disease and the medication (carbidopa-levidopa) causes serious dry mouth especially at night.</li>
            <li> Read this ad - this is not toothpaste!  It&#x27;s a moisturizing product. If you&#x27;re looking for Biotene Gel Toothpaste - this is not that product.</li>
            <li> Some people say this tastes gross. No, it tastes like APPLES, people. Anyway, this works really well, it is a gel-that is, gel-like and has a soothing texture. Just use a little less if you don&#x27;t like the texture.</li>
            <li> L&lt;br /&gt;love this toothpaste as it is easy on the inside of mouth and the taste is mild and as it is good for dry mouth and works.....so do all Biotene products but you have to find the one that works for you......</li>
            <li> I get terribly dry mouth during the night.  I wouldn&#x27;t be able to sleep if it wasn&#x27;t for Biotene Oral Balance Gel.  Use it every night &amp; sometimes in the middle of the night also.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Very good tooth paste.Recommend.AAA+++</li>
            <li> helps with the dry mouth</li>
            <li> my mouth would get so dry it would wake me up.  One small dollup on my tongue at bedtime, no problem.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from dry mouth for quite sometime now. My dentist recommended Biotene. Well all I can say is it didn&#x27;t work for me and I was not pleased with the taste. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying. Still looking for something which will help me.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I received radiation treatment to the left side of my face which destroyed all the salivary glands on that side.  I would wake up several times a night with a \\&quot;cotton mouth\\&quot; feeling and had to drink something.  Not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Biotene gel is Godsend!  I put a small glob of it in my mouth and spread it all over the inside of the left cheek.  That&#x27;s it!  No more cotton mouth, no more waking up, no need to keep water at my bedside.  Highly recommended.  If you have problem with dry mouth, this product is indispensable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the daytime use, there is a Biotene Oral Balance liquid spray which does the same but has a shorter duration.  There is also a Biotene tooth paste.  Both are great items for dry mouth sufferers.</li>
            <li> I love all the Biotene products especially the toothpaste and mouth rinse.  I have severe dry mouth due to medications and using a cpap machine for sleep apnea.  I get canker sores, irritation, discomfort and major dryness when I wake up.  When I first tried this product I did not use it as directed.  It says to put 1/2 inch of gel on your tongue and spread it all over the inside of your mouth and cheeks.  I did not believe that such a small amount would be effective so I used twice as much and it didn&#x27;t help much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luckily I reread the directions and gave it a shot as directed.  Amazingly just that mere 1/2 inch of gel works wonders at coating the entire mouth and providing the comfort and ingredients needed for saliva to be produced.  I use the gel twice a day along with other Biotene products and my dry mouth condition is much better.  Highly recommend this product and can&#x27;t stress enough to use it along with all other Biotene products as directed.  There is help for dry mouth and the serious problems it can cause.</li>
            <li> The product is fine.  The price was high.</li>
            <li> the gel lasted about 1/2 hr, would not buy it again.  Well, I have to add more words to this review so,  this product is a waste of money</li>
            <li> I am a mouth breather due to allergies and I bought this in hopes that it would keep me from waking up each morning with a completely dried out mouth but unfortunately I see no benefit in using this at all. I still wake up with a dry mouth only now it is also full of this gooey dried stuff. I will not be purchasing it again and I gave it three stars only because I do not know if it is just not working for me and might work for other people with different reasons for wanting to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to date, that I have found for dry mouth. I had parotid cancer &amp; had to have one of my salivary glands removed then had a round of radiation as follow up.  Side effect from this is extreme dry mouth.  I can use Oral Balance &amp; have blessed relief for quite some time before I need to use more.  I highly recomend this product for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a three because I don&#x27;t really think this helped my drymouth but it didn&#x27;t worsen it either. I found the product helped a tiny bit when I applied it with a q-tip directly on my gums vs. putting it on my tonge like suggested and licking where i wanted it. I&#x27;m much happier with the mouthwash. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Got the wrong one, the liquid is way better and tastes better.</li>
            <li> When you have dry mouth due to disease situation and/or medication caused, this gel gives immediate relief and last longer than the spray type.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is a temporary fix.  I did not like the flavor or texture.  I prefer the gum.  Biotene gum is in my car and purse and I use it often.</li>
            <li> This will not cure your issue but it does help.  Before retiring I apply a small drop to my tongue and coat the areas that bother me most.  Generally it eases my symptoms till morning.  I see no advantage to using this during the day, your case my differ.</li>
            <li> Sjogren&#x27;s makes my mouth so dry it awakens me during the night. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that relieves the dryness. I tuck it under my pillow &amp; often use it 2-3 times at night. It does have a slight after-taste, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Other Biotene products haven&#x27;t helped me, but this one is good. Coupons are often available,  &amp; the Subscribe &amp; Save Amazon offer is also helpful, as the gel can be costly.</li>
            <li> I use this product nightly just before I go to sleep. I dab a little onto my tongue and then swish it around in my mouth and I am good until morning. It really works well.</li>
            <li> I do not like this product for its intended use. However, I use this product as toothpaste because it doesn&#x27;t leave my mouth horribly dry--my teeth feel clean afterwards. Just tried it one day and was pleasantly surprised. I use Biotene Toothpaste intermittently for the fluoride, but that product leaves my mouth as dry as other toothpastes do.</li>
            <li> soothing to the mouth. like it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and did exactly what it claims it will do.  I will never be without it!</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is a problem for many people ---especially during the night.&lt;br /&gt;It is a real problem for people who have gone through radiation treatments.&lt;br /&gt;It is a great product &amp; I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Product is good but too expensive on line when you can buy in stores for  $8.95 when they have it in stock.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my brother who is receiving chemo therapy. He got mouth sores, and this Oral Balance gel was extremely helpful in reducing the pain and discomfort from the mouth sores. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> fast delivery  &amp; good Deal, Thanks</li>
            <li> I bought to my aunt. She used to be able to find it here in Sao Paulo - Brazil, but all of a sundden it was out of stock. Amazon saved her!I recommend this product and this website to all my friends. Everything was perfect, as usual! You are the best!</li>
            <li> My wife has a very dry mouth and has tried many things to help. This is the only one which seems to effective.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as promised very happy</li>
            <li> changed the formula and the only really good overnight mouth moisturizer is no more. Now I use Orajel (which is nowhere near as good as the old formula Oral Balance, but far better than this). Horrible.</li>
            <li> I have Sjogren&#x27;s, which is characterized in part by extreme dry mouth. I had high hopes for this product after all the stellar reviews. Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work for me in any way. The coating disintegrates within a few minutes and I am left with nothing but an unpleasant taste in my mouth. Absolutely not for overnight use - I&#x27;d wake up dry as a bone. I prefer the slow-dissolving lozenges, which at least provide some relief over an hour or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those suffering from dry mouth, I would suggest that you try everything on the market at least once, though. Different products work for different folks, and it&#x27;s much better that you spend the money to determine if this is the miracle product that works for you. Not only is dry mouth uncomfortable, it will wreck your teeth long-term if you don&#x27;t take steps to keep saliva present. Even if this didn&#x27;t work for me, it clearly works for lots of other people and may well be worth a shot if you are struggling with this incredibly frustrating condition.</li>
            <li> been useing  Biotene  Oral Balance for quite some time. Have a history of dry mouth for years, and Oral Balance really does help alot. I would reccommend it for anyone with this problem, try it ,you&#x27;ll like it</li>
            <li> Good product. will use it again.</li>
            <li> Originally this product helped me.  The next time I bought it, the company changed the formula and it was much less effective.  Now the company has changed the formula so many times that this product no longer does what it is advertised to do.  Instead it now causes a mild burning sensation on my tongue and dries out my mouth.  Find another way.  This product won&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> As a diabetic with four prescriptions and sometimes more, this is the only dry mouth product that works through the night.  When using only the sprays, I wake up with my tongue stuck to the roof of my mouth.  But Oral Balance gel keeps my mouth from drying out all night long and it&#x27;s sugar free.  I started oredering it from Amazon recently because all of the stores in my area quit carrying it for whatever reason.  Once more, its expiration date was well into the future so there is no concern about receiving an old product.</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry mouth due to sjogren&#x27;s and a blockage of sublingual gland.  Been using this for years and it&#x27;s the only thing that can effectively keep my mouth from drying out completely at nighttime.  It&#x27;s very effective as long as you keep your mouth closed and don&#x27;t swallow much.  Not really for daytime use except for those emergency situations where you can&#x27;t get ahold of some water.. so keep a tube on hand for that too..</li>
            <li> really works well especially during the night. excellent product, well priced and delivered quickly. I usually order a significant quantity so that I won&#x27;t run short.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS - 15 YEARS OR MORE.  I HAVE BEEN TAKING MEDICATIONS FOR MANY YEARS AND SUFFERED DRY MOUTH. YOU HAVE TO EXPERIENCE DRY MOUTH TO KNOW HOW MISERABLE IT IS, ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT. BIOTENE ORAL BALANCE HAS MADE MY LIFE EASIER.  I HAVE TRIED THE ORAL BALANCE SPRAY, BUT HAVE FOUND THE GEL MUCH MORE SUCCESSFUL.  WHEN THE COST AND THEN THE AVAILABILITY BECAME A PROBLEM, I DECIDED TO ORDER SEVERAL TUBES FROM AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I buy this for my mother who is in her last stages of alzhaimers and no longer feeds orally.  She does no produce saliva naturally and her mouth and tongue tends to dry.  As a consequence she can not close her mouth.  Once we administer a little of this gel, she is able to close her mouth and swallow.  She loves the taste and often asked for more. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> EASY TO APPLY. ALL THESE PRODUCTS ARE QUITE GOOD. I JUST WISH THEY LASTED LONGER..&lt;br /&gt;ANY RELIEF YOU CAN GET FROM DRY MOUTH IS WELCOME</li>
            <li> My husband needs to regularly order oral balance.  He no longer has any salivary glands due to chemo/radiation for tonsil cancer that has now spread to his lungs.  We appreciate the quick order fulfillment.  This product is very hard to find in our area so ordering this online is much easier.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Changed the formula.  Is now very runny and has a more minty flavor which actually burns my dry mouth.  Completely different than the previous formulation.  If someone knows of a replacement product in the US, I would be forever grateful.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I received radiation treatments for cancer. The treatment was successful, but a side affect of radiation is dry mouth. biotin gel relieves dry mouth when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for dry mouth people at night. It was out of stock for a couple months and I tried Orajel&#x27;s gel product and it tasted so bad I had to toss it. Biotene has a pleasant taste and does the job - I use it before bed and then once during the night. I don&#x27;t find it effective for extended use during the day, but at night it&#x27;s irreplaceable. I was also impressed with Glaxo customer service. I emailed them to ask it if had been discontinued and they replied right away that it would be back in stock at the end of February. Great product and company!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this for dry mouth I get from asthma medications; it really works well for me, especially overnight. I use it in combination with the Biotene toothpaste, and mouthwash which I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think that Biotene&#x27;s best product for dry mouth is their mouthwash.  However, the gel can be handy to bring with you, if you won&#x27;t be able to use the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every dry mouth treatment you can get over the counter. The medications I take dehydrate me to the point I feel like I&#x27;m being mummified and I get dry mouth so severe it actually hurts. This is the only thing that&#x27;s worked even a little, and it is a relief to find something that will give me some relief. However, I find the taste and texture of the gel to be just gross. If you can stand it, it&#x27;s an effective treatment.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Gel simply because clicking on Amazon website photo showed that the ingredients statement was not the recently-reformulated version.  When I received the product, it was indeed the reformulated version which has none of the older-version enzymes.  Returned the product.  Vendor promises a credit.  Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve gotten credit yet.</li>
            <li> I wear dentures which has caused me to have a dry mouth. So I use this when I put my dentures in my mouth. It has a good flavor as well, I strongly recommend this as a cushion.</li>
            <li> I am a CPAP patient and wear the full face mask every night to sleep. The constant flow of air creates dry mouth worse than the Sahara Desert, so I use the Biotene gel every night before bed. This product diminishes the effect of dry mouth and enhances the ability to produce saliva that is vital to good oral health. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from Sjogrens, this product will become a staple in your arsenal of OTC drugs, especially at night.</li>
            <li> For someone who has radiation damage to his lower salivary ducts this product helps keep my mouth and throat moist while I sleep. I simply put a few dabs around the outside of my upper teeth.</li>
            <li> I use this at night rather than chewing gum..it works well, but needs a special rinse in the morning..i will continue it&#x27;s use</li>
            <li> I recently underwent radiation treatment which damaged my salivary glands causing dry mouth.  The product was not pleasant tasting and did very little to relieve my dry mouth.  But, my level of dry mouth may be more severe than others.</li>
            <li> The biotene gel does not work for dry mouth. There is no saliva to break down the clump in your mouth. It is a terrible product for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> One of the best mouth moisterizers.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the Dentist to alleviate dry mouth symptoms due to medication given and possibly not drinking enough fluids.</li>
            <li> I love the Biotene Oral Balance Gel, especially when I wake up at night and my mouth is so dry.  I guess it wouldn&#x27;t happen if I slept with my mouth shut, but that is easier said than done.  I have a hard time finding it in our stores.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t my order.</li>
            <li> I have to love it, as it&#x27;s the only product on the market that helps keep my tongue &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34;, which means, it keeps&lt;br /&gt;it moist. Having had cancer, my salivary glands are only at 50% and I&#x27;ve dry mouth 24/7.  Biotene Oral is in my bathroom&lt;br /&gt;drawer as well as my purse, at all times!</li>
            <li> MY DRY MOUTH &amp; SOMEWHAT SORE GUMS HAVE FOUND A FRIEND IN THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;WHAT A RELIEF IT IS.. THANKS</li>
            <li> This has to be the most repulsive feeling thing, I have ever placed in my mouth. It made me gag! It is like getting a finger full of Vaseline or congealed hamburger grease and putting it in your mouth to spread around with your tongue. I tried to be tough and give it a shot to do it&#x27;s thing. I couldn&#x27;t stop swallowing to try to get it out of my mouth. I had dry mouth again in 5 minutes. As far as a mint flavor, about as much as ABC gum. Unfortunately I ordered 2 tubes of it, which just got taken out with the trash. I guess I&#x27;ll be saving my hamburger grease and ABC gum until I find something not so vile. ;O)</li>
            <li> I have sleep apnea and use a CPAP machine with a full face mask.  I have used this product for about a year now and can say it works for me.  Before, my mouth would be drier than the Sahara Desert and my gums were taking quite the punishment.  A half inch line of gel lathered on the gums before sleep takes care of the problem.</li>
            <li> delivered in good condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Oral Balance gel for quite a few years now as it was recommended by my dental hygienist because I sleep with my mouth open at night.  Can&#x27;t imagine where I&#x27;d be if I didn&#x27;t use this stuff.  It keeps my gums moistened and feeling good - no more &amp;#34;morning mouth&amp;#34;.  I actually get up in the middle of the night (well, to use the potty. . .old age, ya know!) and reapply the Oral Balance to keep my mouth in good shape til I get up in the morning.  I highly recommend this product if you have trouble with dry gums - not just at night but during the day, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Biotene for several years and it works!  I recommend this product to all my friends.  It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom who gets dry mouth due to her medications. She goes through about a tube about every 7-10 days so it&#x27;s rather pricey.</li>
            <li> Product exceeded my expectations. I have oral lichen planus and this worked well on the &amp;#34;hot spots when they occurred</li>
            <li> My Mother has a problem with dry mouth and uses this product for it exclusively. She wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Great Product and Very Quick Arrival&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a nice job with dry mouth. It does a nice job with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this nightly as he wakes up during the night with a very dry mouth. This product is very hard to fine in local stores, so I have ordered multiple packs twice now from Amazon and been pleased.</li>
            <li> Due to prescriptions and sleep apnea my mouth always feels hot and dry.  I chew gum during the day to alleviate my symptoms, but use the gel at night.  My only complaint: My mouth falls open while I sleep and I must wear a full face mask that covers both my nose and mouth while using my BiPap continuous air flow respirator.  When I wake up, my tongue is coated white and feels &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34; and my rubberized mask has a lot of sticky goo inside that&#x27;s difficult to clean off.  When I&#x27;m dining out I also put a little dab in my mouth when my meals arrive.  My mouth is so dry w/o the gum that I try to chew, there is no saliva in my mouth and eating proves to be a task because it&#x27;s hard to chew and swallow.  Since my only real complaint concerns sleep apnea, I would have given the gel 5 stars if not for that.</li>
            <li> spouse has dry mouth secondary to medications and diabetes, he uses this morning and night along with Biotene mouth rinse, he wouldn&#x27;t be without either</li>
            <li> Recently my mouth and throat dried out when I slept at night but not when I was awake during the day. At night I awoke hourly to take a drink of water to relieve the pain in my mouth and throat. This is no way to get a good night&#x27;s sleep so I was tired all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous products, separately and together, which were on the Internet and/or were recommended by my dentist, ENR and other medical professionals to provide \\&quot;Hours of relief from dry mouth\\&quot;, to quote one of product blurbs. These products included mouthwashes, gums, lozenges, sprays, toothpastes, and gels; about a dozen in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one that really provided hours of relief from dry mouth was Biotene Oral Balance Gel. After using it I sleep for about three hours before I awake with a dry mouth but not a dry, painful throat. The second application, which I apply without rinsing my mouth, allows me to sleep through the rest of the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotene Oral Balance Gel is not perfect but it&#x27;s the best of a bad lot. It is expensive and has an awful taste, a horrible mouth-feel, and leaves a bad taste in the mouth which lasts much of the day. Were it not for these defects I would have rated this product 5-star because it was the only one whose use allowed me to get a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Biotene rinse instead of the gel. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but there is some relief from dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Oral Balance works well for dry mouth issues that occur while sleeping. I have tried other products and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> I use a cpap machine and this product has provided the relief of dry mouth and even throat problems. I use as directed just before I am ready to go to sleep.</li>
            <li> My dentist tells me to keep using this product. It&#x27;s keping my mouth moist and preventing many dental problems.&lt;br /&gt;It also keeps me from waking at night due to dry mouth!</li>
            <li> I use a CPAP machine and my mouth gets drying during the night and bought this product to help the dryness.  Didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> This product really provides a good amount of dry mouth relief. Being a gel I thought that the product would be very long lasting as it would stay in the mouth better. This does seem to be the case to some extent however if I had to choose between this and Oasis Mouth Spray I&#x27;d choose the Oasis product as it seems to last a bit longer</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper on this site. It has worked really good for my dry mouth problem. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Very good as a remedy for dry mouth.  I use every day at times when my mouth feels especially dry and it helps.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this more than the toothpaste, made mouth feel better immediately. I just carried it in my purse and used it all the time.</li>
            <li> I buy this online for my mother who has sjogrens disease and this is a necessity.  She used to be able to find it in her local walmart, cvs, walgreens but everytime she went it was out of stock.  Shes quite elderly so the option of running around town was out.  Im so happy to have found this product for her at such a great price.  Also the ease of mind knowing her shipment will go out to her monthly is a plus.</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to use Biotene Oral Balance Gel. It works very well and I like it. It is expensive though. If buying in a larger quanity would reduce the price I would be glad to buy more.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery time and packaging was excellent.</li>
