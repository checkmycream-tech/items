            <li>Tames fly away hair, holds curl with softness and natural look.  </li>
            <li>but Amazon made it so easy.  </li>
            <li>I have easy, light curls,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the most effective.</li>
            <li>it worked good even on my thin hair... and the smell is great.. not too strong..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lot&#x27;s of gels, but this is the best.. Not too stiff, and gives my hair a nice naturally curly look.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, have been using Kenra Curl Defining Cream for over 6 months, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know HOW many curl products I have tried over the years from very high end salon products to your drug store variety</li>
            <li>The best product I have found for making my thin, fine hair to look like it has body and curl.</li>
            <li>The hair looked great for 3-4 hours after washing, but then would start to get frizzy due to the humidity.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered several more off of Amazon, because I love it and cannot fathom the thought of running out.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the best hair products for curls I have used so far (which has been a very wide variety).  </li>
            <li>Defines my curls very nicely, with no sticky mess.  </li>
            <li>For the money its worth the shot...it could work for you.</li>
            <li>Towel dried, no other product simultaneously has yielded the best results for me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I looked it up here and found it right away.</li>
            <li>it is nice, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t stay in as long.</li>
            <li>It dries curly-not frizzy, and, most importantly, SOFT so very soft!</li>
            <li>A friend gave me my first bottle of this Kenra Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li>My curls are pretty uniform and tend towards ringlets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before, so I know what a new, fresh bottle is like.  </li>
            <li>The cream was much thinner, the dispenser does not work correctly and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the product purchase through salons.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t offensive and it saves so much time when you have to jump out the shower and head out without blow drying or straightening your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>if I put in too much.</li>
            <li>but it can be very pricey in the salon.</li>
            <li>; that I get when using too much of this product</li>
            <li>Last thing is I don&#x27;t think it smells as FANTASTIC as everyone mentioned.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need too much</li>
            <li>It handles bed head better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>Cant beat that-especially when &amp;#34;running out&amp;#34; includes a 3 yr old!!</li>
            <li>and I promise you if you have natural curly hair, this will tame it and define it so perfectly without the sticky greasy feel the other products I&#x27;ve tried left my hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>fine with delivery and received sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;one of the caps was broken, but other than that all good.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described at half the salon price...and deliver right to my door!</li>
            <li>I appreciated the seller taping the lids on as well because if they hadn&#x27;t there would have been a huge mess which happened when I packed it on a trip</li>
            <li>those of us with frizzy/curly hair, we know how challenging it can be to tame our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>About a nickel-sized amount in my naturally curly hair creates a head full of curls that I can style with my fingers to cover any flat or bald spots.  </li>
            <li>I live in TX and heat and humidity</li>
            <li>Lesson learned:  I&#x27;ll pay a little more next time for the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I have paid $38 dollars for one bottle previously, even at that price it is worth it!</li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair and it tends to friz out as the day goes on then this product deserves a try.  </li>
            <li>wife loves it and it makes my old gray wire hair softer</li>
            <li>My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Creates soft curls that don&#x27;t frizz and without any stickiness.</li>
            <li>I have done my Aunt&#x27;s hair, as well as a close friends that has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>The two bottles I received online thru Amazon must have been old product.  </li>
            <li>naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair and this product helps define my curls.</li>
            <li>Keeps hair soft, and holds a curl.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and frizz free,not crunchy</li>
            <li>This stuff was runny, like it either melted at some point, or was just old product.  </li>
            <li>My curls are then soft and not crunchy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to last most of the day, which i like, doesn&#x27;t go flat like some other products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have grey curly hair and it can be very unruly at times</li>
            <li>This curl cream provides just the right amount of hold for bouncy curls without weighing them down or making them crunchy.</li>
            <li>With my naturally wavy/curly hair, many products are too heavy and weigh the curls down or give you that perpetual beach hair look.</li>
            <li>if i dont find something that will work better with my thin hair i will stick to this one..</li>
            <li>This product works very well in keeping naturally wavy and frizzy hair from being too messy.  </li>
            <li>Having naturally curly hair, I have searched for a product for years that would make my curls soft and defined, without the gel or wet look.  </li>
            <li>When I put this in my hair and sometimes do a soft blowout the style will last for several days.  </li>
            <li>If you have super loose waves, this may not be enough hold but for those of us who do have natural bounce that can easily become frizzy or crazy-</li>

            <li> those of us with frizzy/curly hair, we know how challenging it can be to tame our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> About a nickel-sized amount in my naturally curly hair creates a head full of curls that I can style with my fingers to cover any flat or bald spots.  </li>
            <li> I live in TX and heat and humidity</li>
            <li> Lesson learned:  I&#x27;ll pay a little more next time for the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I have paid $38 dollars for one bottle previously, even at that price it is worth it!</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair and it tends to friz out as the day goes on then this product deserves a try.  </li>
            <li> wife loves it and it makes my old gray wire hair softer</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Creates soft curls that don&#x27;t frizz and without any stickiness.</li>
            <li> I have done my Aunt&#x27;s hair, as well as a close friends that has naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> The two bottles I received online thru Amazon must have been old product.  </li>
            <li> naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have natural curly hair and this product helps define my curls.</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft, and holds a curl.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and frizz free,not crunchy</li>
            <li> This stuff was runny, like it either melted at some point, or was just old product.  </li>
            <li> My curls are then soft and not crunchy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> It also seems to last most of the day, which i like, doesn&#x27;t go flat like some other products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have grey curly hair and it can be very unruly at times</li>
            <li> This curl cream provides just the right amount of hold for bouncy curls without weighing them down or making them crunchy.</li>
            <li> With my naturally wavy/curly hair, many products are too heavy and weigh the curls down or give you that perpetual beach hair look.</li>
            <li> if i dont find something that will work better with my thin hair i will stick to this one..</li>
            <li> This product works very well in keeping naturally wavy and frizzy hair from being too messy.  </li>
            <li> Having naturally curly hair, I have searched for a product for years that would make my curls soft and defined, without the gel or wet look.  </li>
            <li> When I put this in my hair and sometimes do a soft blowout the style will last for several days.  </li>
            <li> If you have super loose waves, this may not be enough hold but for those of us who do have natural bounce that can easily become frizzy or crazy-</li>
            <li> This is the second time I am purchasing this product, and will continue to do so as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> Also the curls don&#x27;t last as long (frizz) and droopy.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair was long due to trying to keep the curl reduced, but I would then find that 90% of the time it was pulled back in a pony tail to keep it off my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> About 10 months ago I cut my hair very short due to a surgery/recovery that I just couldn&#x27;t face with long hair.  </li>
            <li> apply the cream and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, natural curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product we have found that tames and hightens the curls without weighing down our hair.  </li>
            <li> The curling crème seemed watered down and did not seem to act the same way in my hair as bottles of this product I have purchased thru salons.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with BioSilk Silk Therapy to dilute a bit, and apply on wet hair and leave to air dry.  </li>
            <li> Just apply generously to very wet hair and dry with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> and it was not very flattering.  </li>
            <li> While it doesn&#x27;t quite hold as well as a gel (I face a lot of wind on the way into work while my hair is still wet), it still holds a curl well all day.  </li>
            <li> One pump does job on wet hair.</li>
            <li> this is enough to tame those waves without taking away their energy and playfulness.</li>
            <li> This cream does not weigh my loosely curly hair down but does help control my frizz.</li>
            <li> Although Kenra is a bit pricey, a little creme goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My sons are very active in sports, and they have found that the product does not run into their eyes and burn like some other products do.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I felt that was a ripoff, so I am not sure how to avoid this, but be careful.    </li>
            <li> (I have long, thick hair.)</li>
            <li> This is a product I have used for years, but was having trouble finding it in salons.  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours my hair is frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Helps to enhance curls without making them stiff.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, color-treated, semi frizzy curly hair...</li>
            <li> Usually I purchase it from a salon or beauty supply store.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this product has a shelf life as there is no expiration date on it.  </li>
            <li> Although on the bottle it says I can return the product if not satisfied, so I will be returning this to Amazon.</li>
            <li> No more frizz.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is less expensive buying on line than through my hairdresser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only way I could ever get it to look curly is by making it crunchy, which is worse to me than looking bad.</li>
            <li> I was about to start letting my hair grow out when dumb luck went my way</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Kenra</li>
            <li> Finding something for curly hair is so difficult!</li>
            <li> Defining Crème - there is nothing bad about this</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Kenra Curl Defining Cream.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You will not be disappointed .....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best stuff ever for your hair if you have natural curl.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; really works on curly hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product- I use it with gel too.  Finding something for curly hair is so difficult!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my wife because it is a good value and she swears by it. I love the curl results she gets when she uses it.</li>
            <li> All I have to say is this product is wonderful for curly hair, as it really holds your style.  My sons are very active in sports, and they have found that the product does not run into their eyes and burn like some other products do.  I have very fine curly hair, and the product gives me a really nice wave pattern to my hair.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the Kenra Curl Defining Cream.  This is a product I have used for years, but was having trouble finding it in salons.  I ordered it through Amazon thinking I was getting the same product that I&#x27;d been using, but this was NOT the case.  The cream was much thinner, the dispenser does not work correctly and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the product purchase through salons.  I believe I was sold an inferior product.</li>
            <li> A great product!   Defines my curls, reduces frizz and it smells great. Although Kenra is a bit pricey, a little creme goes a long way. Plus, the compliments I received from others regarding my curls are an extra bonus!</li>
            <li> this is the one hair product that works great on my wavy curly hair</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair and it tends to friz out as the day goes on then this product deserves a try.  I&#x27;ve dealt with curly hair friz all my life.  My hair was long due to trying to keep the curl reduced, but I would then find that 90% of the time it was pulled back in a pony tail to keep it off my face and neck.  I live in TX and heat and humidity are a constant.   About 10 months ago I cut my hair very short due to a surgery/recovery that I just couldn&#x27;t face with long hair.  The hair looked great for 3-4 hours after washing, but then would start to get frizzy due to the humidity.  By the end of the day it was a Rondald McDonald fro and it was not very flattering.  I was about to start letting my hair grow out when dumb luck went my way and I stumbled upon this product.</li>
            <li> wife loves it and it makes my old gray wire hair softer</li>
            <li> I have been using for several months.  It provides excellent hold.</li>
            <li> Helps to enhance curls without making them stiff.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both have naturally curly hair.  This is the ONLY product we have found that tames and hightens the curls without weighing down our hair.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that is finally happy! I have been using this product exclusively for about 2 years now. What a blessing it has been. Curls are separated, and keep their spirals all day. Towel dried, no other product simultaneously has yielded the best results for me. I have paid $38 dollars for one bottle previously, even at that price it is worth it! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried practically every curl cream and this one works best.&lt;br /&gt;For those of us with frizzy/curly hair, we know how challenging it can be to tame our hair.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the cream and let my hair air dry.  This seems to work best to control the frizz and create nice, defined curls.  I recommend Kenra Curl Cream to everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hairdresser recomended it and gave me a sample bottle, she would order it for me but, not for the price I can get it from Amazon.  I have grey curly hair and it can be very unruly at times, this controls my hair gives it a great shine and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out.  Shipping was prompt and I will continue to order this product as needed.</li>
            <li> This product works very well in keeping naturally wavy and frizzy hair from being too messy.  It doesn&#x27;t look shiny, oily, or sticky.  It holds the waves and curls together and reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> Great product for my naturally curly hair. Creates soft curls that don&#x27;t frizz and without any stickiness. I don&#x27;t use anything else. The product smells great too</li>
            <li> Exactly as described at half the salon price...and deliver right to my door! Cant beat that-especially when &amp;#34;running out&amp;#34; includes a 3 yr old!!</li>
            <li> Having naturally curly hair, I have searched for a product for years that would make my curls soft and defined, without the gel or wet look.  A friend gave me my first bottle of this Kenra Curl Defining Cream.  I have ordered several more off of Amazon, because I love it and cannot fathom the thought of running out.  I have done my Aunt&#x27;s hair, as well as a close friends that has naturally curly hair and they are big fans of the product now as well.  From one curly headed girl to another, buy it!, you won&#x27;t regret it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and I use it all the time.  Usually I purchase it from a salon or beauty supply store.  The two bottles I received online thru Amazon must have been old product.  The curling crème seemed watered down and did not seem to act the same way in my hair as bottles of this product I have purchased thru salons.  Not sure if this product has a shelf life as there is no expiration date on it.  Although on the bottle it says I can return the product if not satisfied, so I will be returning this to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells great, holds my hair but keeps it soft to the touch with out looking oily.  I have naturally curly/wavy hair and I have&lt;br /&gt;to put product in it or it just starts to frizz or looks fried.  When I put this in my hair and sometimes do a soft blowout the style will last for several days.  I now have short hair so the size of a dime/nickle does the trick for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair products for curls I have used so far (which has been a very wide variety).  I mix it with BioSilk Silk Therapy to dilute a bit, and apply on wet hair and leave to air dry.  Defines my curls very nicely, with no sticky mess.  This is the second time I am purchasing this product, and will continue to do so as long as it is on the market.</li>
            <li> I love my Kenra curl defining cream. With my naturally wavy/curly hair, many products are too heavy and weigh the curls down or give you that perpetual beach hair look. This product has the perfect amount of curl protection and longevity without being crunchy or flaky. The smell isn&#x27;t offensive and it saves so much time when you have to jump out the shower and head out without blow drying or straightening your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know HOW many curl products I have tried over the years from very high end salon products to your drug store variety but this is by far the most effective. If you have super loose waves, this may not be enough hold but for those of us who do have natural bounce that can easily become frizzy or crazy- this is enough to tame those waves without taking away their energy and playfulness.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat curly hair and I love this product! It keeps it from being frizzy!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, have been using Kenra Curl Defining Cream for over 6 months, and I love it!  It was recommended to me by my hairdresser who has curly hair himself.  I switched from using L&#x27;Oreal Curl Gel.  While it doesn&#x27;t quite hold as well as a gel (I face a lot of wind on the way into work while my hair is still wet), it still holds a curl well all day.  Additionally I&#x27;ve noticed fewer split ends since switching and I no longer have to worry about &amp;#34;crunching&amp;#34; my hair mid-morning if I put in too much.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin, color-treated, semi frizzy curly hair... it worked good even on my thin hair... and the smell is great.. not too strong.. if i dont find something that will work better with my thin hair i will stick to this one.. but im still searching for the perfect product.</li>
            <li> Great product and light weight.  Just one pump is needed for my should length hair.  The pump may need a push from below to work properly.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years! Perfect for keeping curls all day. No more frizz. Will keep buying this product. Love it!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Kenra Defining Crème - there is nothing bad about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is less expensive buying on line than through my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful - just delightful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds beautifully and humidity has never interfered with the way it works.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it. Not only, if defines your curls perfectly, but it smells like strawberry.  I got a great deal through Amazon and from now on that&#x27;s where I&#x27;ll go to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  But the only problem is that I ordered 2 separate cremes and the cost was $8 something each and they bundled it into a package deal so it cost me more.  I felt that was a ripoff, so I am not sure how to avoid this, but be careful.    I have natural curly hair and this product helps define my curls.</li>
            <li> After years of searching for the right curl product I have found what works best for me. This is my go-to curly hair product. This cream does not weigh my loosely curly hair down but does help control my frizz. The product is not crunchy at all.</li>
            <li> great stuff. works good.</li>
            <li> It took me 63 years to find a product that curls my hair so beautifully.  It handles bed head better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.  About a nickel-sized amount in my naturally curly hair creates a head full of curls that I can style with my fingers to cover any flat or bald spots.  Curl Defining Cream is the terrific.  I turned my hair designer onto it; she sells lots of it in our humid, coastal community.</li>
            <li> Present for Christmas and my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Keeps hair soft, and holds a curl.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and smells wonderful! I appreciated the seller taping the lids on as well because if they hadn&#x27;t there would have been a huge mess which happened when I packed it on a trip and it ended up all over my bag :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, only thing that keeps my naturally curly and unruly hair in check  Works like a charm and smells good too.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for curly hair. Smells delish!  Need to switch on and off with it though.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I love this product. It leaves my hair soft and frizz free,not crunchy and it smells good. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair I love it</li>
            <li> The best product I have found for making my thin, fine hair to look like it has body and curl.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for curly hair that I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s hard to find in stores but Amazon made it so easy.  I&#x27;ll never run out again.</li>
            <li> Awesome for Curly Hair!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my hairdresser and I absolutely love it but it can be very pricey in the salon. That&#x27;s why I looked it up here and found it right away. It comes in this 2 pack that can last me a while. This is a wonderful product for curly hair, not greasy, smells beautifully(fruity) and leaves your hair feeling light and shiny. I love it!</li>
            <li> My hair product graveyard will no longer grow! I have finally found THE ONE! I have wavy, frizzy hair that I have always hated. The only way I could ever get it to look curly is by making it crunchy, which is worse to me than looking bad. I have shoulder length hair and use just a dollop of this, come it through, diffuse on medium until damp, and voila! It dries curly-not frizzy, and, most importantly, SOFT so very soft! I have gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using it..me! Compliments on my hair! Which is never something I&#x27;ve ever gotten before! I hope they never quit making this stuff because I&#x27;m a lifer!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works good in the summer.&lt;br /&gt;Everything fine with delivery and received sooner than expected.&lt;br /&gt;one of the caps was broken, but other than that all good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before, so I know what a new, fresh bottle is like.  This stuff was runny, like it either melted at some point, or was just old product.  The 2 pack is a good price, but the quality wasn&#x27;t.  Lesson learned:  I&#x27;ll pay a little more next time for the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I order, order, and re-order this product. It&#x27;s the best product which separated curls and eliminates frizz without being crunchy or sticky. The smell is AWESOME. I don&#x27;t love the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34; that I get when using too much of this product so I&#x27;ve taken to mixing 1.5pumps of this product with a dime-sized amount of Moroccan Oil and the mixture after rubbing together in my hands is just perfect for all of my hair. (I have long, thick hair.) Expensive but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product solely based on the rave reviews and think it&#x27;s just OK. I have easy, light curls,&lt;br /&gt;so weight wise it is nice, but I feel it doesn&#x27;t stay in as long.Within a few hours my hair is frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using more than suggested. Also the curls don&#x27;t last as long (frizz) and droopy. Last thing is I don&#x27;t think it smells as FANTASTIC as everyone mentioned. For the money its worth the shot...it could work for you.</li>
            <li> Another winner from Kenra...and my happy hair.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lot&#x27;s of gels, but this is the best.. Not too stiff, and gives my hair a nice naturally curly look. It also seems to last most of the day, which i like, doesn&#x27;t go flat like some other products i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Brings out my curls without the frizz!  My curls are then soft and not crunchy or sticky.  I don&#x27;t need too much so it lasts a long time. And I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have fine curly hair. My curls are pretty uniform and tend towards ringlets. This curl cream provides just the right amount of hold for bouncy curls without weighing them down or making them crunchy. Just apply generously to very wet hair and dry with a diffuser. Boom!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser started me on this amazing product five years ago and I promise you if you have natural curly hair, this will tame it and define it so perfectly without the sticky greasy feel the other products I&#x27;ve tried left my hair!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointed .....</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, natural curly hair.  This product works fabulous on it!  Tames fly away hair, holds curl with softness and natural look.  Did I say I love this product?  One pump does job on wet hair.</li>
