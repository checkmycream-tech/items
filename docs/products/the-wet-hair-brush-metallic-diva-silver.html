            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done writing this review, I&#x27;m buying more.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this brush and I love it.</li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve made for myself in a long time.</li>
            <li>Perfect for long hair.</li>
            <li>So easy and pain free!</li>
            <li>I bought this brush in the hopes it would more easily brush out the tangles in my dog&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>find I get best result with really wet hair</li>
            <li>she said, The Wet Brush is one of her best.</li>
            <li>is truly the best $9 I&#x27;ve ever spent on myself.  </li>
            <li>Great and super fast shipping ,thank you</li>
            <li>Just as described and arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>it tends to tangle easily.  </li>
            <li>but this brush makes it painless and easy to untangle.  </li>
            <li>(that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) but the strong chemical smell of its material never went away.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Her hair is also fine and tangles easily.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that mats when I shampoo it.</li>
            <li>it works fine.  </li>
            <li>The brush is very good for untangling wet hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got fine, tangly hair, and am super picky about hair brushes.</li>
            <li>This brush is perfect for detangling my Great Lengths hair extensions without snagging the bonds at my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the bristles are so flexible, they will not tear your hair if you have a bad snag.</li>
            <li>I have lots of very fine hair that tangles like crazy after washing/conditioning, so I was happy to find a brush that does a good job of getting through the tangles.  </li>
            <li>No pulling to comb out the tangles - the brush runs right thru it!</li>
            <li>Perfect for tangled thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is baby fine and thin and this brush is wonderful for my hair.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the best brush to use to de tangle the hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product and the reality is that it does the job detangling my super fine hair without breaking it</li>
            <li>Overall, love it and would buy again!</li>
            <li>Worth buying to try out,</li>
            <li>The bristles on this brush are so soft that they just glide over the top of your hair.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite brush.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this brush since it had the highest star rating, but it wasn&#x27;t worth my money.  </li>
            <li>Also the price here is great usually pay 10-15 in stores</li>
            <li>Anyone w medium to long hair needs this kind of brush.</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, it glides right through my wet hair.</li>
            <li>The wet brush is amazing and goes right through my hair to get the knots out.</li>
            <li>The brush itself looks fine, soft bristles on the thinner side.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>The bristles bent the first time I used it to</li>
            <li>I love it and have already ordered a second brush for my grown daughter whose hair is even longer than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She brushed her hair out and said, &amp;#34;I love this brush!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Not sure what it is made of but it cannot be anything good....</li>
            <li>This brush is just as great for dry hair as is for wet.</li>
            <li>I have used this when my hair is wet, right after I wake up and after a night that involved a lot of hair spray and every time, it easily brushes through my hair without any effort.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Works great on wet or dry hair!</li>
            <li>Instead, the bristles will gently tug at your tangle over a series of passes with your brush until the tangle has worked</li>
            <li>Some gentle assistance with your fingertips might be needed if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My girls have curly hair &amp; this brush has made my life much easier.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li>how much can someone say about a brush.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s an ok brush, but it definitely didn&#x27;t wow me, and for the price it should have.</li>
            <li>love these - have 3 in 3 different rooms around the house for my 18 month old and her curly hair</li>
            <li>This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to function any better than any other brush</li>
            <li>LOVE the wet hair brush!!</li>
            <li>It just makes it a lot more comfortable and gentle to go through thin, fine, wet hair without feeling like you&#x27;re breaking lots of strands.</li>
            <li>I was so skeptical that this could actually work, but call me impressed!  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>In fact I&#x27;m going to buy another for my adult daughter!!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that easily tangles, especially when wet or  in the morning</li>
            <li>The 9 year old went from fussing daily about brushing her hair and yelling in pain to suddenly rarely complaining about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No crying from my daughter after showers to get her tangles out!</li>
            <li>This brush really glides through with minimal pain and seemed very gentle to my hair.</li>
            <li>bristles are incredibly soft against the soft!</li>
            <li>Therefore just 4 stars because I this won&#x27;t replace my old hair brush.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long and wavy, prone to knotting.</li>
            <li>But I still find hair on my brush when I&#x27;m through brushing, so it&#x27;s not like a miracle thing that completely solves that problem.</li>
            <li>and now it is completely unusable.  </li>
            <li>Before I could use it on my dog, my 10 year old granddaughter saw it and asked to use it after swimming.  </li>
            <li>Best brush for kids who hate to brush their hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a slight petroleum smell from the rubber backing for the bristles, but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have thick hair that tangles easily</li>
            <li>I have two daughters with very thick hair and this brush works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>It plows right through my rats nests, wet or dry, in just a couple swipes.  </li>
            <li>I am able to run the wet brush through towel-dried hair with hardly any resistance.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that&#x27;s thick, but fine texture and</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and tangles easily</li>
            <li>Detangles well, but I thought it would also cut down on how much hair came out when brushed.</li>

            <li> I have two daughters with very thick hair and this brush works great on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> It plows right through my rats nests, wet or dry, in just a couple swipes.  </li>

            <li> Detangles well, but I thought it would also cut down on how much hair came out when brushed.</li>
            <li> I have very thick course long hair that easily knots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s detangling features are not evident, if anything when I&#x27;m trying to brush my hair after washing it, it &amp;#34;falls out&amp;#34; of my hair because it gets stuck in the tangles, and the soft bristles just bend and &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; out of the hair, instead of going through it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does help with some tangles, but I&#x27;ve noticed it leaves other tangles behind since the bristles conform to the hair so easily.</li>
            <li> The Wet Brush is the only one that I have ever used that actually works.</li>
            <li> Kind of shocked this brush worked.</li>
            <li> If you have a woman/girl in your household with long hair, they need this.  </li>
            <li> Ahh....why didn&#x27;t I stumble upon this sooner?</li>
            <li> Except with this brush I can actually brush my wet hair.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it detangles my hair without breaking a thousand strands.  </li>

            <li> It still brushes my thick brown hair very well, and never tangles wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It is hard to brush down through my hair when it is wet, so I&#x27;m not 100% sold on the concept, but it definitely is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair at all.  </li>

            <li> This brush is perfect for detangling my Great Lengths hair extensions without snagging the bonds at my roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the bristles are so flexible, they will not tear your hair if you have a bad snag. Instead, the bristles will gently tug at your tangle over a series of passes with your brush until the tangle has worked it&#x27;s way out. Some gentle assistance with your fingertips might be needed if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> great brush  for extensions</li>
            <li> Great and super fast shipping ,thank you</li>
            <li> The brush itself looks fine, soft bristles on the thinner side. But it didn&#x27;t do what it advertised for my hair - I end up leaving just the same amount of hair in this brush as in the other one. It&#x27;s detangling features are not evident, if anything when I&#x27;m trying to brush my hair after washing it, it &amp;#34;falls out&amp;#34; of my hair because it gets stuck in the tangles, and the soft bristles just bend and &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; out of the hair, instead of going through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On dry hair, it&#x27;s an ok brush, but it definitely didn&#x27;t wow me, and for the price it should have.</li>
            <li> If you have a woman/girl in your household with long hair, they need this.  The 9 year old went from fussing daily about brushing her hair and yelling in pain to suddenly rarely complaining about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s great value there.  A happier home.</li>
            <li> bristles are incredibly soft against the soft! i was impressed! It still brushes my thick brown hair very well, and never tangles wet or dry. Great brush!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Works great on wet or dry hair! Detangles well, but I thought it would also cut down on how much hair came out when brushed. Overall, love it and would buy again!</li>
            <li> Just as described and arrived very quickly.  It is hard to brush down through my hair when it is wet, so I&#x27;m not 100% sold on the concept, but it definitely is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t tear my hair at all.  Worth buying to try out, and maybe I&#x27;ll learn to love it--</li>
            <li> Amazing hair brush Love it !!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these brushes at the same time and have been using them for about 6 months now.  Not impressed with them at all.  I have 2 daughters.  One with thick hair and the other with thin hair.  My daughter&#x27;s thin hair gets tangled a lot and is always hard to brush, especially after a bath.  I bought this wet brush in hopes to help with that.  This brush doesn&#x27;t seem to function any better than any other brush I&#x27;ve ever used  The bristles on both brushes already started to fall out after a few months use.  I won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Favorite brush! Ordered 2 more!</li>
            <li> Untangles every not in the hair there is. Great brush!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product and the reality is that it does the job detangling my super fine hair without breaking it (that&#x27;s why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1) but the strong chemical smell of its material never went away. I washed it, put powder on it, let it out for at least a month until I just had to put it in the recycling bin and buy another brush. Not sure what it is made of but it cannot be anything good....</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. My little girl loves it and no more tangles</li>
            <li> Ahh....why didn&#x27;t I stumble upon this sooner? Perfect for tangled thick hair.</li>
            <li> Runs through hair better than any brush I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this brush are so soft that they just glide over the top of your hair.  It was not useful to get out any tangles.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully. No complaints. I am loosing a lot less hair when brushing.</li>
            <li> This brush is so good for tangled hair. It doesn&#x27;t pull at all! Wish the handle was round instead of flat so that I could grip it easier but that&#x27;s the only complaint. Love this brush.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt when you brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;My daughter does not cry when I use the wet hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this to work because my hair (thick and elbow-length) is impossible to brush when wet. Except with this brush I can actually brush my wet hair. Of course I still use a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I find I get best result with really wet hair, just dry it with a towel, then brush it. If I wait until my hair is half dry I have issues again.&lt;br /&gt;For dry hair I prefer a different brush though. Therefore just 4 stars because I this won&#x27;t replace my old hair brush.</li>
            <li> Where has this brush been all my life? Seriously, the best brush to use to de tangle the hair. So easy and pain free!</li>
            <li> Anyone w medium to long hair needs this kind of brush. Also the price here is great usually pay 10-15 in stores</li>
            <li> I swear by these brushes! My daughter and I have thick hair that tangles easily and these brushes go through it easily! No crying from my daughter after showers to get her tangles out! Love these!</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing!  I have long hair that&#x27;s thick, but fine texture and it tends to tangle easily.  This brush gave me back the 5 to 10 minutes I was spending every day to detangle my hair.  This is my second time to purchase one of these brushes.  I decided it would be nice to have one in my vehicle in case I&#x27;m running late and need to detangle on the way to work.  LOVE the wet hair brush!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that mats when I shampoo it. Combing it out is a nightmare no matter what product I use. The Wet Brush is the only one that I have ever used that actually works. I recommend it highly. In fact I&#x27;m going to buy another for my adult daughter!!</li>
            <li> iོ lོoོvོeོ iོtོ ! gོrོeོaོtོ fོoོrོ fོiོnོeོ lོoོnོgོ hོaོiོrོ.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this brush.  He uses it on his synthetic hair and it doesn&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> Kind of shocked this brush worked. My hair is pretty long and wavy, prone to knotting. This brush really glides through with minimal pain and seemed very gentle to my hair.</li>
            <li> The brush works way better than the comb.  I LOVE this brush.  I have long hair and it detangles my hair without breaking a thousand strands.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I used to dread combing my hair out after a shower, due to the pain from all the tangles. Not anymore, this brush has changed my life. Best purchase I&#x27;ve made for myself in a long time.</li>
            <li> I have lots of very fine hair that tangles like crazy after washing/conditioning, so I was happy to find a brush that does a good job of getting through the tangles.  I would recommend still going slowly because I have ripped out hair going too fast when brushing.</li>
            <li> Best brush for kids who hate to brush their hair.  My daughter would never brush her hair when it was wet (and not often when dry).  She will not stop brushing her hair now that she has this brush.  She loves it and so do I!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair that tangles easily. I was using a wide tooth comb in the shower after applying conditioner and then again before blow drying my hair. This brush has eliminated the need for both steps. I am able to run the wet brush through towel-dried hair with hardly any resistance. I&#x27;m a happy customer!</li>
            <li> Love this brush. We now have two. I have two daughters with very thick hair and this brush works great on wet or dry hair. It is a lot less painful to brush out their hair using this brush. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Best brush ever!</li>
            <li> Great brush. I use it under the running shower to untangle my long hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this brush. Recommended by my hairdresser (she has made major purchases in the past on high-end hair brushes and was not impressed) she said, The Wet Brush is one of her best. I agree! It does EVERYTHING it claims to do and more, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long, fine and the ends tend to get dry, so tangling is common and post-shower detangling is an annoying ritual.  I was so skeptical that this could actually work, but call me impressed!  It plows right through my rats nests, wet or dry, in just a couple swipes.  And, totally painless.  I can&#x27;t believe what a timesaver it is, I wish I had discovered this brush years ago.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite brush.  My hair is thin and tangles easily but this brush makes it painless and easy to untangle.  This brush is just as great for dry hair as is for wet.</li>
            <li> These brushes make it so that your scalp doesn&#x27;t hurt when you brush your hair, especially if it&#x27;s fine hair prone to tangling. But I still find hair on my brush when I&#x27;m through brushing, so it&#x27;s not like a miracle thing that completely solves that problem. It just makes it a lot more comfortable and gentle to go through thin, fine, wet hair without feeling like you&#x27;re breaking lots of strands.</li>
            <li> Perfect for long hair. Bought it for my girls. They always have tanked hair every morning they wake up and shower. This just what they need.</li>
            <li> The brush is very good for untangling wet hair. Recommend by my hairstylist and I love it.</li>
            <li> Best hairbrush ever. My girls have curly hair &amp; this brush has made my life much easier.</li>
            <li> After reading a few articles about this brush, I decided to check it out.  I have long, fine hair that easily tangles, especially when wet or  in the morning after I wake up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how it works, but this brush truly is a miracle.  It brushes through my hair like silk.  No tugging, no breaking, no pain.  I have used this when my hair is wet, right after I wake up and after a night that involved a lot of hair spray and every time, it easily brushes through my hair without any effort.&lt;br /&gt;This is truly the best $9 I&#x27;ve ever spent on myself.  When I&#x27;m done writing this review, I&#x27;m buying more.  One for my travel bag and a couple of friends with the same tangling problems that I have.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> how much can someone say about a brush.  It is not too stiff or too loose. it works fine.  I am happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this brush since it had the highest star rating, but it wasn&#x27;t worth my money.  The bristles bent the first time I used it to and now it is completely unusable.  Don&#x27;t buy this brush.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Daughter has thick curly hair and very hard to brush now with Wet Brush its a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, almost to my waist. This brush is amazing, it glides right through my wet hair. I love it and have already ordered a second brush for my grown daughter whose hair is even longer than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight petroleum smell from the rubber backing for the bristles, but it quickly fades. I don&#x27;t know what everyone else is complaining about. Give it a little time.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this brush and I love it. My hair is baby fine and thin and this brush is wonderful for my hair. No pulling to comb out the tangles - the brush runs right thru it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got fine, tangly hair, and am super picky about hair brushes. This brush is perfection.</li>
            <li> It does help with some tangles, but I&#x27;ve noticed it leaves other tangles behind since the bristles conform to the hair so easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in the hopes it would more easily brush out the tangles in my dog&#x27;s hair.  Before I could use it on my dog, my 10 year old granddaughter saw it and asked to use it after swimming.  Her hair is also fine and tangles easily.  This brush swept through my granddaughter&#x27;s hair as though there were no severe tangles in it!  She brushed her hair out and said, &amp;#34;I love this brush!&amp;#34;  That settled it for me.  I ordered one for her and one for her mother who also has thick hair that tangles after washing.  Oh, by the way, it works splendidly on my dog&#x27;s hair, too.</li>
            <li> I have very thick course long hair that easily knots. The wet brush is amazing and goes right through my hair to get the knots out. The brush does have a strange smell that lessons over time. Wonder what the brush is made out of? In the meantime, it works great!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t brush as well as I expected</li>
            <li> Works great for my daughter&#x27;s tangled hair. She can brush through her hair without it hurting.</li>
            <li> love these - have 3 in 3 different rooms around the house for my 18 month old and her curly hair</li>
            <li> I think my brush is fake.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. I can walk out of the shower and brush my hair immediately without pain.</li>
