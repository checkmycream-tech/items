            <li>this product&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy for sure</li>
            <li>I love flowers and this parfume smells just like a a field of flowers.</li>
            <li>Many people  have asked me what it is, so they can get it for themselfs</li>
            <li>the scent is just OK and the scent dissappears after about 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Also I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Love the fragance, you can&#x27;t get a better price, I bought two, one for me and another one for my mom.</li>
            <li>This was suppose to be SEX in The City Love, it was some off brand that said SEXY CITY Love...</li>
            <li>i love this product-</li>
            <li>everyone is going to fall in love with this product-</li>
            <li>I ordered Sex In The City Love for Women and they sent me Sex</li>
            <li>Words cannot express how much I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>but I got something that says \\&quot;Sex and the City 2 Love Perfume and Lotion\\</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>would have gotten a better deal elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I ordered the perfume Sex in the City Love.</li>
            <li>I received a perfume labeled Sex in the City Love 2.</li>
            <li>An absolute steal great quality for the price i paid.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume.</li>
            <li>The size of the perfume is just overwhelming too.</li>

            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>When I decided to look for my favorite perfume on \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;, I had.</li>
            <li>i love them...</li>
            <li>Glo  : )</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at all, smells like soap residue, gave it to a friend and she loved it!, but I&#x27;ll never buy this product again, not unless I want to smell like old soap residue.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t absolutely amazing, but is still pretty nice</li>
            <li>Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good.</li>
            <li>The scent is even as described--it&#x27;s a nice sweet floral.</li>
            <li>and pretty I can&#x27;t believe I just got this amazing bottle of perfume at such a great price so quickly.certainly will order from them again!!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim after it was the third most popular bought on Amazon, thinking that this would pleasantly surprise me.</li>
            <li>Smells more like a cheap body spray rather than a perfume.</li>
            <li>It is light, airy and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a car because frankly there isn&#x27;t a strong need for one.</li>
            <li>I bought this fragrance when it first came out and everyone liked it, don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened since then.</li>
            <li>it was ok, fragnance goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>But if you like mild fragances it will be ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m rather sensitive to perfume and the smell is not too strong so its good.  </li>
            <li>My wife is a HUGE fan of Sex in the City</li>
            <li>the bottle was it was so huge</li>
            <li>The box is cheap, the bottle is cheap, the perfume is cheap.</li>
            <li>This perfume is a cheap smell</li>
            <li>I bought it  For a smell trial because is cheap .I  </li>
            <li>Scent was great, but the extra body spray that came with didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li>Makes a great Birthday, Christmas or just because present.</li>
            <li>The scent is light</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It was delivered on time and was cheap.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks veeeeery cheap.</li>
            <li>contact your retailer to order your&lt;br /&gt;recovery as he has received it should be guarded in our&lt;br /&gt;MIAMI</li>
            <li>I instantly thought \\&quot;WOW, I did good, so proud of myself for looking for cheaper.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>is important have this product</li>
            <li>Guess the perfume was cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li>thanks love it love it</li>
            <li>They sell a cheap copy of the original perfume.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend if you already know what the original smells like.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t worth the money at all!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to buy in a store for a higher price and assurance of validity.</li>
            <li>I found this one that was well below than what I had originally paid for, so I went ahead and ordered</li>
            <li>Then as I look closely, I see that my original box had \\&quot;Sex in the City;</li>
            <li>I can say the bottle of very cute and so far hasn&#x27;t leaked.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li>Yes this Smells very nice but lasts a total of 10 Minutes if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li>i like it for semi special things like dates and get-togethers.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is just the right scent for me!</li>
            <li>opened the box and the smell didn&#x27;t get better; it smells straight up like alcohol, I would return</li>
            <li>order if you want your perfume intact, and that actually smells good...</li>
            <li>&amp; I wouldn&#x27;t get my full purchase.</li>
            <li>AND I WILL BE ORDERING MORE FROM THIS COLLECTION VERY SOON</li>
            <li>Good purchase for a middle school tween.</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet then softens throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Its ultra feminine and sweet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft like the Juicy Couture that I own.</li>
            <li>It said it would take 7-10 business days, and fair enough it got there as said.</li>
            <li>Ya get what you pay for was so true in this case</li>
            <li>sweet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a sweet smell but sex at the same time and my husband loved it.</li>
            <li>It was mainly what I wanted and it was okay.</li>
            <li>but it did serve its purpose adequately.</li>
            <li>nice big bottle light smell for price i wear when going out to store are around the house</li>
            <li>Actually i found it fresh and very sexy.</li>
            <li>Also, since christmas is starting to roll around I thought it might be nice to just order some quick gifts, so when I saw 90% off</li>
            <li>I wish they lasted a long time on the skin and clothes because the smells are very nice, especially this one, Love.</li>
            <li>The product was very inexpensive and it was a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>it smells light and fresh, there really arent any notes that stand out to me.</li>
            <li>Does not have a fresh smell.</li>
            <li>doesnt look like a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>looks far better online than the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like alcohol and using the bottle very fast to cover it up.</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Well first of all i bought this product because of its name.</li>
            <li>I received a \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; knockoff instead of the actual Sex in the City perfume.  </li>
            <li>This knockoff smells like it&#x27;s made mostly of alcohol, which it likely is.</li>
            <li>:) I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li>This was my first order on amazon</li>
            <li>What I received is exactly what is advertised and pictured.  </li>
            <li>I got the bottle called \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; (Pictured above) and was bummed because this was supposed to be a gift for my friend.</li>
            <li>Scent does not last for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Thanks Again!</li>
            <li>First they said it&#x27;s gonna be shipped by 3-5 business days, but it took like two weeks to do so.</li>
            <li>My son smelled it on me the first time and asked me to order one for his girlfriend.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t even last through 1/2 day without having to re-apply more.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li>I had first purchased \\&quot;Sex in the City</li>
            <li>I enjoy this fragrance and was surprised because of the price.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I spent cheap and got a cheap product.</li>
            <li>The oz&#x27; on the bottles were very little, but I loved the scent I had to get it again.</li>
            <li>Thickly sweet, not even for a young woman on an evening out.</li>
            <li>THis is another mild fragrance that would fade out near the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much its not overbearing and last pretty long too.</li>
            <li>All my previous experiences with Amazon.com had been honest and very plesant.  </li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve known I wasn&#x27;t going to get the real thing based on such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>I guess when they make perfume to sell for $15 a pop, the alcohol is not enough or there&#x27;s something cheap that&#x27;s being used.</li>
            <li>The packaging on this perfume is neat and the bottle and cap is very sleek looking</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
            <li>She really really likes it too.  </li>
            <li>Its smell is very seductive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like some people get the real thing</li>
            <li>IT WAS ALL THAT I EXPECTED AND MORE.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is a knock off of a knock off.</li>
            <li>and it really lasts.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t beat the price and it was the real thing, not a knockoff .</li>
            <li>so I really hope she likes it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
            <li>But I have no idea how I did not think i was getting the real deal at 3.00 bucks.  </li>
            <li>But shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>Fast arrival.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly as described--brand new, in box, still wrapped.</li>
            <li>I can assure you that the cologne is not fake ( are you aware that they sell cologne....which is very light scent and does not last very long</li>
            <li>But other than that, the product wasmgood and okay.</li>
            <li>It does seem to wear off faster than my other top quality perfumes.</li>
            <li>It was in the same designed box, perfume, lotion, shower gel as my original.</li>
            <li>The only positive was that I received my order quickly.  </li>
            <li>so more than half was spilled out , also it smelled like pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Yet the smell is too sweet, tangy, and pungent all mixed together.</li>
            <li>Next time if you want a good product and use the perfume....it lasts longer too  because you only use a tiny amt to your pressure points ( wrists and by your ears....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a HUGE bottle that lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li>Yea I&#x27;m glad I only ordered this because of the extremely low price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent fades quickly which is just as well because someone probably mixed it in their basement.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to everyone that is on a budget.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap knock off - not really perfume.  </li>
            <li>but personally it&#x27;s not even worth the return shipping or</li>
            <li>I think it was well worth it, overall....</li>
            <li>The second thing is that this item is faked and worth nothing.</li>
            <li>When this perfume came in, I found that the top had leaked and wasted perfume.</li>
            <li>I loved it and was excited when I found it for less than half price after shipping &amp; handling!!!</li>
            <li>I was afraid to even use it because of how the presentation looked, and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all!</li>
            <li>The bottle is super cute too with little beads drifting the bottom of the pink glass.</li>
            <li>and it got sent to an adress i dont even live at....</li>
            <li>This is authenic and came brand new in the box WITH the plastic over it too.</li>
            <li>a cheap imitation, don&#x27;t buy this perfum.</li>
            <li>What kind of item had such a heavy shipping charges attached?</li>
            <li>The smell appears to be a very old fragrance even when used with the shower gel.</li>
            <li>It came in a very classy bottle.</li>
            <li>an the City is Sexy City does not smell and the picture is so small</li>
            <li>I think back and say that the price was a knock off price, and that&#x27;s exactly what I</li>
            <li>I bought a bunch of these perfume sets by Sex and the City in different scents besides Love, but none of the Sex in the City perfumes last long on me at all.</li>
            <li>The product came nicely wrapped inside the box, but when I took the tape away, the cap was a little loose.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll definitely wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>Not even an hour later the smell starts to wear off and smell like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li>My experience made clear (to me) I was not dealing with people who respect their customer.</li>
            <li>Either there was a mistake from Tuccini staff or from the hotel staff, but the hotel staff delivered another different order bought straight from Amazon.com  </li>
            <li>will not waste even    a $1 on it ever.</li>
            <li>It did surprise me, I&#x27;m 20 years old and its too young for me.</li>
            <li>I smell like a musty old lady who lives in a story book one bedroom closet.</li>
            <li>smell soft and not strong!beautiful bottle.</li>
            <li>I purchased 3 of these for gifts and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>can smell  soft</li>
            <li>this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li>I tried to wipe away the wasted perfume when I got back to my dorm, but the sticker on the front started to rub off and the silver around the top started to chip..</li>
            <li>The bottle is good quality, but the strength of the scent is questionable.</li>
            <li>The scent is fresh, crisp yet subtle.</li>
            <li>If Big smelled this, he would have left her picking up pearls in Paris and drove straight to the airport.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been okay if it had just smelled the same, or at least close to.</li>
            <li>I assume it smelled great because she didn&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li>this is truly false advertising here, mine came and it was called sexy city, not sex in the city, and then the sprayer part broke</li>
            <li>In 2 The City Love for Women; they smell completely different with the latter scent being incredibly weak.</li>
            <li>Disappointed even though it was a great price.</li>
            <li>and I did not expect anything to come this fast, it was less then three business days.  </li>
            <li>Smells soft and girly but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all!!</li>

            <li> Love the fragance, you can&#x27;t get a better price, I bought two, one for me and another one for my mom.</li>

            <li> but I got something that says \\&quot;Sex and the City 2 Love Perfume and Lotion\\</li>
            <li> just okay.</li>
            <li> would have gotten a better deal elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I ordered the perfume Sex in the City Love.</li>
            <li> I received a perfume labeled Sex in the City Love 2.</li>
            <li> An absolute steal great quality for the price i paid.</li>

            <li> When I decided to look for my favorite perfume on \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;, I had.</li>
            <li> i love them...</li>
            <li> Glo  : )</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at all, smells like soap residue, gave it to a friend and she loved it!, but I&#x27;ll never buy this product again, not unless I want to smell like old soap residue.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t absolutely amazing, but is still pretty nice</li>
            <li> Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product.</li>
            <li> Its pretty good.</li>
            <li> The scent is even as described--it&#x27;s a nice sweet floral.</li>
            <li> and pretty I can&#x27;t believe I just got this amazing bottle of perfume at such a great price so quickly.certainly will order from them again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after it was the third most popular bought on Amazon, thinking that this would pleasantly surprise me.</li>
            <li> Smells more like a cheap body spray rather than a perfume.</li>
            <li> It is light, airy and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a car because frankly there isn&#x27;t a strong need for one.</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance when it first came out and everyone liked it, don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened since then.</li>
            <li> it was ok, fragnance goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> But if you like mild fragances it will be ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rather sensitive to perfume and the smell is not too strong so its good.  </li>
            <li> My wife is a HUGE fan of Sex in the City</li>
            <li> the bottle was it was so huge</li>
            <li> The box is cheap, the bottle is cheap, the perfume is cheap.</li>
            <li> This perfume is a cheap smell</li>
            <li> I bought it  For a smell trial because is cheap .I  </li>
            <li> Scent was great, but the extra body spray that came with didn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> Makes a great Birthday, Christmas or just because present.</li>
            <li> The scent is light</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It was delivered on time and was cheap.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks veeeeery cheap.</li>
            <li> contact your retailer to order your&lt;br /&gt;recovery as he has received it should be guarded in our&lt;br /&gt;MIAMI</li>
            <li> I instantly thought \\&quot;WOW, I did good, so proud of myself for looking for cheaper.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> is important have this product</li>
            <li> Guess the perfume was cheap for a reason.  </li>
            <li> thanks love it love it</li>
            <li> They sell a cheap copy of the original perfume.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend if you already know what the original smells like.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t worth the money at all!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to buy in a store for a higher price and assurance of validity.</li>
            <li> I found this one that was well below than what I had originally paid for, so I went ahead and ordered</li>
            <li> Then as I look closely, I see that my original box had \\&quot;Sex in the City;</li>
            <li> I can say the bottle of very cute and so far hasn&#x27;t leaked.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was so excited about getting it.</li>
            <li> Yes this Smells very nice but lasts a total of 10 Minutes if you are lucky.  </li>
            <li> i like it for semi special things like dates and get-togethers.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is just the right scent for me!</li>
            <li> opened the box and the smell didn&#x27;t get better; it smells straight up like alcohol, I would return</li>
            <li> order if you want your perfume intact, and that actually smells good...</li>
            <li> &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t get my full purchase.</li>
            <li> AND I WILL BE ORDERING MORE FROM THIS COLLECTION VERY SOON</li>
            <li> Good purchase for a middle school tween.</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet then softens throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Its ultra feminine and sweet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft like the Juicy Couture that I own.</li>
            <li> It said it would take 7-10 business days, and fair enough it got there as said.</li>
            <li> Ya get what you pay for was so true in this case</li>
            <li> sweet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a sweet smell but sex at the same time and my husband loved it.</li>
            <li> It was mainly what I wanted and it was okay.</li>
            <li> but it did serve its purpose adequately.</li>
            <li> nice big bottle light smell for price i wear when going out to store are around the house</li>
            <li> Actually i found it fresh and very sexy.</li>
            <li> Also, since christmas is starting to roll around I thought it might be nice to just order some quick gifts, so when I saw 90% off</li>
            <li> I wish they lasted a long time on the skin and clothes because the smells are very nice, especially this one, Love.</li>
            <li> The product was very inexpensive and it was a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> it smells light and fresh, there really arent any notes that stand out to me.</li>
            <li> Does not have a fresh smell.</li>
            <li> doesnt look like a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> looks far better online than the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like alcohol and using the bottle very fast to cover it up.</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Well first of all i bought this product because of its name.</li>
            <li> I received a \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; knockoff instead of the actual Sex in the City perfume.  </li>
            <li> This knockoff smells like it&#x27;s made mostly of alcohol, which it likely is.</li>
            <li> :) I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> This was my first order on amazon</li>
            <li> What I received is exactly what is advertised and pictured.  </li>
            <li> I got the bottle called \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; (Pictured above) and was bummed because this was supposed to be a gift for my friend.</li>
            <li> Scent does not last for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Thanks Again!</li>
            <li> First they said it&#x27;s gonna be shipped by 3-5 business days, but it took like two weeks to do so.</li>
            <li> My son smelled it on me the first time and asked me to order one for his girlfriend.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even last through 1/2 day without having to re-apply more.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> I had first purchased \\&quot;Sex in the City</li>
            <li> I enjoy this fragrance and was surprised because of the price.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I spent cheap and got a cheap product.</li>
            <li> The oz&#x27; on the bottles were very little, but I loved the scent I had to get it again.</li>
            <li> Thickly sweet, not even for a young woman on an evening out.</li>
            <li> THis is another mild fragrance that would fade out near the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much its not overbearing and last pretty long too.</li>
            <li> All my previous experiences with Amazon.com had been honest and very plesant.  </li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known I wasn&#x27;t going to get the real thing based on such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I guess when they make perfume to sell for $15 a pop, the alcohol is not enough or there&#x27;s something cheap that&#x27;s being used.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this perfume is neat and the bottle and cap is very sleek looking</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like that smell.</li>
            <li> She really really likes it too.  </li>
            <li> Its smell is very seductive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like some people get the real thing</li>
            <li> IT WAS ALL THAT I EXPECTED AND MORE.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is a knock off of a knock off.</li>
            <li> and it really lasts.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price and it was the real thing, not a knockoff .</li>
            <li> so I really hope she likes it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really care for the smell</li>
            <li> But I have no idea how I did not think i was getting the real deal at 3.00 bucks.  </li>
            <li> But shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly as described--brand new, in box, still wrapped.</li>
            <li> I can assure you that the cologne is not fake ( are you aware that they sell cologne....which is very light scent and does not last very long</li>
            <li> But other than that, the product wasmgood and okay.</li>
            <li> It does seem to wear off faster than my other top quality perfumes.</li>
            <li> It was in the same designed box, perfume, lotion, shower gel as my original.</li>
            <li> The only positive was that I received my order quickly.  </li>
            <li> so more than half was spilled out , also it smelled like pure rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Yet the smell is too sweet, tangy, and pungent all mixed together.</li>
            <li> Next time if you want a good product and use the perfume....it lasts longer too  because you only use a tiny amt to your pressure points ( wrists and by your ears....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a HUGE bottle that lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> Yea I&#x27;m glad I only ordered this because of the extremely low price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent fades quickly which is just as well because someone probably mixed it in their basement.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to everyone that is on a budget.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knock off - not really perfume.  </li>
            <li> but personally it&#x27;s not even worth the return shipping or</li>
            <li> I think it was well worth it, overall....</li>
            <li> The second thing is that this item is faked and worth nothing.</li>
            <li> When this perfume came in, I found that the top had leaked and wasted perfume.</li>
            <li> I loved it and was excited when I found it for less than half price after shipping &amp; handling!!!</li>
            <li> I was afraid to even use it because of how the presentation looked, and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all!</li>
            <li> The bottle is super cute too with little beads drifting the bottom of the pink glass.</li>
            <li> and it got sent to an adress i dont even live at....</li>
            <li> This is authenic and came brand new in the box WITH the plastic over it too.</li>
            <li> a cheap imitation, don&#x27;t buy this perfum.</li>
            <li> What kind of item had such a heavy shipping charges attached?</li>
            <li> The smell appears to be a very old fragrance even when used with the shower gel.</li>
            <li> It came in a very classy bottle.</li>
            <li> an the City is Sexy City does not smell and the picture is so small</li>
            <li> I think back and say that the price was a knock off price, and that&#x27;s exactly what I</li>
            <li> I bought a bunch of these perfume sets by Sex and the City in different scents besides Love, but none of the Sex in the City perfumes last long on me at all.</li>
            <li> The product came nicely wrapped inside the box, but when I took the tape away, the cap was a little loose.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll definitely wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Not even an hour later the smell starts to wear off and smell like pure alcohol.</li>
            <li> My experience made clear (to me) I was not dealing with people who respect their customer.</li>
            <li> Either there was a mistake from Tuccini staff or from the hotel staff, but the hotel staff delivered another different order bought straight from Amazon.com  </li>
            <li> will not waste even    a $1 on it ever.</li>
            <li> It did surprise me, I&#x27;m 20 years old and its too young for me.</li>
            <li> I smell like a musty old lady who lives in a story book one bedroom closet.</li>
            <li> smell soft and not strong!beautiful bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these for gifts and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> can smell  soft</li>
            <li> this product help for complete anything.</li>
            <li> I tried to wipe away the wasted perfume when I got back to my dorm, but the sticker on the front started to rub off and the silver around the top started to chip..</li>
            <li> The bottle is good quality, but the strength of the scent is questionable.</li>
            <li> The scent is fresh, crisp yet subtle.</li>
            <li> If Big smelled this, he would have left her picking up pearls in Paris and drove straight to the airport.</li>
            <li> It would&#x27;ve been okay if it had just smelled the same, or at least close to.</li>
            <li> I assume it smelled great because she didn&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> this is truly false advertising here, mine came and it was called sexy city, not sex in the city, and then the sprayer part broke</li>
            <li> In 2 The City Love for Women; they smell completely different with the latter scent being incredibly weak.</li>
            <li> Disappointed even though it was a great price.</li>
            <li> and I did not expect anything to come this fast, it was less then three business days.  </li>
            <li> Smells soft and girly but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all!!</li>
            <li> The only thing i dont like is that the fragrance doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Watery, sticky and scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> This perfume smells alright but doesnt last long.</li>
            <li> they also offer the perfume which is alot stronger and long lasting)</li>
            <li> But the scent does not last long.</li>
            <li> but I prefer perfumes that have a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> Bad thing though, if too much is sprayed on the clothes, the smell still lightly lingers on your clothes even after being washed</li>
            <li> only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is because the smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft but not strong smelling either.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the product is the bottle is so large and wide</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sad at it because it was cheap.</li>
            <li> BUT it does not stay for long</li>
            <li> I received my order earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Get What you Pay For ..\\&quot; excuse.</li>
            <li> I personally collect perfume bottles, not really paying attention to the brand or smell.</li>
            <li> i hate the smell of the perfume I thought it would smell good</li>
            <li> I ended up offering it to my friend from China, who said she liked it.. :(</li>
            <li> I received a bad copy &#x27;sexy city&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This time people from Tuccini claim they have delivered the product, nevertheless, it never arrived to the hands of the person expected to receive it.   </li>
            <li> arrived with pink  label melted off.</li>
            <li> Curious</li>
            <li> not what I expected and the scent disappears</li>
            <li> It came sooner than what I expected it to come in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to open this as the bottle is large and soooooo glam!!</li>
            <li> When I got this the bottle was broken and it leaked out of the rim and this was new</li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy this product by the low price, But the scent is lovely,but as stated in the other reviews  the bottle is hard to hold on to.</li>
            <li> Not the real was a fake</li>
            <li> it does make for awkward spraying, but the smell is well worth it.</li>
            <li> If you buy from this seller know that it is a fake and not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving to my little sister-</li>
            <li> This cologne I was not familiar with, but I like the scent</li>
            <li> However it was not a unique scent</li>
            <li> This perfum is not original</li>
            <li> This parfume is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return the item because I felt that it would be a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I felt cheated that my perfume had wasted all over the box</li>
            <li> , I order it and just wait a few for it to come.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FAKED, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING</li>
            <li> i tame</li>
            <li> , i still have a full bottle of fake, broken perfume!</li>
            <li> &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; FYI not safe on silk.</li>
            <li> not overwhelming at all-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It scared me to read some of the past reviews the day before it was to be delivered to my door</li>
            <li> This is probably due to poor quality of the perfume.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good for body spray, but as a perfume, they fail miserably.</li>
            <li> After reading several negative reviews I was skeptical about the seller/product.</li>
            <li> I have got really upset and disappointed with Tuccini staff.</li>
            <li> When my perfume arrived the cap was broken and the bottom of the box was soiled in wasted perfume.</li>
            <li> I hated this perfume and I am a perfume addict I rarely come across perfume</li>
            <li> I buy a lot from Amazon for seversl years now and this purchase is my first real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I very anxiously opened up the wrapped box set and sprayed the perfume.</li>
            <li> but when you put it on, the smell dissapears completely after a few minutes.what a horrible  waste of money.</li>
            <li> The bad thing was the costly delivery charges for this SINGLE item :</li>
            <li> but not great.</li>
            <li> When it came the outer box was broken.</li>
            <li> Perfume sprayer came broken</li>
            <li> just tap the together and also use you wrists to put it behind your ears...</li>
            <li> and they stand behind their items they sell....</li>
            <li> The bottle came and was broken</li>
            <li> I should have read the negative reviews prior to adding this crap to my cart!!</li>
            <li> These guys sent me fake parfume .</li>
            <li> is it fake or something</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Silly Me.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.  </li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Was afraid to have surprises&lt;</li>
            <li> Everything on campus is within walking distance and having to pay for parking tags/tickets is inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I am indeed disappointed with Tuccini and do not recommend them, not even to those guys I do not care for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like &gt;:(</li>
            <li> It stinks!</li>
            <li> i was disappointed</li>
            <li> Very bad smell for a knock-off.</li>
            <li> The worst thing is that it was a Christmas gift to my mother.</li>
            <li> Ugly smell!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Delivers what it promises. Buyer Venezuela</li>
            <li> My perfume was lovely to smell and the bottle was beautiful.  I also got two others and they were the same.  Just as wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this perfume to everyone!</li>
            <li> I like it. It was mainly what I wanted and it was okay. The bad thing was the costly delivery charges for this SINGLE item :(\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;The item had a pricing of $1.33 and the shipping charges was $8.55. Like.... what the hell!! What kind of item had such a heavy shipping charges attached? I feel cheated and ripped of with this fee/charge. Guess it was too good to be true. I regret making this purchase. I should have read the negative reviews prior to adding this crap to my cart!!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS AND I DID NOT GET THE SEX IN THE CITY LOVE INSTEAD I GOT SEX IN THE CITY LOVE 2 IT SMELLS GOOD BUT I WAS EXPECTING WHAT WAS SHOWN ON THE PICTURE</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It just gives you an extra level of confidence..plus the smell isn&#x27;t over baring at all.</li>
            <li> great price!! got it in the mail  and sprayed it on me, it felt like i was spraying water on myself, just spayed it on me @730am, cant smell it at 9am. im not buying perfume from this site again!</li>
            <li> Hello,  Received this product in the mail today 12/2/11 and the product for  price was amazing. The smell is wonderful and my wife loves it. Will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic steal!! Great price and lovely smell. This is a product I definitely don&#x27;t regret purchasing. I would purchase this product again and I recommend it to others :)</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance.  I&#x27;m rather sensitive to perfume and the smell is not too strong so its good.  The only thing i dont like is that the fragrance doesnt last long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the order, the service was so good, i hope can get more products of your company soon. gh</li>
            <li> This perfume smells the same as Lust. I was expecting it to smell different from Lust. Will not buy Sex In the City perfume again. This perfume is a cheap smell but if you can&#x27;t afford a 20 dollar perfume; sex in the city perfume is a good perfume. You just have to watch what you buy.</li>
            <li> These guys sent me fake parfume . Instead of \\&quot;Sex in the city love Women\\&quot;  they sent me \\&quot;Sexy City LOVE\\&quot;. Never buy from them.</li>
            <li> The product came nicely wrapped inside the box, but when I took the tape away, the cap was a little loose. But other than that, the product wasmgood and okay. For the price, was a good deal.</li>
            <li> I had recently purchased two perfumes from Tuccini via Amazon.com. All my previous experiences with Amazon.com had been honest and very plesant.  This time people from Tuccini claim they have delivered the product, nevertheless, it never arrived to the hands of the person expected to receive it.   Either there was a mistake from Tuccini staff or from the hotel staff, but the hotel staff delivered another different order bought straight from Amazon.com  People from Tuccini refused to reimburse my purchase and now they do not even answer my e-mails.  I have got really upset and disappointed with Tuccini staff. My experience made clear (to me) I was not dealing with people who respect their customer. I am indeed disappointed with Tuccini and do not recommend them, not even to those guys I do not care for.</li>
            <li> They sent me sexy city instead of sex in the city. WHat the hell. I do not recommend buying this item from amazon.com. They sell a cheap copy of the original perfume.</li>
            <li> arrived with pink  label melted off. I could not use the item.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the bottle of perfume, the bottle was all chipped and there were smudges of the perfume all over the lid. I was afraid to even use it because of how the presentation looked, and it doesn&#x27;t smell good at all!</li>
            <li> it was an exelente purchase, i think its the best way to buy a product. really nice perfume!!&lt;br /&gt;greetings from venezuela</li>
            <li> is ok  the perfume is a good perfume I recommend to friends and  family and friends is ok  the perfume is a good perfume</li>
            <li> This parfume is a waste of money. I bought it  For a smell trial because is cheap .I  will not waste even    a $1 on it ever. It has no smell at all.!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> i got this as a gift but wanted to review it here. it smells light and fresh, there really arent any notes that stand out to me. i like it for semi special things like dates and get-togethers.</li>
            <li> El producto es Muy Bueno, su presentación es hermosa, y su fragancia es buenisima, la recomiendo,y la tienda es buy responsable, el producto me llego antes de lo esperado.</li>
            <li> I got a thing called Sexy City... a cheap imitation, don&#x27;t buy this perfum. The smell doesn&#x27;t last even a couple of hours</li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy this product by the low price, But the scent is lovely,but as stated in the other reviews  the bottle is hard to hold on to.Its shape is too big and i can see no purpose for it being so..:)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive sex in the city love for women i receive sex in the city Lust so can&#x27;t rate what I don&#x27;t have I order sex in the city love for women.</li>
            <li> Yea I&#x27;m glad I only ordered this because of the extremely low price.&lt;br /&gt;I could smell the alcohol before I opened the box so I already knew it was leaking. The label looks like Syran wrap, halfway peeled off.&lt;br /&gt;I opened the box and the smell didn&#x27;t get better; it smells straight up like alcohol, I would return but personally it&#x27;s not even worth the return shipping or the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t order if you want your perfume intact, and that actually smells good...</li>
            <li> My past boyfriend brought me this on our first anniversary. It is a great smell and I even have the travel size in my work place. It has a feminine smell to it but not fruity type. Very sensual and great for both day and night wear.</li>
            <li> When my perfume arrived the cap was broken and the bottom of the box was soiled in wasted perfume. I didn&#x27;t return the item because I felt that it would be a waste of time. I felt cheated that my perfume had wasted all over the box &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t get my full purchase.</li>
            <li> This arrived very quickly! I love the smell of this perfume as well and I get lots of compliments while I am wearing it.</li>
            <li> This Sex and the City perfume smells nice. I bought a bunch of these perfume sets by Sex and the City in different scents besides Love, but none of the Sex in the City perfumes last long on me at all. They&#x27;re good for body spray, but as a perfume, they fail miserably. The longest it lasts is about 10 minutes at most. I guess when they make perfume to sell for $15 a pop, the alcohol is not enough or there&#x27;s something cheap that&#x27;s being used. I won&#x27;t be buying this again and whatever I have left, I am giving away to friends or people who want it. I wish they lasted a long time on the skin and clothes because the smells are very nice, especially this one, Love.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this perfume is neat and the bottle and cap is very sleek looking that 1 star. Yet the smell is too sweet, tangy, and pungent all mixed together. It smells similar to Britney Spears- Curious and I really don&#x27;t like that smell. I bought this on a whim after it was the third most popular bought on Amazon, thinking that this would pleasantly surprise me. It did surprise me, I&#x27;m 20 years old and its too young for me. I ended up giving to my little sister- she&#x27;s in middle school.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife because I liked the smell.  She really really likes it too.  She was very happy to get it.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells sooo good!! of the love and lust ones, the lust def smells more like a perfume! I like it a lot, and the smell lasts, the love smells good more of a fruity shampoo smell also I love them both and the bottle is huge!</li>
            <li> Well first of all i bought this product because of its name. I wanted to try it out. Actually i found it fresh and very sexy. Its smell is very seductive. I like it. Its pretty good. BUT it does not stay for long</li>
            <li> Thickly sweet, not even for a young woman on an evening out. If Big smelled this, he would have left her picking up pearls in Paris and drove straight to the airport.</li>
            <li> My wife is a HUGE fan of Sex in the City and I thought this would be the perfect surprise gift for her. The scent is fresh, crisp yet subtle. She loved it and I that made me very happy as well. I think it was well worth it, overall....</li>
            <li> I love the fragance of the perfume, it&#x27; s excellent, I order it and just wait a few for it to come.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knock off - not really perfume.  Watery, sticky and scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all.  Also does not spray out correctly &amp; leaks.  Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This cologne I was not familiar with, but I like the scent and it smells good on me.  So Sex in the City Love is a great cologne for the price.</li>
            <li> excellent presentation of perfume smells good and is a very very very low price they recommend is a good gift</li>
            <li> it was ok, fragnance goes away quickly.  it is one time buy and why on cover its not written where its made..  is it fake or something</li>
            <li> omg ! this perfume smells so good and I was surprized to see how  big the bottle was it was so huge and it smells amazing&lt;br /&gt; it&#x27;s like a sweet smell but sex at the same time and my husband loved it. I am so glad i got this perfume it  was the best value for my money and  more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon.com  everything I have bought here is amazing. and makes me so happy and makes my husband love me more</li>
            <li> good for the price if you dont matter to keep splaying every 3 hours a litle touch of this odorized water</li>
            <li> choose this rating, because I think it&#x27;s great the processes to bring the product in good condition to my mailbox</li>
            <li> not what I expected and the scent disappears 30 minutes.the perfume is not Sex an the City is Sexy City does not smell and the picture is so small</li>
            <li> i roll up next to my wife and she smells like this and Barry White music starts to play in the background</li>
            <li> My cousin liked it. She thanked me. I assume it smelled great because she didn&#x27;t say anything bad about it. I liked the color. I liked the price so I bought it. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got it on time&lt;br /&gt;Love the smell.!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;(Wish the scent could have been a bit stronger)........&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the smell of it at all, smells like soap residue, gave it to a friend and she loved it!, but I&#x27;ll never buy this product again, not unless I want to smell like old soap residue.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother in law. She loves sex in the city, but she not into woman&#x27;s perfume at all, so I was a bit sceptical about this choice. But she loved it. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I received a \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; knockoff instead of the actual Sex in the City perfume.  I&#x27;d recommend not buying this one folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like some people get the real thing and some don&#x27;t.  On the plus side the knockoff smells nice (but in all fairness I don&#x27;t know a lot about perfume).  The scent fades quickly which is just as well because someone probably mixed it in their basement.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve known I wasn&#x27;t going to get the real thing based on such a cheap price. I ordered this when the total price was dropped to about 5 bucks with shipping. I was sent \\&quot;Sex City Love\\&quot; not \\&quot;Sex in the City Love\\&quot;. It would&#x27;ve been okay if it had just smelled the same, or at least close to. This knockoff smells like it&#x27;s made mostly of alcohol, which it likely is. Smells more like a cheap body spray rather than a perfume. I would not recommend if you already know what the original smells like.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle today. It is a box closely resembling Sexy in the City Love but it is called Sexy City Love. The bottle is obviously leaking inside the plastic wrapped box. Not an impressed customer.</li>
            <li> ESTE ERA PARA UN REGALO, Y A LA PERSONA QUE E LO REGALE LE GUSTA BASTANTE ESTA MUY FELIZ Y CONTENTA</li>
            <li> This perfume is reasonably priced and it smells absolutely delicious!  I love it.  The bottle is super cute too with little beads drifting the bottom of the pink glass.</li>
            <li> This cologne is just okay but not great. Will I buy it again? The answer is no. I wasn&#x27;t sad at it because it was cheap. I spent cheap and got a cheap product. Lol!</li>
            <li> When it came the outer box was broken. The packaging was looking like damp. The fragrance is good but does not have that quality in it. its ok for 1 time buy.</li>
            <li> I gave this as a gift for our annual family Christmas &amp;#34;White Elephant&amp;#34; exchange.  The person that got it said there was no smell whatsoever.  It smelled like someone put water in a bottle and packaged it.  Worked as a gag gift though.  I bought this fragrance when it first came out and everyone liked it, don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happened since then.</li>
            <li> Dont ever buy it!!! Cheapest parfume ever!!! Doesn&#x27;t worth the money at all! Better go to Wallmart and buy parfume!!!</li>
            <li> THis is another mild fragrance that would fade out near the end of the day. I probably would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I paid for this \\&quot;Sex in the City Love\\&quot; perfume and I got something else called \\&quot;Sexy City Love\\&quot;. The box is cheap, the bottle is cheap, the perfume is cheap. The worst thing is that it was a Christmas gift to my mother. My mother! How can I explain now that I intended to buy her good products of good brands when y&#x27;all sending me this piece of &amp;#!+ replacement? If you&#x27;re reading this follow this advice: boycott these money vampires. It&#x27;s better to buy in a store for a higher price and assurance of validity.</li>
            <li> i ordered Love by sex in the city because i had it before and love the smell, but when my item arrived today it was &#x27;&#x27;Love 2 by sex in the city 2\\&quot;. and it smells horrid, where is the one i actually wanted?</li>
            <li> IT WAS ALL THAT I EXPECTED AND MORE. THE FRAGRANCE SMELL WONDERFUL AND I WILL BE ORDERING MORE FROM THIS COLLECTION VERY SOON</li>
            <li> Perfume sprayer came broken and I have never been able to use it. Because of that, it was leaking in the packaging as well. Disappointed even though it was a great price.</li>
            <li> Very good, my wife will charm you.</li>
            <li> I had bough this for myself a while ago from a street vendor for 20 bucks!!! I loved it and was excited when I found it for less than half price after shipping &amp; handling!!! I sent it to my best friend for her birthday and she loved it as well!!!! Great gift for a great price!</li>
            <li> Does not have a fresh smell. The smell appears to be a very old fragrance even when used with the shower gel.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is just the right scent for me! It&#x27;s not too overbearing. It&#x27;s light but inviting! This will be one of my signature scents!!!</li>
            <li> Not the real was a fake didnt smell right .....Smelled like rubbing alcohol i ordered a couple of bottles and they both smelled the same</li>
            <li> thank you for this i tame i like it&lt;br /&gt;it was very nice thank you for every thing  good e time</li>
            <li> Scent was great, but the extra body spray that came with didn&#x27;t work too well. I did fix the issue, but you have to stick a pin in the nozzle everytime you want to spray it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother for her birthday, it smells great, and she LOVES this perfume! It&#x27;s exactly as described--brand new, in box, still wrapped. The scent is even as described--it&#x27;s a nice sweet floral. My only complaint about the product is the bottle is so large and wide it does make for awkward spraying, but the smell is well worth it. :) I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> The perfume smells amazing and it&#x27;s a HUGE bottle that lasts a long time!  I bought this for my mother for her birthday but ended up buying one for myself since it was such a great price!</li>
            <li> Is perfect for a teenager.</li>
            <li> Does not smell like it should. I smell like a musty old lady who lives in a story book one bedroom closet.</li>
            <li> Smells soft and girly but the scent doesn&#x27;t last long at all!! Good purchase for a middle school tween. Priced well.</li>
            <li> very good scent.better than i thought.love it!! smell soft and not strong!beautiful bottle. can use for any time of day.</li>
            <li> This was my first order on amazon and I did not expect anything to come this fast, it was less then three business days.  What I received is exactly what is advertised and pictured.  No shipping fees.  Good job guys.</li>
            <li> After in depth research, it turns out \\&quot;Sex in the City\\&quot; is a knock off of \\&quot;Sex and the City\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sex and the City\\&quot; perfume doesn&#x27;t actually exist. The whole thing is a knock off of a knock off. I got the bottle called \\&quot;Sexy City\\&quot; (Pictured above) and was bummed because this was supposed to be a gift for my friend. I tried to consult the seller who acted like they didn&#x27;t want me to return it, so I took the $7 gamble and opened it. Surprisingly, I love the smell. The bottle is good quality, but the strength of the scent is questionable. It does seem to wear off faster than my other top quality perfumes. I am happy with my knock off though.</li>
            <li> Good afternoon, I received, thank you very much for the product. arrived in excellent condition</li>
            <li> Instead of &#x27;Sex and the city love for women perfume&#x27; I received a bad copy &#x27;sexy city&#x27;. I don&#x27;t like &gt;:(</li>
            <li> ok todo muy bien con este equipo.. lo ocupe para lo que necesitabaok todo muy bien con este equipo.. lo ocupe para lo que necesitaba</li>
            <li> Scent does not last for more than 5 minutes. My daughter feels it is a &amp;#34;Knock off&amp;#34; I love the fragrance just wish it would last.longer.The bottle is gorgeous. And it was only 5.00.</li>
            <li> Wife loves the scent! Probably the neatest perfume bottle i&#x27;ve ever seen or bought for her! Thanks Again! A+ A+</li>
            <li> So I had bought this as a present for someone else. When I got it in the mail, I just had to open it and smell it. This purfume is by far the best smelling purfume around! &amp; what do you know, it doesnt cost an arm &amp; a leg.</li>
            <li> Item as described &amp; shown. The smell is wonderful not too strong or soft; its perfect. I recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product was very inexpensive and it was a huge bottle. Love the scent it and it really lasts. It is a very good quality product. I will be ordering from this seller again</li>
            <li> I love parfums but this fragance somewhat need something to be greater. But if you like mild fragances it will be ok.</li>
            <li> I received the gift, but its damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pls chk if can replace it? doesnt look like a fresh product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I wish i could write a rave review, but i cancelled my order via amazon they never cancelled threw tunnucci...so i got billed for a purfume i never wanted..and it got sent to an adress i dont even live at....i even called to cancel and your customer service eas like talking to a brick walll</li>
            <li> I was shocked to open this as the bottle is large and soooooo glam!! My daughter loved it as she is a fan of the series and movies! Smells yummy too!</li>
            <li> I liked it very much its not overbearing and last pretty long too. I would buy it again!&lt;br /&gt;I get allot of compliments.</li>
            <li> This  should be called a body spray not a perfume. It stinks! yek! and i will not recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> Was afraid to have surprises&lt;br /&gt;very happy package&lt;br /&gt;real product&lt;br /&gt;original&lt;br /&gt;Love to buy again&lt;br /&gt;Love this product&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to buy for sure</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 of these for gifts and was pleasantly surprised.  Makes a great Birthday, Christmas or just because present.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the scent.  Wonderful treat for X-mas that. We will treasure for quite a while.  Purchased through amazon &amp; receives well before x-mas</li>
            <li> I hated this perfume and I am a perfume addict I rarely come across perfume i dont like and this is one</li>
            <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
            <li> After reading several negative reviews I was skeptical about the seller/product.It just arrived in the mail and it is exactly what I had ordered in perfect condition. The scent is light and pretty I can&#x27;t believe I just got this amazing bottle of perfume at such a great price so quickly.certainly will order from them again!!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet then softens throughout the day. Bad thing though, if too much is sprayed on the clothes, the smell still lightly lingers on your clothes even after being washed/dry cleaned. &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; FYI not safe on silk. But if you don&#x27;t mind the linger, then I say go for it. Its attracting to guys and its not over powering to your nose.</li>
            <li> I love flowers and this parfume smells just like a a field of flowers. Many people  have asked me what it is, so they can get it for themselfs</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item to my wife on her birthday. First they said it&#x27;s gonna be shipped by 3-5 business days, but it took like two weeks to do so. They just ruined the surprise. The second thing is that this item is faked and worth nothing. After using it by 5 minutes, the smell will go away. IT&#x27;S FAKED, DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS THING</li>
            <li> Excelente Vendedor, responsable en la entrega del producto y en las mejores condiciones. Vendedor 100% recomendado. Compra 100% exitosa .</li>
            <li> love the smell and aroma and the bottle is a great decorative item on my dresser andit is great priced and packages right</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter and she loved it! Couldn&#x27;t beat the price and it was the real thing, not a knockoff .</li>
            <li> This scent smells amazing and is a great scent for the spring and summer. It is light, airy and refreshing.</li>
            <li> the scent is just OK and the scent dissappears after about 20-30 minutes. This is probably due to poor quality of the perfume. Unfortunately, I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I received my order earlier than expected. I like that.  Also I love the scent. Its ultra feminine and sweet.  Its not over powering and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragance, you can&#x27;t get a better price, I bought two, one for me and another one for my mom.</li>
            <li> This was suppose to be SEX in The City Love, it was some off brand that said SEXY CITY Love...FALSE ADVERTISEMENT BEWARE!</li>
            <li> i love this product- wish the show could be as good as the product- has a great floral scent- not overwhelming at all- its like springtime and everyone is going to fall in love with this product-</li>
            <li> This product was available at a great price. It came in a very classy bottle. However it was not a unique scent but it did serve its purpose adequately.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells alright but doesnt last long. I use it for when I go to work. I probably wont buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this scent. My son smelled it on me the first time and asked me to order one for his girlfriend.</li>
            <li> happy with this produc im very satisfied with it..great..it arrived when it was suppose to...custumer friedly..i would recomend your company to everyone</li>
            <li> me encanta esta fragancia es tan especial, a todas mis hermanas y cuñadas las gusto también la fragancia la recomiendo, aunque se partió en el envio, la tapa al menos fue la tapa gracias a Dios</li>
            <li> Ugly smell!!! Gave it to my nine-year-old for a toy. Even she&#x27;s not playing with it. I can&#x27;t identify the odor, but it&#x27;s foul. It smells like something I&#x27;d find in a dump. Yukky!</li>
            <li> I can assure you that the cologne is not fake ( are you aware that they sell cologne....which is very light scent and does not last very long (they do not put the same amt of fragrance in cologne...they also offer the perfume which is alot stronger and long lasting) Next time if you want a good product and use the perfume....it lasts longer too  because you only use a tiny amt to your pressure points ( wrists and by your ears....never Never spray perfume or cologne on your wrists and rub them together....just tap the together and also use you wrists to put it behind your ears...when you rub your wrists it does not lst as longthe ....I have been dealing with overstock for over 5 yrs and only had a problem with a book....since it was bought from them they took care of it and handeled the situation for me now and they stand behind their items they sell....Overstock has a great rating on the internet</li>
            <li> i hate the smell of the perfume I thought it would smell good but oh well it got on time thanx</li>
            <li> I ordered Sex In The City Love for Women and they sent me Sex In 2 The City Love for Women; they smell completely different with the latter scent being incredibly weak.</li>
            <li> Did not like this perfume at all....Very bad smell for a knock-off. It was delivered on time and was cheap.I guess you get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> Words cannot express how much I love this perfume. I was introduced to it by a friend who said she got it as a Christmas gift last year. The scent is great! Can&#x27;t keep my daughter away from it. I plan to purchase another one sometime soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a college student who recently opened a mailbox on campus because I thought it might save me some effort. I don&#x27;t have a car because frankly there isn&#x27;t a strong need for one. Everything on campus is within walking distance and having to pay for parking tags/tickets is inconvenient. Also, since christmas is starting to roll around I thought it might be nice to just order some quick gifts, so when I saw 90% off I didn&#x27;t think to look at the reviews, which was obviously a giant mistake. When this perfume came in, I found that the top had leaked and wasted perfume. The perfume itself smelled like a very nice men&#x27;s cologne. I tried to wipe away the wasted perfume when I got back to my dorm, but the sticker on the front started to rub off and the silver around the top started to chip.. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift, but honestly, I would have been too embarrassed to give this perfume to anyone. I ended up offering it to my friend from China, who said she liked it.. :( I honestly think this product is basically a scam. The advertising is misleading, as is the \\&quot;original\\&quot; price. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I was going to get lotion alongside the perfume. This is for my mom for Christmas so I really hope she likes it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It scared me to read some of the past reviews the day before it was to be delivered to my door but I got something that says \\&quot;Sex and the City 2 Love Perfume and Lotion\\&quot; so it&#x27;s not an impostor brand. :P</li>
            <li> This perfum is not original</li>
            <li> just okay. would have gotten a better deal elsewhere. looks far better online than the real stuff. i was disappointed</li>
            <li> I ordered the perfume Sex in the City Love. I received a perfume labeled Sex in the City Love 2. I&#x27;m wondering if the 2 meant it was a knock off. I sprayed the perfume and it smelled good for about 10 minutes and then the smell went away. I tried it several times and actually over sprayed myself yet again the smell immediately went away and I nor anyone else could smell it. The only positive was that I received my order quickly.  I buy a lot from Amazon for seversl years now and this purchase is my first real disappointment.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews I read before I bought it because everyone said the same thing basically- doesn&#x27;t even last through 1/2 day without having to re-apply more.</li>
            <li> Was great! An absolute steal great quality for the price i paid. Love the smell i would order this product again!</li>
            <li> nice big bottle light smell for price i wear when going out to store are around the house can smell  soft</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. It&#x27;s very soft but not strong smelling either. It lasts all day. At max about two sprays in the areas that you need it. It&#x27;s soft like the Juicy Couture that I own. This is authenic and came brand new in the box WITH the plastic over it too. It came sooner than what I expected it to come in the mail. The size of the perfume is just overwhelming too. I will definitely buy more when the time comes.</li>
            <li> i send this parfume  to my friend to  HUNGARY  for xmas. she is the subway driver.  every day some lady telling her; what parfume do you use? its so great.  THANK YOU  AMAZON,AND EVEYBODY. I JUST GET IT ONE FOR ME TO.</li>
            <li> I love sex in the city so this is y I bought these perfume&lt;br /&gt;Price was awesome n cheap. Fast service.</li>
            <li> this is truly false advertising here, mine came and it was called sexy city, not sex in the city, and then the sprayer part broke, i still have a full bottle of fake, broken perfume!</li>
            <li> pleasant fragrance for women. acceptable for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Women&#x27;s fragrance  Women&#x27;s fragrance  Women&#x27;s fragrance  Women&#x27;s fragrance  Women&#x27;s fragrance  Women&#x27;s fragrance</li>
            <li> Product great quality...thanks love it love it love it love it love it love it love it yesss yes yes</li>
            <li> i love this perfume and for the size you cannot beat the price I am very happy about this item and I just wanted to say thank you and you are doing a good job in the business:)</li>
            <li> The perfume smells nice. But the scent does not last long. The price is good but I prefer perfumes that have a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It arrived in good shape and smelled great!  It was shipped in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Since I read all your guys reviews I ordered 2 of this item. It came in 5 days and it smelled like vodka. The bottle looks veeeeery cheap. I only tried to open the box and I already broke smth. Don&#x27;t buy - waisting money</li>
            <li> Exquisite aroma, I love to use it in special occasions</li>
            <li> When I got this the bottle was broken and it leaked out of the rim and this was new</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really care for the smell sorry</li>
            <li> excellent product I liked a lot and filled all my expectations surely buy again because I really liked the recomiento</li>
            <li> excelente perfume...me gusto mucho.</li>
            <li> El producto no me parecio muy bueno, esperaba una fragancia mas agradable y seductora acorde al nombre del perfume y relacionado con la serie de tv.</li>
            <li> but where are the products_ because in zoom miami don isn´t that and i need my merchandise  Good afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then contact your retailer to order your&lt;br /&gt;recovery as he has received it should be guarded in our&lt;br /&gt;MIAMI ZOOM agency without any identification.</li>
            <li> When I decided to look for my favorite perfume on \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;, I had. In mind that it would save me a couple dollars. I had first purchased \\&quot;Sex in the City LOVE\\&quot; at Macy&#x27;s for $40 about a year ago. The oz&#x27; on the bottles were very little, but I loved the scent I had to get it again. I found this one that was well below than what I had originally paid for, so I went ahead and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;  It said it would take 7-10 business days, and fair enough it got there as said. I was very pleased when I got it out; it beiing a glass bottle and it got here perfectly fine. They had it shipped with plenty of foam around it so it wouldn&#x27;t get damaged.I very anxiously opened up the wrapped box set and sprayed the perfume. I instantly thought \\&quot;WOW, I did good, so proud of myself for looking for cheaper.\\&quot; Then as I look closely, I see that my original box had \\&quot;Sex in the City; LOVE\\&quot; on all the products. But, this one only had \\&quot;LOVE\\&quot;. It was in the same designed box, perfume, lotion, shower gel as my original. Not even an hour later the smell starts to wear off and smell like pure alcohol. I think back and say that the price was a knock off price, and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I can only blame myself for overlooking the reviews. I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone, unless you don&#x27;t mind smelling like alcohol and using the bottle very fast to cover it up. In the future I will either go to the actual store or look over the reviews.</li>
            <li> t o d o  b i e n  l l e g a r o n  s i n  n o v e d a d</li>
            <li> It smells lovely♥&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave it four stars rather than five is because the smell doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> sex in the city colognes...i love them...the design of the bottle is excellent and great size.  buy it</li>
            <li> Trae bastante pelfume y huele sabroso la elda que si lo recomiendo guenismo y las mamis del barrio adentro les gusto mucho</li>
            <li> Не стоит и цента.  Вода с краской. Параша полная.  Никому не советую покупать. Хочу вернуть деньги назад.  Банку выбросил в мусор.</li>
            <li> Wife absolutely loved her gift. Fragrance is perfect for all occasions. Highly recommend to everyone that is on a budget.</li>
            <li> So yes it smells very nice! very very nice! But I have no idea how I did not think i was getting the real deal at 3.00 bucks.  Silly Me.  If you buy from this seller know that it is a fake and not the real deal.  Yes this Smells very nice but lasts a total of 10 Minutes if you are lucky.  So here we go with the \\&quot;You Get What you Pay For ..\\&quot; excuse. -  Glo-N-Tha-Dark  Glo  : )</li>
            <li> The bottle came and was broken so more than half was spilled out , also it smelled like pure rubbing alcohol. But shouldn&#x27;t expect much for the price I paid for it. Ya get what you pay for was so true in this case</li>
            <li> I am so bummed. this smells great in the bottle but when you put it on, the smell dissapears completely after a few minutes.what a horrible  waste of money.</li>
            <li> this product is interesting and good product. good factory. this product help for complete anything. is important have this product</li>
            <li> I personally collect perfume bottles, not really paying attention to the brand or smell. I can say the bottle of very cute and so far hasn&#x27;t leaked. The smell isn&#x27;t absolutely amazing, but is still pretty nice and I&#x27;ll definitely wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly, and you definitely can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I recommend this seller, perfect delivery and product, thanks</li>
            <li> This a large bottle. SmellS sweet. I enjoy this fragrance and was surprised because of the price. Good quality. Fast arrival.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and was so excited about getting it. When I opened the box it was  exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Item bought as a gift for someone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  Guess the perfume was cheap for a reason.  Just doesn&#x27;t have a feminine perfumey scent at all, in fact my daughter asked me if I sprayed a cleaning product on myself.</li>
