            <li>Rose oil is known for being a soothing ingredient.</li>

            <li>But the smell is nice.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used a&lt;br /&gt;whole bottle of witch hazel and liked it.</li>
            <li>So I was kind of expecting that to happen, and it did.</li>

            <li>Nice and refeshing, I like the smell of it, and i like</li>
            <li>but I read so many great reviews on this product I decided to give it a try as I am trying to go more \\&quot;green\\&quot; in every aspect of my life - skin care included.  </li>
            <li>This is sth must be own from all girlllssss.</li>
            <li>Let me give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>However, the smell does not irritate my skin and I quite like the smell of rose.</li>
            <li>and i even have a nice glow afterwards.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked the way this product makes the skin on my face feel.</li>
            <li>I ordered Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel after reading an article about how it can help with itch and irritation from poison oak.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this witch hazel</li>
            <li>I heard about Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal WithHazel.</li>
            <li>Feels really refreshing and smells good.</li>
            <li>I used ACV as a toner before and even though it was good for my skin, my husband wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell :).</li>
            <li>With this Rose Petal Witch Hazel, he grabs a bottle and uses it on his skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am definitely loving in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an excellent product that is gentle on skin and smells like roses.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find Thayer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Loving this witch hazel.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast and in perfect condition</li>
            <li>I will say my mother uses it now, and seems to be loving it.</li>
            <li>Moisturizing, reliable, and somewhat effective.</li>
            <li>My husband loves the rose scent when I use it.</li>
            <li>You can apply it after shaving, waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a great toner with a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>but I went and returned the Rose Petal.</li>
            <li>but I must be allergic to the rose oil or something.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The rose water masks the smell of apple cider vinegar and it seems to be improving my skin.</li>
            <li>This has been an absolutely excellent product and has really been instrumental in helping my son&#x27;s eczema begin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Let me know if you do test and get any kind of reaction</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice alone</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to add anymore steps to the process but did want to incorporate rose.</li>
            <li>The witchhazel is not as stingy as alcohol and softened my skin nicely after using a drier kind of shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I recently read a blog that talked about how great witch hazel is for your skin... and I am so happy that I bought it!</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It feels so nice when you apply it on your face</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% natrual (can&#x27;t smell anything if it doesn&#x27;t put any addition inside, it should be nothing, literally not even rose smell.)</li>
            <li>Nice soothing scent.</li>
            <li>A really nice toner product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my responsibility to report honestly and</li>

            <li>Love the smell, very gentle on face, no alcohol and soothing aloe vera, great combination.</li>
            <li>Very light scent</li>
            <li>Very light, petal scent, and soothing.  </li>
            <li>The scent is *very* genuine - just like roses.  </li>
            <li>Very good smell and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells very light.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth, and I find myself rubbing my face with my hands to feel</li>
            <li>Never using a toner again, this makes your skin feel very smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I spray my skin 3 or 4 times per day,my skin looks very smooth  </li>
            <li>It smells great and is very gentle and refreshing</li>
            <li>I feel very comfortable after each use.</li>
            <li>which is something very important to me.</li>
            <li>The smell is very light, not overpowering, and does not linger.</li>
            <li>I love the soft feel of it against my skin, and the smell is very pleasant as well.</li>
            <li>Oh My Gossshh, ive been had this product for more than 3 weeks or so, first it smells great</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I experienced some tingling and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Part of the joy of this besides the refreshing feeling and pretty skin</li>
            <li>Yes, you pay a higher price for it, but having something which smells delightful as you use it on your face may well be worth it.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t exactly a miracle product for me, but it&#x27;s a great alternative and healthy product compared to toners and cleansers that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>It smells so pretty when you put it on :) and works great</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend to anyone who loves a product made with nature ingredients and rose smell.</li>
            <li>It does have a strong rose smell, but it fades after a bit.</li>
            <li>It has a strong rose fragerance which is why I gave four stars rating instead of five.  </li>
            <li>I can think of is the smell; the strong rose scent might be a turn off for some people.</li>
            <li>Best thing it does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>DOES NOT DRY MY FACE OUT,  AND CLEANS GREAT!</li>
            <li>Best thing it does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is quite strong.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is strong and might cause a problem if you&#x27;re allergic to bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is super good stuff.  </li>
            <li>I just wish the rose flagrance isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like strong rose fragrance you should stay away with this one&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>May not be ideal for a person with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Feels very good on face; nice scent; does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>Never knew how important toner was until this acne-prone girl started using this stuff and realized that it&#x27;s MAGIC!  </li>
            <li>It smells like a beautiful soft rose and makes my skin feel healthy and moisterized.</li>
            <li>Love the rose scent (not too strong) and the added aloe.</li>
            <li>I love the rose scent not too strong.</li>
            <li>Since, I already use witch hazel after cleansing and needed more, the rose petal witch hazel was an easy solution.</li>
            <li>However, this toner was perfect and was very mild as far as smell.</li>
            <li>Vry gentle n mild at a great price!</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, very light on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I love the smell of roses, and I think the scent of this is perfect, not too strong, not too soft.</li>
            <li>This toner is also perfect for a quick refreshing throughout the day to remove excess oil and dirt without having to wash my whole face.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for preventing blackhead prevention in my ears and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy that I gave this product a try, and I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>This rose water is fine, but not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Has such a nice pleasant smell!</li>
            <li>Love the large size and great price.</li>
            <li>Beautiful product, skin feels so refreshed, clean and mosturised after using it, and the scent of Rose is heavenly, very calming to the nerves.</li>
            <li>It is a special &amp;#34;grandmama treat&amp;#34; and becoming a beloved tradition.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works well on my very sensitive acne prone face!!</li>
            <li>and I have seen huge results!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free which is great for my sensitive skin, and the rose petal makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a bargain (and the bottle is HUGE for the price too - 12 oz!)</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a light, not overpowering rose.  </li>
            <li>It was refreshing, but I don&#x27;t feel like it DID anything.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>After I applied the foundation, I applied the toner on a cotton ball and dabbed some over top of my finished look.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has never been more even.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is much better.</li>
            <li>Too soon to see if it makes my skin look better yet.</li>

            <li>I had purchased an aloe/witch hazel product years ago and hadn&#x27;t been able to find one again.</li>
            <li>It feels absolutely refreshing</li>
            <li>and I love the rosey smell.</li>

            <li>:)</li>

            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like the cherry on top to my face routine.</li>

            <li>Having used it for 3 weeks, I have stopped as pimples have been appearing on my face more and more as I use the product, and my skin is much more oily than it has ever been before.</li>

            <li>/&gt;There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products.  </li>
            <li>It has so many benefits:</li>
            <li>the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks!</li>

            <li>I will be buying more as I can&#x27;t find it in any store.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance, although I would try the lavender sometime.</li>

            <li>Fast shipping and great product packaging</li>
            <li>This is a lovely cleanser that I use after washing my face and before putting on my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The rose smell is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.  </li>
            <li>It feels so smooth!  </li>
            <li>My favorite toner now.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I switched to witch hazel</li>
            <li>and my skin seems much more clearer now that I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand before and love it.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m repeating it because I havn&#x27;t been able to find this and</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it to stop mosquito bites from itching and find it works better than the anti-itch creams.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I suspect that I will be buying this for many years to come as I might have found my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; toner.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t make me break out either :)</li>
            <li>I have yet to see it making a difference on my skin, but I will say it is my favorite toner to date.</li>
            <li>Toners tend to have a burning sensation when used, but Thayers Rose Petal feels so nice and fresh on my skin.</li>
            <li>but I am in love.</li>
            <li>I just love this toner.</li>

            <li>I tried many toners, including those from Japan.</li>
            <li>But this one is definitely always on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayer has lots of toners, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li>WILL BUY MORE ....</li>
            <li>This product works better than many of the high-end department store toners.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I do notice a difference in my skin tone - smoother and more moist.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about 2 years now, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is actually much better than Witch Hazel</li>
            <li>If you love the scent of roses you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I simply use a neutrogena soap for oily skin and this witch hazel and my skin looks the best it has in my life!</li>
            <li>Love this product - use it morning and evening</li>
            <li>Feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it.  </li>

            <li>Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love the way this product makes my skin feel and smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really refreshing.</li>
            <li>No burning or drying ok skin.</li>
            <li>Love the feel and fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and</li>
            <li>its feels incredibly refreshing.</li>
            <li>My skin is as smooth a a baby&#x27;s bottom now!</li>
            <li>It is a fantastic moisturizer!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy and look forward to trying the lavender version next.</li>
            <li>Put it in a sprayer and spray on before bed :)</li>
            <li>It also feels more soothing than the competitor that contains alcohol, and balance my skin tone.</li>
            <li>The lavendar witch hazel is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I use witch hazel for everything from sun burns to mosquito bites and nothing you buy will work better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t mix it yet because I love it just the way it is.</li>
            <li>That was a + for Amazon :)</li>
            <li>I love the scent and feel of this toner.</li>
            <li>I use with hazel for anything, I use this mostly as a toner (morning &amp; night).</li>
            <li>The smell is okay.</li>
            <li>It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel.</li>
            <li>If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>I also love all the benefits it has.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil.</li>
            <li>Even longer if you take better care of them.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin.</li>
            <li>but I love it because sometimes I need &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hands; the moisturizer will just ruin things.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin mostly in my T-zone.</li>
            <li>I went on a hunt to find the best toner for oily skin and decided to purchase this back in June 2013.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not horrible as some say.</li>
            <li>but there&#x27;s a better formula out there.</li>
            <li>Best facial cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay stuff.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love it for drier seasons</li>
            <li>Smells great and feels good overall.</li>

            <li>i have to get more</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>but maybe it takes more time.  </li>
            <li>I rememberd Witch Hazel being a thicker lotion, this is more of baby oil feel.  </li>
            <li>pleased to have found it</li>
            <li>I do massage facials and its lovely freash feeling</li>

            <li>I love the way it smells and feels on my skin</li>
            <li>most face washes cause irritation on jaw, dryness on my cheeks and do nothing for the oil on my t spot.  </li>

            <li>I swear by this stuff, I love it.</li>
            <li>I seriously love how this smells.</li>

            <li>I found that using it like a serum is better then cotton balls for me.  </li>
            <li>but It works better when i use my fingers.</li>

            <li>Perfect ph balance, I only gave it four stars because I love the CUCUMBER SCENTED HAZEL more</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, I use this daily now (:</li>
            <li>I bought this as an alternative to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner that I saw at the store (has a yellow label, I think) upon reading the excellent reviews on here.</li>
            <li>The smell is divine - but then, Ive always loved the smell of fresh roses.</li>
            <li>Im thinking of buying more bottles and keeping one at the office/ gym bag.</li>
            <li>I love this product based on the soothing feel of it alone.</li>
            <li>spells great and very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and use it 2 times per day now.</li>
            <li>This is just ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>my favorite toner since i cant stand anything with alcohol</li>
            <li>, sine tea tree oil is potent)</li>

            <li>I am really pleased with this toner.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toner for quite a while now and love it.  </li>
            <li>But I think because this product is not distilled, and therefore retains all the skin feeding ingredients of the witch hazel, plus the addition of the rose and aloe, it makes for a genuinely nurturing formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think it&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
            <li>I surely will purchase this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I love this product, it smells good and makes my face fresh.</li>
            <li>However, I have better results with the cucumber alcohol-free one.</li>
            <li>I also figured that it&#x27;d be better for my skin since it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>

            <li>She loved it so much</li>
            <li>it is good for my skin, and i really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Was good, but not I&#x27;m addicted to Dickerson&#x27;s watch hazel</li>
            <li>Delivery is fast too with good packaging.</li>
            <li>fresh rose smell, not overly perfume-y or old-lady-like.  </li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s a good seal it&#x27;ll break but this one came off whole with the cap.</li>
            <li>This product smells good and is gentle on my skin.  </li>

            <li>Pleasant and refreshing product with a soft rose scent, cleans my face and leaves it feeling fresh</li>
            <li>This takes it right away!!</li>
            <li>My face feels great after I use it; not tight.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out (since there is no alcohol), and does a great job of getting the remnants of makeup off after I wash my face at nice.  </li>
            <li>The rose fragrance is light and fades quickly.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is light and fades rather quickly</li>
            <li>This toner  is very mild and makes skin feel nice and fresh with zero drying effect.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and made my pores appear smaller, but I also ended up with flushed skin and a face that feels like I have a mild sunburn after two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice but not too strong, leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I like the way it leaves my face so clean, moisturiized and so very lightly fragrant.</li>
            <li>The rose smell turned me off though because it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell right with the witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Love this product!Although some people may be put off by the rose like smell, it gives my face a fresh clean hydrated feeling when used as a toner.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and its a pretty good deal!</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this toner, I LOVE it!  </li>

            <li>If your goal is to find something to clean and sooth, this toner does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>I do have pure Lebanese rose water that I add to the bottle to give it a more robust scent.  </li>
            <li>The bottle came with the protective seal which made me feel good about the product being 100% pure and genuine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is unique and is not my favorite thing in the world.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s one of the best parts other</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>Anyway, worth to try! :)</li>
            <li>The original and aloe one is okay.</li>
            <li>I just poured some into a smaller, tighter container, so I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li>If you love the smell of fresh cut roses, this toner is for you!</li>
            <li>I originally got this to get rid of my freckles, but it did so much more.</li>
            <li>Love how fresh my skin feels after using this product!</li>
            <li>But it tightens my skin in a good way, smells great, and dries up any little spots or blemishes.</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful, leaves my skin super soft and dries out pimples!  </li>
            <li>Also, I love all things rose, and am very picky about what I&#x27;ll use.</li>
            <li>Not a fan,  made my skin too oily very quickly.</li>
            <li>so I easily covered it with makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean and looks to healthy when I use this.</li>
            <li>Moreover, my husband uses it, and he finds it to be clean smelling; also invigorating; We love it.</li>
            <li>This toner smells like clean roses and feels wonderfully refreshing on the face.</li>
            <li>It smells great, it&#x27;s not expensive, and it really works!</li>
            <li>I think the rose water in this is gentle and softens your skin more then</li>
            <li>Love the smell,and it feels so nuture and clean when I use it</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling so clean and the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li>Even when I think my face is completely clean after washing it, I use this on a cotton pad to balance the pH and cleanse it even more</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like using it after I have cleansed my face to make sure everything is splarkling clean with no residue remaining.  </li>
            <li>so it was refreshing to find this one which works well, smells nice, and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh at all on your skin, and the rose makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does.</li>
            <li>The rose petal kind of makes my face smell like I shoved my head in an old lady&#x27;s purse...</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve been using on my face and love the smell and how clean my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Both felt so clean &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li>so my skin is easy to irritate, and this has caused no redness at all.  </li>
            <li>Love to use it to clean my face in the morning.</li>
            <li>but it can get irritated by products easily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleansing yet easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is really good before a treatment on more sensitive clients.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m often easily duped by \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li>Easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I have purchased this before and love the clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>This is a great witch hazel toner that is completely alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>Make my skin feels refreshing and clean.  </li>
            <li>i feel the clean it smells more like a powder smell</li>
            <li>This leaves my face feeling soft and smelling so nice, even my Husband likes it and uses it on his own face.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product and the price is nice.</li>
            <li>The smell is a litte too strong though.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural toner to replace my favourite Humphries - I saw that there were many good reviews for this one and considered buying it until I looked at the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This toner smells fantastic - and the best part is that it&#x27;s alcohol free, so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>scent is pleasent but strong.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have that strong of a gag reflex.</li>
            <li>It is STRONG.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;rose scent&amp;#34; goes on a bit strong, but subsides within a minute.</li>
            <li>The rose is good, but I think I&#x27;d go with something else like Unscented next purchase.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think the smell is too strong at all.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly strong</li>
            <li>My girlfriend wanted this as her older friend uses it and has quite fair complexion.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice soft rose smell.</li>
            <li>strong fragrances bother me but this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been reading comments about how the smell is grandma-like and too strong</li>
            <li>I have been using rose water for over 15 years, so when I found this combination about 5 years ago, I tried it, loved it and have never looked back.</li>
            <li>scent .... was so STRONG...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be too strong at all</li>
            <li>However, you&#x27;ve really got to love the smell of rose perfume if you want to use this scent.  </li>
            <li>Way to strong a scent for me.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars is because the smell is kinda strong for me</li>
            <li>I used the toner before bed, and the scent seemed strong when I put it on, but I assumed the scent would fade as time went by.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too strong which I like.</li>
            <li>It has a nice natural rose scent as well.</li>
            <li>Never disappointed and highly recommended!!!!!</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my face very soft!</li>
            <li>(it has a nice scent and is very gentle)</li>
            <li>It smells really nice, and is a very gentle astringent.</li>
            <li>Effective and very gentle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as a superior toner for the skin.</li>
            <li>Very good and lasts for long time.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this toner, it&#x27;s all natural and the price is good.</li>
            <li>This is ok for a toner but nothing special from my perspective.  </li>
            <li>nice clean rose scent, dries smooth does not take alot to cover body good or after shower or bath just as expected</li>
            <li>this product left my skin feeling clean and moist, this is a very good buy, and the price meets my budget.</li>
            <li>It is so gentle and has a light rose petal scent that is so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product and the delivery was very speedy.  </li>
            <li>Therefore I was very pleased to discover that this was as gentle as claimed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any odors/fragrance, which is great because I generally prefer my beauty products not to have a scent.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing but gentle.</li>
            <li>First off, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and cleanses my face really well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to use it for a full month to see more result and then, I&#x27;ll write a review on it again.</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing on the face</li>
            <li>I have dark brown skin, and this stuff was my best skin purchase in months.</li>
            <li>Smells nice at first</li>
            <li>The rose scent is too much for me!  </li>
            <li>update my review in couple weeks!!If satisfied will give full 5 star.</li>
            <li>I was worried at first about getting the rose scent</li>
            <li>I bought this because my normal toner was running out, and I saw this on amazon with good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on your face or skin and smells nice also!</li>
            <li>So far I am loving it!</li>
            <li>this is my first time using Rose Petal  Witch</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have been looking for a toner that is not only good but that smells lovely as well.</li>
            <li>When I saw that there was a rose petal based one I thought it might smell pretty and work just as well.</li>
            <li>The first one was rejected so I will try to include the focus on Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>The rose water scent smells funny, but you&#x27;ll get over it after using it for a week or so.</li>
            <li>it may too sweet scented for some users but i am ok with that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent comes from natural rose water!</li>
            <li>Most of the claims that they make about this product are true and I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is brighter and looks healthier and smoother</li>
            <li>It is alcohol free, the rose petal not only smells good,  </li>
            <li>To this I would say that it is first and foremost witch hazel that has rose assed to it.</li>
            <li>I use jojoba oil on my face before bed to hydrate and I am trying out this updated version of Thayers rose petal which I like 100% from when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and I just poured some in a bottle of my own and put Suran wrap over the original to keep fresh</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this toner, the rose smell is not that strong and at this price you won&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li>Smells great (refreshing light scent) and works even better (cleans skins, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out) &amp;#60;3 Will buy again!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it makes your face feel smooth, vibrant and healthy!</li>
            <li>This is the best toner, hands down.</li>
            <li>I adore the clean and fresh rose scent.</li>
            <li>It smells great, makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best without drying your face.</li>
            <li>The best toner there is, hands down.</li>
            <li>hands down, the best toner ever.</li>
            <li>have never used this particular product, I am a repeat buyer of dickensons witch hazel, but this stuff has rose water which benefits the skin more than witch hazel alone.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle rose scent, is alcohol-free and makes the skin feel and look wonderful.</li>
            <li>Absorbed right away, loving it.i don&#x27;t know why many people dislike the smell</li>
            <li>Especially in the case of skincare and cosmetics, it is an on-going quest to find a product that works for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel is ranked the best in facial toners and not outrageous in pricing, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over 6 months now (twice a day with cotton pad, once in the morning after I wake up, and</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product because it cleans gently and is a healthy alternative to regular witch hazel because it is alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought this because the reviews were so high and also because I thought the bottle was cute.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is pleasant and not overpowering, more importantly, this really helps balance out my combination skin to absorb facial moisturizer more evenly.</li>
            <li>Does not dry my skin &amp; has a great smell.  </li>
            <li>Finding exactly what I wanted/ needed at a better price just makes it an even better experience.</li>
            <li>It works fine as a toner.</li>
            <li>This seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>Since then it has been fine.</li>
            <li>use this as a solvent for making cosmetic lotion myself, which works fine.  </li>
            <li>It helped with my acne and shrunk my pores and the fine lines on my forehead have disappeared.</li>
            <li>I have noticed less acne which is always great!</li>
            <li>Previously, (years ago) I used this wonderful product and ran out of it.</li>
            <li>but this ridded me of some of the deeper fine lines that have been creeping up since 35.</li>
            <li>The toner still works fine.</li>
            <li>The seal was fine.</li>
            <li>But wiping once with a towel just makes it fine.</li>
            <li>So for those who are worried about the scent, it goes away quickly!</li>
            <li>Received order really quickly!</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>If I have a problem with acne, Thayers Witch Hazel clears it quickly!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li>My skin looks super smooth and healthier !</li>
            <li>It is non-irritating and I love the smell, although it fades quickly.</li>

            <li>Good luck to those who also have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I love trying new toners and rose petals.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and it works great.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this product helps brings back the moisture on my face, very good toner and great smell too, reminds me of some baby products.</li>
            <li>First of all I am over 50, fair, and have normal skin that is in pretty good condition.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like rose water, not a bit like original witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>I recently tried the lavender but the rose is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many brands of Witch Hazel and this brand is by far the best because it does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and is gentle on my (admittedly) super sensitive skin that HATES everything.</li>
            <li>My mom is sensitive and she said she wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it because the rose scent is strong.</li>
            <li>smells so amazing and has helped to reduce my large pores</li>
            <li>Not the pure rose smell.</li>
            <li>Use for myself and my daughter helps with her baby acne and is gentle on her skin smells wonderful and feels great when applied it definitely does not dry out my skin or my daughters.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, my pores are tighter and it smells so pretty!</li>
            <li>At first I really liked this product it made my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell, and feels pleasant and tingly on my skin when I apply it, which is usually after washing my face twice a day.</li>
            <li>Lovely rose smell, kept skin very smooth silky and toned, would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great little product very lightly rose petal scented which doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies to fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to carry in spray bottle and use through out the day when your face needs a little lift and the fragrance which, as others have said, does not linger, gives a nice boost also.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, soothes and moisturizes, and does a nice little pick-me-up for the face.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this as I was looking for a new toner and the reviews were good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I will report as accurately as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rose smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite though, it kinda reminds me of something an old lady would use.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t huge though</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve now got a huge zit on the tip of my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice refreshing toner that leaves your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this product ( rose scented ), it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The price is also a huge advantage.</li>
            <li>That makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural, smells amazing; I love this product.</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel is by far the best natural skin toner out there</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about a week of using it the pores on my nose were getting smaller andI looked more bright and dewy.</li>
            <li>The rose scent stays with you even longer than cologne and has a much better natural smell.</li>
            <li>Great for after facial regimen and just fredhening up throughout the day...</li>
            <li>I was looking for an inexpensive alcohol free toner.</li>
            <li>This product is just fit with my skin type.</li>
            <li>great as a daily toner!</li>
            <li>I discovered this product while looking for an alcohol free astringent/toner.</li>
            <li>Skin feels great and no dryness from alcohol and the Aloe Vera is a big plus</li>
            <li>This is alcohol free btw</li>
            <li>Gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposed to be alcohol free</li>
            <li>As a fellow online shopper, I think it&#x27;s important to know the reviewers skin type</li>
            <li>This product smells great and is actually moisturizing because it does not contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>This astringent works fabulously.</li>
            <li>This stuff also is paraban free.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t dare try any rose water afterwards.....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a steal since it&#x27;s cheap and takes forever</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always put toner on with my hand, just lightly pad on, however when i watch the review of this product people said to apply with cotton.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, from all the great reviews there</li>
            <li>This toner feels and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>gentle and nice smell.</li>
            <li>I used the shisheido toner before, which is great, but currently outside my budget.</li>
            <li>I like the light scent.</li>
            <li>Gentle, yet Effective.</li>
            <li>have the Amazon warehouse label stuck over important supplement information and ingredients.</li>
            <li>I went online searching for an alcohol free toner and came across this brand.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel clear and bright.</li>
            <li>I feel comfortable after every use.</li>
            <li>but it is a great toner and gets of any extra face makeup off!</li>
            <li>my skin feels smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic price and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Great to refresh your face in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice, but my skin thanks me.</li>
            <li>This toner is very soothing and feels really nice on my skin.</li>
            <li>The rose fragrance is very noticeable, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my skin is radiant and blemish free.</li>
            <li>and it smells light and rosy.</li>
            <li>I always look forward to using this product because I always have smooth baby skin after I apply it.</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin has been changing with time and hormones and I need a gentle but effective cleaner.</li>
            <li>This fit the bill.</li>
            <li>This does the trick and it smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Definitely does its job, great on the skin.</li>
            <li>SMELLS FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but really doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits.  </li>
            <li>I found this toner about a year ago and was drawn to it because it&#x27;s alcohol free.  </li>

            <li>it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>Fit for my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel for years but not alcohol free.</li>
            <li>It is great to use as a refresher; especially since I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for all skin types and conditions.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin supple and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, a lot of quantity and quality.  </li>
            <li>and it gets irritated with almost every product I use, but this toner is so light</li>
            <li>Toner is an important part of skincare.</li>
            <li>It really smells nice.</li>
            <li>so I smile just a bit more.</li>
            <li>Great skincare product, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to using it, because it balances out my combination skin, it smells great (some people say \\&quot;too old lady\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m 29 and think it smells amazing), and it&#x27;s refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look and feel fabulous.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and supple.</li>

            <li>TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment -</li>
            <li>Alcohol FREE Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>Not one product was Alcohol Free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and it works.</li>
            <li>alcohol toner can be harsh on my skin at times, but this is perfect!</li>
            <li>fit like a 34.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and really cleans</li>
            <li>face feels so smooth after&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>Soothing, works brilliantly to smooth, tone and help with all sort of skin issues.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth when using this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;10 days later, still working great.  </li>
            <li>I love the fresh feeling after putting this on-</li>
            <li>Ordering and delivery were problem free.</li>
            <li>Non stinging and alcohol free</li>
            <li>It is cheap compare to what I bought in the store.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not drying, as it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>This is great for tightening up the face after washing (something men knew about for ages), the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it feels a bit sticky on the face, but probably that is just the witch hazel, and can&#x27;t be prevented.</li>
            <li>Have been ordering this toner a few times, and going to again - best quality ever, my skin loves it too</li>
            <li>This is an alcohol free version of the witch hazel</li>
            <li>Light fragrance, and non drying formula.  </li>
            <li>Helps moisturize my skin and leaves it feeling smooth, without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fragrant--</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so is non-drying, which is important since I use this product twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried the cucumber one available from this brand.</li>
            <li>I honestly can say I don&#x27;t find this product a miracle toner, but I can say I really, really like it.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Nice, gentle product.</li>
            <li>Ever since purchasing this product I am happy to declare that not only have I not encountered any witches, I also have not heard that one-hit-wonder band from the 90&#x27;s, Sister Hazel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can of course buy the much cheaper kind at the drugstore</li>
            <li>I get Free Shipping.</li>
            <li>It makes a fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this toner because I heard so much about witch hazel and rose petals.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to make &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; for postpartum recovery since it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li>MADE MY FACE SO SMOOTH AND SMELLS LIKE ROSES WHICH I WANTED.</li>
            <li>,it fit as expected,it looks</li>
            <li>I really like the rose scent.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is simply fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it subsided in about an hour</li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle and soothes nicely.  </li>
            <li>Soon I realized this is a FANTASTIC eye make-up remover!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses effectively and gently.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my current skin care products.</li>
            <li>and I personally enjoy it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li>It has a gentle smell of rose but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but Witch Hazel is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I held it up to my nose and despite that this is an alcohol free toner, it smelled like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li>Works for acne without drying your skin out, and alcohol free.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it five stars is because as yet, it hasn&#x27;t made my wrinkles go away, lol.</li>
            <li>FABULOUS FOR YOUR FACE</li>
            <li>this surpasses them , alcohol free so</li>
            <li>A great alternative to traditional witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrant, not too powerful.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t fit well for removing eye make-up</li>
            <li>but just based on trying it a few times it seems to be perfect.</li>
            <li>Alcohol free, leaves my skin toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Wanted something that was alcohol free and animal cruelty free ( no testing on animals).  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and over time, it has evened my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>The scent is absolutely amazing, and it tightens and clears pores VERY well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>I ordered this and began using it daily, and my skin has greatly improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this morning and night after washing my face and use a light moisturizer after applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li>The aloe vera and rose petals are really soothing on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is soothing and a great facial toner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from the fragrance this toner is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>Great product, would totally recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li>Smells and feels so light.</li>
            <li>Does a great job of removing the residue that facial soaps leavebehind.</li>
            <li>This product falls into that fortunate \\&quot;in between\\&quot; group.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I have no problem tolerating the witch hazel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li>but it seems to be comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li>It is alcohol free</li>
            <li>This one has aloe and rose petals added which makes this stuff very soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a great all-natural toner.</li>
            <li>recently I think around 2013-14, because I think it was synthetic version of it and wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li>one with the rose petal made my face really itchy.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and well moisturized after I put this.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and tones without any dryness whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a wonderfully light scent and</li>
            <li>Light</li>
            <li>it is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>unless I use a product like apple cider vinegar and calcium benzonite clay, then it gives a light stinging.</li>
            <li>I use cotton sheets with this and just smooth it over my face after cleanse.</li>
            <li>I lightly moisten a cotton ball with the witch hazel and apply it to my face every morning and night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>Arrived sealed nicely, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>Great for cleansing and giving visibly smaller pores!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the sent and I like that</li>
            <li>The smell is divine (like roses) and it really does a nice job of removing all traces of oil, soap, make-up, etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li>This toner smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my skin felt smooth and refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this a couple of times and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Gentle and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>And it is quite cheap considering the bottle shape.</li>
            <li>Skin feels smooth and comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It cleanses lightly as well and will remove makeup.</li>
            <li>Good for sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>smell so good, and sensitive skin also can use</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and almost everything that touches my face does not end up good.</li>
            <li>This one is no exception, with a lovely natural perfume of pressed rose petals and an added moisturizer from the aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>I love the soft rose scent of this witch hazel.</li>
            <li>And while I still have fairly oily skin, I do feel like this product has minimized some of the oiliness I will definitely purchase more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li>Not too surprising, since I think the source of the scent is natural.  </li>
            <li>As far as the seller goes-good transaction; good price would buy again.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>however I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better product out there to really help balance PH levels in my skin</li>

            <li>smells good, i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So, many years of experience, of trying different products, and I have found a regime that I&#x27;ve been using for around three or four years that keeps my acne to a minimum and gives very consistently good results</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised , love the smell and this product is very gentile but very effective .</li>
            <li>Ordering more right now</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if it stays that way, but I am completely in love with Thayer&#x27;s right now.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I swip it over my face on a cotton pad and my face feels clean and refreshed and super moisturized!</li>
            <li>Love it:) leaves skin clean feeling and not tight or irritated:)</li>
            <li>First it smells divine!!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Thayers!!!</li>
            <li>I use this for cleasing skin after wash and very good for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling my skin is more clear and more smooth after using it.</li>
            <li>It does a very nice job in daily skin care.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical also.</li>
            <li>Love THAYERS toners, personally i like the lavender witch hazel better, however this one is also pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Very Fresh feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>Very fresh feeling after use.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff and it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It smells like roses and seems to do a great deep clean.</li>
            <li>Super mild toner with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>Works as described, leaves a very clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li>It did, but to my delight, it was a lovely and refreshing scent rather than the sickly sweet rose scent you will find with most other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great toner and it makes my skin feel soft, cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>when your skin feels sticky and clogged up, this is a wonderful way to cool off and give yourself a little treat.</li>
            <li>My skin feels light and fresh after I use it!</li>
            <li>I generally stick to Rose as it is usually available via Prime; and, the smell is my favorite even though all are pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smells so light and fresh!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any other fragrance than real rose.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Some people might associate the smell with \\&quot;grandma\\&quot; since rose petal is a classic scent that was very popular for cosmetics and fragrances in earlier decades.  </li>
            <li>This gets my skin smooth and clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean and oil free without drying my skin.</li>
            <li>It retains the cleansing &amp; purifying properties that Witch Hazel is so known for, but it adds light-weight moisture to the skin and leaves it feeling clean, smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>love rose water in general</li>
            <li>So I spent some time looking for a replacement and discovered that this product is consistently the #1 Amazon best seller in toners.  </li>
            <li>It keeps them from becoming infected yet is more gentle than rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li>it also has super strong fragrance smell....</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li>and I break out super easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Rose Water products in the past - all great, until I tried this.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and will ease off quickly with passing time.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a natural astringent!!!!!!</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorite things!</li>
            <li>I love this toner very much.</li>
            <li>love it very gentle with my skin</li>
            <li>After reading about the benefits (softens skin) of rose water, rose hip oil, and rose essential oil, I started searching for natural products to add into my nighttime skincare regime.</li>
            <li>I love this product very much.</li>
            <li>It is effective though so if you like sticking to a routine, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love this product very much.</li>
            <li>scent is lovely and it feels very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and feels refreshing on your skin.</li>
            <li>I bought a mist spray bottle from Daiso, and filled it with Rose Petal toner, and it was the same as Fresh Rose water.</li>
            <li>My face feels so fresh and clean after!</li>
            <li>Fresh clean makes ur face soft and breath pores :p</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and clean every time I apply!</li>
            <li>Iam loving the results so far!!  </li>
            <li>Overall I am super happy with this purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Super gentle and moisturizing, as well as being effective.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective on my super oily skin</li>
            <li>the product advertises, it feels mild and good for those who have sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to many chemicals that are so prevalent in many of today&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>My pores have shrunk and my skin feels overall amazing!</li>
            <li>Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of toners from Shishedo, Lancome, Estee Lauder to a lot of drugstore brands in the past and I will stay with this one since it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t feel that it made any significant improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Many thanks!</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;ve had those type of blemishes, I&#x27;ve applied this to a washcloth with hot water and used it as a compress, and the acne has looked and felt better immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural, affordable toner, and I am so happy I found such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, it feels so gentle on the face, the skin tone feels soft after using it, the scent is so good!</li>
            <li>While I was excited to use this product, my skin does not like it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck!</li>
            <li>Love this product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for myself.</li>
            <li>Give this a shot, it is worth the price!</li>
            <li>Has the best smell, leaves your skin feeling refreshed and has drastically started to even my skin tone in the past two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>; if you have been working outside all day-just wash your face and then use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner with a cotton ball and you will glow for your evening activities!</li>
            <li>Love the smell first of all.</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells so lovely.</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>:B00430CRX6 Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Feels so fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time using Witch Hazel Toner and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Bought it because of the reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>So you get all the advantages of that, but unlike other witch hazel toners, this one smells really really good!</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a testament to how long a bottle lasts which is great.</li>
            <li>Familiar with the product.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh every time!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that the original Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel contained alcohol until I read the label on this product.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is not overwhelming .... but just perfect !</li>
            <li>I love this product, unfortunately it&#x27;s not always sold in every store.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing and soothes my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would indeed recommend for reducing pore size and keeping complexion fresh!</li>
            <li>One bottle goes a long way; will buy again--and Amazon has a great price, too.</li>
            <li>I was really excited.  </li>
            <li>but this product is worth it!</li>
            <li>However I am Excited about all the added benefits to this formula.</li>
            <li>I love it soo much!</li>
            <li>and I have had significantly fewer breakouts since using it.</li>
            <li>A bottle lasts a long time too so the price is a great deal.</li>
            <li>This product is so fresh !</li>
            <li>this product softens, and makes you feel fresh!</li>
            <li>Anyway, this toner been keeping my skin on my face pretty healthy in my experience..</li>
            <li>I would say I noticed significant results within 18 hours of using it, and I maybe applied it four times in those 18 hours.</li>
            <li>We use Witch Hazel at work, and a few people had requested not to use products that contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Choosing the Thayers Natural Rose Petal and Unscented was a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li>It does the job of regular with hazel with a lovely, light rose scent and the aloe keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels very refreshing on the skin and is not harsh at all, it gives no stinging</li>
            <li>but I feel that it cleanses my skin so well that my pores seem significantly minimized.</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this product, :</li>
            <li>I just got this product in the mail and was excited to use this before bed time..</li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see significant changes in my skin yet&lt;</li>
            <li>I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>what I have learned over the years is that the more alcohol-based products/drying products you use, the more likely your face will create MORE OIL.  </li>
            <li>So clean and pretty without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Also great used in a little spray bottle as a refreshing face spritz or prep before applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t pay tons of money for small bottles of toners, when you can get this huge bottle with the best smelling, most gentle, cleansing toner.  </li>
            <li>Am not as keen on the rose petal scent, however, but can live with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new toner after making my own sea salt toner.</li>
            <li>used both the rose and the unscented one as well as new razor blades, just in case it was my blade, and not the toner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried a couple different witch hazels but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it to clean my dog&#x27;s ears too.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and does not make my face feel dry although I can smell the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>The smell is excellent, it&#x27;s not harsh or drying and this bottle will last forever.  </li>
            <li>It make my skin feel rejuvinated &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin super moisturized and flake free throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I also tried the Lavender, which is OK and also soothing,  but went quickly back to the Rose Petal.  </li>
            <li>Removes my makeup cleanly.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I managed to burn through sunscreen 100 and used this toner to soothe and clean, my skin was, well, soothed and clean.</li>
            <li>It is free of alcohol, and has rose petal &amp; aloe vera, making it a staple for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It helps remove leftover makeup and makes my skin feel clean without the \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sensation (code: burning) or tightness</li>
            <li>so I clean it twice with this toner.</li>
            <li>Even after using your cleanser when you use this product to wipe your skin you will see it cleans further, proof is on the cotton :) You can even use it around the eyes, it gives a nice soothing feeling.</li>
            <li>and she uses rose water for more than 20 years as her only face cleanser.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice,fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I use this as a toner, and the scent is light, lovely, and real.  </li>
            <li>and I feel clean after using it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>but it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as a toner with alcohol does.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so clean, without over drying it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use two or three cotton balls of this to clean my face after.</li>
            <li>I use it every day either after washing face or periodically throughout the day to clean up and remove oil when I&#x27;m not wearing face makeup.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I will use it with apple cider vinegar as an astringent for my face and to clean off deodorant residue (armpits).</li>
            <li>I use my Mia2 to clean my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe my dry skin could not benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has a great flower smell.</li>
            <li>I have even used it as a cleanser since it seemed to clean my face and yet maintain the moisture...........</li>

            <li>I love the rose water and also I use it for mask several times.</li>
            <li>Great cleaning product and the smell is simple mesmerizing.</li>
            <li>The redness is basically gone, the texture looks way smoother, and it feels clean and hydrated at all times.</li>
            <li>I use it every night to clean my face and remove makeup and go to bed feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>after patting my face with a clean wash cloth, I apply this toner with a cotton pad by dabbing it on my face, all over.</li>
            <li>Apply with clean hands instead of a cotton ball-</li>
            <li>feel great on my face doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li>It came quickly and smells fabulous.  </li>

            <li>I have never been able to use anything with the Rose scent previously as it was always too powerful, this is just a hint of Rose.</li>
            <li>Not only does it prevent and help heal breakouts, it gives skin a nice healthy glow and smoother texture.</li>

            <li>And the scent alone is so pleasant, I keep wanting to use this several times a day.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, thanks for sending it so fast.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li>The smell of the rose petal is very soft and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very gentle, I love the soft rose scent</li>
            <li>This is product smells amazing and is very gentle on my sensitive skin:)</li>
            <li>I make my own because of very sensitive skin and my organic lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 56 years old and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li>I love the light rose smell (and my husband does too) and the product lasted my a long time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing and well worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a new toner.</li>
            <li>I got my shipment pretty quickly and it was safely packaged.</li>
            <li>I like rose scents, and scented products in general do not bother me, but this was just too strong.</li>
            <li>one has lovely rose smell, not too strong but subtle just like when you put your nose in rose petals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Instead, it leaves very smooth and gentle sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The addition of the rose petal makes for an incredibly soothing toner than can not only be used for toning of the skin but really as an addition to any home made cleanser for irritated or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Well, to my surprise the product is more gentle on my mature skin and dries with a light rose scent that disappears but is quite pleasing.</li>
            <li>They love the rose water for quick clean hands and the immediate cooling and freshness when it is applied to their faces, back of the neck, arms and legs after a romp in the garden.  </li>
            <li>The solution is gentle and makes me face very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin, it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li>Either I am old or this mild scent is just so refreshing on my face that I now love it</li>
            <li>I also put it in a fine mist bottle for when my face dries up (rare).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle, smells good, and is easy on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Other nice ones consist of  Cucumber Witch Hazel,  Lavender Witch Hazel, and Peaches Witch Hazel!They smell really nice and keep your skin youthful and radiant.</li>
            <li>I like the light rose smell and the bottle should last me a year easily.</li>
            <li>so I special ordered this from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I went into a GNC yesterday and they have it on special  </li>
            <li>Nothing special with this toner, but I like the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Thayers has been around since 1847 and is still in business, so they must be doing it right!</li>

            <li>Says that it makes her skin smooth, fresh and clean without drying.</li>
            <li>Works great and has a subtle rose scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is also lovely, very light and very like real roses, which I grow in abundance.</li>
            <li>The smell is a distinctive rose water smell, but not as strong as plain rose water.</li>
            <li>LOVE it coming from someone who is very sensitive to odors (I get headaches easily).</li>
            <li>I feel my face becoming more soft and clean.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful, soothing, hard to find product.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent and seems to be very high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product after trying many other toners which weren&#x27;t as good as this one!</li>

            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have that potent smell witch hazel usually has.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing toner that works for my fairly sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>im bright red and blotchy for an hour after a shower) and</li>
            <li>I use this on my body after a bath, and not greasy absorbs into my skin and it really smells like a pretty rose...</li>
            <li>amazing natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>amazing leave my skin soft ,</li>
            <li>This one however smells amazing and has never once irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and it does an amazing job at keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li>It feels lovely and smells gently.</li>
            <li>then I moisturize :) and my face stays matte for so much longer.</li>
            <li>Feels cool and soothing when applied to skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>love its scent and works really well.</li>
            <li>I love thayer&#x27;s, And it smells really like roses.</li>
            <li>I had good skin prior to using this.</li>
            <li>like the soft rose scent.</li>
            <li>But had to really struggle for more the 3 weeks for my skin to improve from the damage caused my toner.</li>
            <li>To top it off the three products I&#x27;m using are very affordable and all on Amazon prime.</li>
            <li>I was paying three times as much (maybe even more) for the Clinique line.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of alcohol-free toners over the years and give this thumbs up as gentle and refreshing on my combination skin (oily in the T zone).  </li>
            <li>I love the smell and it nourishes my skin very well.</li>
            <li>I have had no reaction to it and my skin really seems to love it.</li>
            <li>And really, I just love the smell.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because of the rave reviews and the history of the product</li>
            <li>It has a light fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I had tried many toners before this one and none of them worked as fast or as well as this one.</li>
            <li>how moisturizing it is when most toners have alcohol and are very drying.</li>
            <li>sure why the shipping jumped up so much.</li>
            <li>I am amazed once again but how effective natural products can be for the skin.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li>I love how gentle this feels on my face.</li>
            <li>:) gentle</li>
            <li>Love that this is alcohol-free: very soothing.</li>
            <li>If anything, it smells like rose perfume for old ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch</li>
            <li>and it has absolutely worked fabulously for that as well!</li>
            <li>I have tried this toner for more than 6 months now and do not feel like it has done much for me.</li>
            <li>I loved this and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>Fast service, love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much</li>
            <li>It feels nice so far.</li>
            <li>I have true combination skin accompanied by clogged pores.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re true.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good toner.</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try since it is good enough for my dad to use.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s the rose scent, maybe it is the fancy old time label.</li>
            <li>I just love this product so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very soothing on my skin and it feels refreshing after applying it.</li>
            <li>Since the Tea Tree face wash and oil are richer in the oils that my combination skins, the witch hazel acts as a sort of in between step for the two that makes sure that it isn&#x27;t too much oil, and you still get the moisturizing aspect.</li>
            <li>Love this product very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li>It is a good value for what it is and it lasts for awhile, for me personally about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li>I use it 2 times a day felt so cool on my face</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tad bit too overwhelming for me, though I don&#x27;t mind too much as the smell fades after application.</li>
            <li>I used to think rose smell was for old ladies.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it for my fiancee who loves rose scent, has sensitive skin and needed an astringent.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with it - the smell is nice and soft - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Its refreshing and seems to have really helped both my complexion as a senior and</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin nice and soft and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t really like the scent, it smells kind of mature.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much.</li>
            <li>Love it so much</li>
            <li>It made my skin so smooth and soft, and it really does smell so good.</li>
            <li>This is a good stable for anyone&#x27;s facial routine.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes my skin to the point where I feel like I don&#x27;t need night cream or day cream, but it&#x27;s the most gentle toner I have used.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even caught my boyfriend spraying this on his face after shaving because it feels so cool and</li>
            <li>It smells just lovely, and I noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much</li>
            <li>Rose scent dissipates if you&#x27;re sensitive to floral fragrances.</li>
            <li>It makes my face not only smell good</li>
            <li>This product smells very strongly of old person rose</li>
            <li>It is gentle and non-abrasive and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I will say that I&#x27;ve also being making my own face masks out of natural ingredients and that too has been helping my skin and not just the witch hazel</li>
            <li>a matter of full disclosure, I use Thayers Witch Hazel  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh</li>
            <li>so maybe they were just out in full force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my skin smell nice and feel soft.</li>
            <li>Tried and true.  </li>

            <li>This toner smells nice, doesn&#x27;t burn, and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I used the full line of Thayer Witch toner w/ Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li>Also, a better deal here than the Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>reaching for the rubbing alcohol as a toner...not such a good idea.  </li>
            <li>However, on my face not so much... I found that my face became more oily using this.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this toner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toner (didn&#x27;t use toner before) once or twice a ready most days (I also started using</li>
            <li>you sent me a old product and it dose not smell like a rose at all.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this and the gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li>So far loving this product.</li>
            <li>I give this product and seller a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This rose water is natural and doesn&#x27;t break my face out like.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I put it on after a shower and the soft rose smell is a treat.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much I overused it</li>
            <li>because with that it takes a full minute to wash off all the soap...</li>
            <li>Soft rose smell.</li>
            <li>This makes my skin feel so nice and soft, and helps with after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>I love this toner so so much.</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed improvement on that front, but it does a good job of cleaning and moisturizing and is waaaay cheaper than getting those individual face</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling soft and balanced.</li>
            <li>I love this as a gentle toner and for freshening up without stressing my skin.</li>
            <li>I agree that it can be overwhelming a bit, but I like the toner so much</li>
            <li>good to use individually in the summer time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard good things about witch hazel and finally decided to try some.</li>
            <li>Fair enough with its price and its quality.</li>
            <li>I know myself, I like a nice fragrance to things I use (albeit a natural fragrance,</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this lovely smelling witch hazel without alcohol.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very affordable and smells even better.  </li>
            <li>You can get this from Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s a priced just a smidge more.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and my skin looks better and feels healthier than it ever has.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells like roses, kind of, but like an old grandma&#x27;s flagrance.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel dewy fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is soothing and my skin feels soft and cool.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin so soft and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>So far, It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good different toner for those who want a sweet smelling toner for their skin.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve used this brand and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>Just trying it for the first time, so far good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not really a fan of the rose scent, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong and went away quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my face soft and smelling like roses !!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite toner, cheap, all natural, smells good and it is super gentle but really makes a difference in my face routine.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that burns very easy.</li>
            <li>I have very very fussy, easily irritated acne prone skin, and this does not irritate my skin at all, nor does it cause break outs.</li>
            <li>this is the first product that hasn&#x27;t dried me out or made me break out&lt;br /&gt;Feels very clean and fresh with a beautiful light scent</li>
            <li>It does leave the skin feeling a bit sticky.. Would probably be great if you are very dry!</li>
            <li>I put some in a bigger spray bottle to use on my body which is great, but I&#x27;m sailing through it pretty quickly, so</li>
            <li>My only warning is the rose petal scent is very strong, I don&#x27;t mind it, but my mom who is very sensitive to smells found it too strong.</li>
            <li>I use this right after my Clarisonic and it not only brightens my skin tone, but moisturizes my face nicely as well!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, it has a nice scent and soothes my dry combination skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the strong rose smell.</li>
            <li>Hazel  w/Aloe Vera......was pleased with the slight fragrance and loved it had no alcohol.  </li>
            <li>, I THINK I have a dry skin, and this product helps looks nice, no peeling feel any more.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so good, I hardly have to wear any foundation any more!</li>
            <li>I really liked the way this witch hazel toner performed, but I had to stop using it because the scent was so strong that it woke me up in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this toner, in conjunction with some other great skin products, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m definitely happy with this one purely because I enjoy the smell and the soft feel of it so much.</li>
            <li>This was the very first product that I included into my new skincare routine and Thayers makes great Witchhazel products that I use on pretty much every part of my body.</li>
            <li>When it comes to cosmetics and skin care products, I love trying new things and very very rarely am content to use any product exclusively and consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell was a bit strong when I first poured it on a cotton pad, but about 5 minutes after application, 95% of the smell went away.</li>
            <li>I really like the light scent, and it does leave my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Very mild and gentle but gets the job done!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped make my skin look better and also hydrate my skin during this very hot summer.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and, when applying the toner, my skin feels clean, slightly tingly, but not tight (which is great).</li>
            <li>The first few days that I used this product were great, I was ok with the smell that reminds me of my grandmother.</li>
            <li>Smells great but extremely drying.</li>
            <li>But other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Tried the 2 other versions (Cucumber and unscented) and both were great.</li>
            <li>I cried happy tears just the other day when I woke up and saw no bumps.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any miracle results like some other people have, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li>Love the smell , very refreshing ,pores look smaller, I really like this product,</li>
            <li>Very good, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love a rose smell but this is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It feels just so clean and fresh after use this toner.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and clean my skin glows</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin fresh, clean, moisturized.</li>
            <li>This toner makes me feel so fresh and clean after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Also makes a nice application for a quick light back massage.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>A wonderful witch hazel with a subtle, true-rose scent</li>
            <li>And it just makes my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Plus, Thayers is completely cruelty free and has a strong statement on their website about being cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without residue.</li>
            <li>Its light and refreshing, has a slight rose smell.</li>
            <li>This is a must for keeping your skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It use it even under my eyes on fine lines - it is that gentle!  </li>
            <li>It is not drying and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>my skin feels clean and fresh with this toner without any irritation.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and balancing and can be used for so many different things!</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It was also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>SUPER OILY.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>To add to my problems, I also have mild acne.</li>
            <li>I came in quickly and was boxed well.</li>
            <li>It was shipped quickly and no problems at all.</li>
            <li>Plus, I find the subtle rose scent to be quite pleasant.    </li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t get oily nearly as quick in my T-zone and it feels so moisturized that I don&#x27;t even feel the need to use anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is so lovely (not the usual witch hazel scent, because of the rose!)</li>
            <li>But it wears off quickly and is not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received this quickly.</li>
            <li>Perfect for everyday skin care and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>i use it twice a day, morning and night and it provides a great base for make-up but makes your skin look great even without it!</li>
            <li>but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li>I do not use moisturizer, foundation, or powder in the morning, mainly because I think it clogs and enlarges my pores and makes me break out more.  </li>
            <li>I gave it to my boyfriend who has mild breakouts here</li>
            <li>My skin also doesn&#x27;t look super oily either.</li>
            <li>So yeah, I&#x27;m super self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price, better than the Burt&#x27;s bee toner which costs more for smaller quantity.</li>
            <li>It has rose petals and aloe in it which keeps your skin clean and toned but not dry at all.  </li>
            <li>In addition, witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>a super toner..</li>
            <li>Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li>There is no alcohol to dry out the skin and the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>I use it as a daily facial toner, and the scent is beautiful!</li>
            <li>Helps my homemade face oils absorbed better and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and the product works as advertised.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually review products, but this one really impressed me, thanks Thayers!</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick and prompt.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely being purchasing more.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin.</li>
            <li>This product has tremendously helped my skin, and removed blemishes that I had for years.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit floral/feminine but it fades quickly</li>
            <li>I also use a quick squirt here and there around the bathroom to freshen the scent of the room.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>Came quickly was packed</li>
            <li>two days later multiple people commented on how awesome my skin looked.</li>
            <li>the smell is a bit antiquated (reminds me of that \\&quot;tea rose\\&quot; perfume) but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>it takes it away quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product, im very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly and was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Can fee the mild softing impact of the skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed with any toner I have used, rubbing across my face and pimples only spread more bacteria and broke me out more.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild.</li>
            <li>and I stopped using my anti wrinkle creams months ago when I became pregnant.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this toner - mainly worried that I&#x27;d smell like a grandma -</li>
            <li>This Rosepetal witch hazel not only is a lovely toner, but you can safely put it anywhere to quell inflammation.</li>
            <li>my pores have shrunk tremendously</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>this toner is mild that will not makes you pricking.</li>
            <li>And by the way, the rose scent is NATURAL, not artificial, as some reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>After using Thayers my skin really feels ready for the moisture step, even though it already feels nice by this point.</li>
            <li>When I wake up and before bed, I wash my face with Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Tear Free Shampoo, Fragrance Free Mild Cleanser</li>
            <li>great product, fast shipping...will do business again shortly!</li>
            <li>Saw this on sale at Whole Foods, and had previously read about how rose petal water can be good for skin.  </li>
            <li>And especially so if you have yet to venture into the wonderful world that is using witch hazel regularly!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li>She ran out and had to make sure I ordered more with my next Amazon order.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will definitely get more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li>The rose fragrance is light enough to not be overpowering or lingering.</li>
            <li>and it was just a mild sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to leave this under product packaging reviews but the &amp;#34;fill in the appropriate box&amp;#34; style doesn&#x27;t allow for this particular problem</li>
            <li>I also love that t is all natural and alcohol free</li>
            <li>Mild, fragrant and no stinging alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It was shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li>It does a lovely job of cleansing my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Light rose scent, alcohol- free, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong rose fragrance, but the vitamin E is slightly too predominant for my liking.</li>
            <li>It is very strong and burns young tender faces.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, as I have very sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this!</li>
            <li>no drying out, no alcohol/astringent, just plain good ol&#x27; ingredients!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many toners from high end to drugstore, but could never find one that does what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The scent of this product is very gentle and made me comfortable.</li>
            <li>I am now a repeating customer and would highly recommend it to others. :)</li>
            <li>very gentle and light.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>I use to fear using oil right after I washed my face since my skin is very oily, but the almond oil absorbs very quickly and helps create a smooth base/foundation for my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this toner feels really good when applied to the skin, very moisturizing and not tight nor oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still early but thus far I love this product!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sensitive enough on my skin while still cleaning well, and I feel good knowing there aren&#x27;t a ton of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>The very first time I applied Thayers to my face</li>
            <li>If you want witch hazel, just get the original basic kind without fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very gentle!</li>
            <li>and it smelled very pretty.</li>
            <li>but I feel like there are other more effective ones out there.</li>
            <li>I also use it as a rinse for my natural hair makeup brushes which I also love as it leaves a nice smell on them along with making the bristles soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand for several yrs., and have been very satisfied</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and has a light natural rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is light just enough to make you smile.</li>
            <li>First time I ever used witch hazel that is alcohol free.</li>
            <li>The labeling is very pretty and has a vintage look.</li>
            <li>available everywhere, but thank goodness you can get it on amazon for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>TODAY WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I EVER</li>
            <li>Nothing cystic but more than I would normally get, I am hoping this is just the products removing gunk from underneath the surface of my skin</li>
            <li>It does a good job cleaning my face, feels fresh and clean when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li>Two more days passed, and my oily skin started to get better and the few blemishes I had around my chin and forehead started to minimize, and a full week later I&#x27;m happy to say my skin has NEVER felt or looked this</li>
            <li>I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine.</li>
            <li>smells good (roses) but not old lady roses.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve long heard about Thayers witch hazel from friends and skincare gurus, and Amazon has really good reviews on this products as well, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With hazel has a strong distinct scent of its own, and if you&#x27;re not familiar with that, don&#x27;t expect this to smell like straight rose water.</li>
            <li>Not that I didn&#x27;t like them and they worked fine, but I wanted to go a more natural route and start being more conscious of the things I was putting on my skin.</li>
            <li>I swear by this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing to clean your face and moisturize it at the same time.</li>
            <li>gives a nice clean feeling without feeling as it is adding anything extra to your skin, just cleanliness.</li>
            <li>It leaves a clean, soft, and refreshing after effect.&lt;br /&gt;No Alcohol.</li>
            <li>I like this one a lot better because it does the same job, smells better, moisturizing (from the aloe vera), and an extra plus because the rose water has anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non drying, non irritating, has a lovely light scent of Rose, and it&#x27;s refreshing on your skin.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is completely alcohol free and that the smell actually comes from rose petals.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this as a toner in my new skincare regime, and my skin has never looked better or felt softer.</li>
            <li>but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wake up with new zits every morning and get more throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>I started using it to be able to see if a new cleanser was getting all of my makeup and sunscreen off at night</li>
            <li>Its my NEW FAVORITE.</li>
            <li>The price per use is pennies, maybe less - great value.  </li>
            <li>As a result, my previous skin issues were greatly excacerbated.</li>
            <li>Now that I use this , with less products, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Although the rose smell is the scent of old women, I&#x27;m willing to overlook it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Generally speaking, it is good for dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s really a combination of this and my more consistent practice of the OCM.</li>
            <li>, it has been leaving my face feeling nice and refreshed and not dry</li>
            <li>It evaporates quickly, is cooling and smells fresh without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Really good and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thayers toner works really well - leaves my skin clean, fresh and smooth without drying it or causing acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is really nice, feels cool going on, especially if you keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>but it has a strong smell that sometimes is too much.</li>
            <li>Great for hot summer months when you don&#x27;t wanna be continually going through whole facial wash routine but need a quick refresher.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a pretty nice toner so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure the rose does anything, but it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, so I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li>Reasonably priced, too, and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>However, it is still witch hazel, and is still useful as a mild astringent.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin this is a good option for you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at following that whole regime of buying lots of different facial products so this product is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li>The rose smell is a little overpowering at first, but dries to a nice cclean rosy scent.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this to everyone together with a right nutrition and make sure you also drink lots of water</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that reacts to most products .</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and Thayers is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Well, quite frankly, I just don&#x27;t care, it leaves you feeling clean and the scent is pleasant enough, not over-powering and after a bowel movement who couldn&#x27;t use some &amp;#34;air freshener?&amp;#34; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Has made my skin very soft, supple, and smooth!</li>
            <li>have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong!</li>
            <li>The hundreds of positive reviews here are all accurate.</li>
            <li>After applying the toner on my face I felt very clean and normal.</li>
            <li>I love this rose toner for its gentle formula and subtle rose scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is heavenly &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any irritation after 2 weeks of consistent use!</li>
            <li>As I used the witch hazel toner more and more my skin began to break out more than usual</li>
            <li>Such a refreshing sensation!</li>
            <li>I love this toner because it is alcohol-free and natural!</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin I would not recommend this product, I really wish it worked though!!</li>
            <li>I love old apothecary brands, and Thayers is no exception!</li>
            <li>I decided to use my &amp;#34;Handy Dandy Trusty ol&#x27; Friend&amp;#34; that is Amazon.com, &amp; I found the exact one she was talking about!</li>
            <li>So soothing on a hot summer day!</li>
            <li>It really makes a difference when you can see results!!</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night after I wash my face and it has significantly improved my skin since the first use.</li>
            <li>Love this natural product!</li>
            <li>Clears away makeup residue very well!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I usually do not fragrances in skin care products, but I love the rose-y scent of this one.</li>
            <li>so I love knowing that this product has natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li>You skin just instantly drinks it up leaving your face healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s a little tingly, but usually it&#x27;s very refreshing!  </li>
            <li>I love that is natural!</li>
            <li>Just as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>great product,  not harsh or does not dry out the skin</li>
            <li>Love the slight rose scent.</li>
            <li>Love the slight rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>It smelled pretty strong to me at first, but I got used to it</li>
            <li>This was my choice of more natural toner while I am pregnant.</li>
            <li>I love the hint of Rose....and alcohol free means no dry skin.</li>
            <li>I also love the slight rose scent</li>
            <li>If it was strong, I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it either since roses tend to remind one of old ladies.</li>
            <li>Great way to get your face really clean and my complexion seems a little smoother and brighter now!</li>
            <li>It smells great and never makes my face feel tight.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been great on my face since I have suddenly become very sensitive to products.  </li>
            <li>Holy cow this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>All of this time I&#x27;ve thought I was getting my face pretty clean, but when wiping my face with a cotton swab with this it does pull dirt off my face.</li>
            <li>this is an extremely fine with hazel preparation that I find to be very soothing and moisturizing to my skin.</li>
            <li>First I clean with Thayers, then I use Skingenixx Exfoliating Cleasner</li>
            <li>I have blackheads, large pores, and light acne scars and my skin looks tighter and brighter.</li>
            <li>The scent it leaves behind is very light and attractive.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t linger for long luckily, but if you like the smell of roses than you will love it!</li>
            <li>This toner is great and refreshing, and does not dry my face like other toners.</li>
            <li>When I use this toner on a regular basis, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I put a few drops of this on my baby wipes for a great feeling and cleaning.</li>
            <li>Like all toners, it helps balance, calm and even out the skin tone.</li>
            <li>There is also a fragrance free version; but who wants that?</li>
            <li>It really helps to smooth and rebalance your skin.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing (so much better than the Clinique toner I have been using for a few years) and I feel like it&#x27;s helping my skin.</li>
            <li>This is amazing  use it for anything from acne to foot soaks so universal!</li>
            <li>It has seemed to calm my skin</li>
            <li>The results of these two products after one week of use for my entire family is amazing</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available on time.</li>
            <li>I read a few of the reviews and am so happy I bought this one.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to heavy scents, so this toner is just great for me.  </li>
            <li>It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t have an over powering witch hazel smell, and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it smells nice and makes my face feel smooth, clean and fresh without feeling dry.</li>
            <li>Havent really seen a huge improvement with my skin</li>
            <li>My skin is really improving, I also use the Aztec Indian Clay mask, this combination is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I added THAYERS to my daily face cleansing routine and my skin has been amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is alcohol free, so it&#x27;s gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>It makes me feel relaxed and happy for a few seconds before I go to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much extra dirt</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s where my gripe is with this product, It cleanses my face amazingly in the such an easier step in the morning when I have already washed my face at night and use this product.</li>
            <li>I really became a believer after a couple of days use when I would wash  my face and it felt so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and supple and the scent is very pleasing to me.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, so it&#x27;s very bearable at all times of the day.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any miraculous claims about this product working wonders on my skin, but I don&#x27;t really have any huge skin issues to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s sooo worth it.</li>
            <li>and I think well worth</li>
            <li>For the price of this product, it is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Hence, I am breaking out more frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural, alcohol-free toner.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and the scent is quite lovely.</li>
            <li>Which is something that has been working for me since switching to more all natural, 100% organic products.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and sufficiently moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li>The smell itself is of faint rose, but it doesn&#x27;t smell 100% authentic rose water.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and natural ingredients make me feel safe to use.</li>
            <li>I love it so far</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite witch hazel product.</li>
            <li>I have decided that something has to change in order to get results, so I&#x27;ve been going towards more natural remedies.</li>
            <li>My only gripe (if you could call it that) is I am not a fan of the rose smell.</li>
            <li>Only giving 4/5 because the smell is kind of cloying.</li>
            <li>It is so worth it.</li>
            <li>Since i was a teen i always used a rose water i stoped for a while using it not this brand</li>
            <li>Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel - use as toner twice daily</li>
            <li>I make a lot of my own personal beauty products, childrens, cleaning&amp; so on.</li>
            <li>Rose water is the only toner I used</li>
            <li>Fingers crossed but so far I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Smells like fresh roses, none of that witch hazel scent</li>
            <li>and I love its natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh and moisturized and my pores may be shrinking?  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use it every day you can pour it in a spray bottle and spritz your face to feel fresh whenever you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>A well made, useful product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>But I feel its worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing and makes me face feel clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>I rarely have to use moisturizer when using the toner twice a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny</li>
            <li>Brisk fresh treat for my  skin .Has become my morning routine .  </li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel popped up after I added a similar product to my cart</li>
            <li>love it , make my skin so soft</li>
            <li>Have been testing out toners recently when I came across this since I was looking for a rose toner</li>
            <li>12oz is a nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my go to for clear healthy skin in combo with the rest of my skin routine.  </li>
            <li>Love it so far</li>
            <li>At the pharmacy there was only the kind with alcohol in it.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is not harsh or overwhelming, I recommend this products 100%</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>Leaving my skin fresh</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t peel, so I&#x27;d consider that a success.</li>
            <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s cheap and will last awhile.</li>
            <li>feel fresh when I use this toner.</li>
            <li>I have been looking, without success, for an alcohol-free witch hazel - until I came across this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Try it out worth it.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and alcohol-free.</li>
            <li>I am 17 and have sensitive combination skin and this toner has been a great add on to my daily regimen.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth trying once.</li>
            <li>My face doesn&#x27;t feel truly fresh after washing face until I use this.</li>
            <li>This is a simple and cost effective option</li>
            <li>and I can tell you that this stuff is well worth it for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li>And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is</li>
            <li>we use it everyday in our salon, we love it , our costumers love them, overall, good value for your money</li>
            <li>With this Rose Petal Witch Hazel, get all the skin soothing, astringent power of regular witch hazel without that funky smell.</li>
            <li>I could still smell a hint of rose a couple hours later</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I love that it is a natural product</li>
            <li>Also, in case anyone is wondering, the rose smell isn&#x27;t perfumey or gross.</li>
            <li>Smells solo fresh and rosey.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m sensitive and allergic to most cosmetics and skin products.</li>
            <li>This not only smells nice</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I use this toner just a couple of times and feels my skin softens and even more clear.</li>
            <li>it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li>and I rarely have time to give up 5mins...</li>
            <li>The fragrance is from rose water and fades shortly after it dries anyway.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>gives a fresh feel for skin after cleansing, removes dirt too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gives enough moisture (aloe, rose water) but keeps the oilies at bay.</li>
            <li>I will admit that I&#x27;m not a fan of the rose/ \\&quot;granny perfume\\&quot; scent, but I&#x27;m eager to try more of the formulations that Thayer&#x27;s offers (aloe and lavender).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love affordable, natural, skin care products?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only skin care product I have that smells nice</li>
            <li>Wow love this.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural ingredients, and it smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff doesn&#x27;t burn and smells like fresh cut roses.</li>
            <li>I love the way it gently removes residual traces of residue (soap, etc.) and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, my mom is from India and has grown up with so many natural products.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why it would cause this kind of reaction, especially since I use body lotions that have oils in them as well as aloe gel for my face after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;ve recently changed to using derma e products), and just wear rose perfume,</li>
            <li>but i liked what&#x27;s left of the liquid inside.</li>
            <li>Oh well, will probably just use this to make my face smell nice and use a 2nd moisturizer in the areas I need.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so fresh &amp;</li>
            <li>For years I mixed my own toner, until I found this.</li>
            <li>Simple product great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a toner in years, but I recently ran across a review of Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li>I only got this for the toner with rose scent.</li>
            <li>Fun fact</li>
            <li>Ive never used a toner but its a nice soothing feeling prior to after shave.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it seems more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li>It contains some of the essential ingredients found in a popular makeup artist brand of brush cleaner...witch hazel (a cleansing ingredient) and grapefruit seed extract (known for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties).  </li>
            <li>I love that the product is natural and without alcohol.  </li>
            <li>I like the old formula better.</li>
            <li>Lovely product for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But my husband loves it--he INSISTS that it smells like a fresh bouquet of roses.</li>
            <li>I love this as a toner it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It does not strip anything away and just makes my skin feel soft and more supple.  </li>
            <li>I like the rose scent, think I will try the cucumber next time.</li>
            <li>totally worth the money.</li>
            <li>My skin has changed over the course of the years, from dry to oily (depending on seasons and life changes) but this Rose Petal Witch Hazel has always made my skin feel squeaky clean and</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth the $.</li>
            <li>Love the product so far (been 3 weeks).</li>
            <li>I use a make up remover towelette then use a cotton pad to use this toner, and it removes any left over make up makes my skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li>I love how natural the ingredients are and that there is no alcohol.</li>
            <li>Wow me~ :-)</li>
            <li>Not too powerful of a scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, so I suppose it&#x27;s more my fault then the products.</li>
            <li>I use the cucumber in the morning because it is light and refreshing, and I use the rose water at night because I find it delicate and almost comforting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite natural toners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price ~$10</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the natural and alcohol-free aspects of this product.</li>
            <li>I love this toner make my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>All you need for a perfectly fresh complexion.</li>
            <li>I bought this last summer and really wanted to love it after seeing so many people raving about it on instagram...</li>
            <li>I make a concoction of this, water, and fresh squeezed lemon juice and put it on my face every morning.</li>
            <li>This toner leaves my face feeling fresh, and not tight like many toners.  </li>
            <li>cause i get headaches very easily, but its not, it smells very light and rosey and goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I think that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more dilute (contains less witch hazel) than the clear bottle and the strong rose smell masks</li>
            <li>has a nice little rose smell but not old lady overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My skins feels fresh, clean and smooth after use, but not dried out.</li>
            <li>Product feels great on my skin and has made my complexion much clearer in combination in other products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very refreshing on my face unlike the alcohol toners that I used before and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li>Like most other reviewers, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good one, but this is it!    </li>
            <li>but they disappear pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells nice like natural roses and leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li>A pretty, mild scent.</li>
            <li>Also, the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>But the product has allowed me to have a clean refreshed feeling face without the skin drying effects of many facial products.</li>
            <li>Leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li>Then apply the toner, which will clean off any left over residue and close your pores before more dirt goes in.</li>
            <li>It contains no harsh chemicals and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li>Very clean and soft feel after applying the product.  </li>
            <li>I feel very clean and my skin feels soft and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell and the fresh feeling after use!</li>
            <li>Very practical &amp; never disappointing!</li>
            <li>I would give 5 stars other wise.</li>
            <li>Other than that this stuff is good.</li>
            <li>I change toners and other skincare products often (good for the skin)</li>
            <li>So if you are like me and you like disinfecting your skin before you sleep in addition to using other body salves or creams, I think reviva would be a good night choice for disinfecting purposes in addition to taking a shower at night which also helps acne.</li>
            <li>you will appreciate how good this smells in comparison to the other stuff.  </li>
            <li>User friendly packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But for my normal to slightly dry ,54 year old, fair complexion its a nice mild, refreshing toner for everyday and a refreshing wipe on a hot, sweaty day.</li>
            <li>I use it right after washing my face and before my lotion.</li>
            <li>I used it right after cleaned my face</li>
            <li>They responded right away</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away my complexion ,was brighter and</li>
            <li>and i still get the right amount of moisture from this.</li>
            <li>and I knew right away</li>
            <li>but it seems that the witch hazel and aloe are doing something right.  </li>
            <li>or if it has helped, but I always use right after the cleaning my face.</li>
            <li>You can use it in between face washes or right after.</li>
            <li>It shrinks the pores right away.</li>
            <li>Not the right toner for me.</li>
            <li>I feel smooth and clean but not tight after using this.</li>
            <li>The alcohol free aspect of the product is very important to keep skin from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li>I am amazed at all the positive reviews!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and my skin feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I love how its all natural and I am a fast of scent!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it drying or irritating and the rose scent is lovely - very mild and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>I am typically pretty sensitive about scents and don&#x27;t like most women&#x27;s colognes/ perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this with hopes that I would really make my skin feel clean..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s calming and moisturizing and really gets your skin clean.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I am able to use a Toner that does not destroy my skin.</li>
            <li>Suited my normal skin just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cucumber in the past, but the rose petal smells much better.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s alcohol free which us older women need because we need the oil in our face to maintain youthful look.</li>
            <li>But it just feels really nice on the skin, especially if I can remember to put it in the fridge on hot days.</li>
            <li>If you spritz on too much, just wipe off excess with a clean</li>
            <li>I apply it with a cotton pad after I cleanse my face daily and nightly and it has such a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 star since I like the smell of rose, but this one is a little too strong.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is just a little strong for me, but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated and this toner did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>product is very gentle and has a subtle rose smell that I think is quite nice, when I look at my cotton ball at the end of the day</li>
            <li>i just wipe my face down twice a day with this and finish with any kind of oil free gel creme.</li>
            <li>So I already knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be able to do that for me, since no other toner I&#x27;ve ever used has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of alcohol free toner and was extremely excited to see try this product after reading several positive reviews.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle but certainly keeps the pores clean.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any positive effects and stopped using it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Once I started back up with religiously following my routine, my skin is very smooth and nice</li>
            <li>The price is absolutely cheap but high quality product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and clean!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft, refreshed, and clean!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t find anything too special with this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say anything special about this toner, it does</li>
            <li>Now I can save money with the cheaper makeup and save my Giorgio Armani for times I really want to look special.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge improvement from where I used to have dry patches on my face, now I notice more even texture.</li>
            <li>Great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great so far, moisturizing if you have dry skin</li>
            <li>Product goes on light with slight rose scent.</li>
            <li>I use a mild cream cleanser daily, an exfoliating treatment every week or so, and a clay mask treatment every week, but I always make sure to follow each one up with Thayers.</li>
            <li>I like the soft light smell that quickly disappears.</li>
            <li>It works great for all skin types and  because it contains witch hazel, it is an especially fantastic remedy for combination skin (commonly a combination of oily, greasy, dry, and normal) and Rosacea.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28, and newly battling acne and the onset of fine lines.</li>
            <li>My number one reason why I do love this toner is because it does not dry my skin out!!</li>
            <li>Delivery was super quick, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I personally think it brings my skins PH back to balance making my moisturizer more effective.</li>
            <li>I usually use this toner in the morning and it&#x27;s a great way to start my day.</li>
            <li>very faint rose sent that is sweet and works great.</li>
            <li>It is cool going on and very soothing.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and so addicted.</li>
            <li>I love what witch hazel can do, and it&#x27;s great for keeping makeup out of your pores, but I&#x27;ve only ever used it for heavy stage makeup because of the lingering smell.</li>
            <li>After being in grad school and working full time, my lack of sleep really started to show in my skin.</li>
            <li>I normally have a mixture of dry/oily skin which is a huge disaster.</li>
            <li>A FEW ROSE BUSHES FROM JACKSON AND PERKINS AND TAKE A WHIFF!</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean, no harsh feelings at all, absorbs quickly, it wakes up my skin.</li>
            <li>Worth buying, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>After I use it, my whole face is a disaster... full of pimples....</li>
            <li>And it is also useful when first use.</li>
            <li>I recently became more informed on using essential oils and thus reintroduced Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel into my skin routine</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the first toner worth to buy.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is quite nice, not heavy like it can get, but fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, removes the extra makeup washing or make-up wipes leave behind and it leaves my skin feeling wonderfully smooth!  </li>
            <li>If you like to use natural products and enjoy the scent of roses (which is not overpowering), I think you will enjoy this as much as I do.  </li>
            <li>This product is alcohol free (important with my sensitive skin), gentle, non-drying, and is a pleasure to put on my skin.</li>
            <li>This smells great and seems gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face super clean, soft and fresh..</li>
            <li>thing is it&#x27;s cost effective, lasts a long time &amp; if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice during a long commute or after the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really love this toner - it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, smooth, clean, and slightly moisturized.</li>
            <li>My pores are now small, fine wrinkles are smoothed, and my entire face is bright and healthy in appearance.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sturdy and it&#x27;s tough making it look nice, conditioned and smooth and this product surely does that.</li>
            <li>This actually hydrates my face, makes it smoother, cleans the remaining dirt and debris from my pores and leaves my 30 year old face looking like a super fly and funky fresh 20 year old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great right after washing off a mask to clean the missing parts up, it however does leave my skin slightly red (which goes away after 5 min), but overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I went back and forth between trying this product or a pure rose water.</li>
            <li>After a shave, it moistens/softens my skin a little bit and gives a light enduring rose scent to it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and very effective at doing what it supposed to do (treat and calm skin acting as a facial</li>
            <li>Larger than I expected and very good quality.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, in my opinion--if you are familiar with rose absolute essential oil, it is definitely not that &amp;#34;breathtaking.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend adding Cortas rose water--it has no additives--and I highly reccommend this product, as well.</li>
            <li>My hubby secretly tried it and then told me he liked it as well!!</li>
            <li>but I notice my skin going back to really oily more so than I did with the Dickinson&#x27;s original Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t buy the large quantity unless you know it works for you!</li>
            <li>Everyone always talks about scrubs and exfoliation, but I feel like the RIGHT way to go is to nourish the skin, and this product does exactly that.</li>
            <li>but right now I&#x27;m using it and liking it ;-)</li>
            <li>Right away I opened it and used it with a cottonball after a hot day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always trying new skin care products and looking for something that will make my combination skin clean, balanced, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>For the most part I am careful and never try to squeeze any pimples on my cheeks because they definitely scar the most easily and also leave mini-welts after you squeeze them, but I might have overdone it this time and</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and it makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and is very soothing while acting as a toner.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin like many stronger products.</li>
            <li>A nice toner that doesn&#x27;t dry my face.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t anywhere near as strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the rose smell</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really care for the smell of rose I would suggest a different type like lavender.</li>
            <li>It feels nice on your face and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or burn when you put it on.</li>
            <li>can however understand that it might still be a bit too strong for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild and gentle, and has no alcohol.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice aroma and really cleans deep.</li>
            <li>I love the soft scent of the Thayers and the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>and I love having found natural products that work with real results.</li>
            <li>Slightly too moisturizing for my oily skin, but definitely is a good toner.</li>
            <li>It has a soft rose scent and it keeps your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery</li>
            <li>ive only used once so far so good</li>
            <li>After a few more nights of using it my skin is better than it has been in years.</li>
            <li>I had been very loyal to Lush brand toner&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are ALL a great product, I just like to change out for a different style occasionally.</li>
            <li>The spray option is so much more refreshing and feels gentler on my skin than smearing this unevenly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this, and how gentle it is on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and fresh.</li>
            <li>Such a nice and gentle toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and my skin feels really nice, soft and clear.</li>
            <li>This is mild and helps to keep my skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, easily irritated skin.</li>
            <li>Because it is made with rose petals and has no alcohol, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>It is mild and gentle - no irritation.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my face - it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>but if you are sensitive to strong fragrances, you may not like this.</li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone to include this into their skincare routine since I use it for not only my face, but also areas of my body such as arms, legs, and neck making it a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal takes that experience to a whole different level.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast.</li>

            <li>and i like it very much.</li>
            <li>I LOVE that there no extra unnecessary chemicals which makes for something I can feel safe and good using.  </li>
            <li>I love this toner, although i think the frangrance they can tone down alittle, a bit too strong.</li>
            <li>After my job got me a free facial, the lady told me some things I should be doing more often, and I was looking for a new skincare regimen</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t exactly know if this product helped my skin because I use so many different things right now, but I feel like it makes it feel fresher and smoother somehow.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry my facial skin.its perfect toner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When traveling or in a hurry I will use this to clean my face real quick, but I mainly utilize it as an extra layer of moisture.</li>
            <li>During a hot, humid summer I have found that the Thayers witch hazel seems not to over dry my skin and leaves it nice and soft with a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li>Does not cause drying of my sensitive skin in fact has healed redness I&#x27;ve experienced from other products -</li>
            <li>I like being able to quickly refresh my face when I get home and then later do a real cleansing.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of lavender products before and creamy rose products, but this seems to work way better on scars and skin tone in general due to the combined aloe/vitamin E/rose/ and even witch hazel.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a tingle but it feel good.  </li>
            <li>Makes my face clean, fresh and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>The cottonball showed the residue of my sweat and my skin was left feeling clean, lightly moisturized and dewy.</li>
            <li>Also leaves my face feeling super refreshed,clean,and feeling super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different versions of Thayer&#x27;s after shave toner, and this particular mixture with rose petal/aloe vera is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love the subtle rose smell, and the generous size.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become dryer and more sensitive.</li>
            <li>The product is a great value (you get so much for so little!)</li>
            <li>To open - I just flip the top up and the toner dispenses through a tiny hole, very precise.  </li>
            <li>The aloe leaves skin soft, not dry, and the rose scent is just right for me</li>
            <li>Having come from Pro Activ, I&#x27;ve found this to be superior as it doesn&#x27;t overly dry your skin out and makes it very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to awaken and freshen face after a hard work out too.</li>
            <li>It is highly fragranced with a rose scent; but that&#x27;s no surprise as it states this openly on the label.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this and loving it after several weeks, I just picked up a bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel from the store.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the very best to use after cleansing my face without making my skin feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li>like I do with Dickson&#x27;s (smaller pores, clearer skin, more removal of dirt/make up/grime.</li>
            <li>I also use this when my skin feels hot.</li>
            <li>First I wash my face with my Vichy face wash, then I use this with a cotton pad</li>
            <li>Smells Great last a long time</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s an easy addition to my beauty routine and feels very pampering and clean, so I&#x27;ll likely keep doing it.</li>
            <li>I started using this toner 2 months ago and really like it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently begun using toners again, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
            <li>I have been using for several weeks and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not out a whole lot of money - give it to a neighbor for her or him to try!</li>
            <li>I purchased this toner and tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>All natural and light</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you for fast shipping as always!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so having a toner that can keep my skin naturally clear is important to me.  </li>
            <li>would definitely buy some more.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s consistent and works well.</li>
            <li>and I use it 2-3 times a day when I want to freshen up my face on hot days.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>and it has helped my complexion and is first class for lessening the time it takes for bruises to fade.</li>
            <li>I did not know what this product would do but it really exceeded any expectations!</li>
            <li>When I first began using this, I adored it.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>Ships fast!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin pretty sticky.</li>
            <li>for it also made my skin pretty itchy.</li>
            <li>I always use it after a shower to make sure all soap and shampoo residue is gone as well as after facial masks.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff, it&#x27;s the only toner you need</li>
            <li>So in attempt to peel off the label, the pretty packaging which I wanted to display in my bathroom was ruined.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Love the personal service.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth after using this.</li>
            <li>Unusual for a toner!</li>
            <li>For being in business for over 100+ years, this brand knows exactly what they are doing.</li>
            <li>It clears my pores and locks in moisture, which is exactly what my combination skin needs.</li>
            <li>I now use it daily and find my makeup applies more evenly, as well.</li>
            <li>Roses are not my favorite scent but the scents goes away pretty quickly so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Prompt, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used witch hazel in several items, this always being the brand of choice, but for beauty products, or ANYTHING that would be put on the skin, this is a fabulous one to chose!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>I personally feel that my oily, acne prone skin does much better with Witch Hazel toner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say it will do this for everyone but this product was EXACTLY what my skin needed.</li>
            <li>I like it - I just finished the first bottle...</li>
            <li>great product- much nicer than usual brands, doesn&#x27;t burn or cause irritation</li>
            <li>My pores seem slightly smaller and my skin tone more even</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly like roses and with my first use I saw a glow in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>And in the morning, my skin becomes so soft and smooth, which never happened befor.</li>
            <li>I feel confident enough to leave the house without makeup now.</li>
            <li>Works just as well and possibly even better than Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle , and i just love it.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m interested in trying the aloe and lemon one.......</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination adult-onset, acne-prone skin and since I have been using this for two weeks my skin has been so much more clear, more even tone and looks brighter in general.</li>
            <li>and then I will apply regular toner on top of it.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and has helped my pores and facial scaring tramendously.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite facial toner.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, does the job and smells like a bed of fresh roses.  </li>
            <li>In the hot weather I even put some in the fridge and mist my face periodically.</li>
            <li>I have only been using for a week and my skin does look more radiant.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I am 74 and have used many different toners all of my life.</li>
            <li>first I just brought it to tone</li>
            <li>but it really does moisturize too!</li>
            <li>I changed NOTHING else in my skincare routine, just added this toner twice daily, and my skin is better than ever.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is the most impacting of the various characteristics of this product.</li>
            <li>It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana (sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words \\&quot;witch hazel\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>Then over time the water started turning cloudy and had a funny smell.</li>
            <li>Smells divine and leaves my face utterly refreshed, smooth, and (hopefully) youthful and radiant!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll use the bottle up and hope for better luck next time!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use this in my homemade facial wipes and the scent is lovely.</li>
            <li>My skin actually glows now and has a more refreshed look.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t slap it across the pretty label,</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend using them all together if you have combination skin, the tea tree products moisturize my skin and fight acne, and the witch hazel acts as an astringent, making sure my skin isn&#x27;t too oily, and also fighting the acne.</li>
            <li>maybe it made a noticeable difference at first, but then your skin got &amp;#34;used to it&amp;#34;, or it &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34;, then try toning with this witch hazel after you wash your face.</li>
            <li>At first I was using cotton balls</li>
            <li>After reading so many glorious reviews on this product, I finally decided to give this a try..</li>
            <li>Love the smell, and no alcohol in this product, I will definitely order more in future!!</li>
            <li>This product really helps decrease acnes and make my skin smoother!</li>
            <li>After only 2 weeks of using this skin toner, my skin looks FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer as I did with my former skin toner that I paid three times more for.  </li>
            <li>i bought it cuz of the high reviews!!</li>
            <li>Love it and will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li>Delivered on time, exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is the first toner that I have ever used that didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li>Also its pretty.</li>
            <li>First time using it.</li>
            <li>use Noxzema and apply this toner every morning and night, I only apply sunscreen in the morning &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>This is my first comment, coz I have to.</li>
            <li>I love this product, my skin wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>And to top that off, I&#x27;m definitely an acne picker.</li>
            <li>Adding this to my facial routine changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li>First time ordering this product.</li>
            <li>was using Body Works&#x27;s Tea Tree Toner which is supposed to help with acne and this Witch Hazel toner works ten times better.</li>
            <li>I love that this brand is all-natural and that I&#x27;m supporting a local company (they&#x27;re based in CT).</li>
            <li>Still absolutely love this stuff but have found that I can get it a lot cheaper from the actual Diva Stuff wesite.</li>
            <li>It seems pretty hydrating, I sometimes forget to use a moisturizer even.</li>
            <li>a hot day,</li>
            <li>My face could have been better big time.</li>
            <li>You really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Although, I have noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin looks more even than before I started using this</li>
            <li>I use it after washing my face with cetaphil (gentle cleanser), fresher sensitive cleanser, and origins checks and balances, and this stuff is great at getting the forgotten soap particles and minimal makeup residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back in stock.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This toner actually gave me better results than regular &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; toners or astringents, and it smells better too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back in a month to purchase more.</li>
            <li>First, I went to Thayer&#x27;s website &amp; found their price for this product is same/similar to Amazon</li>
            <li>will break me out, but this stuff makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>When I first put it on I swear that the scent was pickle-like.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products</li>
            <li>I am an admitted product junkie, but it&#x27;s back to basics with this stuff because it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>is the pretty packaging you can leave out on the counter.</li>
            <li>Will definitely not be repurchasing in this scent, maybe the cucumber scent is better?</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact that this is all natural; there are not -oates</li>
            <li>I love this toner I can see a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>For the first time in YEARS my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth, toned and clear.</li>
            <li>the aroma, the feeling of cleanliness, and my favorite the smaller pores!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first use, it made my face itchy.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite I like to put it in a spray bottle and use it on my chest and back ...</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>first used it to help treat my acne break-outs.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE that I have found another American made product too!</li>
            <li>My husband even commented that I smelt funny after I applied it.</li>
            <li>it makes my skin look so much better, and pores smaller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, I just love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>It took about 3 weeks for my skin to start clearing up, but now I nearly acne free.</li>
            <li>within 24 hours of the first use of the toner, everything seemed to even out.</li>
            <li>I alternate this one with lavender one and love them both.</li>
            <li>I leave it on the bathroom counter next to cotton balls and whenever I am there I put some more on.</li>
            <li>I love this product, especially the smell of roses!!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love this product and have bought it several times already.</li>
            <li>And the price was reasonable!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it&#x27;s my first time trying it</li>
            <li>I put it in  a container with cotton rounds and they are ready to go!</li>
            <li>Love it, I will definitely be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;Four.</li>
            <li>Very soothing!</li>
            <li>(so men can use this without a worry of smelling &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;).  </li>

            <li>Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Clear Difference Advanced Blemish Serum</li>
            <li>I feel like it makes my complexion look more radiant and younger as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I decided to incorporate this product into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>Will def come back for more.</li>
            <li>The sea salt toner worked GREAT at diminishing my acne but after using it for too long, my face was turning red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, like any product my face turned dry/pinkish/red for the first 2 uses.</li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin and nor does it make my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Like most of these &amp;#34;Old Fashioned&amp;#34; remedies it also has a variety of different uses.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough :)</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>;-))</li>
            <li>;-).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I actually just use my fingers to rub it on instead of a cotton ball, which seems to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>And this is exactly what I got with this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what a whole bottle will do!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes pretty well too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just used my second bottle; I&#x27;ll probably keep using it until I find a better product.</li>
            <li>me start off by saying I LOVE using witch hazel as a facial toner/cleaner/astringent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I can wash my face with a 2% Salicylic Wash (pretty darn drying) and then apply this toner</li>
            <li>I got my first wrinkles going on my forehead</li>
            <li>So now I always apply this first after washing my face...</li>
            <li>I noticed an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on purchasing this toner again and again. :)</li>
            <li>Yet, it leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>not fake smelling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I still have the acne scars, but I actually feel confident to leave home without make up, cover up.  </li>
            <li>Kept meaning to go to the store and this was a much more convenient way of meeting my facial needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first time using witch hazel.</li>
            <li>It removes dirt and grime very well and leaves my skin looking fresh.  </li>
            <li>Next time I may buy a more neutral or unscented version</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more as I cannot find it in any store.</li>
            <li>toner is very moisturizing for my face and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks !&lt;</li>
            <li>My skin not only feels better but looks healthier.  </li>
            <li>I immediately noticed my skin was softer and smoother after the first use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased it at retail locations for much higher prices.</li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this product here on Amazon around 2011, there was like no reviews AT ALL..</li>
            <li>This product is my first witch hazel</li>
            <li>With this price, I definitely get more.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Witch Hazel product I have tried</li>
            <li>Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another product that I love from the same line is the Medicated SuperHazel....</li>
            <li>Even after the first use.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty flowery</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is supposed to have all sorts of benefits for various inflammations (some more anecdotal than others)</li>
            <li>I had been eyeing this product for a while, and I&#x27;m glad I finally took the chance of spending $9.</li>
            <li>First off, it smells like heaven and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li>I have been a big believer in witch hazel for many years, but I&#x27;ve never tried an alcohol-free version before.</li>
            <li>This witch hazel works really well, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchase.</li>
            <li>It sounds weird, I know, but after looking into it I found out a lot of people also experienced this!</li>
            <li>Fast and quality delivery!</li>
            <li>I am very thankful for this product!</li>
            <li>To say the least, I&#x27;m blown away - this is a product of great quality.</li>
            <li>and I am sure it will last for months and months.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and she loves it and is starting to use it in her office :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to twist the cap off to remove the outer safety seal instead of picking at it to tear it first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am now thinking it was not the oil that first caused it on my hands but contact with the toner that had leaked into</li>
            <li>It cleans the skin, but leaves it so soft, smooth and toned.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>It came exactly when it said it would</li>
            <li>I know many people love this stuff but after trying it a few times my face just burned way too much after using it.</li>
            <li>Product arrived just as described and fast!</li>
            <li>It is very well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so I know exactly what I am putting on my body.</li>
            <li>I gave this one star because after applying it a glossy film was left on top.</li>
            <li>Refreshing change from regular witchazel.</li>
            <li>with or without washing my face first -</li>
            <li>The smell is also pretty good！</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and this really does the trick!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely stunned about how well this works!</li>
            <li>This is my first toner ever.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I love the way the product gives the illusion of smaller pores...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble finding good products made by companies that don&#x27;t do any animal testing, so was</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been eyeing this toner for a while because of all the good reviews and decided to buy it a few months back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good with cotton balls or pads instead of something harsh like Seabreeze or Stridex.  </li>
            <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for me at this time of year when my oily skin needs just a little bit of help keeping the dry skin away yet</li>
            <li>This is has been added to my new more natural skin care regime.</li>
            <li>is such a mild astringent that I feel free to use it any time my skin feels oily.  </li>
            <li>: I have very oily T-zone, sometimes sensitive, acne-prone, easily congested skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly blotting with oil absorbing sheets (my life savers!!!!)</li>
            <li>a must-have especially if you live somewhere with a lot of humidity, I live in Miami, FL so a good toner is a necessity.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and it makes my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>For acne prone skin I think Alba Botanica&#x27;s Natural Acnedote Deep Clean Astringent is much better at reducing oil on the face and minimizing pimples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week, but so far, I love it!  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so clean and soft and just overall healthy.</li>
            <li>It made my skin soft, smooth, clear, and really clean by removing any residue that the cleanser hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Its gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate but still leaves my skin feeling moisturized and totally clean and free of buildup in my pores.</li>
            <li>more clean clear and younger looking.</li>
            <li>it is a slight slight rose smell but in a good way...</li>
            <li>it smells great, i can usually smell the rose for a little while after applying it.</li>
            <li>, at the first time I put this product on, I feel my face is so fresher than it ever before, no sticky, no oily but so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Looking at my bottle one day recently I noticed that it had alcohol in it (never bothered my skin though) and decided to look for some without alcohol in it in an attempt to get an even more pure product.</li>
            <li>This toner smells amazing and does not sting my face like other toners.</li>
            <li>rose scent, which is not overpowering like other beauty products on the market.</li>
            <li>if you do not like rose I would try one of the other varieties.</li>
            <li>As well as the face, this is nice to use on other areas of the body, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, legs, feet, &amp; after shaving.</li>
            <li>makes my skin look healthy will be buying more as long as they make it only issue</li>
            <li>This makes the solution smell so good, and it&#x27;s gentle on my little one&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, gentle, and it tones down the redness on my face, for sure.</li>
            <li>A couple weeks ago I decided to switch to a more natural face care regimen and using the advice of other reviewers I purchased Dr. Woods Black Soap, the Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel and organic argan oil (all from Amazon for cheap!)</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way on a cotton-ball and the light rose scent is much more tolerable than some other more pungent brands.</li>
            <li>It helps keep my face clean and clear without being drying.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for all skin and especially skin sensitive to alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Great facial product with minimal side effect reactions.</li>
            <li>Ok I understand all the hype behind this amazing product.</li>
            <li>My face feels fresh, clean, not dry.</li>
            <li>This is a great alcohol-free astringent with a subtle, rosy scent.</li>
            <li>She loves it, makes her skin glowy and clean, and plus it&#x27;s helped to clear up her acne.</li>
            <li>Purchased this to get away from the Clean &amp; Clear Astringents.</li>
            <li>They have amazing natural products, I&#x27;m constantly using it!</li>
            <li>It made my entire face itch, burn and turn bright red.</li>
            <li>and it makes her skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It makes my face soft , silky and clean</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, instead it leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Im still trying it but tell now I found that my face is so soft and clean.</li>
            <li>, my skin feels purified, clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling soft and clean..</li>
            <li>leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and I have not had an issue with my skin drying out or getting flaky.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft &amp; feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean and soft</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, refreshed and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I always feel soft and clean aftering using this toner.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t strip your natural oils but leaves you skin clean.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the smell doesn&#x27;t last, but I quickly realized that the toner made my skin very oily, even if I don&#x27;t have oily skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a gentle toner and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li>It tones my skin nicely, and helps with both the sensitive nature of it and the rosacea that I&#x27;ve finally gotten under control.  </li>
            <li>My facial aesthetician sells this product at her spa as well, so I feel further reassured that this is regarded as a good product by a skin care specialist.</li>
            <li>: I love that it is all natural, alcohol-free, has natural moisturizers, and contains witch hazel.</li>
            <li>i was looking for a toner to make my skin soft &amp; keep it clear and oil free all day!</li>
            <li>The rose scent is a bit too \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; for me, but that is just my personal preference.</li>
            <li>I love the soft floral scent and the way it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>and so i thought this should be good for me... yet who knows each individual is still different.</li>
            <li>I would even say this (along with a good moisturizer) has helped my skin over the last several weeks and contributed to my decrease in breakouts.</li>
            <li>So far, I have only tried the Rose scented.</li>
            <li>love the smell, much like roses, and works well enough.</li>
            <li>this product is not that magical, i feel uncomfortable when i using it,it do smells good, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>This toner gives me a very refreshed look after application and I can actually see healthy skin.</li>
            <li>I have acne and this definitely soothes it, plus the scent is a natural aloe and rose scent.</li>
            <li>and I have a lot of tiny bumps, blackheads, hormonal flare-ups, and mostly scarring from squeezing which I really shouldn&#x27;t do but can&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to use something more natural, and I think this helps my skin keep young.</li>
            <li>I get hormonal cystic acne breakouts when I&#x27;m really stressed on top of my regular period</li>
            <li>Makes my face feels refreshed and very soft, mild scent.</li>
            <li>but I really enjoy product packaging and this was a major pet peeve for me.</li>
            <li>gave me some redness, but I m not sure its because of the product, other wise , nice smell , and feel..</li>
            <li>After the very first use my skin felt not only clean but moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin but cleanses the face very well.</li>
            <li>Like others here, I very much appreciate that it has no alcohol and that it is affordable, two unusual features of Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>I read one person said that it caused the oils to come out of their pores the first few days, but it was a kind of cleansing, and it stopped after a few days and then they really loved it.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a toner than gave me the same clean feel without the alcohol and this toner does it!</li>
            <li>Made my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling clean but not tight.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had much luck with any that I&#x27;ve tried until I tried this!  </li>
            <li>I use a cotton ball to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much, so it will last me for a good long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost positive that the description did NOT include this fact at the time I decided to purchase).</li>
            <li>Cleaned my skin without any burning and my skin positively glowed after.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a toner for years but all the positive reviews enticed me to try it.</li>
            <li>The smell is positive and I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>This toner, from the research that I did, got a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I used it for about three weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any positive effects.</li>
            <li>I was attracted by those positive reviews of the product and bought it with a doubt.</li>
            <li>First purchased in October 2011, getting ready to reorder now (August 2012).</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to more expensive natural toners.</li>
            <li>I love it and wonder how my skin survived so long with out Thayers.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and cleansing but it did not clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>, that is after I tried pretty much every toner out there.  </li>
            <li>I had been using Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel in the summer just to clear my pores after washing my face and to cool off when I was outdoors with no makeup.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even really know what it was supposed to do exactly.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is how much you get for your money-</li>
            <li>Fast shipping exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything from the store</li>
            <li>At the beginning I did not notice a great deal of difference in my complexion, but I did notice that it did not make my face red like other toners I had tried immediately after using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks and much luck to you!</li>
            <li>I like a real -scent , not fake perfumey scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I got it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Mine was been super-soft lately, it works nice as a refresher - it does minimize pores too!</li>
            <li>I thought at first it did not do much for my skin</li>
            <li>I am 48 years old and honestly my skin really does looks years younger.</li>
            <li>After using it my skin feels totally refreshed soft and the rose scented water really uplifts my mood.</li>
            <li>So I have been trying this out and must say it has a soft sweet scent,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s make my face feel so good and soft without the burning affect of other toners.</li>
            <li>After awhile the product clouded up and the smell has kind of a sour smell now.</li>
            <li>I used this in the past and, while I loved the smell, wasn&#x27;t wowed by it.</li>
            <li>Witch hazel is a natural astringent and this product has the addition of rose petal water, aloe vera and vitamin E, and it is very nourishing and non-drying (in fact quite the opposite, softening!)</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, so at the most time of my life I was suffering from bigger and very visible pore, blackhead, and acne etc..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been doing a good job clearing my face off pimples, blemishes and whiteheads for the past 7 months.</li>
            <li>Going to try and find a small spray bottle to keep some on hand during the day when I need to be refreshed &amp; to keep makeup looking good.</li>
            <li>use it every day on sensitive skin and no bad smell</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for the real deal in terms of what Witch Hazel can really do, and, most importantly, what it was intended for; for the real deal before manufactured watered down brands overran the shelves, then this is the one to try.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a more subtle effect, but you will still be able to feel the difference.</li>
            <li>It smells lovely lovely but subtle.</li>
            <li>I feel so refresh after I put it on fast drying and leaves s soft clean feeling on your face.</li>
            <li>At first my skin had some reaction to it, but then it was fine after several uses.</li>
            <li>I have been doing this routine twice daily, and my skin looks fresh and clean, no clogged pores or blackheads, and my skin looks firmer and tighter.</li>
            <li>I mean whether or not it REALLY does much, it feels great.  </li>
            <li>I would rather price my own products a little higher than buy cheaper ingredients that I can&#x27;t trust--and I think my clients appreciate my stance.  </li>
            <li>The smell is gentle and sweet and cozy, I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I actually tried the lavender/cucumber one, but switched back to the rose one because it works better for me personally.</li>
            <li>but it has a nice fresh clean and very delicate water like appearance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this, and I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s being made!</li>
            <li>This particular brand feels good going on, leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight.  </li>
            <li>Even after the first use, the next morning I noticed a huge difference with my skin....</li>
            <li>Have a great smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, leaves the skin between dry and moisture!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin so keep using brand named mild toner: shishedo, clarins etc.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and a lot of products just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I feel it mild, but it never disturbed my sensitive skin so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It reduces the visibility of capillaries and is a mild natural cleanser.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just as effective and less drying</li>
            <li>cause this toner can dry it out more if not).</li>
            <li>As an adult with mild acne, this product helps keep the breakouts, somewhat, in check.</li>
            <li>My face don&#x27;t feel dry any more.</li>
            <li>it seems quite calming to my super sensitive, prone to redness skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s super gentle--perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin, and anything with fragrance, alcohol, chemical coloring, mineral oil, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found it helps minimize irritation, especially on my neck and has also eliminated my very mild and infrequent acne spots on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It does clear it up quickly when I use the witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I never regret with my bold action this time.</li>
            <li>I had previously purchased another type of Rose water, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>My face feels super clean after using, and the fragrance is subtle, yet lovely.  </li>
            <li>I love this product so much I immediately ordered a replacement so I wouldn&#x27;t be without it for long.</li>
            <li>I have used this before in the past and loved it so much that I got some for my mother.</li>
            <li>there are several people said it has a \\&quot;strong smell\\&quot; and \\&quot;smell cheap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t as strong as the one I bought last time.</li>
            <li>only reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because of the scent--to me, it&#x27;s a bit grandma-ish, and strong.</li>
            <li>Feels very soft and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li>It works great at removing the deep down dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>Even better, I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair since I started using it.  </li>
            <li>I guess it was a smart move, sell expired stuff on Amazon, they&#x27;ll never</li>
            <li>Certainly have made a face routine with this</li>
            <li>This also helped me with my acne problems and certainly helped prevent breakouts by cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this by pure accident.</li>
            <li>While I do not think that it minimizes my pores, it certainly did not enlarge it or cause any excess oil secretion.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve certainly noticed clearer/glowing skin</li>
            <li>This is the number one reason I ordered the large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At around $9.00 you get a fairly large bottle compared to department store toners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fairly large bottle for the price</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li>I like that it is pure and non-toxic.</li>
            <li>(I also take the murad Pure Skin clarifying Dietary supplement)</li>
            <li>so this is a long-term use product for your chronicly large pores.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>I use to have large pores but ever since I&#x27;ve used this with skin laboratory&#x27;s 20% Salicylic acid peel</li>
            <li>I wanted pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Large area of allergic rash......</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>Why mess with something so amazing?</li>
            <li>For the very first time I used a face toner that doesn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>one of the very first ingredients before witch hazel is fragrance and my face is extremely sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>Using this product only made me realize that I&#x27;m personally sensitive to Thayer&#x27;s which is interesting since their ingredients aren&#x27;t exactly toxic.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling fresh and soft!</li>
            <li>And a little cheaper than Whole Foods :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>Foxbrim brand made my skin feel dried out in so many ways!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, but so far, I&#x27;m really loving it.  </li>
            <li>Decided to give the Rose Petal a shot due to the high ratings and it did not work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been keeping it in a zip-lock in my gym bag, just in case the top comes loose, and I have had no spills.</li>
            <li>The bumps never amounted to pimples (but I still DID get pimples), and it was highly noticeable, especially if the light hit me just right.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s fast drying, and the slight smell of rose petals tops it off.</li>
            <li>Slight rose scent but not too much for the men in my family to use, as well.  </li>
            <li>This product smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t dry out my delicate face or neck skin, yet</li>
            <li>The nice tight snap cap is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this because of the inexpensive cost, but after time, and once I could afford higher end beauty products, I found myself coming back to this toner.  </li>
            <li>In such a short period of time it&#x27;s managed to eliminate most of my blackheads AND shrink my pores, something I&#x27;ve been trying to do unsuccessfully for years!</li>
            <li>I notice smaller pores, more even skintone and my face just feels and looks soft!</li>
            <li>is that first I use Noxzema&#x27;s original deep cleansing cream ([[ASIN</li>
            <li>It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I can see the fine lines starting to disappear!  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first, mainly because the product looks like a cliche &amp;#34;miracle elixir&amp;#34; from 1875.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this toner in particular.</li>
            <li>The scent is blissful and the efficacy is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>Contains a rosey scent and very affordable for its large size.</li>
            <li>but this is by far the easiest less intrusive most effective for what I need and that&#x27;s just simple cleansing, toner, and astringent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, the rose petal version of this toner smells a little aggressive.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use on your eyelids and seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>Very good for my complicated skin.</li>
            <li>Honestly, i have very dry sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s hot and muggy, this is a great way to clean my face from sweat.</li>
            <li>moistrurizing very well, can smell rose a little bit.</li>
            <li>This gently scented toner is just right for my sensitive skin and I and expect to have it in my bathroom forever!</li>
            <li>Because this obviously does not smell like a perfume, this scent is more natural and pure.</li>
            <li>I like that the top is a squirt top so only a little comes out at a time.</li>
            <li>Very natural products!!</li>
            <li>The toner is great, doesn&#x27;t dry my face like other toners.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find good quality REAL Witch Hazel</li>
            <li>Taking the extra step to tone the skin with a product such as this Thayers Rose Witch Hazel, yields a very high increase in the efficacy of any serum &amp;/or overnight treatments</li>
            <li>This is a great product and something that&#x27;s part of my everyday facial care routine.  </li>
            <li>My only huge issue with it is the smell.</li>
            <li>It tingles just slightly after I apply it and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s witch hazel, which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks,  is a great astringent.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s no big deal, the huge difference in price makes up for that.</li>
            <li>Which is amazing because my face usually is easily dried out by ANYTHING I put on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my break outs, they&#x27;re not as intense,my skin is much tighter, and pores are smaller.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how something so simple could make a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I use my cotton ovals to do mask with it twice daily after cleansing, it feels so comfortable and gentle after applying it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it&#x27;s a nice, faint whiff of rose.&lt;br /&gt;The softening effect.</li>
            <li>However, it also makes your face soft, and completely dirt and oil free.</li>
            <li>IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS PACKAGED VERY WELL</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very picky</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely DESPISE however, about this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li>I guess the aloe really does work.</li>
            <li>I had bought witch hazel before but didn&#x27;t think to look at it too much and realized when I got home that it contained alcohol.</li>
            <li>reasonable price.</li>
            <li>If anything,  it makes my face sooo much oilier and greasier.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toner for almost 3 years and really really like it.</li>
            <li>It does everything it promises too also...leaves my skin feeling clean, but NOT dry.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and it always leaves my skin looking and feeling very refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a real person and so are you (hopefully)</li>
            <li>I have used up a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, but I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well as the Clearasil brand toner.</li>
            <li>The pads are ready &amp; hassel free.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>Leave me skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to help or hurt much.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>This toner really cleanses and moisturizes my oily/combo skin needs.</li>
            <li>go through a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is still very moisturizing for a toner.</li>
            <li>My acne scars are fading fast which could be from either or all of the three products I&#x27;m now using.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really understand the use of toner</li>
            <li>Alcohol free was a big plus.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate though I have found if I use too much I can feel it on my face.</li>
            <li>It has been very helpful for the dermatitis that I have on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have oily/sensitive skin with light rosacea and this toner cleans off any traces of cleanser and preps my skin for the next step in my regime.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it really helped her.  </li>
            <li>With that being said, it didn&#x27;t do much to help treat my acne, so my seach continues for another toner.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>I have very temperamental skin with dermatitis, acne and rosacea...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to any woman or man of any age, the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>and I feel like this really helps keep in moisture</li>
            <li>I really cleared my complexion and gave me a rosy glow.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my wife as she really enjoys the smell of roses.</li>
            <li>I have been battling acne for fourteen years and after trying a plethora of products OTC and prescription, I&#x27;ve decided natural remedies are worth a shot.</li>
            <li>So gentle</li>
            <li>she didnt like it as much as the walmart one</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>really like the scent, texture (it&#x27;s a bit moisturizing), and how it preps my skin before my moisturizer (I use jojoba oil).  </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, either.</li>
            <li>St. Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control - use to gently exfoliate twice a week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very lightweight liquid and isn&#x27;t greasy in the slightest.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Which I really would rather not smell on my face.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and acne.</li>
            <li>If you have acne-prone skin, I would highly suggest this miracle worker as well!</li>
            <li>It cleased my face very well</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and it just leaves a fresh feel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really torn on this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>and it does so much for my skin.</li>
            <li>it is so gentle for my face and do not have alcohol.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very soothing - reminds me of my grandma 😊</li>
            <li>The price is also quite affordable (I got mine at Whole Foods for $9.99</li>
            <li>This makes my face feel so fresh and soft</li>
            <li>I really like this toner.</li>
            <li>This might be the product I&#x27;ve been searching for my whole life.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use products like this very often</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my skin breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li>I really like the Thayer&#x27;s brand as a toner to help with my rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li>it keeps my skin very moisturized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light enough scent that I can handle it for now.</li>
            <li>I really like how this feels.</li>
            <li>I used to use Mario Badescu cucumber toner, but it really was too drying.</li>
            <li>and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Unlike lotions, it doesnt make my skin real oily.</li>
            <li>but it did seem like too much for my skin</li>
            <li>You can see how much dirt it removes after you&#x27;ve already washed your face.</li>
            <li>really like it, and probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li>My face hates water and all cleansers, no matter how gentle, so I&#x27;ve stopped washing my face and started using this stuff instead.</li>
            <li>and it really helped for him.</li>
            <li>Very devoted, have been using on my face and the faces of my babes for years.</li>
            <li>My cousin recommended this toner, and I bought it despite me not even needing it really, but I felt I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since my acne was getting out of control.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price.</li>
            <li>My face thanks Thayers</li>
            <li>Really shrinks pores and leaves skin with even tone.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this toner.  </li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>No allergic reaction and results fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>2) it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Gentle, clean-smelling.</li>
            <li>So much nicer for a toner than the toners in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>and you can use it as much as you want throughout the day.</li>
            <li>After I shower and remove all my makeup from the day I put some of this on a cotton ball and gently apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li>It really did not work anything for</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It smells like heaven and really clears up any spots on your face without drying them up with alcohol.</li>
            <li>The alcohol free is also a big bonus.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all thanks to this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li>Very drying even without any alochol.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it in the evening after the last step of cleansing and before the fist step of moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>shipment was fast.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin fresh and not dried out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell and you just slap some on your face after you wash, morning and night.  </li>
            <li>, I found that it also worked really well on my son&#x27;s weeping eczema.</li>
            <li>will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li>So i have a reason this toner is really organic with no chemical</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>that my sister bought me (also on Amazon, we really can use the internet for everything, huh?)</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore my witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really tried it yet..</li>
            <li>The toner keeps my face fresh and soft while the tea tree oil prevents pimples/oil build up.</li>
            <li>and I really prefer this.</li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>Gentle for skin and does just what it says it will</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and really balances, tones and cleans the remaining traces of junk off your skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does smell like roses</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and it looks so much smoother when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much softer than before.</li>

            <li>it really takes off the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t breakout as much since using this product.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t break out as much anymore</li>
            <li>this has really helped my skin will continue buying</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this toner and the way it makes me skin feel after using it.  </li>
            <li>Wondering if it is real one from the manufacturer or a faked one.</li>
            <li>works very well</li>
            <li>really like it</li>
            <li>I gave it to my sister ultimately as I really cant stand the smell.</li>
            <li>and I was made whole and told to keep the remaining product.</li>
            <li>Personally, I&#x27;m going to go toner free.</li>
            <li>Staying in the shower longer than you absolutely must will cause the skin to lift and peel.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel clean and not dry, smells like roses.</li>
            <li>so this really helps.</li>

            <li>feel very moist after use.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast and they were nice enough to pack it in a ziploc-type back in case the bottle leaked.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the aloe or the roses, but it really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>REAL ROSES DO SMELL LIKE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>Absolutely astounded.</li>
            <li>Now is this really a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; thing to do?</li>
            <li>, it really takes all the dirt out of my face.</li>
            <li>i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
            <li>While witch hazel isn&#x27;t the star of this product, the astringent is very soothing and even somewhat skin-smoothing.</li>
            <li>dont breal out as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much softer and cleaner looking and feeling.</li>
            <li>The toner is really soothing</li>
            <li>The packaging is just a plastic bottle, which looks rather &#x27;cheap&#x27; on my vanity, so I actually pour it into a spritzer bottle, and I spritz it onto my face, neck, and body after washing.</li>
            <li>It really tones everything up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Prior to using thayers, I would try all different facial cleansers, toners, moisturizer, serums, creams, etc and never be happy with my skin.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I scrubbed, I couldn&#x27;t get the lingering essence of grandma off my skin.</li>
            <li>very moisturizing but does not make skin oily.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Thayer toners!</li>
            <li>This toner is not only alcohol free but has vitamin E as well.  </li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling clean and refreshed - not dry.</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner is gentle, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my pore size.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend using it throughout the day as a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; as the product recommends unless you have very oily skin -</li>
            <li>The bottle that I bought recently in a store was paraben free.  </li>
            <li>The bottles available through Thayers website have different ingredients listed too.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I pour it into a spray bottle and gently mist my face.</li>
            <li>I use this product as a toner and it really helps to control my skin redness.</li>
            <li>The toner being alcohol-free helps so much.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to make skin look fresher and newer...</li>
            <li>It was much brighter and toned.</li>
            <li>I really like to use this after cleansing my face at night or morning.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often...very touchy skin...</li>
            <li>Reasonable Price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides as make-up remover, I use Witch Hazel as a gentle substitute of alcohol for wound cleansing.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Very cooling.</li>
            <li>, my skin now thanks me.</li>

            <li>It is gentle and nice-smelling.</li>
            <li>He is allergic to so much</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cloying with fragrance, and it&#x27;s fresh, not heavy.  </li>
            <li>but I found it on vitacost for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li>By the way...i have pretty normal skin</li>

            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know really what to think about this product.</li>
            <li>I peeled it and then the whole Thayer&#x27;s label got messed up.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy mixing it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>Gentle, recommended.</li>
            <li>i really recommend this product, it can be used as mist or toner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a convert, I really like it.</li>
            <li>and it really works and does not disturb your makeup.  </li>
            <li>It really works to even my tone.</li>
            <li>but I expected more.</li>
            <li>It has really cleared up my face...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I even had a friend come over who had a date at night, (because I am very into cosmetics and model) he trusted my judgement.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, product as described</li>
            <li>and I will absolutely purchase again through this business.</li>
            <li>This stuff sort of smells like my grandmother but as for its potency it works very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my daughter in law for getting me started with it.</li>
            <li>Very refreshingly&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Gentle and did not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>very hydrating without that sticky gunky sensation.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>My skin is very acne prone, I break to practically every product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to like this product, every way I tried to use it, it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I came across this product in my search, and saw that they sold it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>Delivery is fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This toner doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in term so tightening pores</li>
            <li>which I really and no alcohol.</li>
            <li>but it had been very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>Love the toner itself, BUT when it arrived, my package was wet and the bottle was leaking from the lid.</li>
            <li>(what does a grandma really smell like?</li>
            <li>but I really like the smell</li>
            <li>but no that much</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t really feel any softer and doesn&#x27;t really glow either</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading so much about toners.</li>
            <li>for I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really in need for a toner of this type.</li>
            <li>Which is all that really matters.</li>
            <li>also really like the smell.</li>
            <li>it is VERY drying.  </li>
            <li>so I won&#x27;t run out since I use it so much.</li>
            <li>Very cooling and soothing on sunburned skin, too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>so perhaps I will not experience this effect so much in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gently cleanses your skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Received item fast.</li>
            <li>Moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face at night and it removes all of the oil but still allows your skin to feel moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li>The smell is not so intense in the day time when I move around from time to time and have to focus on work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and reduces irritation.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference with my  hyperpigmentation</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, using this in the morning and at night has helped my skin to not be so oily.</li>
            <li>seller shipped this to me fast</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, and I notice no adverse effects on my face.</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much.</li>
            <li>It gently cleans my skin, and I never have even the tiniest blemish.</li>
            <li>Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free-Best Hyaluronic Acid for Your Face (Pro Formula) 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for decades, its all I use to cleanse my face morning and evening, except for my clarisonic once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I was brought up to be gentle to my skin.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone regardless of skin type!</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t notice it at all, really.)</li>
            <li>I really like it and will use it from now on</li>
            <li>but this is so gentle I have used it on my youngest child&#x27;s milia.</li>
            <li>I really like thus product.  </li>
            <li>It came wrapped really well.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>it came so fast</li>
            <li>first washing my face twice with my normal cleanser&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s quite gently on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a rather really self-conscious person,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>It really cleanses your skin well and there is no burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li>The smell takes some getting used to as it really smells like roses</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my skin &amp; non-drying.</li>
            <li>It has a smoother and softer feel to it than just straight Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>But anyways, when I do break out, now a break out consists of 4-6 pimples whereas it used to be my whole face.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li>and it does not cost much.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>I really like that this product is witch hazel based instead of alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone struggling with acne!</li>
            <li>I like to use a toner after washing my face but don&#x27;t want to pay the department store prices, and this is a product that works well for me and is priced reasonably.</li>
            <li>Fast service delivery with quality packaging.</li>
            <li>I have smaller pores now, no roughness or blemishes, and my skin is baby smooth.</li>
            <li>Gentle and cleanses without drying skin.</li>
            <li>Very disconcerting.</li>
            <li>But maybe I used too much or something.</li>
            <li>Fast</li>
            <li>Who knew alcohol free would make such a difference.</li>
            <li>delivered fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really helps a lot</li>
            <li>it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li>I was purchasing this off of Amazon until I saw cheaper price at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>the witch hazel is so gentle</li>
            <li>My skin feels much smoother and softer after use.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really cleans my face and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>But, this toner was very softening and moisturizing EVEN in that problem area.</li>
            <li>It really tightens my pores.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>and this is very soothing and calming when applied to those areas.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a very soothing, cleansing toner.</li>
            <li>Please do the patch test before applying to your whole body.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a very soothing lotion, leaving my skin feeling silky and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I feel it&#x27;s very soothing and beneficial for keeping my skin moist;</li>
            <li>Very hydrating and soothing.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and it works well tightening my pores.</li>
            <li>Gentle after washing toner.</li>
            <li>It was much pricier at around $14.00 there.</li>
            <li>The smell was way too much for me too.</li>
            <li>and it is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so gentle that I don&#x27;t *have</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>very useful！</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer and it shrank my pores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for years to combat shiny skin (my T-zone gets shiny FAST)</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Smells like roses and really softens and refreshes my skin.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is very pleasing too.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.</li>
            <li>I very seldom break out now.</li>
            <li>and i love it, and second leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I skip lotion and apply Rose every few hours around the house.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is if it were all natural.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>Has a faint rose scent, which i love.</li>
            <li>Three days later it&#x27;s completely gone and my skin just feels better.</li>
            <li>My skin always looks wonderful when I use it regularly, and I feel like I could use it at any time of the day to freshen up without over irritating my face.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday, as it&#x27;s gentle and effective in controlling overproduction of oil.</li>
            <li>It left me red and dryness but not this Rose water.</li>
            <li>Because I stripped away my natural oil, my skin only produced more to make up for it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no need to ever buy a chemically produced astringent when you can have all natural ingredients that essentially produce better results.</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine.</li>
            <li>Only toner I have ever liked, only toner I will ever use.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much more hydrated and clear in just a couple weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>Apply Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera to dried face with a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Apply Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera to dried face with a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li>Although I have a more intense beauty regiment because I suffer from hyperpigmentation, I use several several different products, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love using natural products on my skin, and this has definitely become a \\&quot;staple\\&quot; for me!</li>
            <li>The aloe is a nice touch and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after use thanks to it.</li>
            <li>My face is clear and my pores more refined, and I haven&#x27;t even been having the occasional blemish I used to get.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, use every evening as a toner to remove any trace of make up and oil that my soap left behind.</li>
            <li>Good with normal skin tone, not sure if it works for oil skin.</li>
            <li>later I removed the rose and witch Hazel toner from the plastic baggie and went to open</li>
            <li>Just received it a few days ago, but I&#x27;m really loving it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned through my own trials and tribulations that what works for one (or even many) definitely doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll work for me, so I warn you not to assume this product will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, not tight.  </li>
            <li>For easier application and to not waste the product I put it in a small plastic travel bottle with an applicator top or a spray bottle, to easily dab or spritz.</li>
            <li>Super delicate smell, love the package design, always leaves my skin feeling refreshed  even after  a hot summer day.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something natural to accompany my soaps that I hand make and I have found it...!!!</li>
            <li>The rose scent may be too intense for some, so add the plain solution to create an acceptable dilution.</li>
            <li>I never really know when it might have a mini fit, say, right by my nose.</li>
            <li>Have used other more expensive toners before - but this one by far works the best.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s suitable for dry, oily, sensitive, and acne skin.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better for normal to dry skin, leaves skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same as what is found at Super Supplements or Vitamin Shoppe (et.al).</li>
            <li>Very big bottle, delivered quickly and exactly as it appears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and haven&#x27;t really seen too big of a result, but I feel very clean in the face and my skin has brightened up CONSIDERABLY.</li>
            <li>After much researching, I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a shot, mainly due to the good price and numerous raving reviews, and the fact that it contains no alcohol and is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first bought it a year ago because I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>We had been using just the plain witch hazel and a friend told us to try this one with the Rose Petal</li>
            <li>It helps to make it smell fresh down there and makes for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had faster results than any medications, than any pretty packaging promising the moon--with basic, simple, honest, and natural products.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and is exactly what they put in those expensive &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; sprays; I ordered a small glass spray bottle and pretty happy with the cost-savings.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I just leave my face with this alone - it keeps it from becoming too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got everything you want from witch hazel, and the smell isn&#x27;t a strong, strange one.</li>
            <li>I originally use regular Witch Hazel for my toner but found it very drying.</li>
            <li>Smells like a rose but is not a strong scent.</li>
            <li>skin didn&#x27;t break out when using it, but it also didn&#x27;t seem to pick up that much dirt compared to an OTC toner such as clean &amp; clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this product is suitable for every skin type, my mother has very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My blackheads are slowly but surely becoming fewer and fewer, and my skin is far more radiant.</li>
            <li>unlike many other withc hazel out there.</li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, this product broke me out.</li>
            <li>So I bought this as a replacement, because I do like the witch hazel but wanted something that would also moisturize my skin, plus something that smelled better than the twiggy smell the other one had.</li>
            <li>OMG, not sure if it is because of this toner, but my skin noticeably looks more radiant after using this toner!</li>
            <li>will make this a normal part of my skin care routine!</li>
            <li>Works like a charm every day and the effects don&#x27;t seem to wear off like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>So excited to finally find Witch Hazel without alcohol.  </li>
            <li>but it truly is much better than the other witchhazel that I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I noticed there is lavender and many other choices.  </li>

            <li>Cleans your skin better than any other product out there and reduces pores without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li>And i&#x27;m glad it arrived on time with my other products.</li>
            <li>I like it better than the other toner I&#x27;d been using...</li>
            <li>Better than other toner.</li>
            <li>Most all other moisturizers that I use make me break out.</li>
            <li>I believe other people may have had a better experience than me</li>
            <li>Besides that, it definitely cleans my face and has significantly improved my complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my complexion since using it, which is odd but fine by me.  :-)</li>
            <li>was inspired to purchase the Thayers witch hazel in peach after finishing half my existing rose bottle, but unfortunately the alcohol in it (rose is alcohol free) did not react so well with my face.</li>
            <li>I used it only when it comes as a free gift or sample, but after I read couple reviews on youtube, and I checked on amazon, this toner is highly recommended by people, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of witch hazel, and natural skincare in general.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t drying but it definitely gets my skin clean.</li>
            <li>My son has been using this toner to clean his ski, as he is prone to break out occasionally.  </li>
            <li>After becoming addicted to this product, and purchasing it in stores, I decided my habit needed a better outlet.</li>
            <li>One bottle usually lasts me several months, so it is a great value.  </li>
            <li>You can just spray it on your face several times a day to keep your complexion moisturized, clean, and your oil production under control.</li>
            <li>not a miracle cure if you have acne, but will definitely get any grime/dirt off your face and leave you feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li>I put it in a small spray bottle to use as a facial mist instead of just using a cotton pad to apply and it works great.</li>
            <li>I use this daily and love what it does to even out redness and blemishes and to improve the general appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>for this was a bit steep for me at first, but when I received it and started using it, I definitely think that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I usually use this and some light moisturizer after I wash my face and it is very refreshing (since my skin is dry as well</li>
            <li>and I do feel like it actually does clean out my pores while moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It give me an instant clean feel</li>
            <li>used to use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby oil to remove make-up as it does a great job too, but Witch Hazel achieves the same effect, if not better, without any grease.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty big bottle and very much worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>so use this every morning to clean my skin prior to applying a serum &amp; sunscreen moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing and makes my skin a good base for lotion application.</li>
            <li>It does seem to clean up left over residue and makeup that didn&#x27;t come off via washing</li>
            <li>It helps to clean my face after facial wash.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised by how fast it really transformed the texture of my skin and helped my breakouts after it was very disgruntled from infection.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use warm water (not hot or it&#x27;ll dry your face) to wash your face in order to open up your pores and and wash all the dirt away.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to use this based on the other reviewers reviews.</li>
            <li>So much more effective than other toners with harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but used for weeks and still have older age acne, pimples between my eyes and a couple other area.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>High quality witch hazel really does help tone and soften skin.</li>
            <li>I feel like it really cleans my face and pores well because I see whats on my cotton ball after wiping down my face with this toner and its not pretty lol.</li>
            <li>After I use this, I usually apply jojoba oil to really fight any blemishes and maintain smooth, clean skin.</li>
            <li>I live in a very humid climate and have combination skin that gets very oily in the t-zone.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel anything special or different with this</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s high quality, and smells better than other brands of witch hazel for some reason.</li>
            <li>and so many people raved about this product I had to try it and have high hopes for it to do all the things other reviewers say it does.</li>
            <li>A real keeper as far as I am concerned!!</li>
            <li>It does make my skin feel a bit softer, though I typically put a layer of lotion on top of it because my skin gets very cracked otherwise.</li>
            <li>Glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like regular witch hazel</li>
            <li>went on a business trip and left this at home and freaked out, luckily GNC and Whole Foods sell</li>
            <li>Maybe I should have known that rose petal is your typical old lady scent, but somehow I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out regular skin and smells nice.</li>
            <li>This smells like roses and leaves my skin feeling soft instead of dry like most astringents.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel fresh with a long lasting clean feeling without over drying!</li>
            <li>From past November till January my skin care routine that I started from mid-october started showing amazing results.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to write something about this amazing product.</li>
            <li>Looks like ordinary water but its effects are amazing.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner and wish I could just force myself to stop slipping from my skin routine because it really makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I did try another brands supposedly &#x27;authentic&#x27; rose water, and finally found the worse smelling product on the market.</li>
            <li>I have no idea how her skin-whispering facial skills told her that, but as she left me with amazing, soft skin, I believed her.&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li>Light fragrance, gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues using this toner.</li>
            <li>Also, WOW, it does so much cleaning!</li>
            <li>I also exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs, but this is the first product that has prevented them completely.  </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I think this is a good product just not good for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents and had no issues.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really liking it!</li>
            <li>Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it is the rose petals or what</li>
            <li>I buy simply because I am a full time college students</li>
            <li>It worked for me and I am pretty much sensitive to everything else.  </li>
            <li>Nice to put on my skin, but I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s benefiting my skin at all.</li>
            <li>First off, my product was shipped and delivered on time, and arrived completely in tact, sealed and everything.</li>
            <li>I will probably also will use a stronger rose-hip oil, non-creamy blend for scarring in the future since I have used this in addition to shea, cocoa, and conconut oil instead of the lavender oil-based products I have bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now instead of using the alcohol to disinfect my skin in addition to a tea-tree oil cleanser, I am glad I switched to this in addition to a 10 percent, glycolic acid natural cleanser from Be Natural Organics and a stay-on</li>
            <li>Put some on a cotton pad and it wipes away the daily grime and leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li>never used a toner before, but apparently there&#x27;s a bit of debate as to whether or not they&#x27;re even worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this particular Thayers witch hazel religiously for almost 3 years now but my most recently bottle caused my skin to become very irritated.</li>
            <li>So, so far it&#x27;s been a catch-22 and in the mean time I got a generic &amp;#34;sensitive skin astringent&amp;#34; from the dollar store which pretty much works great, but has a smell I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin and needed something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but it is gentle enough that it is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Even when it dried, and makeup was over it--the smell was too strong!</li>
            <li>Love the product, just used it for little over a week and find it very soothing.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about ordering this because regular witch hazel doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li>New Holy Grail product added to my skincare regimen!</li>
            <li>A new staple at my home!</li>
            <li>I had been needing a new toner and at this point I would of done anything to help my skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s toner for several years now, but the smell was becoming more harsh and I was nearly choking on the &amp;#34;fumes&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Using this a couple of times a day, little pimples went away leaving my 12 year old&#x27;s skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like so many other toners do, and leaves my skin squeaky clean and radiant.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to say oily, but it was more like the toner was being squeezed back out of my pores after it had been absorbed, and my face was basically wet!</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel is also soothing and it has all natural ingredients, even the Rose is a natural fragrance not like the fragrances they put in all other kinds of products.</li>
            <li>Thayers must have introduced new packaging which I really like</li>
            <li>I purchased mine from Whole Foods, but was going to order a new bottle from Amazon until I saw the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Brand new and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin smooth and refreshed, have not had a breakout so often with this product and it lasts very long</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, either.</li>
            <li>It seems more even and less oily.</li>
            <li>Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel better as it feels like it leaves less residue on my skin.</li>
            <li>Since this toner&#x27;s alcohol free, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>Being alcohol free is also a plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out nor aggravate my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, day by day my skin became more tolerant of the toner and instead of the slight stinging</li>
            <li>It has a delicate rose smell that&#x27;s not overpowering, and it&#x27;s much gentler than just using outright witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>and this is the main component of my toner.</li>
            <li>The price is decent, too.</li>
            <li>This toner does a decent job at moisturizing and soothing skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not have the money to by the top of the line products that I usually use since I am getting married and have a wedding to pay for.</li>
            <li>Really nice for use after wet shaving too soothe your skin, possibly in conjunction with an alum block.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent makeup remover and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>And with the amount inside the bottle, it will last a good few months.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to look smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li>I bought this product mainly to use as a toner.  </li>
            <li>Smells a lot like an older person (one who showers of course).</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel used to be an older time skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Super Detox Elixir?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY acne products and this is the only one that I see actually working on my skin.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a cotton ball and not only is it refreshing, but all the red spots on my face disappeared.  </li>
            <li>this is a good second toner after you use the harsh stuff.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait to write a review on this, mainly to see the impact it had on my face, and woahh it did.</li>
            <li>This is a main staple in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>Is amazon selling something else, or perhaps an older product?  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 nights now, but it&#x27;s definitely not breaking me out.</li>
            <li>just started using it, got a bigger bottle than I expected which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>have tried several kinds of face lotion, and was hooked on Eucerin for quite some time, and this would only sit on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>classic product for all things that need Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>I have decent skin</li>
            <li>I also use it on my son&#x27;s back after removing his medication patch to help heal the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li>I did have an initial break out on my nose, but it went away fairly quickly with continued use.</li>
            <li>I am not a big believer on things working so quickly</li>
            <li>Thayers witch hazel has been a favorite staple in my facial routine for the last year compared to witch hazels you buy in store</li>
            <li>The bottle was the main reason I was attracted to this product.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn my face, smells decent.</li>
            <li>Since a main ingredient in the Proactive toner is witch hazel, I thought I&#x27;d try Thayer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Maybe when I am a bit older I will appreciate a product like this...just not now.</li>
            <li>I was going to go out and buy the Ponds caring classic (5 stars review)</li>
            <li>: I received the package very quickly and at first I was a little apprehensive because the liquid looked like baby oil inside the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very oily acne prone very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and leaves it very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>No alcohol + the addition of aloe makes this gentle, even for some folks&#x27; very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Very soothing witch hazel for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This toner really works, better than plain which hazel and definitely better than the more expensive brand name I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>This is coming from someone who has very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>If you are very sensitive, this may be the toner you have been looking for!</li>
            <li>Gentle and all natural!</li>
            <li>Order arrives quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>I made sure it was on tight and still it leaked.</li>

            <li>I am confident that it cleans out any residue left over at the end of the day before I go to bed, and at the same time, it&#x27;s gentle and soothing and never harsh or drying.</li>
            <li>After reading so many of the positive reviews here I was anxious to try this product</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll continue using this for a long time because it makes my skin glow, feel clean, moisturizes/evens out my complexion</li>
            <li>In winter just put a rose oil or other over it for extra skin hydration.</li>
            <li>I breakout so much to new things that I&#x27;m really in fear when I try new</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand because it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, even pure Aloe Vera which is soothing and isn&#x27;t supposed to burn.</li>
            <li>I put this on his face, and it was TOTALLY clear by the evening!!</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the smell but some of you may not; it sticks around for a little bit after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does help a little though, and it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li>(lavender is a favorite) and a little goes a loong way.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to see what my skin will look like after long term use!</li>
            <li>Most of the time I don&#x27;t even use cotton balls and just splash a little on my face.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feels, but one day my skin was a little taught.</li>
            <li>but I prefer a little more witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>This Thayer facial toner is all natural and absolutely fantastic for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Once you smell it a little more it does smell like roses.</li>
            <li>Feeling a little help for my nose pole, not so sure yet, because I just start to use it.</li>
            <li>It simply does exactly what it says it will!</li>
            <li>but I think with a little more time....</li>
            <li>Sometimes to give it a little more oomph I add a drop of tea tree oil on the cotton</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I saw the light before those products could do any serious damage.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and suffer from mild acne that has left scars on my face.</li>
            <li>but it lasts forever, smells amazing, cools and cleans my humid skin after a hard day</li>
            <li>its very gentle and very helpful when i have occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much that I got it for my 17 year old little sister</li>
            <li>Let me be clear that this toner is not bad, in fact, it&#x27;s a lot better than other toners I&#x27;ve tried because it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it also did not fulfill the hopes that I had when trying it.</li>
            <li>It is very smooth and not strong.</li>
            <li>(I use the soap first and, with a bristle skin brush and warm water, I scrub my face in tight circular motions and then pat dry and apply this toner with a cotton ball)</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a new, more natural beauty routine and after doing some research, I purchased this product along with Leven Rose Jojoba Oil, Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural, Viva Labs</li>
            <li>Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always heard that Witch Hazel was amazing for your skin, but I never liked the smell.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s gentle and soft.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on the skin and calms my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product so far</li>
            <li>I recommend to anyone that wants to tone his/her skin without stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and cooling, and I&#x27;m not worried about using any of the ingredients around sensitive parts of my body.  </li>
            <li>This really helps to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>I honestly really prefer my sensitive skin astringent from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>and my skin is soft and I haven&#x27;t been breaking out on my forehead as much as well.</li>
            <li>My face is clear and hydrated for the first time in my adult</li>
            <li>but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I have very persistent adult acne that I have battled with since I was about 22</li>
            <li>Using this really helps restore a natural balance while also getting rid of any dullness.</li>
            <li>It feels so natural and still picks up dirt- not as much dirt as the harsher brands though, so if you have oily acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>This is something really natural and gently for my face.</li>
            <li>Gentle on sensitive skin and isn&#x27;t stripping at all.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so am really cautious about the products I put on it.</li>
            <li>Not harsh and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I really like this natural toner.</li>
            <li>but then I don&#x27;t have a real sensitive nose like some people do.  </li>
            <li>This is a gentle toner, not heavy duty.</li>
            <li>I was a littel nervous because I have sensitive skin, this was gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural, gentle toner.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so clear, and really hydrates it, even without a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t do we&#x27;ll with moisturizers, since my skin is so sensitive, so this really helps out.</li>
            <li>Makes my face very radiant and soft.</li>
            <li>I really want to recommend it to the person who with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is sensitive in places and not so much in others.</li>
            <li>have very acne-proned, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very oily and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel clean but not overly dry.</li>
            <li>I would have thought it would be drying when it fact it makes my skin feel soft and is very soothing.</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all, very soothing.</li>
            <li>Really keeps my skin soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li>I say normal meaning</li>
            <li>Love it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>and it is the first toner that hasnt dried out my face and left it bright red.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few years now and  love it.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell like actual, fresh roses.</li>
            <li>I use witch hazel toner whenever I run out of my regular Loreal Hydra fresh toner.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it anymore, since it hindered my skin more than it improved it.</li>
            <li>I do love it and it picks up dirt well with a cotton round.</li>
            <li>Most toners are too harsh for me and seemed to break me out a lot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to update my review in a few weeks with more specs on how well it works for me.</li>
            <li>Lately, I&#x27;ve been mixing my own toner using this and Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and some distilled water.</li>
            <li>I normally use witch hazel for my face.</li>
            <li>Knowing that I tend to add a few layers on top of my darker spots, hopefully it will even out my skintone.</li>
            <li>Still need your normally makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and normally my makeup</li>
            <li>I use this on emerging zits and trouble spots, and it&#x27;s lovely without being too drying.</li>
            <li>refreshing- without the harsh drying or stinging of alcohol-based toners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money because of all the benefits.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t feel like normal toners.</li>
            <li>The rose petal scent is natural, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks now and love the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I use it every day, but I am sure to use it after a harsh glycolic treatment which I do a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>I use witch hazel on my skin since many toners tend to be too harsh.</li>
            <li>Well worth it and a giant bottle for the quality and price.</li>
            <li>use it everyday, love it</li>
            <li>The only thing is the smell, it&#x27;s not bad and it fades away, but it has that old fashion smell that remind me of my grandma beauty routine when I am using it.</li>
            <li>skin is normal</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical about this at first, and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I received this within a few days of ordering and have been really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get many wrinkles, but must always battle the downsides of youthful skin while trying not to be too harsh on my &amp;#34;not a spring chicken&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use for a few more weeks to see what it does.</li>
            <li>This Works wonders on my combination skin (normal, oily t-zone).</li>
            <li>Many toners have harsh chemicals and alcohol in them.</li>
            <li>This Winter weather is really harsh on my skin and this product has helped my skin to be more moisturized even with makeup on.</li>
            <li>and recently I have been trying to purchase more natural facial products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used everything from birth control pills to prescription-strength topical cream that totally dried my face out (and launched me into severe break outs as soon as I stopped using it) to homemade masks that felt nice but didn&#x27;t do much against my acne.</li>
            <li>I normally apply it after washing my face and before I moisturise.</li>
            <li>I have behind one ear from oxygen hose, and it appears to have done that a world of good with just one application.</li>
            <li>Still a good product, just broken on arrival.</li>
            <li>The shipping on it was kind of slow</li>
            <li>I think it does a good job of wiping off any dirt/grease and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or dry out my skin like more astringent facial cleansers and a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for sensitive to normal skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, and the rose scent calms me down.</li>
            <li>And the smell is completely artificial, very unnatural and too too strong!!!</li>
            <li>It smells good and suits me a lot, my skin is a little dry and mix.</li>
            <li>I have really oily skin, so using oils on my face seemed kind of silly to me, but before using this, I used a lot of hygiene products that had synthetic fragrances and chemicals in them, and they would dry my face out and during the day my face would secrete even more oil.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out your skin, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this witch hazel or the new face oil is the reason for my much improved skin, but I love this product.</li>
            <li>Witch Hazel is fine, so it&#x27;s some other ingredient that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  </li>
            <li>I ran out this week and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to throw out the bottle until the new bottle arrived in the mail, hoping I could eek out a few more skin nourishing</li>
            <li>but honestly you can get the same product at the dollar store for a lot less $$.  </li>
            <li>The rose scent is noticeably less, which is not a big deal</li>
            <li>Most toners make my skin feel dry and ashy, but this is a completely different product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easily twice the size of the BB version, and essentially the same ingredients!</li>
            <li>Recently, I decided to give it another shot, since now I use more makeup and did not want to dry my skin out with an alcohol-based toner.</li>
            <li>have combination skin with dry patches around my cheeks, and an oily t-zone, and let me just say--this product makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, but I love a toner with a slight fragrance.  </li>
            <li>My skin is too dry in the winter to use the toner without a moisturizer, but in the summer I might be able to use only the toner in the morning.</li>
            <li>Smell is delicate and pleasant and it does an knock-out job removing last traces of makeup.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS NOT HARSH, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL NICE AND IS NOT LIKE OTHER NAME BRANDS THAT COST BIG BUCKS.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any toners with alcohol in them and the ones I have tried that don&#x27;t have alcohol don&#x27;t seem any better than plain water.</li>
            <li>I went right back to Thayers</li>
            <li>but  Every once in a while one will sneak up, usually back to when I am not eating right.  </li>
            <li>I especially like to use it right before bed.</li>
            <li>The effect upon using is instant - there is a tingling sensation and the skin feels fresher, cleaner right away.</li>
            <li>My pores feel so clean, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all!</li>
            <li>As for the rest of my face...I have decent clear skin already, but this product has really added a natural, if you will, glow to my skin.</li>
            <li>I had read that for some skin types, soaps of ANY kind will create a never ending cycle of dried out skin followed by break outs (due to more oil being produced to make up for the dry skin).</li>
            <li>think it is a good toner, only not suitable for me.</li>
            <li>...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organic ingredients really help to keep my skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li>I went back to only useing it twice a day and my face is fine now.</li>
            <li>hot water, half a teaspoon of Thayer witch hazel, one tablespoon of coconut oil and a spoon of Dr Bronner&#x27;s mild baby soap.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very clean and does not feel harsh in any way.</li>
            <li>My daughter gets huge extremely itchy mosquito bites</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I notice any difference between this and regular witch hazel, but I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li>After a few more minutes, my face was red, blotchy and hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>I will be searching for other products available from this seller.</li>
            <li>not bad, really, a little bit too floral for me at the first sniff, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same, high quality product I was purchasing locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this toner due to all the high reviews.</li>
            <li>I must admit, I was wondering if the product could live up to the reviews when it comes to oily skin (I&#x27;ve tried everything), but I put it to the test.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try it as a new toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And look out for the launch of our new site this month which will feature product reviews, treatment reviews and spa reviews.</li>
            <li>And look out for the launch of our new site this month which will feature product reviews, treatment reviews and spa reviews.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s time to find new product for yourself.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>This IS my new toner.  </li>
            <li>I am new into witch hazel.</li>
            <li>but my skin cant live without this stuff..</li>
            <li>I live in Florida so makeup just melts off.</li>
            <li>This is the onyl new thing introduced to my face, as nothing in my diet or anything else has changed.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li>but I know she can&#x27;t live without the stuff.</li>
            <li>I thought it&#x27;s my allergic reactions to new product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these as new morning beauty routine for about a month.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim to try something new</li>
            <li>cleaned my face, used the new rosehip oil and and went to bed awhile after that and read for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super sketchy about what I put on my face, and reading other reviews I decided to try it, and it has cleared up so much of my skin</li>
            <li>Normally I would be hesitant to give a product, especially a beauty/cosmetic product, five stars, but I absolutely love this product, and I think it would be useful to many people and non-irritating/not a waste of money to people who end up not loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so soft and is going well with my new acne regimen!</li>
            <li>half the attractiveness of this product!(or use a sticker that will easily peel off )</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only ten dollars which is huge plus.</li>
            <li>As for the smell, if you don&#x27;t like heavy florals then I suggest trying a different kind.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and it has been good, which means I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative effect from using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and clear and glowing and looks very</li>
            <li>It soaked up excess oils and dirt left behind from my clarisonic and smelled great.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is noticeable but subtle.</li>
            <li>The scent smells like an older woman&#x27;s perfume, so if you are sensitive to smell, this might be too over powering or bothersome.</li>
            <li>and I really think it&#x27;s helped my skin become less red and more even in tone.</li>
            <li>Its gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave any film behind on my skin, just a nice smell.</li>
            <li>The rose smell is less similar to an actual rose and more artificial, like grenadine.</li>
            <li>After I wash, I use Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and a few drops of tea tree essential oil on a cotton ball and swab my face.</li>
            <li>I think it has helped dry up any blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li>Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel has improved the texture of my facial skin in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>The rose smell is subtle.</li>
            <li>I gave myself a few days of not using the Rose scented one to give my face a break, but when I started using the unscented one, the same thing happened</li>
            <li>With no harsh chemicals, this gentle and naturally fragrant alcohol-free toner seems to truly improve the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>has helped my skin heal quickly and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Use:&lt;br /&gt;For use as a daily facial toner, makeup remover, light moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>with any skin regime, it is important especially for those with oily skin as such as myself to follow up with a moisturizer after using a toner.</li>
            <li>Not to mention super dry skin from the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the product for at least five years and it really has kept my skin in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>I give it only 4 stars because I am not a huge fan of the rose smell.</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser, as good as the expensive toners sold at make-up counters for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I was a little put off by the smell at first (reminds me of elderly women) but got used to it quick.</li>
            <li>This is a second time purchase and the original bottle lasted us a super long time with daily use.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about buying this given the fact I couldn&#x27;t really see much real benefits to it, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling I normally do with other toners.</li>
            <li>Very gentle, also removes left over traces of make up.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin prone to irritation-related breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I know workers are very busy but please place sticker on another part of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Very unexpected, coming from a toner that I had never had any issues with.</li>
            <li>The smell takes awhile to get used to, but I like the idea that it&#x27;s a very natural product.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this toner feels like water on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li>I use it every morning on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is totally different from any toner I&#x27;ve used before in that it is very, very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this product every night and it has helped her teenage skin very much.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don;t feel irritated at all when using it, considering that I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive and this product has not irritated it one bit.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feels refreshed and very soft.</li>
            <li>I found this when I was searching for just the right natural pre-wedding skin care routine last year.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells great (very light), but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change since using this daily over the past week.</li>
            <li>Really great as far as witch hazel goes but its still a little harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to really clean my skin, and clear it up after coming back from a weeks worth of flying back and fourth to Florida and Hawaii.</li>
            <li>I put it on under my daily moisturizer, because my combination skin can get pretty dry in winter, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is actually very refreshing to add to my daily routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received it a few days ago, started using it right away, it made my face feel tight, not the kind of \\&quot;tight\\&quot; that is \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Within days my skin has already started to clear up!</li>
            <li>I think it is helping my skin stay clear, too!  </li>
            <li>I woke up to clear skin!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are clearly stated on the bottle and have nothing that I can&#x27;t pronounce, stop hating people!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also anxious to try the lavender version :)</li>
            <li>First time tried this one felt stinging on the face then retried again the same.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to like this stuff as much as I do, it&#x27;s definitely the first thing I reach for when my face needs a refresher.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>I look so young!</li>
            <li>Delicate for my sensitive skin and has a nice soft fragrance</li>
            <li>i found it in this all natural product!</li>
            <li>As long as the product does the job, it is worth using.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle).</li>
            <li>It works just the same as any other toner but feels smoother and better for your skin.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was taken back because I was used to the types of toner that would make my skin tingle.</li>
            <li>This doesnt smell like old lady!</li>
            <li>This is not a good replacement for the rose water toner issued to student of modeling schools.</li>
            <li>As a facial aftershave, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I buy this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>Like it much better than my usual toner I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I was using regular witch hazel from the drug store, and boy, does this smell soooo much nicer!</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also have a fine misting bottle that I mix half w/</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t like using creme or gel based moisturizers because my skin is a bit sensitive</li>
            <li>They are so soft!</li>
            <li>theres no alcohol in this so it has a different feeling from other toners - you do need to use more liquid to cover your face compared to alcohol based cleaners - but that is not a show stopper.</li>
            <li>I picked up a bottle in my local health food store and a mere week later was astonished and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It took me a year to get through the first bottle, and I&#x27;ve already repurchased the second.</li>
            <li>After I let her try it once, my 7-year old likes to steal into my bathroom and use it too!</li>
            <li>This toner stopped my breakouts completely!</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of use, my face is glowing and soft!</li>
            <li>I found this product when I finished my first standard Walgreens witch hazel.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m pretty amazed at how well it actually works.</li>
            <li>first time I used it I went outside to run errands with my son.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sure if I love it yet.</li>
            <li>UPDATE: found this exact item for almost 3$ cheaper will go to GNC next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On my first use it made my face tingle almost burning, and I was very red.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and feelings refreshed!</li>
            <li>I poured this witch hazel into a small, travel-size spray bottle to use it as a refreshing spray.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about this being an anti-aging product, but at 23 I figure it won&#x27;t hurt since you can never start too early!</li>
            <li>Definitely not Thayer&#x27;s, more likely some generic drug-store brand.</li>
            <li>just do not feel it is different or better than other things I use,</li>
            <li>Later my hands felt mildly hot and tingling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in the past and love.</li>
            <li>I originally bought it as an astringent for my face, but I ended up getting a severe sunburn around the same time and this product actually helped a lot with my sun burn.</li>
            <li>feel it&#x27;s very affordable given the quality of the product as well; especially as compared to the more harsh distilled drug store varieties which lack the benefits of this formulation.</li>
            <li>It might seem a little strong when you first put it on (especially if you&#x27;re using a lot!)</li>
            <li>I was a little taken aback by the strong smell</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s not really an issue, the bottle is quite large and a phenomenal price, I forsee it lasting quite a bit, but after that I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>the smell is an artificial rose smell, which may not be for everyone, but others have remarked that it has that clean soap smell instead.</li>
            <li>I appreciate the subtle, natural rose fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have had acne and super oily skin since I was in middle school, and while its not usually as harsh as it was then, these last few months I have been breaking out even more around my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out my already extremely dry skin and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing, softening, and gives you a serious glow that I can&#x27;t really explain.</li>
            <li>It moisterized my face instantly and calmed my skin after I clean my face with my battery operated facial brush.</li>
            <li>i use it as a facial toner on a daily basis and makes my face feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit much, I was expecting it to be more subtle -</li>
            <li>so use to the other alcohol type of toners which are stronger and leave your face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>Even without acne, it will improve your complection and clean and moisturize your skin without any harshness like other toners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but is very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on face especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to discern long term effects, but I can only imagine good things.</li>
            <li>I thought this product was nice enough to start with, but it caused massive breakouts which only cleared up when I went back to using my homemade witch hazel toner mix.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the rose actaully does anything other than create a scent, but next time, I will try another scent of the same product.</li>
            <li>I love using witch hazel as a toner or to just clean my face off when I feel like it needs it, but the rose scent of this stuff is horribly overpowering.</li>
            <li>I looked for a long time to find something that was alcohol free with aloe vera in it that I could use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>Prior to using this, my skin was pretty clear.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to Clinique as long as this product is still available.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past few months and my complexion has improved greatly.</li>
            <li>I use it every day after cleansing my skin and it dries in a minute and absolutely does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not pleasant to apply to the face because of the grandmother-y rose floral scent.</li>
            <li>I really like that this product is alcohol-free, and that it does not dry out your skin or irritate your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The basic premise is that they can help clean out those last lingering bits of dirt and oil after cleansing your face (some people going so far as to argue that it \\&quot;restores the pH balance of your skin\\</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this leaves it fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>True to life rose scent and no smell of witch hazel, which IMO stinks.  </li>
            <li>first may make the skin appear red and sticky, but it completely goes away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>this is the first &#x27;natural&#x27; toner that I have tried and I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using it on a sunburn you don&#x27;t want to peel, only take SHORT showers with cool water.</li>
            <li>The full chemical toners work much better unfortunately.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually the first toner I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s kept my skin soft, reduced the size of my pores, and kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>I have acne and oily skin, the scent for this product is way too strong, makes my skin very dry, I only used twice</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this toner helps me keep it clear without over drying.</li>
            <li>I have mature skin which is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I have mature skin which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively clean out the soap residue like other strong astringent toners I&#x27;ve used before, but it seems to perform just as well.</li>
            <li>not too strong, not too weak, just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily since I first purchased it, and hardly have any more breakouts these days.</li>
            <li>I have used other toners that make my skin scream for lotion afterwards but this one makes my face feel clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li>have been asking what am I doing differently because my skin is positively glowing.  </li>
            <li>I put it on as usual with a cotton ball and all of a sudden my face turned bright red and started to burn.</li>
            <li>My last bottle lasted me almost a year before I ordered my current bottle, and I use it pretty much every day</li>
            <li>This product is natural and FEELS natural!</li>
            <li>I have also used on legs and other areas to cool irritation and prevent ingrown hairs and it works well for that.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last very long anyway.</li>
            <li>but it is especially good in the winter when it&#x27;s cold and dry.</li>
            <li>I like this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Dickinson&#x27;s, which I can buy for less at local drugstores.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with some light acne marks, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and a half</li>
            <li>I recommend using a cotton ball (consisting of the product) and going over your face lightly after your regular face wash/cleanser, or even if your skin is feeling oily, dry...</li>
            <li>This witch hazel stops my skin from feeling tight after being washed, and make my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>This tonic is what I have been looking for rose is very hard to find .Very</li>
            <li>It made my skin very soft and actually changes the whole appearance of your skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type but without applying a lot of moisturizer after use, it would really dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>, my pores are a lot smaller and my favorite bit is that all my little blemishes/pimples have completely gone away!</li>
            <li>My skin is mostly normal (not very oily or dry), and it is very sensitive and clogs easily.</li>
            <li>I use three types of moisturizer at any given time, try a new shampoo every two weeks, and currently own at least 6 types of facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li>My face cooled down and stopped breaking out, but I started getting a fair amount of weird pimples and breakouts and ingrown hairs on my legs which very very very rarely</li>
            <li>/&gt;-To freshen up in general: When I have been particularly sweaty for whatever reason, I&#x27;ve put this on a tissue or and used it to freshen my face, underarms, cleavage, neckline, etc.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more even and clear, less acne especially around that time of the month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin,,, nough said!</li>
            <li>Just purchased at whole foods in Lexington Kentucky as I am a Flight attendant with eczema, severly sensitive dry skin and allergies.</li>
            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]], and finally I use Skingenixx Super Hydrating Moisturizer</li>
            <li>I use it daily after I wash my face with an organic purifying cleanser (no alcohol, no animal testing, pure fruit extracts).</li>
            <li>The large pores on my cheeks appear smaller as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would help with my large pores and oily skin, but It doesn&#x27;t have any real lasting effects that I can see.</li>
            <li>I have a problem where once I see my pores are smaller, I stop using it, and then see the large pores return</li>
            <li>(2) just get a cheap little travel bottle that squeezes (like $0.50 at REI)</li>
            <li>I also bought a little spray bottle on here - and have filled that too with this.</li>
            <li>With the help of cotton pads with those little scrubbers on one side, I&#x27;ve pretty much gotten rid of my blackheads that have plagued me since high school.</li>
            <li>The aloe vera in the solution keeps the skin from becoming too dry while the witch hazel helps dry up the weeping parts.</li>
            <li>The product DOES NOT have methylparaben and polysorbate 20 based on the picture of this product you click before it takes you to its page with an older picture and apparently ingredient list, and it is now completely natural and just uses vitamin E as a preservative.</li>
            <li>only nit picky little complaint is that a large sticker was placed on the product&#x27;s attractive vintage-style label,and when I tried to remove the sticker it tore away at the label.</li>
            <li>Took me a month to figure out why my skin started to break out more than it did and looked dull.</li>
            <li>Not acidic, so there is no typical sensation on the skin at all!</li>
            <li>Not for all skin types,  it smells good, but feels a little heavy</li>
            <li>I can see how some of the other reviewers might find the scent a bit strong, but I use a lot of essential oils now</li>
            <li>I have been searching for the right toner for a very long time, and this is it!</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t as gentle as I expected for my dry winter skin, I went with fresh floral toner instead!</li>
            <li>So far I love this Witch Hazel, its not like all the other that dry you out.  </li>
            <li>I had a huge rash from an allergic reaction the other day, then put this stuff all over it and, the next morning, my skin was very clear in comparison to the night before.  </li>
            <li>while this cleans my skin great and freshens me up when I&#x27;ve been all sweaty or dirty.</li>
            <li>It helped clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>Day 2 after I stopped using this product, my face was clear again.</li>
            <li>Leaves face smooth and makes a good base for applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I used recently and decided to let my 7 year old grandson try after feeling the gentle soothing product on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also tightens my pores and has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is a really  old old old stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the clear bottle Witch Hazel from Thayer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>My skin glows and is clear</li>
            <li>clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of toners and use them every night to clear away residue from the day before moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear (based on my diet as well) and not oily.</li>
            <li>This toner does not prevent or clear up acne; however it does tighten and hydrate skin after cleansing.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really clear and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>The water was clear and transparent at the beginning, but became unclear and milky after a while.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t clear up any of my skin issues.</li>
            <li>It clearly states that it is &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting this to help improve my skin, to clear it up and brighten it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve recently decided to switch to natural products to see what would happen since I really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>Working well as a toner to help clear my son&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li>Idk which one is helping making my face stay clear ...</li>
            <li>It has clearly been tampered with.</li>
            <li>It smells divine, makes my skin feel so soft, and I have noticed my skin is starting to look so much</li>
            <li>just so that&#x27;s clear.)</li>
            <li>I have never, ever had this clear of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t clear my acne</li>
            <li>Gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>As soon as I stopped using it, the pimples started to clear.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product only about 2 weeks ago and really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using it 1-2 times daily after cleansing and it is doing a great job picking up things my cleanser leaves behind!</li>
            <li>and I do believe continued use of this will clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning after applying it at night, my skin looks clear with tighter pores.</li>
            <li>It keeps it moist and clear.  </li>

            <li>Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>This toner doesn&#x27;t seem to help with breakouts but it soothes my skin and leaves it soft and moisturizerized after drying treatments.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars is that it is quite fragrant, which might be troublesome for those sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural with certified organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I have to use a toner after washing my face, I just don&#x27;t feel complete without the smoothing effect a toner provides.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, but now my complexion is really starting to even out.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it to prep my skin for waxing, and as a astringent-</li>

            <li>Leaves my skin feeling soft</li>

            <li>I have very oily skin especially in T-zone area</li>
            <li>and I like it so far,</li>
            <li>I am not a user of toner, but this popped up when I was researching for hydration for my skin that was natural and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about natural skin products.</li>
            <li>So far this has done the trick</li>
            <li>Its all natural</li>
            <li>I came across this product at a a natural health foods store in the area.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much of an astringent effect from this, likely because it is the hydrosol and the &amp;</li>

            <li>Desert Essence 100% Natural Jojoba Oil - use as moisturizer before bed</li>

            <li>She is 68yrs old.</li>
            <li>Or to just use straight as a facial toner.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients this never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li>I have highly sensitive combination-type skin</li>
            <li>and I am very picky about the products I use (especially on my face).</li>
            <li>Since nothing else in my skin care routine has changed yet I determined it to be Thayers, probably because of the natural oils and tannins.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I wash my face, morning and night, and it leaves my skin toned but soft.  </li>
            <li>I really feel like it adds some moisture back into my skin after cleansing, even before I add a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And it really does work, the amount of gunk left on my face after washing</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft but not oily.</li>
            <li>This product is cheap, but not cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Also, I have read about some of the natural healing qualities of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I thought it would be much gentler than regular witch hazel.  </li>
            <li>it seems in &amp;#34;my old age&amp;#34</li>
            <li>For reference I have oily/combination acne prone skin (also quite sensitive) and this toner works wonders without irritation.</li>
            <li>use this toner when I need a gentle product, such as post acid peel, post waxing or sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>since we both have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Fixed my skin</li>
            <li>The scent, while not horrendous, is probably not something that sensitive noses will want to put up with.</li>
            <li>I had been wanting to try this product, I was drawn to the all natural ingredients and lack of alcohol.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and sometimes have breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have pores on the larger side and using this twice a day has REALLY helped</li>
            <li>Natural and</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s natural and</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li>I think I developed a pimple using this because of its oily texture.</li>

            <li>Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Florida in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to perfumes and fragrances you might want to skip this product.</li>
            <li>Also, it does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>

            <li>and when I use it on a regular basis it really does help minimize redness.</li>
            <li>but I  do like this one so far too soon to tell ifi</li>
            <li>I like this stuff a lot because it&#x27;s such a gentle toner</li>
            <li>I recommend this to others with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>My pores have reduced in size and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of 70 year old cat lady&#x27;s house.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Very happily surprised with this.</li>
            <li>Bought it after reading reviews about a natural toner.  </li>
            <li>This toner preserves the natural moisture</li>
            <li>I like it so far.</li>
            <li>But, better late than never.</li>
            <li>my skin felt soft soon after i used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so soft and hydrated without it getting oily from lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li>My skin is ultra sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Well this arrived early yesterday</li>
            <li>Now all I have are scabs from where the old blemishes are healed.</li>
            <li>This stuff is old school and legit.</li>
            <li>my 22 year old granddaughter&#x27;s as well.</li>
            <li>/irritating if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but this does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I had used one originally to help apply it, and it turned my towels into a splotchy mess.</li>
            <li>old skin so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought two bottles of this so far.</li>
            <li>Made my skin ultra soft.  </li>
            <li>still really like the smell and and am using it up on my legs for extra moisture.  </li>
            <li>AND its natural.</li>
            <li>if this is what natural products will turn out to be.</li>
            <li>and my face is particularly sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times so far as a night routine after cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a purer form of witch hazel and has all the natural tannins.    </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>This does not irritate my sensitive skin, either, or cause</li>
            <li>It doesnt burn my sometimes sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so affordable and natural.</li>
            <li>Fastest shipping so far</li>
            <li>Changed my acne and rosacia face to soft, clear and supple.  </li>
            <li>but the natural ingredients were the selling point for me.</li>
            <li>My face skin is really sensitive so it may tend to make me break out.  </li>
            <li>I still had really clogged pores while using this daily.</li>
            <li>And you&#x27;re set for a few hours of protected and smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Will keep using it forever, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>and I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>In 5 days use my skin is tighter looks younger and is also getting much clearer.</li>
            <li>I have a very combination/oily skin type and this is the only product that I can use as needed without a fear of drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve had a brown spot that developed during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>but it feels so soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li>I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does.</li>
            <li>They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li>I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel for three days and it makes my skin really soft and even.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I really like this toner for my facial skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This is a staple and vital part of my skincare regimen.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin refuses to accept anything else.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this toner is an all natural product.  </li>
            <li>As far as improvements in my skin, I don&#x27;t see a lot of difference</li>
            <li>I will keep using it because I like having something natural to use underneath my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>In addition to making your skin feel refreshed, overtime the toner really does make your pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really working for me, only have to use soap maybe once a week.  </li>
            <li>I have uber sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had to wash my face twice in order to completely remove the product from my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting soft and moisture.</li>
            <li>fast shipping....will definitely be doing business again with you...</li>
            <li>Please do not use if you have sensitive, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft, moisturizing feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>kept my face wonderfully soft.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking it.  </li>
            <li>They all act as &amp;#34;safe for sensitive skin&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It helped to clear my face and does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I like this toner because it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 35 with pimples and wrinkles and combo uber sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Like the water so far.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s lightly moisturizing, but not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have combination skin (sensitive and acne prone).</li>
            <li>It  does what it claims and is soothing on mature skin.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed considerable pore shrinkage</li>
            <li>And it seems gentle enough for the under-eye area.</li>
            <li>My skin became really sensitive</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>All natural</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural, no alcohol or chemical perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It has everything you need to keep your skin soft and hydrated without harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshing but not in the least bit drying.</li>
            <li>I now only use this and Cetaphil cleanser, which really seems to contribute to the improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what.  </li>
            <li>My 15 year old son swears by this for his acne.</li>
            <li>but no problems so far.  </li>
            <li>It is non drying, all natural</li>
            <li>Not harsh at all, either.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling soft, moisturized, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Face feels soft after applying it, but the smell is that of a grandma style perfume.</li>
            <li>, I went back to Whole Foods and bought the alcohol-free, unscented toner.</li>
            <li>My face isn&#x27;t severely sensitive either,</li>
            <li>I feel my skin is ready for my next step on my regimen.</li>
            <li>A soft smell of rose...not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s is gentler and leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>but if you have sensitive skin, it will eventually happen to you.</li>
            <li>my face has never been clearer or so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a few days (as a toner) and already see fantastic results.</li>
            <li>purchased this product from Natural Grocers because they didn&#x27;t have Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel (the brand I used to use).  </li>
            <li>The product also showed a difference when my 56 year old mother used it</li>
            <li>This toner makes my skin soft without making it greasy, absorbs oil, and has dramatically improved the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>It does leave the skin feel soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My skin is also sensitive even with products that are labeled natural and don&#x27;t contain synthetic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I no longer have to carry oil absorbing sheets with me daily.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and even.</li>
            <li>Reason why I use this is because I have supper sensitive skin</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>but once they do, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of my skin lately, and decided to try a toner.</li>
            <li>No burning because it is alcohol free and does not leave a sticky feeling residue behind, only smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>It helps to reduce aging and offers a detox of the your skin every time you use it.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer this inexpensive alternative to the Proactive toner.</li>
            <li>It has no alcohol and has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin but saw the reviews for this toner.  </li>
            <li>AS FAR AS QUALITY IS COCERNED.  </li>
            <li>I am currently using the Thayers Cucumber toner (just to change up a bit) and i like the results on my skin but not so much the smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s literally 100% natural and they even use organic ingredients..</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I dont see a difference in my skin, but I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>And lo and behold, rashes developed again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next morning I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I am now 30 yrs old.</li>
            <li>I wanted to go natural, and amazon told me this was &amp;</li>
            <li>I am also vegan, so the fact that this is natural and doesn&#x27;t test on animals is an added plus.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this seemed to irritate it.</li>
            <li>My 24 year old daughter insisted I try this stuff.  </li>
            <li>No heavy residue.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because of its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order it again and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t sting my face at all, even in the sensitive blemished areas with acne.</li>
            <li>When I was young, one of my uncles always followed his shaves with Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>And WOW.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive and oily skin, so even if I put water on a cotton ball and rub it on my face, it will irritate me</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li>, Works well if used sparingly for sensitive adult acne</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft without drying it out.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft afterward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product now for nearly 3 months, and I fully attribute my clearer complexion to it.</li>
            <li>But, I can say it helps keep my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>I feel like it also helps my face feel completely cleansed after I wash my face, to prep for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>that it contains natural products like witch hazel.</li>
            <li>My face was SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells like roses, but roses kinda smell like old ladies to me.</li>
            <li>and I spray it directly onto my skin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft and has helped remove any excess dirt on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft</li>
            <li>As a busy mom I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face.</li>
            <li>Simple ingredients, gentle on skin and works well.</li>
            <li>Use it directly after showering.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive baby skin, and almost everything burns.  </li>
            <li>No harsh stinging or dryness.</li>
            <li>With such a big bottle, its worth the price</li>
            <li>After going through a bottle of an expensive name-brand toner much faster than I would have liked, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li>I am allergic to this , it may be a good product, but, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>It is as good as those expensive brand names, but the price is 1/10 of them.</li>
            <li>People are claiming this is good for sensitive skin, but be wary it might not work for everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is very dry in Phoenix right now</li>
            <li>After using the whole bottle, I switched to another brand that was half the price, but it really made my face feel tight and dry and didn&#x27;t smell as nice.  </li>
            <li>I ALWAYS follow up my shave routine by rubbing this over my neck and face to cool down my skin and close the pores while cleaning out any gunk and residue I might have missed.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s a natural product doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li>And it is a third of the price, more natural, and bigger than any other supposed &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I hate to go against what so many other reviewers have experienced (</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simple ingredients doesn&#x27;t mean you need more.</li>
            <li>Better than the other expensive store brands for me:))</li>
            <li>I packed a full new bottle in my luggage on the plane and when I got off, half the solution was gone!</li>
            <li>I needed something to clean my face with in the late afternoons when my face doesn&#x27;t feel so fresh without having to actually wash it.  </li>
            <li>The tingle, however, tends to dry a lot of people&#x27;s skin out and that was exactly what was happening with mine.</li>
            <li>Its much cheaper here than at Whole Foods and all the other health food stores</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li>This is the final clean up of the deeply ground dirt and impurities, that even my facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li>a subtle rose instead of a fake perfume rose.  </li>
            <li>Well, turns out that is true because I have noticed less oil on my face.  </li>
            <li>I cracked open the new bottle I just ordered, and I&#x27;m positive they have changed the formula since I last purchased.</li>
            <li>I use it on my face, neck and in the little crevices of my ear to get everything squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone and I had a few really tiny, expected breakouts for the first few days, but they went away quickly and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li>To make application easier, I clean out an old moisturizer jar and put a stack of round gauze pads inside.</li>
            <li>I tend to breakout or have a lot of redness after shaving mainly because I have sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li>It used to be dry, red, irritated and super peely.</li>
            <li>But I was so happy to be proven wrong!</li>
            <li>Facial masks usually leave some sort of residue, so it is great to remove the traces without being harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>However, when you feel the difference on your skin, you will realize exactly what I did---that it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra dollars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used witch hazel for years instead of more expensive toners as I find it as effective, if not more so.</li>
            <li>Final thoughts are I have sensitive combination skin prone to rosacea and blackheads, and I wish I had known about this product, well, in high school.</li>
            <li>Less waste going on a cotton ball and more for my face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a 22 year old single mother of many pets, and a little accident prone.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry, sensitive skin (not helped by Colorado&#x27;s year-round low humidity), so I&#x27;ve always been a bit gun-shy of toners, because they&#x27;re usually full of alcohol and other stuff</li>
            <li>This is an amazing toner to say the least, I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find it.</li>
            <li>My skin is absolutely glowing, it has never been this soft or supple for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li>I love it, seriously.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt clean, firm and a bit dewey.</li>
            <li>And then, this year I came to the USA, and the first product I purchased for facial daily care is THAYER.</li>
            <li>Even after I stopped using the product, it took a while for my face to clear back up to normal.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and have had it for the past five months and FINALLY have to repurchase!</li>
            <li>Trial and error - guess I&#x27;m going back to my regular witch hazel (don&#x27;t fix what&#x27;s not broken!)</li>
            <li>I recommend starting out with using it only at night for the first week</li>
            <li>made me breakout even more, not sure if this is what happens at the beginning before actually improving but will not use again!</li>
            <li>I used to purchase the Burt&#x27;s Bees rosewater toner, but it is becoming harder and harder to find in stores, so I switched to this after reading Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it like a month but noticed the different the first week.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells pretty gross; it reminds me of rubbing alcohol mixed with some perfume to cover the smell (bearing in mind that it contains no alcohol).</li>
            <li>So be careful to read reviews about skin products when buying from amazon because it seems to be a pretty frequent mistake on their part.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it because it&#x27;ll last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very subtle rose scent is uplifting.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin with combination of oily and dry on certain areas on my face.</li>
            <li>I will never use another toner as long as I live!!</li>
            <li>For comparison, there are a lot of eye creams I cannot near my eyes without burning, stinging and/or swelling.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective: Allows a further cleansing of the skin, leaving it refreshed and comfortable, as opposed to stripped and tight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product and will be back for me!</li>
            <li>do not work for this company &amp; I have never given such high praise for anything I bought as Amazon.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t recommend high enough!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe this little clear liquid that didn&#x27;t sting or burn at all had somehow left my skin this smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like no other toner I&#x27;ve ever used before!</li>
            <li>My skin has made a complete turnaround from being patchy and oily at the same time with random breakouts to being smooth, clean, and soft.</li>
            <li>So I ordered the cucumber toner a few days ago (even less harmful than rose one by the database website).</li>
            <li>Very large bottle, too, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>It is very fragrant, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long on my skin.</li>
            <li>I am very sad this product didn&#x27;t work out for my skin type because I read all these great reviews.</li>
            <li>Just use a light hand, apply with a cotton ball or round and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li>It is more like a fresh natural flower smell rather than an artificial odor</li>
            <li>It is a good product, It personally did not strike me as amazing or horrible.</li>
            <li>if it takes some pink away, it definitely doesnt make it more pink which some stronger toners do.</li>
            <li>A bottle really lasts me a long time too</li>
            <li>I observed no negative reactions and it&#x27;s quite affordable as a toner for only $10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this was a completely different product as to a normal toner with alcohol.</li>
            <li>; I&#x27;ve bought in the past has been mostly rubbing alcohol (incredibly harsh and drying) but this is the real thing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different facial products - scrubs, masks, different face washes, astringents, toners, and so on - and none of that other stuff helped with the bumps.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, the next morning my face was normal</li>
            <li>I normally use a regular witch hazel as an astringent</li>
            <li>i was so excited when my package arrived but the toner was not clear like i expected it to be.</li>
            <li>This toner is a lifesaver and has brought my skin back to its normal glow.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell and really gets anything that&#x27;s left behind after I wash my face.</li>
            <li>It is mild and removes makeup your cleanser did not totally clean.  </li>
            <li>This morning I only had to put a small amount of BB cream and a very light amount of powder on my face (I am considering looking into home-making natural makeup as my next project).</li>
            <li>and I have to say that this is certainly helping it not be so dry.</li>
            <li>Also, \\&quot;The compound bergamottin is found in grapefruit, and when it interacts with certain enzyme systems in the body, it can prevent these enzymes from breaking down statins, which causes the drug to accumulate in high levels in the body.</li>
            <li>seems to calm it down.</li>
            <li>I use this product to calm my skin down when I&#x27;ve had a reaction to something</li>
            <li>and this seems to calm all that down.</li>
            <li>I notice it helps calm my skin down after I had been using Retin-A</li>
            <li>It has taken me years to figure out what is best for my skin, and for about a year I have been cleansing my skin with African black soap and then using a benzoyl peroxide acne treatment every morning and night, and still, I would have an average of 3-5 pimples every day, mostly small, but sometimes big.</li>
            <li>: the bottle is quite large, so what I do is pour some of this product into a smaller container for daily use, and keep the remainder refrigerated.</li>
            <li>Then, I started using it again and right away the big red rash came back.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most things usually irritate it and either make it dry out, burn, or itch, and this product causes none of that whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews on other sites with people stating the same problem - the fragrance was breaking them out because their skin was/is sensitive to most</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I was looking for an alcohol free toner to use on my acne prone skin which is often dry and irritated due to retin-a micro.  </li>
            <li>This product takes traditional witch hazel to a new level.  </li>
            <li>soothing; definite new medicine cabinet staple</li>
            <li>I get it from amazon only because I live in Alaska now and can&#x27;t find it in my town.</li>
            <li>Yes, your skin will feel tight without oil for the first few minutes, but the moisturizer is really important.</li>
            <li>It lasts for ages and it&#x27;s free from all those nasty chemicals and is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference in my skin yet, it&#x27;s only bee a few days since I started using it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much either.</li>
            <li>At least get the easy off stickers</li>
            <li>I did notice that the scent of this particular bottle was much stronger than of those I had previously used.</li>
            <li>~the toner is very moist for the dry skin.</li>
            <li>My nose gets really oily yet my cheeks get really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I also use after shower, as a moisturizer, keeps my skin very moist and helps with dry skin ( use before lotion or oil).</li>
            <li>What really suprised me was that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I have older skin which is fairly dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li>it is much milder than another brand have found that using it daily both prior to putting on my make up and again after to set it.  </li>
            <li>, two months later I still occasionally have a zit or two, but my complexion is much clearer and my acne scars seem to be fading somewhat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through the gauntlet of facial creams, washes, and pills-- including Acutane which left my face chronically dry in some spots and super oily in others.</li>
            <li>I sometimes just use the witch hazel to give me that fresh feel after running around for half the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through bottles and bottles of this - it always leaves my skin feeling fresh and a slightly hydrated before I continue with the rest of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>The only issue that I have (which really isn&#x27;t an issue) is that if you are traveling, I would suggest moving the product to a different container because it will leak.</li>
            <li>I noticed some complained about the scent being too strong.  </li>
            <li>have really good skin (only because I&#x27;m obsessed with taking care of</li>
            <li>I quickly realized what I&#x27;d been missing.</li>
            <li>I normally hate anything scented, but the fragrance is nice and light.</li>
            <li>I much prefer this as a toner than more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking at a lot of Makeup Tutorials &amp; Beauty Trends on YouTube, &amp; one YouTuber mentioned that she has very sensitive skin (I do also) &amp; has to use a specific type of Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li>The alcohol-based toners make my face even more oily after initially making it tight and dry.  </li>
            <li>Used it only once so far, but it smells divine!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve started using this in 2014, I&#x27;ve seen a major reduction in pore size, skin elasticity, and youth.</li>
            <li>I have not heard any complaints or comments, so apparently it works!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter to use in her facial cleansing routine and WOW!</li>
            <li>This product is familiar to me as my mother and grandmother and great-grandmother used it in the past.</li>
            <li>I have noticed such a difference in my sensitive skin since using this!</li>
            <li>I have only tried this product for my daughter&#x27;s acne last night, but the fact that she allowed me to apply it to her face AGAIN the following night is promising!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using plain rose water for a few years but decided to try this one when I read about the decrease in pore size.</li>
            <li>My skin feels fresh and tight.</li>
            <li>Makes my face really calm...not dry at all!</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling clean and toned without that dry cracking feeling you sometimes get with other products.  </li>
            <li>I recently completely revamped my skincare routine and this along with the other products I purchased has really made a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mean to diss all you fabulous 60+ ladies, but this does have that typical smell that one would describe &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; mainly because it smells SO much like roses.</li>
            <li>A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several other toners such as Weleda, &amp; Michael Todd True Organics.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic change or anything, but it&#x27;s so far one of my favorite toner.</li>
            <li>I took one star off because I find it leaves a mild film and slight shine on my skin, but since I use it at night it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li>Even as I&#x27;m getting older my skin still breaks out sometimes and regular facial moisturizers clog my pores.</li>
            <li>nothing artificial or super strong).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin, so I try to use products that have natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was a little unsure if I should try the rose scented witch Hazel over my usual aloe</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to my friends and family and therefore I highly recommend to anyone currently using regular witch hazel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a product that would take away my greasy italian shine and</li>
            <li>I previously had light acne around my hairline due to my bangs, and it has cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li>This is a really large container of toner that seems like it is going to last a really long time!</li>
            <li>It was twice as expensive but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and see a difference in my skin tone and general skin health.</li>
            <li>and my complexion is generally clearer.</li>
            <li>Month Later: I have lowered my use to once a day, at night, to clear away any excess dirt or makeup that was overlooked by the makeup remover + face wash.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell really</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it really helps fight acne which I have a bit of</li>
            <li>I have to use about 6 cotton balls until they come back clear.</li>
            <li>One of these bottles lasts me at least 2-3 months, so the price is actually pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took over 2 months to clear the rashes, and even after my skin was healed the blemishes and tiny blotches still remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does the job of witch hazel but actually soothes my skin and leaves my skin soft and feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>it may not suit Asian sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Also the bottle is pretty big for a toner so it will last for a long time</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and try to stay as natural as I can with facial products.</li>
            <li>My sensitive skin often stings after a regular toner</li>
            <li>As a 63 year old male I started to see the wrinkles develop.</li>
            <li>My older skin isn&#x27;t dry, but it doesn&#x27;t need anything that will make it that way.</li>
            <li>I have seen a big difference with how soft my skin feels and how my acne is clearing up.</li>
            <li>Although so far I don&#x27;t see my skin has any different.</li>
            <li>It has natural moisturizers instead of 100 different chemicals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I expected and works really well at removing excess dirt and makeup that my face wash misses.</li>
            <li>Since I was 14&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of Clinique&#x27;s toner for combination/oily skin, which seems to do all the things I want, but the alcohol strips my skin of its natural oils and can make my face red and blotchy.</li>
            <li>So I drew short straws in the skin department and have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>I am a big skeptic - but this stuff won me over, completely.</li>
            <li>It is thorough enough to tone, but offers moisture to the beard .</li>
            <li>I like the old fashion look with the label you can read through the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li>All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]</li>
            <li>This toner has left my skin so soft and moist, all while controlling my acne.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I&#x27;m a white man in my early 30&#x27;s, for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apparently have an allergy to witch hazel, so I gave this to my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li>Caucasian, sensitive skin, occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a toner to pamper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Finally found an all natural product that cleans, moisturizers, and shrinks pores without making my face shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li>especially for sensitive skill</li>
            <li>The facial lady also told me it&#x27;s sensitive,</li>
            <li>So far I have only used this 3 times, and I like it.  </li>
            <li>Busy with my second bottle and cannot think of a reason to switch to another product.</li>
            <li>My main concern was that it would dry or crack my skin</li>
            <li>I mainly use this product after I wake up in the morning because it&#x27;s keep my skin from being overly dry.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin extra soft.</li>
            <li>Big wow for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can barely see it now.</li>
            <li>Natural Hawaiian Facial Cleanser Pineapple Enzyme&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use this (natural) over those acne toners that have alcohol and different chemicals.</li>
            <li>Dab the cotton balls until they&#x27;re wet and rub gently on your face.</li>
            <li>This is natural, has vitamin E, and moisturizes my skin enough to not have to use a lotion/cream type moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This was unusual for me as I&#x27;d never really had issues with my skin.</li>
            <li>So if your sensitive to smell i would actually recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin but can use this daily without drying.</li>
            <li>you will no regrets with it at all.</li>
            <li>Its barely been a month</li>
            <li>I used this in combination and woke up the next morning with baby soft skin that lasted through the day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 30 years old and up until recently struggled with hormonal cystic acne.</li>
            <li>fast and arrived as expected</li>
            <li>Removed the seal on the cap,the inner seal as well, then twist the cap back the normal way.</li>
            <li>I usually use Biore and liked it but felt like it dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of this toner &amp; find that with my oily skin it doesn&#x27;t make it worse (or really better).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always avoided toners because most have alcohol - something that makes my skin worse, but that didn&#x27;t keep me from searching for one.</li>
            <li>Also, the rose scent is not overpowering and usually disappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just addicted to this and how it makes my skin feel, and I know I will have to buy more when I run out,</li>
            <li>Fake rose smell</li>
            <li>I got the shipment in time - however the top cap was broken.</li>
            <li>but I am sure there are worse things to smell like.  </li>
            <li>It really smoothes out my skin, gets rid of blemishes, nourishes my skin, and it smells lovely, not like most nasty alcohol-based toners.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t made my oily areas better, but it hasn&#x27;t made them worse</li>
            <li>This smell is not like fake rose smell which lots of stuff have.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice though and doesn&#x27;t have any unnatural, weird ingredients...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to those who want to use a toner, but don&#x27;t want their skin stripped dry.</li>
            <li>I ran out of it within 20 days due to my large amount of usage every day.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling a little tight, not my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am a 34 y/o African American with blemish and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>bought this toner at Whole Foods just because it was the most pleasant-sounding witch hazel product at Whole Foods, and I felt like splurging given my breakouts, and I was tired of using rubbing alcohol on my face throughout finals that has most likely been a bad decision for my skin and wanted something else.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 4 days and my skin is almost back to being fully clear!</li>
            <li>It seems to keep my face from getting dry like it normally gets.</li>
            <li>When I use it regularly I notice my skin looking smoother and my giant pores looking more subtle.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m um... &amp;#34;middle aged&amp;#34; and my skins tends to be normal to dry).</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my skin felt a bit odd afterwards -</li>
            <li>Frist, I have normal to dry skin tone.</li>
            <li>However, since moving to the Pacific Northwest, my skin has been dry and flaky, unresponsive to my normal regimen.</li>
            <li>Has worked better than any other toner in the past.</li>
            <li>I use as a quick face wash that I keep on my nightstand for lazy nights.</li>
            <li>I followed quickly with my usual moisturizer and voila.</li>
            <li>I do still experience breakouts using this toner, but I usually have to follow with a mild acne cream regardless of what toner I use.  </li>
            <li>I am too lazy to wash my face so this is a quick way to get it done.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very faint but pleasant.</li>
            <li>I could easily go without  any other product after this,because this one gives me a little bit of moisture.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it a few days, but this paired with a chemical-free soap by Out Of Africa (began using both at the same time) has really cleared up my skin...and even helped with diminishing blackheads on my nose and chin that I have never had much luck with getting out.</li>
            <li>not that squeaky, shiny clean astringent normally leaves behind.</li>
            <li>is a decent size of bottle, it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff, makes me skin feel really soft and helps to diminish the little acne bumps on my forehead.</li>
            <li>I do think it is a little expensive, but I am happy with  my purchase.  </li>
            <li>It also copes very well with other types of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see as much improvement as other people did in their skin, but I was using a million products.</li>
            <li>This really seemed to do something because it doesn&#x27;t stink and have that salty, briny smell that other witch hazels have.</li>
            <li>I also like peppermint, non-sticky hand sanitizer spray in general but that is only minimally related to keeping your face clear by keeping your hands clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have using this for a few days now, and I think I already see a little difference, my skin feels softer and has a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much of it other than a mild irritation that the paper portion of the label was wet and ruined.</li>
            <li>Not a single breakout</li>
            <li>My kids even live using it, esp during winter months when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommendations: For anyone looking for a general toner that covers all your bases, I would recommend this one due to its low costs and large quantity.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not very expensive compared to other products.</li>
            <li>I am a young adult in my early 20&#x27;s and started looking for something that was not going to strip my face dry like rubbing alcohol because my face is started to get dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this toner sometimes irritated my skin and left red splotches on my face.</li>
            <li>(only been about 2 weeks now) to see if my overall redness goes away completely.</li>
            <li>I was using Apple Cider Vinegar to reduce my acne scars and help get rid of my cystic acne,  but once I bought this toner, my face not only brightened, but so far, no extra cystic acne!  </li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin like alcohol-based toners.</li>
            <li>(I can see the makeup and dirt on my cotton pad) and my skin does feel tighter and refreshed, but not dry.</li>
            <li>but I personally like the faint rose smell of this product</li>
            <li>It does not dry up my skin.</li>
            <li>It does not contain alcohol, and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>This will not dry your skin and leaves it feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li>this toner does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>My face is not dry.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin, or sting at all.  </li>
            <li>not dry the skin at all.</li>
            <li>This toner will not dry out your face like the Tea Tree toner.</li>
            <li>I usually hate having to use products, but I really enjoy this toner, and I love using it.</li>
            <li>Also, it keeps my face nice and soft during this cold winter times in NY.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and it does remove left behind dirt well.</li>
            <li>have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, not dry, oily or combination</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It helps my pores shrink and my face dose not dry out.</li>
            <li>and it does not dry it.</li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still confused as to what a toner is actually used for, but I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It does not dry the skin out and helps your skin to feel refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li>It did not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my face with the hopes that it would help with the glow effect so face would not appear dull; however I used it for my face after washing and didn&#x27;t notice any type of glow or anything special.</li>
            <li>However, Burt&#x27;s bee toner made my skin a little irritated if i used it right after facial exfoliation or waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helped calm down large breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t make existing acne worse at all.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to this tonic permanently as my toner because my skin is very sensitive and dry during winter months.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use toner&#x27;s which contains alcohol as it dries up my skin resulting in dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>It tightens my pores right up and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like any other toner would.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell a little funny; my boyfriend says I smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it caused me a little breakout.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who tries it.</li>
            <li>it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion, helps with large pores, treats acne, and helps with various other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li>My face feels clean and refreshed with absolutely no drying or tight feeling after.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say other than the fact that it&#x27;s the same price as more expensive products available at the mall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried countless other products (Proactiv, Murad, Neutrogena, and Clean and Clear just to name a few) with no luck.</li>
            <li>But after a few days I noticed that my face was more oily than usual and within 5 days of using this product, I had a major breakout that I could not control.</li>
            <li>Whenever I&#x27;ve had a breakout, it has helped reduce the size and redness of blemishes overnight, and made them feel less hot and irritated instantly.  </li>
            <li>If my skin feels oily during the day I will quickly wipe over my face with this and have instant oil slick relief.</li>
            <li>I have naturally very dry skin, live in New England, and have forced hot air for heat</li>
            <li>Make sure you keep the cap closed however because fruit flies will randomly appear out of nowhere and gravitate towards this bottle haha.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work really well, but it also doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, like other toners I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has also helped immensely with acne, seeing as I haven&#x27;t really gotten any other than one or two zits every now and then</li>
            <li>Some areas (specifically my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone), are very oily and acne prone, while other patches of my skin are extra dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I remember it being prime not long ago.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin sooo soft and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Finally I fell back on the old standard, witch hazel</li>
            <li>I tried going back to regular witch hazel just to save a few bucks, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this... Tried it for a few days and it doesn&#x27;t have the tightening and toning effect I expected.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know exactly when the trouble started, but after having the product maybe a couple of months, I began noticing that it was giving me a rash.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra few bucks than regular witch hazel.</li>
            <li>yet this has no ill affects on my at all, it&#x27;s not drying or harsh.</li>
            <li>Just beware the first few days if you skin&#x27;s on the temperamental side.</li>
            <li>I figured putting it on a cotton ball first is a waste of both cotton and solution.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already reordered this a few times since I first tried it months ago</li>
            <li>Well, in the expensive all organic deli near my house, I found this brand as the only one that wasn&#x27;t full of alcohol and paraben, but it was so expensive I couldn&#x27;t bear to buy it even though I read online that it was a good one.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry area, so I stopped washing my face in the morning</li>
            <li>I immediately grabbed my other bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner that I spent barely $4 on at the local Target store and sure enough, there is a slight alcohol</li>
            <li>Not to drying and when used after makeup removal it really gets down in your pores to get the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li>My skin is very dry during the winter time, but this toner is very soft and moisture.  </li>
            <li>Just washing your face &amp; going straight to the serum is a major waste of serum.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought this product due to its 12 oz size since it lasts a while.</li>
            <li>Other than that it seems to be a decent product.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t sting at all, in fact it&#x27;s kinda hard to believe that it&#x27;s a toner, but I&amp;#34;m trying it for the first time and so far it hasn&#x27;t irrated my skin or increased my break outs.. which is a</li>
            <li>I have now divorced Lancome, Clinique and every other high priced skin toner.  </li>
            <li>Unlike toners I have tried in the past that dry out my skin, this one leaves it clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use this toner any day over the acne toners that dry my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It is slightly cheaper on Amazon than Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>My mom uses it on her mature, dry skin and likes it as well.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li>This natural toner is alcohol-free so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry skin and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using this, my skin has gotten a lot less dry/red - would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I previously used witch hazel but the smell became too much</li>
            <li>This product has made my skin so soft, I no longe have dry patches.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that has a tendency to be quite dry and</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and after cleansing my face with a cream cleanser by purity I used a cotton ball to remove any traces of makeup and my skin didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; or dry after use.  </li>
            <li>I then allow it to dry completely.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out my skin will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>A few days later, I decided to give it another chance thinking the first time I may have been a chemical reaction with my foundation/moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this witch hazel because it does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li>and I am glad this might have saved me from a few small scars.</li>
            <li>Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap - use to wash face twice daily</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle that does the job almost as well as my super expensive brands.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a hot mess!</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a huge difference in my skin, perhaps a little less breaking out, but I cannot say that it&#x27;s from using this item.</li>
            <li>I sound like a bad commercial, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>The top spout is small enough to let out trickles, so you don&#x27;t waste toner by oversoaking.  </li>
            <li>After washing my face with either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castile Soap or Dr. Woods Black Soap, I take a cotton pad, liberally squirt on the Thayers Witch Hazel, rub the cotton against the solid sea salt bar and use it as a facial toner and as a toner to eliminate razor bumps after shaving.  </li>
            <li>are the reason I have clear skin (I&#x27;ve been struggling with slight adult acne).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as drying as my previous witch hazel that had alcohol in it and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>IF YOU ARE A BIT SENSITIVE TO SCENTS, BE WARY THAT IT MAY BE STRONG TO YOU.</li>
            <li>Soothing and gentle, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using it either.</li>
            <li>Worth ten times more than other expensive brands !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what other fragrances are available.  </li>
            <li>I ended up breaking out after three days of use which is not normal for me as an adult or even in my younger years.</li>
            <li>I bought this particularly for the dark circles I have around my eyes.</li>
            <li>The problem is it was delivered in a plastic bag inside a box, which would have been fine except the lid was broken &amp; lost some of the product inside plastic bag.</li>
            <li>It smells like roses too which is an added bonus for your pretty little face!</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I am late 20s and have combination oily skin and have typically only used Clinique products (or other high end skin care lines i.e. Origins, FRESH,</li>
            <li>I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it makes a real change in my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs or other side effects.</li>
            <li>This product causes little to no irritation and I feel is really helping my skin while reducing breakouts.</li>
            <li>It smells a little bit too much for me</li>
            <li>I ran out of my other toner and was looking for a new one</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have dry skin but found that witch hazel would dry my skin out and it would take a couple of days for my skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li>final advice is, sensitive skin, oily skin, dry skin, what have you, try it!</li>
            <li>He had a small bit of sun exposure around neck and on face, very gentle.</li>
            <li>After &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; my face I put a little on a cotton ball and gently go over my entire face.</li>
            <li>After i had severe troubles due to new cosmetic, i had to stop make up and should put only toners.</li>
            <li>I have always been very hesitant to apply toner after cleansing, due to my extremely dry patch around my mouth/chin area.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised on how it made my skin feel and it seem to make the acne and other imperfections disappear.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn’t good or bad.</li>
            <li>and of course watching tons of videos of people who have good and bad experiences with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is going to sound stupid, but the graphics on the bottle were the primary attraction.  </li>
            <li>What it doesn&#x27;t have in common with the MA brand is alcohol, which is a very drying ingredient, both for the face and natural hair brushes.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve heard that rose petal and witch hazel is good for acne and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> it is so good that I bought my sisters some and told them if they run out,  that they have to get the one with the rose petals because it is something magical,  lol....</li>
            <li> This is a nice product , good toner and cleaner for face and neck.</li>
            <li> Rose and cucumber are both good.</li>
            <li> Rose is really, really good for skin, and the aloe helps with moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It is what is says it is which is a alcohol-free (good because non drying), rose petal witch hazel with aloe vera toner.  </li>
            <li> but I know rose water is good for skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good things about rose water for your skin</li>
            <li> I refridgerate the bottle because I LOVEEEE the feeling of that cooling sensation on my face after I gave it a good cleaning with warm water.</li>
            <li> but the Rose petal smells soooo good..</li>
            <li> And I have read that rose water helps heal scars faster, so that&#x27;s good to help with any acne</li>
            <li> It has the rose flavor and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant and mild scented toner, and I think it works well on my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Love this, works great, and smells even better!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE!!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is alcohol free!!!</li>

            <li> It smells wonderful and is a wonderful toner with absolutely no drying of my skin.</li>
            <li> The hint of rose water in this makes a great toner even better.  </li>
            <li> (the scent is really nice) and great to use at night after you wash your face to make sure you get all the makeup off.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used a&lt;br /&gt;whole bottle of witch hazel and liked it.</li>
            <li> So I was kind of expecting that to happen, and it did.</li>
            <li> The rose petal smell lifts me up every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Nice and refeshing, I like the smell of it, and i like</li>
            <li> but I read so many great reviews on this product I decided to give it a try as I am trying to go more \\&quot;green\\&quot; in every aspect of my life - skin care included.  </li>
            <li> This is sth must be own from all girlllssss.</li>
            <li> Let me give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> However, the smell does not irritate my skin and I quite like the smell of rose.</li>
            <li> and i even have a nice glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the way this product makes the skin on my face feel.</li>
            <li> I ordered Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel after reading an article about how it can help with itch and irritation from poison oak.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this witch hazel</li>
            <li> I heard about Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal WithHazel.</li>
            <li> Feels really refreshing and smells good.</li>
            <li> I used ACV as a toner before and even though it was good for my skin, my husband wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell :).</li>
            <li> With this Rose Petal Witch Hazel, he grabs a bottle and uses it on his skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Moisturizing, reliable, and somewhat effective.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the rose scent when I use it.</li>
            <li> You can apply it after shaving, waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a great toner with a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li> but I went and returned the Rose Petal.</li>
            <li> but I must be allergic to the rose oil or something.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The rose water masks the smell of apple cider vinegar and it seems to be improving my skin.</li>
            <li> This has been an absolutely excellent product and has really been instrumental in helping my son&#x27;s eczema begin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Let me know if you do test and get any kind of reaction</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice alone</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to add anymore steps to the process but did want to incorporate rose.</li>
            <li> The witchhazel is not as stingy as alcohol and softened my skin nicely after using a drier kind of shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I recently read a blog that talked about how great witch hazel is for your skin... and I am so happy that I bought it!</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It feels so nice when you apply it on your face</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% natrual (can&#x27;t smell anything if it doesn&#x27;t put any addition inside, it should be nothing, literally not even rose smell.)</li>
            <li> Nice soothing scent.</li>
            <li> A really nice toner product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my responsibility to report honestly and</li>
            <li> told one of my girlfriends that I got the rose petal one,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> this Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel gave me</li>
            <li> Wonderful gentle on the skin I used with my daughter.</li>

            <li> It smells lovely and provides good nourishment for our skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> I read where it said Rose oil  are Rose Petal was extant for your face and wrinkles.</li>

            <li> product has rose water and aloe which makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients it contains are: undistiled witch hazel, aloe vera, and rose water.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice on the skin, not drying.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li> Thayers rose</li>
            <li> Nice toner.</li>
            <li> This does work as a nice toner for the face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell</li>
            <li> I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a nice moment to cherish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is twice as much in the stores, best to buy it here.</li>
            <li> Get a face steamer to pair with this and your pores will tighten up nicely.</li>
            <li> Rose petal water, witch hazel, aloe Vera juice, and vit e all in one product?</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is the absolute best to tone and soothe redness in the skin.</li>
            <li> Soothing and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice glow and tightens pores.</li>
            <li> She used to make rose water all the time.</li>
            <li> and I heard that witch hazel and rose water can help reverse those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> glad it works for others, but I&#x27;ll continue my search for a good toner if I find I need it</li>
            <li> I will not buy this product again although I will keep the bottle and refill with another kind of witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Nice rose smell.</li>
            <li> aloe &amp; rose petal makes it gentler than witch hazel without.</li>
            <li> This rose</li>
            <li> I decided to take a chance since it has rose water in it</li>
            <li> and I have maintained a nice complexion.</li>
            <li> Nice smell.</li>
            <li> this is really nice.  </li>
            <li> Its nice when you don&#x27;t want an astringent/toner that feels like it is burning your face off.</li>
            <li> The toner does not remove any dirt whatsoever and presumably opens up your pores and then clogs them with the help of rose oil.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this toner has been the best for it.</li>
            <li> It smelts like rose.</li>
            <li> smells nice and cleans well.</li>
            <li> and Rose water are supposed to be beneficial to skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is effective at removing dirt from the day.  </li>
            <li> i ordered this from amazon because i have read so many good things about this toner.</li>
            <li> Great price a Red Heads best friend</li>
            <li> Some were somewhat effective, others none at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you amazon for selling this product so cheap,that someone like me can own 1.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just rose petal witch hazel.</li>

            <li> As a face astringent, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I would have liked, but I give it four stars for helping with my sun burn.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreen, any kind of alcohol, I can&#x27;t handle benzoyl peroxide...</li>

            <li> This has the perfect amount in it (must be the aloe) to make my skin soft without having to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the best Witch Hazel product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toner, absorbs fast and the rose flavor smells good once you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and it smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Works beautifully on my skin as a toner (and in the armpits after shaving ;-).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an alcohol-free witch hazel.</li>
            <li> and I love the way the Rose Petal smells.</li>
            <li> It smells good and being alcohol-free is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> but mostly I just like the rose smell.</li>
            <li> I love Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dogs&#x27; &#x27;hot spots,&#x27; and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> but my sister is an esthestitian &amp; uses a rose water product that costs A LOT more.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this much more cost effective product a try.  </li>
            <li> Loving this toner even more every time I use it..</li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s a lovely rose scent</li>
            <li> This is a nice, refreshing witch hazel that has a lovely rose petal smell.</li>
            <li> but I love this, and the rose smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li> For me, I am even able to use it rather close to my eyes, and it does not burn, but instead feels quite nice.</li>
            <li> and I love the rose scent..</li>
            <li> I think it helps but to be honest I just keep using it because I love the way it smells</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and that with the natural ingredients are what set it apart.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best witch hazel I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> but it sure is a nice product to use.  </li>
            <li> I love the rose scent in this product.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for all the blends I have made so far, will order again.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the rose petal smell.</li>
            <li> It is AWESOME that it is completely natural and there is no alcohol</li>
            <li> so a good toner plays an important role in my break outs.</li>
            <li> Lovely rose smell</li>
            <li> This is a perfect toner if you do not want to strip your skin and use a natural product (and who doesn&#x27;t?).</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and is an effective witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I felt in the beginning, it now feels nice and refreshing on my skin.</li>

            <li> Rose petal fragrance is lovely</li>
            <li> This is, by far the best product for finicky, combo skin.</li>
            <li> I love rose water</li>
            <li> Gets it clean without drying it out and has a pleasant smell ..</li>
            <li> The rose petal addition is lovely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite would have to be Rose Petal Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> (comes in unscented and lavender-scented as well, but the rose is my favorite).</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and is a lovely toner without burning or stinging.  </li>

            <li> I am always impressed with how much grime I seem to clean off my skin even after I&#x27;ve just washed my face.</li>
            <li> Super embarrassing!!</li>
            <li> The toner is very light, non-greasy, and smelled like roses.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very gentle on face, no alcohol and soothing aloe vera, great combination.</li>

            <li> I love the soft feel of it against my skin, and the smell is very pleasant as well.</li>
            <li> Oh My Gossshh, ive been had this product for more than 3 weeks or so, first it smells great</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I experienced some tingling and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Part of the joy of this besides the refreshing feeling and pretty skin</li>
            <li> Yes, you pay a higher price for it, but having something which smells delightful as you use it on your face may well be worth it.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly a miracle product for me, but it&#x27;s a great alternative and healthy product compared to toners and cleansers that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> It smells so pretty when you put it on :) and works great</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend to anyone who loves a product made with nature ingredients and rose smell.</li>
            <li> It does have a strong rose smell, but it fades after a bit.</li>
            <li> It has a strong rose fragerance which is why I gave four stars rating instead of five.  </li>
            <li> I can think of is the smell; the strong rose scent might be a turn off for some people.</li>
            <li> Best thing it does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT DRY MY FACE OUT,  AND CLEANS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Best thing it does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is quite strong.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is strong and might cause a problem if you&#x27;re allergic to bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is super good stuff.  </li>
            <li> I just wish the rose flagrance isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like strong rose fragrance you should stay away with this one&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> May not be ideal for a person with very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Feels very good on face; nice scent; does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> Never knew how important toner was until this acne-prone girl started using this stuff and realized that it&#x27;s MAGIC!  </li>
            <li> It smells like a beautiful soft rose and makes my skin feel healthy and moisterized.</li>
            <li> Love the rose scent (not too strong) and the added aloe.</li>
            <li> I love the rose scent not too strong.</li>
            <li> Since, I already use witch hazel after cleansing and needed more, the rose petal witch hazel was an easy solution.</li>
            <li> However, this toner was perfect and was very mild as far as smell.</li>
            <li> Vry gentle n mild at a great price!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, very light on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Very light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I love the smell of roses, and I think the scent of this is perfect, not too strong, not too soft.</li>
            <li> This toner is also perfect for a quick refreshing throughout the day to remove excess oil and dirt without having to wash my whole face.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for preventing blackhead prevention in my ears and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy that I gave this product a try, and I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> This rose water is fine, but not my favorite.</li>

            <li> Love the large size and great price.</li>
            <li> Beautiful product, skin feels so refreshed, clean and mosturised after using it, and the scent of Rose is heavenly, very calming to the nerves.</li>
            <li> It is a special &amp;#34;grandmama treat&amp;#34; and becoming a beloved tradition.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well on my very sensitive acne prone face!!</li>
            <li> and I have seen huge results!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free which is great for my sensitive skin, and the rose petal makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a bargain (and the bottle is HUGE for the price too - 12 oz!)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> The scent is a light, not overpowering rose.  </li>
            <li> It was refreshing, but I don&#x27;t feel like it DID anything.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>

            <li> This product is something that I want to love, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that I&#x27;m just putting scented water on my face and calling it toner.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> It is Fantastic!</li>
            <li> After I applied the foundation, I applied the toner on a cotton ball and dabbed some over top of my finished look.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has never been more even.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is much better.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see if it makes my skin look better yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I added it to my routine.</li>
            <li> and they take it home to try and love it.</li>
            <li> This has a nice light scent.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a product that I will be in my beauty regime for now on, and on top of working, it&#x27;s all natural/organic.</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s like the cherry on top to my face routine.</li>

            <li> /&gt;There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products.  </li>
            <li> It has so many benefits:</li>
            <li> the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s great at night when I don&#x27;t feel up to a whole beauty routine</li>
            <li> I am in love with this toner and want to sing it at the top of the world.</li>
            <li> It is a completely wonderful product with no irritants for me, and it has helped prevent the occasional pimple or zit.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> AND  price is better.</li>
            <li> There is no use in paying more for a fancy toner.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and we like it even more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it and use it all the time</li>
            <li> Love the product and the service.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m repeating it because I havn&#x27;t been able to find this and</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it to stop mosquito bites from itching and find it works better than the anti-itch creams.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I suspect that I will be buying this for many years to come as I might have found my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; toner.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t make me break out either :)</li>
            <li> I have yet to see it making a difference on my skin, but I will say it is my favorite toner to date.</li>
            <li> Toners tend to have a burning sensation when used, but Thayers Rose Petal feels so nice and fresh on my skin.</li>
            <li> but I am in love.</li>
            <li> I just love this toner.</li>
            <li> What more can you want?  </li>
            <li> Fast service and a great price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim just because I love the smell of rosewater and thought the scent might be better than Dickenson&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I still love it.</li>
            <li> What more could a girl want?</li>

            <li> you can also use this as an aftershave - i mix it in with 100% aloe vera to make it a better consistency for application</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light and effective.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> Pores shrank and my skin was glowing , I love how I wake up with smoother skin after I apply this at night .</li>

            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I use this at the end of makeup removal and it always finds more to remove.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Great as a gentle cleanser for the skin.</li>
            <li> Light, soothing and calming on the skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Okay, I read reviews on this product and decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I tried many toners, including those from Japan.</li>
            <li> But this one is definitely always on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayer has lots of toners, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> WILL BUY MORE ....</li>
            <li> This product works better than many of the high-end department store toners.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I do notice a difference in my skin tone - smoother and more moist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is actually much better than Witch Hazel</li>
            <li> If you love the scent of roses you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> and I am glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I simply use a neutrogena soap for oily skin and this witch hazel and my skin looks the best it has in my life!</li>
            <li> Love this product - use it morning and evening</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it.  </li>
            <li> smell is divine- its a light rose smell without being perfume-y or overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel and smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really refreshing.</li>
            <li> No burning or drying ok skin.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and</li>
            <li> its feels incredibly refreshing.</li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth a a baby&#x27;s bottom now!</li>
            <li> It is a fantastic moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy and look forward to trying the lavender version next.</li>
            <li> Put it in a sprayer and spray on before bed :)</li>
            <li> It also feels more soothing than the competitor that contains alcohol, and balance my skin tone.</li>
            <li> The lavendar witch hazel is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I use witch hazel for everything from sun burns to mosquito bites and nothing you buy will work better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t mix it yet because I love it just the way it is.</li>
            <li> That was a + for Amazon :)</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel of this toner.</li>
            <li> I use with hazel for anything, I use this mostly as a toner (morning &amp; night).</li>
            <li> The smell is okay.</li>
            <li> It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel.</li>
            <li> If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> I also love all the benefits it has.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Even longer if you take better care of them.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin.</li>
            <li> but I love it because sometimes I need &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hands; the moisturizer will just ruin things.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin mostly in my T-zone.</li>
            <li> I went on a hunt to find the best toner for oily skin and decided to purchase this back in June 2013.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not horrible as some say.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s a better formula out there.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser and toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> love it for drier seasons</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels good overall.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So many uses for witch hazel</li>
            <li> More recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel and smell.</li>

            <li> and I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research about this product, and have seen many people recommend it.</li>
            <li> i have to get more</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> but maybe it takes more time.  </li>
            <li> I rememberd Witch Hazel being a thicker lotion, this is more of baby oil feel.  </li>
            <li> pleased to have found it</li>
            <li> I do massage facials and its lovely freash feeling</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great customer service.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and feels on my skin</li>
            <li> most face washes cause irritation on jaw, dryness on my cheeks and do nothing for the oil on my t spot.  </li>
            <li> This is so lovely for so many reasons-</li>
            <li> This will be the last toner I ever try because it is the BEST EVER!  </li>
            <li> It cost more than 20$ for 6 OZ.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Even though most face lotions are non-comedogenic, (won&#x27;t clog pores), I still get acne on my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff, I love it.</li>
            <li> I seriously love how this smells.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> This time, I used it before I heading to sleep making sure that I had no products on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that using it like a serum is better then cotton balls for me.  </li>
            <li> but It works better when i use my fingers.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin feel.</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use this daily now (:</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner that I saw at the store (has a yellow label, I think) upon reading the excellent reviews on here.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine - but then, Ive always loved the smell of fresh roses.</li>
            <li> Im thinking of buying more bottles and keeping one at the office/ gym bag.</li>
            <li> I love this product based on the soothing feel of it alone.</li>
            <li> spells great and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and use it 2 times per day now.</li>

            <li> Smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for quite a while now and love it.  </li>
            <li> But I think because this product is not distilled, and therefore retains all the skin feeding ingredients of the witch hazel, plus the addition of the rose and aloe, it makes for a genuinely nurturing formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think it&#x27;s a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I surely will purchase this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> The packaging was excellent and I&#x27;d definitely order again.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells good and makes my face fresh.</li>
            <li> However, I have better results with the cucumber alcohol-free one.</li>
            <li> I also figured that it&#x27;d be better for my skin since it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is phenomenal inasmuch as it has a lovely scent in addition to,its efficacy.  </li>

            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been using on my face and love the smell and how clean my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Both felt so clean &amp; refreshing.</li>
            <li> so my skin is easy to irritate, and this has caused no redness at all.  </li>
            <li> Love to use it to clean my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> but it can get irritated by products easily</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleansing yet easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is really good before a treatment on more sensitive clients.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often easily duped by \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> Easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before and love the clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great witch hazel toner that is completely alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> Make my skin feels refreshing and clean.  </li>
            <li> i feel the clean it smells more like a powder smell</li>
            <li> This leaves my face feeling soft and smelling so nice, even my Husband likes it and uses it on his own face.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product and the price is nice.</li>
            <li> The smell is a litte too strong though.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural toner to replace my favourite Humphries - I saw that there were many good reviews for this one and considered buying it until I looked at the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This toner smells fantastic - and the best part is that it&#x27;s alcohol free, so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> scent is pleasent but strong.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have that strong of a gag reflex.</li>
            <li> It is STRONG.</li>
            <li> the &amp;#34;rose scent&amp;#34; goes on a bit strong, but subsides within a minute.</li>
            <li> The rose is good, but I think I&#x27;d go with something else like Unscented next purchase.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think the smell is too strong at all.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly strong</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this as her older friend uses it and has quite fair complexion.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice soft rose smell.</li>
            <li> strong fragrances bother me but this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been reading comments about how the smell is grandma-like and too strong</li>
            <li> I have been using rose water for over 15 years, so when I found this combination about 5 years ago, I tried it, loved it and have never looked back.</li>
            <li> scent .... was so STRONG...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be too strong at all</li>
            <li> However, you&#x27;ve really got to love the smell of rose perfume if you want to use this scent.  </li>
            <li> Way to strong a scent for me.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not as strong.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars is because the smell is kinda strong for me</li>
            <li> I used the toner before bed, and the scent seemed strong when I put it on, but I assumed the scent would fade as time went by.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too strong which I like.</li>
            <li> It has a nice natural rose scent as well.</li>
            <li> Never disappointed and highly recommended!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my face very soft!</li>
            <li> (it has a nice scent and is very gentle)</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, and is a very gentle astringent.</li>
            <li> Effective and very gentle.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as a superior toner for the skin.</li>
            <li> Very good and lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this toner, it&#x27;s all natural and the price is good.</li>
            <li> This is ok for a toner but nothing special from my perspective.  </li>
            <li> nice clean rose scent, dries smooth does not take alot to cover body good or after shower or bath just as expected</li>
            <li> this product left my skin feeling clean and moist, this is a very good buy, and the price meets my budget.</li>
            <li> It is so gentle and has a light rose petal scent that is so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product and the delivery was very speedy.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I was very pleased to discover that this was as gentle as claimed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any odors/fragrance, which is great because I generally prefer my beauty products not to have a scent.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing but gentle.</li>
            <li> First off, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and cleanses my face really well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use it for a full month to see more result and then, I&#x27;ll write a review on it again.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing on the face</li>
            <li> I have dark brown skin, and this stuff was my best skin purchase in months.</li>
            <li> Smells nice at first</li>
            <li> The rose scent is too much for me!  </li>
            <li> update my review in couple weeks!!If satisfied will give full 5 star.</li>
            <li> I was worried at first about getting the rose scent</li>
            <li> I bought this because my normal toner was running out, and I saw this on amazon with good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on your face or skin and smells nice also!</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it!</li>
            <li> this is my first time using Rose Petal  Witch</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been looking for a toner that is not only good but that smells lovely as well.</li>
            <li> When I saw that there was a rose petal based one I thought it might smell pretty and work just as well.</li>
            <li> The first one was rejected so I will try to include the focus on Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera.</li>
            <li> The rose water scent smells funny, but you&#x27;ll get over it after using it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> it may too sweet scented for some users but i am ok with that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent comes from natural rose water!</li>
            <li> Most of the claims that they make about this product are true and I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is brighter and looks healthier and smoother</li>
            <li> It is alcohol free, the rose petal not only smells good,  </li>
            <li> To this I would say that it is first and foremost witch hazel that has rose assed to it.</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil on my face before bed to hydrate and I am trying out this updated version of Thayers rose petal which I like 100% from when I tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> and I just poured some in a bottle of my own and put Suran wrap over the original to keep fresh</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this toner, the rose smell is not that strong and at this price you won&#x27;t get anything better.</li>
            <li> Smells great (refreshing light scent) and works even better (cleans skins, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out) &amp;#60;3 Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your face feel smooth, vibrant and healthy!</li>
            <li> This is the best toner, hands down.</li>
            <li> I adore the clean and fresh rose scent.</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best without drying your face.</li>
            <li> The best toner there is, hands down.</li>
            <li> hands down, the best toner ever.</li>
            <li> have never used this particular product, I am a repeat buyer of dickensons witch hazel, but this stuff has rose water which benefits the skin more than witch hazel alone.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle rose scent, is alcohol-free and makes the skin feel and look wonderful.</li>
            <li> Absorbed right away, loving it.i don&#x27;t know why many people dislike the smell</li>
            <li> Especially in the case of skincare and cosmetics, it is an on-going quest to find a product that works for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel is ranked the best in facial toners and not outrageous in pricing, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over 6 months now (twice a day with cotton pad, once in the morning after I wake up, and</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product because it cleans gently and is a healthy alternative to regular witch hazel because it is alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this because the reviews were so high and also because I thought the bottle was cute.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is pleasant and not overpowering, more importantly, this really helps balance out my combination skin to absorb facial moisturizer more evenly.</li>
            <li> Does not dry my skin &amp; has a great smell.  </li>
            <li> Finding exactly what I wanted/ needed at a better price just makes it an even better experience.</li>
            <li> It works fine as a toner.</li>
            <li> This seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> Since then it has been fine.</li>
            <li> use this as a solvent for making cosmetic lotion myself, which works fine.  </li>
            <li> It helped with my acne and shrunk my pores and the fine lines on my forehead have disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less acne which is always great!</li>
            <li> Previously, (years ago) I used this wonderful product and ran out of it.</li>
            <li> but this ridded me of some of the deeper fine lines that have been creeping up since 35.</li>
            <li> The toner still works fine.</li>
            <li> The seal was fine.</li>
            <li> But wiping once with a towel just makes it fine.</li>
            <li> So for those who are worried about the scent, it goes away quickly!</li>
            <li> Received order really quickly!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> If I have a problem with acne, Thayers Witch Hazel clears it quickly!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> My skin looks super smooth and healthier !</li>
            <li> It is non-irritating and I love the smell, although it fades quickly.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t, however, find it super refreshing on my face.</li>
            <li> Super refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is so mild and my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> come summer for a quick freshen up!</li>

            <li> I have dry skin and this product helps brings back the moisture on my face, very good toner and great smell too, reminds me of some baby products.</li>
            <li> First of all I am over 50, fair, and have normal skin that is in pretty good condition.</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like rose water, not a bit like original witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> I recently tried the lavender but the rose is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of Witch Hazel and this brand is by far the best because it does not dry your skin.  </li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is gentle on my (admittedly) super sensitive skin that HATES everything.</li>
            <li> My mom is sensitive and she said she wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it because the rose scent is strong.</li>
            <li> smells so amazing and has helped to reduce my large pores</li>
            <li> Not the pure rose smell.</li>
            <li> Use for myself and my daughter helps with her baby acne and is gentle on her skin smells wonderful and feels great when applied it definitely does not dry out my skin or my daughters.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, my pores are tighter and it smells so pretty!</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this product it made my skin feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell, and feels pleasant and tingly on my skin when I apply it, which is usually after washing my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> Lovely rose smell, kept skin very smooth silky and toned, would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a great little product very lightly rose petal scented which doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies to fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to carry in spray bottle and use through out the day when your face needs a little lift and the fragrance which, as others have said, does not linger, gives a nice boost also.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, soothes and moisturizes, and does a nice little pick-me-up for the face.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this as I was looking for a new toner and the reviews were good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I will report as accurately as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rose smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite though, it kinda reminds me of something an old lady would use.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t huge though</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve now got a huge zit on the tip of my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice refreshing toner that leaves your skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love this product ( rose scented ), it leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The price is also a huge advantage.</li>
            <li> That makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural, smells amazing; I love this product.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel is by far the best natural skin toner out there</li>
            <li> /&gt;After about a week of using it the pores on my nose were getting smaller andI looked more bright and dewy.</li>
            <li> The rose scent stays with you even longer than cologne and has a much better natural smell.</li>
            <li> Great for after facial regimen and just fredhening up throughout the day...</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive alcohol free toner.</li>
            <li> This product is just fit with my skin type.</li>
            <li> great as a daily toner!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product while looking for an alcohol free astringent/toner.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great and no dryness from alcohol and the Aloe Vera is a big plus</li>
            <li> This is alcohol free btw</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposed to be alcohol free</li>
            <li> As a fellow online shopper, I think it&#x27;s important to know the reviewers skin type</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is actually moisturizing because it does not contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> This astringent works fabulously.</li>
            <li> This stuff also is paraban free.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t dare try any rose water afterwards.....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a steal since it&#x27;s cheap and takes forever</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always put toner on with my hand, just lightly pad on, however when i watch the review of this product people said to apply with cotton.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, from all the great reviews there</li>
            <li> This toner feels and smells fabulous.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> gentle and nice smell.</li>
            <li> I used the shisheido toner before, which is great, but currently outside my budget.</li>
            <li> I like the light scent.</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet Effective.</li>
            <li> have the Amazon warehouse label stuck over important supplement information and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I went online searching for an alcohol free toner and came across this brand.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel clear and bright.</li>
            <li> I feel comfortable after every use.</li>
            <li> but it is a great toner and gets of any extra face makeup off!</li>

            <li> This toner is very soothing and feels really nice on my skin.</li>

            <li> It was cheap, a lot of quantity and quality.  </li>

            <li> Toner is an important part of skincare.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;10 days later, still working great.  </li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling after putting this on-</li>
            <li> Ordering and delivery were problem free.</li>
            <li> Non stinging and alcohol free</li>
            <li> It is cheap compare to what I bought in the store.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not drying, as it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> This is great for tightening up the face after washing (something men knew about for ages), the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it feels a bit sticky on the face, but probably that is just the witch hazel, and can&#x27;t be prevented.</li>
            <li> Have been ordering this toner a few times, and going to again - best quality ever, my skin loves it too</li>
            <li> This is an alcohol free version of the witch hazel</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, and non drying formula.  </li>
            <li> Helps moisturize my skin and leaves it feeling smooth, without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fragrant--</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so is non-drying, which is important since I use this product twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried the cucumber one available from this brand.</li>
            <li> I honestly can say I don&#x27;t find this product a miracle toner, but I can say I really, really like it.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle product.</li>
            <li> Ever since purchasing this product I am happy to declare that not only have I not encountered any witches, I also have not heard that one-hit-wonder band from the 90&#x27;s, Sister Hazel.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can of course buy the much cheaper kind at the drugstore</li>
            <li> I get Free Shipping.</li>
            <li> It makes a fantastic lotion.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this toner because I heard so much about witch hazel and rose petals.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to make &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; for postpartum recovery since it&#x27;s alcohol free.</li>
            <li> MADE MY FACE SO SMOOTH AND SMELLS LIKE ROSES WHICH I WANTED.</li>
            <li> ,it fit as expected,it looks</li>
            <li> I really like the rose scent.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is simply fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it subsided in about an hour</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle and soothes nicely.  </li>
            <li> Soon I realized this is a FANTASTIC eye make-up remover!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses effectively and gently.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and effective.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my current skin care products.</li>
            <li> and I personally enjoy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.  </li>
            <li> It has a gentle smell of rose but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> but Witch Hazel is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I held it up to my nose and despite that this is an alcohol free toner, it smelled like rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> Works for acne without drying your skin out, and alcohol free.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it five stars is because as yet, it hasn&#x27;t made my wrinkles go away, lol.</li>
            <li> FABULOUS FOR YOUR FACE</li>
            <li> this surpasses them , alcohol free so</li>
            <li> A great alternative to traditional witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrant, not too powerful.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t fit well for removing eye make-up</li>
            <li> but just based on trying it a few times it seems to be perfect.</li>
            <li> Alcohol free, leaves my skin toned and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Wanted something that was alcohol free and animal cruelty free ( no testing on animals).  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and over time, it has evened my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> The scent is absolutely amazing, and it tightens and clears pores VERY well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and began using it daily, and my skin has greatly improved.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this morning and night after washing my face and use a light moisturizer after applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li> The aloe vera and rose petals are really soothing on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is soothing and a great facial toner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from the fragrance this toner is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> Great product, would totally recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels so light.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of removing the residue that facial soaps leavebehind.</li>
            <li> This product falls into that fortunate \\&quot;in between\\&quot; group.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I have no problem tolerating the witch hazel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alcohol free</li>
            <li> but it seems to be comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> It is alcohol free</li>
            <li> This one has aloe and rose petals added which makes this stuff very soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a great all-natural toner.</li>
            <li> recently I think around 2013-14, because I think it was synthetic version of it and wasn&#x27;t all that great.</li>
            <li> one with the rose petal made my face really itchy.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and well moisturized after I put this.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and tones without any dryness whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a wonderfully light scent and</li>
            <li> Light</li>
            <li> it is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> unless I use a product like apple cider vinegar and calcium benzonite clay, then it gives a light stinging.</li>
            <li> I use cotton sheets with this and just smooth it over my face after cleanse.</li>
            <li> I lightly moisten a cotton ball with the witch hazel and apply it to my face every morning and night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> Arrived sealed nicely, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> Great for cleansing and giving visibly smaller pores!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the sent and I like that</li>
            <li> The smell is divine (like roses) and it really does a nice job of removing all traces of oil, soap, make-up, etc.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> This toner smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my skin felt smooth and refreshed after using it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a couple of times and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Gentle and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> And it is quite cheap considering the bottle shape.</li>
            <li> Skin feels smooth and comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It cleanses lightly as well and will remove makeup.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been used this toner for 6 years, it make my skin become more and more healthier, and the smell is very comfort.</li>
            <li> I have tried different ones which were very drying to my skin, this one is wonderful.</li>
            <li> smell so good, and sensitive skin also can use</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and almost everything that touches my face does not end up good.</li>
            <li> This one is no exception, with a lovely natural perfume of pressed rose petals and an added moisturizer from the aloe vera.  </li>
            <li> I love the soft rose scent of this witch hazel.</li>
            <li> And while I still have fairly oily skin, I do feel like this product has minimized some of the oiliness I will definitely purchase more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not too surprising, since I think the source of the scent is natural.  </li>
            <li> As far as the seller goes-good transaction; good price would buy again.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> however I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better product out there to really help balance PH levels in my skin</li>
            <li> love this toner ~ light &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> so far so good</li>

            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> However, this is definitely a good toner if you have sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin, too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a good and healthy product.</li>
            <li> It is better than what I made, since the aloe makes it even more gentle.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Smells like an actual rose or &#x27;cooking use&#x27; rose water</li>
            <li> smells good, i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> So, many years of experience, of trying different products, and I have found a regime that I&#x27;ve been using for around three or four years that keeps my acne to a minimum and gives very consistently good results</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised , love the smell and this product is very gentile but very effective .</li>
            <li> Ordering more right now</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it stays that way, but I am completely in love with Thayer&#x27;s right now.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin and it smells amazing!</li>

            <li> First it smells divine!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Thayers!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for cleasing skin after wash and very good for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling my skin is more clear and more smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> It does a very nice job in daily skin care.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very economical also.</li>
            <li> Love THAYERS toners, personally i like the lavender witch hazel better, however this one is also pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Very Fresh feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> Very fresh feeling after use.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It smells like roses and seems to do a great deep clean.</li>
            <li> Super mild toner with a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> Works as described, leaves a very clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li> It did, but to my delight, it was a lovely and refreshing scent rather than the sickly sweet rose scent you will find with most other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a great toner and it makes my skin feel soft, cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> when your skin feels sticky and clogged up, this is a wonderful way to cool off and give yourself a little treat.</li>
            <li> My skin feels light and fresh after I use it!</li>
            <li> I generally stick to Rose as it is usually available via Prime; and, the smell is my favorite even though all are pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This smells so light and fresh!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other fragrance than real rose.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Some people might associate the smell with \\&quot;grandma\\&quot; since rose petal is a classic scent that was very popular for cosmetics and fragrances in earlier decades.  </li>
            <li> This gets my skin smooth and clean without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean and oil free without drying my skin.</li>
            <li> It retains the cleansing &amp; purifying properties that Witch Hazel is so known for, but it adds light-weight moisture to the skin and leaves it feeling clean, smooth &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> love rose water in general</li>
            <li> So I spent some time looking for a replacement and discovered that this product is consistently the #1 Amazon best seller in toners.  </li>
            <li> It keeps them from becoming infected yet is more gentle than rubbing alcohol.  </li>
            <li> it also has super strong fragrance smell....</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick and easy.</li>
            <li> and I break out super easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rose Water products in the past - all great, until I tried this.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and will ease off quickly with passing time.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s a natural astringent!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorite things!</li>
            <li> I love this toner very much.</li>
            <li> love it very gentle with my skin</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits (softens skin) of rose water, rose hip oil, and rose essential oil, I started searching for natural products to add into my nighttime skincare regime.</li>
            <li> I love this product very much.</li>
            <li> It is effective though so if you like sticking to a routine, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this product very much.</li>
            <li> scent is lovely and it feels very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and feels refreshing on your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought a mist spray bottle from Daiso, and filled it with Rose Petal toner, and it was the same as Fresh Rose water.</li>
            <li> My face feels so fresh and clean after!</li>
            <li> Fresh clean makes ur face soft and breath pores :p</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and clean every time I apply!</li>
            <li> Iam loving the results so far!!  </li>
            <li> Overall I am super happy with this purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Super gentle and moisturizing, as well as being effective.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective on my super oily skin</li>
            <li> the product advertises, it feels mild and good for those who have sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to many chemicals that are so prevalent in many of today&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> My pores have shrunk and my skin feels overall amazing!</li>
            <li> Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of toners from Shishedo, Lancome, Estee Lauder to a lot of drugstore brands in the past and I will stay with this one since it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t feel that it made any significant improvements to my skin.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Many thanks!</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve had those type of blemishes, I&#x27;ve applied this to a washcloth with hot water and used it as a compress, and the acne has looked and felt better immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, affordable toner, and I am so happy I found such an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, it feels so gentle on the face, the skin tone feels soft after using it, the scent is so good!</li>
            <li> While I was excited to use this product, my skin does not like it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> Love this product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself.</li>
            <li> Give this a shot, it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> Has the best smell, leaves your skin feeling refreshed and has drastically started to even my skin tone in the past two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> ; if you have been working outside all day-just wash your face and then use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner with a cotton ball and you will glow for your evening activities!</li>
            <li> Love the smell first of all.</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells so lovely.</li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> :B00430CRX6 Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Feels so fresh!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using Witch Hazel Toner and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Bought it because of the reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> So you get all the advantages of that, but unlike other witch hazel toners, this one smells really really good!</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s a testament to how long a bottle lasts which is great.</li>
            <li> Familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh every time!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that the original Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel contained alcohol until I read the label on this product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not overwhelming .... but just perfect !</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunately it&#x27;s not always sold in every store.</li>
            <li> Very refreshing and soothes my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would indeed recommend for reducing pore size and keeping complexion fresh!</li>
            <li> One bottle goes a long way; will buy again--and Amazon has a great price, too.</li>
            <li> I was really excited.  </li>
            <li> but this product is worth it!</li>
            <li> However I am Excited about all the added benefits to this formula.</li>
            <li> I love it soo much!</li>
            <li> and I have had significantly fewer breakouts since using it.</li>
            <li> A bottle lasts a long time too so the price is a great deal.</li>
            <li> This product is so fresh !</li>
            <li> this product softens, and makes you feel fresh!</li>
            <li> Anyway, this toner been keeping my skin on my face pretty healthy in my experience..</li>
            <li> I would say I noticed significant results within 18 hours of using it, and I maybe applied it four times in those 18 hours.</li>
            <li> We use Witch Hazel at work, and a few people had requested not to use products that contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Choosing the Thayers Natural Rose Petal and Unscented was a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li> It does the job of regular with hazel with a lovely, light rose scent and the aloe keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels very refreshing on the skin and is not harsh at all, it gives no stinging</li>
            <li> but I feel that it cleanses my skin so well that my pores seem significantly minimized.</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product, :</li>
            <li> I just got this product in the mail and was excited to use this before bed time..</li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see significant changes in my skin yet&lt;</li>
            <li> I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> what I have learned over the years is that the more alcohol-based products/drying products you use, the more likely your face will create MORE OIL.  </li>
            <li> So clean and pretty without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Also great used in a little spray bottle as a refreshing face spritz or prep before applying moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t pay tons of money for small bottles of toners, when you can get this huge bottle with the best smelling, most gentle, cleansing toner.  </li>
            <li> Am not as keen on the rose petal scent, however, but can live with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new toner after making my own sea salt toner.</li>
            <li> used both the rose and the unscented one as well as new razor blades, just in case it was my blade, and not the toner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different witch hazels but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it to clean my dog&#x27;s ears too.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and does not make my face feel dry although I can smell the alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> The smell is excellent, it&#x27;s not harsh or drying and this bottle will last forever.  </li>
            <li> It make my skin feel rejuvinated &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin super moisturized and flake free throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Lavender, which is OK and also soothing,  but went quickly back to the Rose Petal.  </li>
            <li> Removes my makeup cleanly.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I managed to burn through sunscreen 100 and used this toner to soothe and clean, my skin was, well, soothed and clean.</li>
            <li> It is free of alcohol, and has rose petal &amp; aloe vera, making it a staple for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It helps remove leftover makeup and makes my skin feel clean without the \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sensation (code: burning) or tightness</li>
            <li> so I clean it twice with this toner.</li>
            <li> Even after using your cleanser when you use this product to wipe your skin you will see it cleans further, proof is on the cotton :) You can even use it around the eyes, it gives a nice soothing feeling.</li>
            <li> and she uses rose water for more than 20 years as her only face cleanser.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice,fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner, and the scent is light, lovely, and real.  </li>
            <li> and I feel clean after using it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> but it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as a toner with alcohol does.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so clean, without over drying it.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use two or three cotton balls of this to clean my face after.</li>
            <li> I use it every day either after washing face or periodically throughout the day to clean up and remove oil when I&#x27;m not wearing face makeup.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I will use it with apple cider vinegar as an astringent for my face and to clean off deodorant residue (armpits).</li>
            <li> I use my Mia2 to clean my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my dry skin could not benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has a great flower smell.</li>
            <li> I have even used it as a cleanser since it seemed to clean my face and yet maintain the moisture...........</li>

            <li> Great cleaning product and the smell is simple mesmerizing.</li>
            <li> The redness is basically gone, the texture looks way smoother, and it feels clean and hydrated at all times.</li>
            <li> I use it every night to clean my face and remove makeup and go to bed feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> after patting my face with a clean wash cloth, I apply this toner with a cotton pad by dabbing it on my face, all over.</li>
            <li> Apply with clean hands instead of a cotton ball-</li>
            <li> feel great on my face doesn&#x27;t dry it out</li>
            <li> It came quickly and smells fabulous.  </li>
            <li> recommend Thayers Witch Hazel to everyone for its many usages and will continue to re-order and have available for my family and friends and in particular to have available for the visits of my three-year-old granddaughters.  </li>

            <li> I have never been able to use anything with the Rose scent previously as it was always too powerful, this is just a hint of Rose.</li>
            <li> Not only does it prevent and help heal breakouts, it gives skin a nice healthy glow and smoother texture.</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face at night.</li>

            <li> but it feels clean and does not smell like</li>

            <li> This is good stuff, thanks for sending it so fast.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t last forever.</li>
            <li> The smell of the rose petal is very soft and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very gentle, I love the soft rose scent</li>
            <li> This is product smells amazing and is very gentle on my sensitive skin:)</li>
            <li> I make my own because of very sensitive skin and my organic lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and my skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I love the light rose smell (and my husband does too) and the product lasted my a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and well worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a new toner.</li>
            <li> I got my shipment pretty quickly and it was safely packaged.</li>
            <li> I like rose scents, and scented products in general do not bother me, but this was just too strong.</li>
            <li> one has lovely rose smell, not too strong but subtle just like when you put your nose in rose petals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Instead, it leaves very smooth and gentle sensation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The addition of the rose petal makes for an incredibly soothing toner than can not only be used for toning of the skin but really as an addition to any home made cleanser for irritated or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Well, to my surprise the product is more gentle on my mature skin and dries with a light rose scent that disappears but is quite pleasing.</li>

            <li> It cleans my skin, it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin!</li>
            <li> Either I am old or this mild scent is just so refreshing on my face that I now love it</li>
            <li> I also put it in a fine mist bottle for when my face dries up (rare).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle, smells good, and is easy on my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Other nice ones consist of  Cucumber Witch Hazel,  Lavender Witch Hazel, and Peaches Witch Hazel!They smell really nice and keep your skin youthful and radiant.</li>
            <li> I like the light rose smell and the bottle should last me a year easily.</li>

            <li> I went into a GNC yesterday and they have it on special  </li>
            <li> Nothing special with this toner, but I like the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Thayers has been around since 1847 and is still in business, so they must be doing it right!</li>
            <li> I cleanse my face and use this toner right after and it removes any leftover residue!will definatley buy again!</li>
            <li> I stock up right before i run out!</li>

            <li> I have seen my pores shrink and disappear right before my eyes!</li>
            <li> Theresa Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel makes my skin feel so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Says that it makes her skin smooth, fresh and clean without drying.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a subtle rose scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is also lovely, very light and very like real roses, which I grow in abundance.</li>
            <li> The smell is a distinctive rose water smell, but not as strong as plain rose water.</li>

            <li> amazing leave my skin soft ,</li>
            <li> This one however smells amazing and has never once irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and it does an amazing job at keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> It feels lovely and smells gently.</li>
            <li> then I moisturize :) and my face stays matte for so much longer.</li>

            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>

            <li> I had good skin prior to using this.</li>
            <li> like the soft rose scent.</li>
            <li> But had to really struggle for more the 3 weeks for my skin to improve from the damage caused my toner.</li>
            <li> To top it off the three products I&#x27;m using are very affordable and all on Amazon prime.</li>
            <li> I was paying three times as much (maybe even more) for the Clinique line.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of alcohol-free toners over the years and give this thumbs up as gentle and refreshing on my combination skin (oily in the T zone).  </li>
            <li> I love the smell and it nourishes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> I have had no reaction to it and my skin really seems to love it.</li>
            <li> And really, I just love the smell.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of the rave reviews and the history of the product</li>
            <li> It has a light fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> I had tried many toners before this one and none of them worked as fast or as well as this one.</li>
            <li> how moisturizing it is when most toners have alcohol and are very drying.</li>
            <li> sure why the shipping jumped up so much.</li>
            <li> I am amazed once again but how effective natural products can be for the skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and gentle on skin.</li>
            <li> I love how gentle this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> :) gentle</li>
            <li> Love that this is alcohol-free: very soothing.</li>
            <li> If anything, it smells like rose perfume for old ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch</li>
            <li> and it has absolutely worked fabulously for that as well!</li>
            <li> I have tried this toner for more than 6 months now and do not feel like it has done much for me.</li>
            <li> I loved this and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Fast service, love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much</li>
            <li> It feels nice so far.</li>
            <li> I have true combination skin accompanied by clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re true.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good toner.</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try since it is good enough for my dad to use.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the rose scent, maybe it is the fancy old time label.</li>
            <li> I just love this product so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very soothing on my skin and it feels refreshing after applying it.</li>
            <li> Since the Tea Tree face wash and oil are richer in the oils that my combination skins, the witch hazel acts as a sort of in between step for the two that makes sure that it isn&#x27;t too much oil, and you still get the moisturizing aspect.</li>
            <li> Love this product very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li> It is a good value for what it is and it lasts for awhile, for me personally about 3-4 months.  </li>
            <li> I use it 2 times a day felt so cool on my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad bit too overwhelming for me, though I don&#x27;t mind too much as the smell fades after application.</li>
            <li> I used to think rose smell was for old ladies.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it for my fiancee who loves rose scent, has sensitive skin and needed an astringent.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with it - the smell is nice and soft - not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Its refreshing and seems to have really helped both my complexion as a senior and</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin nice and soft and smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t really like the scent, it smells kind of mature.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much.</li>
            <li> Love it so much</li>
            <li> It made my skin so smooth and soft, and it really does smell so good.</li>
            <li> This is a good stable for anyone&#x27;s facial routine.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and fresh.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes my skin to the point where I feel like I don&#x27;t need night cream or day cream, but it&#x27;s the most gentle toner I have used.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even caught my boyfriend spraying this on his face after shaving because it feels so cool and</li>
            <li> It smells just lovely, and I noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much</li>
            <li> Rose scent dissipates if you&#x27;re sensitive to floral fragrances.</li>
            <li> It makes my face not only smell good</li>
            <li> This product smells very strongly of old person rose</li>
            <li> It is gentle and non-abrasive and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I will say that I&#x27;ve also being making my own face masks out of natural ingredients and that too has been helping my skin and not just the witch hazel</li>
            <li> a matter of full disclosure, I use Thayers Witch Hazel  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> so maybe they were just out in full force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> reaching for the rubbing alcohol as a toner...not such a good idea.  </li>
            <li> However, on my face not so much... I found that my face became more oily using this.</li>

            <li> I agree that it can be overwhelming a bit, but I like the toner so much</li>
            <li> good to use individually in the summer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard good things about witch hazel and finally decided to try some.</li>
            <li> Fair enough with its price and its quality.</li>
            <li> I know myself, I like a nice fragrance to things I use (albeit a natural fragrance,</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this lovely smelling witch hazel without alcohol.</li>
            <li> I love this so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very affordable and smells even better.  </li>
            <li> You can get this from Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s a priced just a smidge more.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and my skin looks better and feels healthier than it ever has.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells like roses, kind of, but like an old grandma&#x27;s flagrance.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel dewy fresh and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is soothing and my skin feels soft and cool.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin so soft and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> So far, It&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good different toner for those who want a sweet smelling toner for their skin.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this brand and so far so good.</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> Just trying it for the first time, so far good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a fan of the rose scent, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong and went away quickly.</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my face soft and smelling like roses !!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner, cheap, all natural, smells good and it is super gentle but really makes a difference in my face routine.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that burns very easy.</li>
            <li> I have very very fussy, easily irritated acne prone skin, and this does not irritate my skin at all, nor does it cause break outs.</li>
            <li> this is the first product that hasn&#x27;t dried me out or made me break out&lt;br /&gt;Feels very clean and fresh with a beautiful light scent</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin feeling a bit sticky.. Would probably be great if you are very dry!</li>
            <li> I put some in a bigger spray bottle to use on my body which is great, but I&#x27;m sailing through it pretty quickly, so</li>
            <li> My only warning is the rose petal scent is very strong, I don&#x27;t mind it, but my mom who is very sensitive to smells found it too strong.</li>
            <li> I use this right after my Clarisonic and it not only brightens my skin tone, but moisturizes my face nicely as well!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, it has a nice scent and soothes my dry combination skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the strong rose smell.</li>
            <li> Hazel  w/Aloe Vera......was pleased with the slight fragrance and loved it had no alcohol.  </li>
            <li> , I THINK I have a dry skin, and this product helps looks nice, no peeling feel any more.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked so good, I hardly have to wear any foundation any more!</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this witch hazel toner performed, but I had to stop using it because the scent was so strong that it woke me up in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> Thanks to this toner, in conjunction with some other great skin products, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m definitely happy with this one purely because I enjoy the smell and the soft feel of it so much.</li>
            <li> This was the very first product that I included into my new skincare routine and Thayers makes great Witchhazel products that I use on pretty much every part of my body.</li>
            <li> When it comes to cosmetics and skin care products, I love trying new things and very very rarely am content to use any product exclusively and consistently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit strong when I first poured it on a cotton pad, but about 5 minutes after application, 95% of the smell went away.</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent, and it does leave my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Very mild and gentle but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped make my skin look better and also hydrate my skin during this very hot summer.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and, when applying the toner, my skin feels clean, slightly tingly, but not tight (which is great).</li>
            <li> The first few days that I used this product were great, I was ok with the smell that reminds me of my grandmother.</li>
            <li> Smells great but extremely drying.</li>
            <li> But other than that, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Tried the 2 other versions (Cucumber and unscented) and both were great.</li>
            <li> I cried happy tears just the other day when I woke up and saw no bumps.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any miracle results like some other people have, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> Love the smell , very refreshing ,pores look smaller, I really like this product,</li>
            <li> Very good, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love a rose smell but this is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It feels just so clean and fresh after use this toner.</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and clean my skin glows</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin fresh, clean, moisturized.</li>
            <li> This toner makes me feel so fresh and clean after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Also makes a nice application for a quick light back massage.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> A wonderful witch hazel with a subtle, true-rose scent</li>
            <li> And it just makes my skin feel so fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Plus, Thayers is completely cruelty free and has a strong statement on their website about being cruelty free.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without residue.</li>
            <li> Its light and refreshing, has a slight rose smell.</li>
            <li> This is a must for keeping your skin clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It use it even under my eyes on fine lines - it is that gentle!  </li>
            <li> It is not drying and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> my skin feels clean and fresh with this toner without any irritation.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and balancing and can be used for so many different things!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It was also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> SUPER OILY.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> To add to my problems, I also have mild acne.</li>
            <li> I came in quickly and was boxed well.</li>
            <li> It was shipped quickly and no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Plus, I find the subtle rose scent to be quite pleasant.    </li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t get oily nearly as quick in my T-zone and it feels so moisturized that I don&#x27;t even feel the need to use anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is so lovely (not the usual witch hazel scent, because of the rose!)</li>
            <li> But it wears off quickly and is not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received this quickly.</li>
            <li> Perfect for everyday skin care and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i use it twice a day, morning and night and it provides a great base for make-up but makes your skin look great even without it!</li>
            <li> but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li> I do not use moisturizer, foundation, or powder in the morning, mainly because I think it clogs and enlarges my pores and makes me break out more.  </li>
            <li> I gave it to my boyfriend who has mild breakouts here</li>
            <li> My skin also doesn&#x27;t look super oily either.</li>
            <li> So yeah, I&#x27;m super self-conscious about it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price, better than the Burt&#x27;s bee toner which costs more for smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> It has rose petals and aloe in it which keeps your skin clean and toned but not dry at all.  </li>
            <li> In addition, witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> a super toner..</li>
            <li> Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> There is no alcohol to dry out the skin and the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use it as a daily facial toner, and the scent is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Helps my homemade face oils absorbed better and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and the product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually review products, but this one really impressed me, thanks Thayers!</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick and prompt.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely being purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product has tremendously helped my skin, and removed blemishes that I had for years.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit floral/feminine but it fades quickly</li>
            <li> I also use a quick squirt here and there around the bathroom to freshen the scent of the room.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> Came quickly was packed</li>
            <li> two days later multiple people commented on how awesome my skin looked.</li>
            <li> the smell is a bit antiquated (reminds me of that \\&quot;tea rose\\&quot; perfume) but it dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> it takes it away quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, im very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Can fee the mild softing impact of the skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed with any toner I have used, rubbing across my face and pimples only spread more bacteria and broke me out more.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild.</li>
            <li> and I stopped using my anti wrinkle creams months ago when I became pregnant.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this toner - mainly worried that I&#x27;d smell like a grandma -</li>
            <li> This Rosepetal witch hazel not only is a lovely toner, but you can safely put it anywhere to quell inflammation.</li>
            <li> my pores have shrunk tremendously</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> this toner is mild that will not makes you pricking.</li>
            <li> And by the way, the rose scent is NATURAL, not artificial, as some reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> After using Thayers my skin really feels ready for the moisture step, even though it already feels nice by this point.</li>
            <li> When I wake up and before bed, I wash my face with Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Tear Free Shampoo, Fragrance Free Mild Cleanser</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping...will do business again shortly!</li>
            <li> Saw this on sale at Whole Foods, and had previously read about how rose petal water can be good for skin.  </li>
            <li> And especially so if you have yet to venture into the wonderful world that is using witch hazel regularly!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li> She ran out and had to make sure I ordered more with my next Amazon order.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will definitely get more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> The rose fragrance is light enough to not be overpowering or lingering.</li>
            <li> and it was just a mild sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to leave this under product packaging reviews but the &amp;#34;fill in the appropriate box&amp;#34; style doesn&#x27;t allow for this particular problem</li>
            <li> I also love that t is all natural and alcohol free</li>
            <li> Mild, fragrant and no stinging alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It was shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li> It does a lovely job of cleansing my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Light rose scent, alcohol- free, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong rose fragrance, but the vitamin E is slightly too predominant for my liking.</li>
            <li> It is very strong and burns young tender faces.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, as I have very sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this!</li>
            <li> no drying out, no alcohol/astringent, just plain good ol&#x27; ingredients!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many toners from high end to drugstore, but could never find one that does what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is very gentle and made me comfortable.</li>
            <li> I am now a repeating customer and would highly recommend it to others. :)</li>
            <li> very gentle and light.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I use to fear using oil right after I washed my face since my skin is very oily, but the almond oil absorbs very quickly and helps create a smooth base/foundation for my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this toner feels really good when applied to the skin, very moisturizing and not tight nor oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still early but thus far I love this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sensitive enough on my skin while still cleaning well, and I feel good knowing there aren&#x27;t a ton of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> The very first time I applied Thayers to my face</li>
            <li> If you want witch hazel, just get the original basic kind without fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very gentle!</li>
            <li> and it smelled very pretty.</li>
            <li> but I feel like there are other more effective ones out there.</li>
            <li> I also use it as a rinse for my natural hair makeup brushes which I also love as it leaves a nice smell on them along with making the bristles soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for several yrs., and have been very satisfied</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and has a light natural rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is light just enough to make you smile.</li>
            <li> First time I ever used witch hazel that is alcohol free.</li>
            <li> The labeling is very pretty and has a vintage look.</li>
            <li> available everywhere, but thank goodness you can get it on amazon for a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> TODAY WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I EVER</li>
            <li> Nothing cystic but more than I would normally get, I am hoping this is just the products removing gunk from underneath the surface of my skin</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning my face, feels fresh and clean when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> Two more days passed, and my oily skin started to get better and the few blemishes I had around my chin and forehead started to minimize, and a full week later I&#x27;m happy to say my skin has NEVER felt or looked this</li>
            <li> I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine.</li>
            <li> smells good (roses) but not old lady roses.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long heard about Thayers witch hazel from friends and skincare gurus, and Amazon has really good reviews on this products as well, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With hazel has a strong distinct scent of its own, and if you&#x27;re not familiar with that, don&#x27;t expect this to smell like straight rose water.</li>
            <li> Not that I didn&#x27;t like them and they worked fine, but I wanted to go a more natural route and start being more conscious of the things I was putting on my skin.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing to clean your face and moisturize it at the same time.</li>
            <li> gives a nice clean feeling without feeling as it is adding anything extra to your skin, just cleanliness.</li>
            <li> It leaves a clean, soft, and refreshing after effect.&lt;br /&gt;No Alcohol.</li>
            <li> I like this one a lot better because it does the same job, smells better, moisturizing (from the aloe vera), and an extra plus because the rose water has anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non drying, non irritating, has a lovely light scent of Rose, and it&#x27;s refreshing on your skin.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is completely alcohol free and that the smell actually comes from rose petals.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this as a toner in my new skincare regime, and my skin has never looked better or felt softer.</li>
            <li> but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wake up with new zits every morning and get more throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> I started using it to be able to see if a new cleanser was getting all of my makeup and sunscreen off at night</li>
            <li> Its my NEW FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> The price per use is pennies, maybe less - great value.  </li>
            <li> As a result, my previous skin issues were greatly excacerbated.</li>
            <li> Now that I use this , with less products, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Although the rose smell is the scent of old women, I&#x27;m willing to overlook it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Generally speaking, it is good for dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s really a combination of this and my more consistent practice of the OCM.</li>
            <li> , it has been leaving my face feeling nice and refreshed and not dry</li>
            <li> It evaporates quickly, is cooling and smells fresh without being overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Really good and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thayers toner works really well - leaves my skin clean, fresh and smooth without drying it or causing acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is really nice, feels cool going on, especially if you keep it in the fridge.</li>
            <li> but it has a strong smell that sometimes is too much.</li>
            <li> Great for hot summer months when you don&#x27;t wanna be continually going through whole facial wash routine but need a quick refresher.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a pretty nice toner so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the rose does anything, but it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, so I&#x27;ll take it.  </li>
            <li> Reasonably priced, too, and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> However, it is still witch hazel, and is still useful as a mild astringent.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin this is a good option for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at following that whole regime of buying lots of different facial products so this product is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> The rose smell is a little overpowering at first, but dries to a nice cclean rosy scent.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this to everyone together with a right nutrition and make sure you also drink lots of water</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that reacts to most products .</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and Thayers is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Well, quite frankly, I just don&#x27;t care, it leaves you feeling clean and the scent is pleasant enough, not over-powering and after a bowel movement who couldn&#x27;t use some &amp;#34;air freshener?&amp;#34; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Has made my skin very soft, supple, and smooth!</li>
            <li> have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong!</li>
            <li> The hundreds of positive reviews here are all accurate.</li>
            <li> After applying the toner on my face I felt very clean and normal.</li>
            <li> I love this rose toner for its gentle formula and subtle rose scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is heavenly &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any irritation after 2 weeks of consistent use!</li>
            <li> As I used the witch hazel toner more and more my skin began to break out more than usual</li>
            <li> Such a refreshing sensation!</li>
            <li> I love this toner because it is alcohol-free and natural!</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin I would not recommend this product, I really wish it worked though!!</li>
            <li> I love old apothecary brands, and Thayers is no exception!</li>
            <li> I decided to use my &amp;#34;Handy Dandy Trusty ol&#x27; Friend&amp;#34; that is Amazon.com, &amp; I found the exact one she was talking about!</li>
            <li> So soothing on a hot summer day!</li>
            <li> It really makes a difference when you can see results!!</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night after I wash my face and it has significantly improved my skin since the first use.</li>
            <li> Love this natural product!</li>
            <li> Clears away makeup residue very well!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I usually do not fragrances in skin care products, but I love the rose-y scent of this one.</li>
            <li> so I love knowing that this product has natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> You skin just instantly drinks it up leaving your face healthy and glowing!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a little tingly, but usually it&#x27;s very refreshing!  </li>
            <li> I love that is natural!</li>
            <li> Just as described and fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> great product,  not harsh or does not dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Love the slight rose scent.</li>
            <li> Love the slight rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> It smelled pretty strong to me at first, but I got used to it</li>
            <li> This was my choice of more natural toner while I am pregnant.</li>
            <li> I love the hint of Rose....and alcohol free means no dry skin.</li>
            <li> I also love the slight rose scent</li>
            <li> If it was strong, I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it either since roses tend to remind one of old ladies.</li>
            <li> Great way to get your face really clean and my complexion seems a little smoother and brighter now!</li>
            <li> It smells great and never makes my face feel tight.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and leaves your face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great on my face since I have suddenly become very sensitive to products.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> All of this time I&#x27;ve thought I was getting my face pretty clean, but when wiping my face with a cotton swab with this it does pull dirt off my face.</li>
            <li> this is an extremely fine with hazel preparation that I find to be very soothing and moisturizing to my skin.</li>
            <li> First I clean with Thayers, then I use Skingenixx Exfoliating Cleasner</li>
            <li> I have blackheads, large pores, and light acne scars and my skin looks tighter and brighter.</li>
            <li> The scent it leaves behind is very light and attractive.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger for long luckily, but if you like the smell of roses than you will love it!</li>
            <li> This toner is great and refreshing, and does not dry my face like other toners.</li>
            <li> When I use this toner on a regular basis, my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this on my baby wipes for a great feeling and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Like all toners, it helps balance, calm and even out the skin tone.</li>
            <li> There is also a fragrance free version; but who wants that?</li>
            <li> It really helps to smooth and rebalance your skin.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing (so much better than the Clinique toner I have been using for a few years) and I feel like it&#x27;s helping my skin.</li>
            <li> This is amazing  use it for anything from acne to foot soaks so universal!</li>
            <li> It has seemed to calm my skin</li>
            <li> The results of these two products after one week of use for my entire family is amazing</li>
            <li> Thanks for making it available on time.</li>
            <li> I read a few of the reviews and am so happy I bought this one.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to heavy scents, so this toner is just great for me.  </li>
            <li> It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t have an over powering witch hazel smell, and makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it smells nice and makes my face feel smooth, clean and fresh without feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Havent really seen a huge improvement with my skin</li>
            <li> My skin is really improving, I also use the Aztec Indian Clay mask, this combination is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I added THAYERS to my daily face cleansing routine and my skin has been amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is alcohol free, so it&#x27;s gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> It makes me feel relaxed and happy for a few seconds before I go to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how much extra dirt</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s where my gripe is with this product, It cleanses my face amazingly in the such an easier step in the morning when I have already washed my face at night and use this product.</li>
            <li> I really became a believer after a couple of days use when I would wash  my face and it felt so smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and supple and the scent is very pleasing to me.</li>
            <li> The scent is light, so it&#x27;s very bearable at all times of the day.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any miraculous claims about this product working wonders on my skin, but I don&#x27;t really have any huge skin issues to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s sooo worth it.</li>
            <li> and I think well worth</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, it is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Hence, I am breaking out more frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural, alcohol-free toner.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and the scent is quite lovely.</li>
            <li> Which is something that has been working for me since switching to more all natural, 100% organic products.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and sufficiently moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> The smell itself is of faint rose, but it doesn&#x27;t smell 100% authentic rose water.</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and natural ingredients make me feel safe to use.</li>
            <li> I love it so far</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite witch hazel product.</li>
            <li> I have decided that something has to change in order to get results, so I&#x27;ve been going towards more natural remedies.</li>
            <li> My only gripe (if you could call it that) is I am not a fan of the rose smell.</li>
            <li> Only giving 4/5 because the smell is kind of cloying.</li>
            <li> It is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Since i was a teen i always used a rose water i stoped for a while using it not this brand</li>
            <li> Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel - use as toner twice daily</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own personal beauty products, childrens, cleaning&amp; so on.</li>
            <li> Rose water is the only toner I used</li>
            <li> Fingers crossed but so far I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Smells like fresh roses, none of that witch hazel scent</li>
            <li> and I love its natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and moisturized and my pores may be shrinking?  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use it every day you can pour it in a spray bottle and spritz your face to feel fresh whenever you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> A well made, useful product.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> But I feel its worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing and makes me face feel clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I rarely have to use moisturizer when using the toner twice a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny</li>
            <li> Brisk fresh treat for my  skin .Has become my morning routine .  </li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel popped up after I added a similar product to my cart</li>
            <li> love it , make my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Have been testing out toners recently when I came across this since I was looking for a rose toner</li>
            <li> 12oz is a nice big bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my go to for clear healthy skin in combo with the rest of my skin routine.  </li>
            <li> Love it so far</li>
            <li> At the pharmacy there was only the kind with alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent is not harsh or overwhelming, I recommend this products 100%</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Leaving my skin fresh</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t peel, so I&#x27;d consider that a success.</li>
            <li> I love the fact it&#x27;s cheap and will last awhile.</li>
            <li> feel fresh when I use this toner.</li>
            <li> I have been looking, without success, for an alcohol-free witch hazel - until I came across this product on Amazon.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Try it out worth it.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and alcohol-free.</li>
            <li> I am 17 and have sensitive combination skin and this toner has been a great add on to my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth trying once.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel truly fresh after washing face until I use this.</li>
            <li> This is a simple and cost effective option</li>
            <li> and I can tell you that this stuff is well worth it for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is</li>
            <li> we use it everyday in our salon, we love it , our costumers love them, overall, good value for your money</li>
            <li> With this Rose Petal Witch Hazel, get all the skin soothing, astringent power of regular witch hazel without that funky smell.</li>
            <li> I could still smell a hint of rose a couple hours later</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love that it is a natural product</li>
            <li> Also, in case anyone is wondering, the rose smell isn&#x27;t perfumey or gross.</li>
            <li> Smells solo fresh and rosey.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sensitive and allergic to most cosmetics and skin products.</li>
            <li> This not only smells nice</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I use this toner just a couple of times and feels my skin softens and even more clear.</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it</li>
            <li> and I rarely have time to give up 5mins...</li>
            <li> The fragrance is from rose water and fades shortly after it dries anyway.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> gives a fresh feel for skin after cleansing, removes dirt too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gives enough moisture (aloe, rose water) but keeps the oilies at bay.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I&#x27;m not a fan of the rose/ \\&quot;granny perfume\\&quot; scent, but I&#x27;m eager to try more of the formulations that Thayer&#x27;s offers (aloe and lavender).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love affordable, natural, skin care products?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only skin care product I have that smells nice</li>
            <li> Wow love this.  </li>
            <li> I love the natural ingredients, and it smells heavenly.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff doesn&#x27;t burn and smells like fresh cut roses.</li>
            <li> I love the way it gently removes residual traces of residue (soap, etc.) and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> , my mom is from India and has grown up with so many natural products.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why it would cause this kind of reaction, especially since I use body lotions that have oils in them as well as aloe gel for my face after my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (i&#x27;ve recently changed to using derma e products), and just wear rose perfume,</li>
            <li> but i liked what&#x27;s left of the liquid inside.</li>
            <li> Oh well, will probably just use this to make my face smell nice and use a 2nd moisturizer in the areas I need.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so fresh &amp;</li>
            <li> For years I mixed my own toner, until I found this.</li>
            <li> Simple product great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner in years, but I recently ran across a review of Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I only got this for the toner with rose scent.</li>
            <li> Fun fact</li>
            <li> Ive never used a toner but its a nice soothing feeling prior to after shave.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it seems more sensitive than others.</li>
            <li> It contains some of the essential ingredients found in a popular makeup artist brand of brush cleaner...witch hazel (a cleansing ingredient) and grapefruit seed extract (known for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties).  </li>
            <li> I love that the product is natural and without alcohol.  </li>
            <li> I like the old formula better.</li>
            <li> Lovely product for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But my husband loves it--he INSISTS that it smells like a fresh bouquet of roses.</li>
            <li> I love this as a toner it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> It does not strip anything away and just makes my skin feel soft and more supple.  </li>
            <li> I like the rose scent, think I will try the cucumber next time.</li>
            <li> totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> My skin has changed over the course of the years, from dry to oily (depending on seasons and life changes) but this Rose Petal Witch Hazel has always made my skin feel squeaky clean and</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s well worth the $.</li>
            <li> Love the product so far (been 3 weeks).</li>
            <li> I use a make up remover towelette then use a cotton pad to use this toner, and it removes any left over make up makes my skin feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I love how natural the ingredients are and that there is no alcohol.</li>
            <li> Wow me~ :-)</li>
            <li> Not too powerful of a scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, so I suppose it&#x27;s more my fault then the products.</li>
            <li> I use the cucumber in the morning because it is light and refreshing, and I use the rose water at night because I find it delicate and almost comforting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite natural toners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up and feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price ~$10</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the natural and alcohol-free aspects of this product.</li>
            <li> I love this toner make my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> All you need for a perfectly fresh complexion.</li>
            <li> I bought this last summer and really wanted to love it after seeing so many people raving about it on instagram...</li>
            <li> I make a concoction of this, water, and fresh squeezed lemon juice and put it on my face every morning.</li>
            <li> This toner leaves my face feeling fresh, and not tight like many toners.  </li>
            <li> cause i get headaches very easily, but its not, it smells very light and rosey and goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I think that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more dilute (contains less witch hazel) than the clear bottle and the strong rose smell masks</li>
            <li> has a nice little rose smell but not old lady overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My skins feels fresh, clean and smooth after use, but not dried out.</li>
            <li> Product feels great on my skin and has made my complexion much clearer in combination in other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing on my face unlike the alcohol toners that I used before and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Like most other reviewers, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good one, but this is it!    </li>
            <li> but they disappear pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells nice like natural roses and leaves my face soft and clean.</li>
            <li> A pretty, mild scent.</li>
            <li> Also, the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> But the product has allowed me to have a clean refreshed feeling face without the skin drying effects of many facial products.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li> Then apply the toner, which will clean off any left over residue and close your pores before more dirt goes in.</li>
            <li> It contains no harsh chemicals and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  </li>
            <li> Very clean and soft feel after applying the product.  </li>
            <li> I feel very clean and my skin feels soft and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell and the fresh feeling after use!</li>
            <li> Very practical &amp; never disappointing!</li>
            <li> I would give 5 stars other wise.</li>
            <li> Other than that this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> I change toners and other skincare products often (good for the skin)</li>
            <li> So if you are like me and you like disinfecting your skin before you sleep in addition to using other body salves or creams, I think reviva would be a good night choice for disinfecting purposes in addition to taking a shower at night which also helps acne.</li>
            <li> you will appreciate how good this smells in comparison to the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> User friendly packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But for my normal to slightly dry ,54 year old, fair complexion its a nice mild, refreshing toner for everyday and a refreshing wipe on a hot, sweaty day.</li>
            <li> I use it right after washing my face and before my lotion.</li>
            <li> I used it right after cleaned my face</li>
            <li> They responded right away</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away my complexion ,was brighter and</li>
            <li> and i still get the right amount of moisture from this.</li>
            <li> and I knew right away</li>
            <li> but it seems that the witch hazel and aloe are doing something right.  </li>
            <li> or if it has helped, but I always use right after the cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> You can use it in between face washes or right after.</li>
            <li> It shrinks the pores right away.</li>
            <li> Not the right toner for me.</li>
            <li> I feel smooth and clean but not tight after using this.</li>
            <li> The alcohol free aspect of the product is very important to keep skin from getting too dry.  </li>
            <li> I am amazed at all the positive reviews!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and my skin feels clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I love how its all natural and I am a fast of scent!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it drying or irritating and the rose scent is lovely - very mild and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I am typically pretty sensitive about scents and don&#x27;t like most women&#x27;s colognes/ perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this with hopes that I would really make my skin feel clean..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s calming and moisturizing and really gets your skin clean.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I am able to use a Toner that does not destroy my skin.</li>
            <li> Suited my normal skin just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cucumber in the past, but the rose petal smells much better.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s alcohol free which us older women need because we need the oil in our face to maintain youthful look.</li>
            <li> But it just feels really nice on the skin, especially if I can remember to put it in the fridge on hot days.</li>
            <li> If you spritz on too much, just wipe off excess with a clean</li>
            <li> I apply it with a cotton pad after I cleanse my face daily and nightly and it has such a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star since I like the smell of rose, but this one is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is just a little strong for me, but not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated and this toner did not irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> product is very gentle and has a subtle rose smell that I think is quite nice, when I look at my cotton ball at the end of the day</li>
            <li> i just wipe my face down twice a day with this and finish with any kind of oil free gel creme.</li>
            <li> So I already knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be able to do that for me, since no other toner I&#x27;ve ever used has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of alcohol free toner and was extremely excited to see try this product after reading several positive reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle but certainly keeps the pores clean.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any positive effects and stopped using it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Once I started back up with religiously following my routine, my skin is very smooth and nice</li>
            <li> The price is absolutely cheap but high quality product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and clean!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft, refreshed, and clean!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t find anything too special with this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything special about this toner, it does</li>
            <li> Now I can save money with the cheaper makeup and save my Giorgio Armani for times I really want to look special.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement from where I used to have dry patches on my face, now I notice more even texture.</li>
            <li> Great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great so far, moisturizing if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> Product goes on light with slight rose scent.</li>
            <li> I use a mild cream cleanser daily, an exfoliating treatment every week or so, and a clay mask treatment every week, but I always make sure to follow each one up with Thayers.</li>
            <li> I like the soft light smell that quickly disappears.</li>
            <li> It works great for all skin types and  because it contains witch hazel, it is an especially fantastic remedy for combination skin (commonly a combination of oily, greasy, dry, and normal) and Rosacea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28, and newly battling acne and the onset of fine lines.</li>
            <li> My number one reason why I do love this toner is because it does not dry my skin out!!</li>
            <li> Delivery was super quick, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I personally think it brings my skins PH back to balance making my moisturizer more effective.</li>
            <li> I usually use this toner in the morning and it&#x27;s a great way to start my day.</li>
            <li> very faint rose sent that is sweet and works great.</li>
            <li> It is cool going on and very soothing.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and so addicted.</li>
            <li> I love what witch hazel can do, and it&#x27;s great for keeping makeup out of your pores, but I&#x27;ve only ever used it for heavy stage makeup because of the lingering smell.</li>
            <li> After being in grad school and working full time, my lack of sleep really started to show in my skin.</li>
            <li> I normally have a mixture of dry/oily skin which is a huge disaster.</li>
            <li> A FEW ROSE BUSHES FROM JACKSON AND PERKINS AND TAKE A WHIFF!</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, no harsh feelings at all, absorbs quickly, it wakes up my skin.</li>
            <li> Worth buying, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> After I use it, my whole face is a disaster... full of pimples....</li>
            <li> And it is also useful when first use.</li>
            <li> I recently became more informed on using essential oils and thus reintroduced Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel into my skin routine</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the first toner worth to buy.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is quite nice, not heavy like it can get, but fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, removes the extra makeup washing or make-up wipes leave behind and it leaves my skin feeling wonderfully smooth!  </li>
            <li> If you like to use natural products and enjoy the scent of roses (which is not overpowering), I think you will enjoy this as much as I do.  </li>
            <li> This product is alcohol free (important with my sensitive skin), gentle, non-drying, and is a pleasure to put on my skin.</li>
            <li> This smells great and seems gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my face super clean, soft and fresh..</li>
            <li> thing is it&#x27;s cost effective, lasts a long time &amp; if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice during a long commute or after the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really love this toner - it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, smooth, clean, and slightly moisturized.</li>
            <li> My pores are now small, fine wrinkles are smoothed, and my entire face is bright and healthy in appearance.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sturdy and it&#x27;s tough making it look nice, conditioned and smooth and this product surely does that.</li>
            <li> This actually hydrates my face, makes it smoother, cleans the remaining dirt and debris from my pores and leaves my 30 year old face looking like a super fly and funky fresh 20 year old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great right after washing off a mask to clean the missing parts up, it however does leave my skin slightly red (which goes away after 5 min), but overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between trying this product or a pure rose water.</li>
            <li> After a shave, it moistens/softens my skin a little bit and gives a light enduring rose scent to it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and very effective at doing what it supposed to do (treat and calm skin acting as a facial</li>
            <li> Larger than I expected and very good quality.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, in my opinion--if you are familiar with rose absolute essential oil, it is definitely not that &amp;#34;breathtaking.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend adding Cortas rose water--it has no additives--and I highly reccommend this product, as well.</li>
            <li> My hubby secretly tried it and then told me he liked it as well!!</li>
            <li> but I notice my skin going back to really oily more so than I did with the Dickinson&#x27;s original Witch Hazel.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy the large quantity unless you know it works for you!</li>
            <li> Everyone always talks about scrubs and exfoliation, but I feel like the RIGHT way to go is to nourish the skin, and this product does exactly that.</li>
            <li> but right now I&#x27;m using it and liking it ;-)</li>
            <li> Right away I opened it and used it with a cottonball after a hot day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always trying new skin care products and looking for something that will make my combination skin clean, balanced, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> For the most part I am careful and never try to squeeze any pimples on my cheeks because they definitely scar the most easily and also leave mini-welts after you squeeze them, but I might have overdone it this time and</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and it makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and is very soothing while acting as a toner.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin like many stronger products.</li>
            <li> A nice toner that doesn&#x27;t dry my face.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t anywhere near as strong.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the rose smell</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really care for the smell of rose I would suggest a different type like lavender.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on your face and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or burn when you put it on.</li>
            <li> can however understand that it might still be a bit too strong for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild and gentle, and has no alcohol.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice aroma and really cleans deep.</li>
            <li> I love the soft scent of the Thayers and the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> and I love having found natural products that work with real results.</li>
            <li> Slightly too moisturizing for my oily skin, but definitely is a good toner.</li>
            <li> It has a soft rose scent and it keeps your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery</li>
            <li> ive only used once so far so good</li>
            <li> After a few more nights of using it my skin is better than it has been in years.</li>
            <li> I had been very loyal to Lush brand toner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are ALL a great product, I just like to change out for a different style occasionally.</li>
            <li> The spray option is so much more refreshing and feels gentler on my skin than smearing this unevenly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this, and how gentle it is on my sensitive skin.  </li>

            <li> Such a nice and gentle toner.</li>

            <li> This is mild and helps to keep my skin clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, easily irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Because it is made with rose petals and has no alcohol, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It is mild and gentle - no irritation.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my face - it feels refreshing.</li>
            <li> but if you are sensitive to strong fragrances, you may not like this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone to include this into their skincare routine since I use it for not only my face, but also areas of my body such as arms, legs, and neck making it a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal takes that experience to a whole different level.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> The rose water fragrance is delicate and refreshing.</li>

            <li> I always loved this stuff for how dewy and smooth it made my skin feel, but after applying the new batch this morning and yesterday, I noticed my skin has felt tight and not as moisturized afterward.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it makes my skin feel clean and soft but not tight.</li>
            <li> the original witch hazel I normally get @ walmart for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> The smell is also really amazing, I mean I love the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much gentler than face products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and honestly does a much better job too.</li>

            <li> and i like it very much.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that there no extra unnecessary chemicals which makes for something I can feel safe and good using.  </li>
            <li> I love this toner, although i think the frangrance they can tone down alittle, a bit too strong.</li>
            <li> After my job got me a free facial, the lady told me some things I should be doing more often, and I was looking for a new skincare regimen</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know if this product helped my skin because I use so many different things right now, but I feel like it makes it feel fresher and smoother somehow.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry my facial skin.its perfect toner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When traveling or in a hurry I will use this to clean my face real quick, but I mainly utilize it as an extra layer of moisture.</li>
            <li> During a hot, humid summer I have found that the Thayers witch hazel seems not to over dry my skin and leaves it nice and soft with a fresh, clean feeling.</li>
            <li> Does not cause drying of my sensitive skin in fact has healed redness I&#x27;ve experienced from other products -</li>
            <li> I like being able to quickly refresh my face when I get home and then later do a real cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of lavender products before and creamy rose products, but this seems to work way better on scars and skin tone in general due to the combined aloe/vitamin E/rose/ and even witch hazel.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a tingle but it feel good.  </li>
            <li> Makes my face clean, fresh and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> The cottonball showed the residue of my sweat and my skin was left feeling clean, lightly moisturized and dewy.</li>
            <li> Also leaves my face feeling super refreshed,clean,and feeling super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different versions of Thayer&#x27;s after shave toner, and this particular mixture with rose petal/aloe vera is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love the subtle rose smell, and the generous size.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become dryer and more sensitive.</li>
            <li> The product is a great value (you get so much for so little!)</li>
            <li> To open - I just flip the top up and the toner dispenses through a tiny hole, very precise.  </li>
            <li> The aloe leaves skin soft, not dry, and the rose scent is just right for me</li>
            <li> Having come from Pro Activ, I&#x27;ve found this to be superior as it doesn&#x27;t overly dry your skin out and makes it very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to awaken and freshen face after a hard work out too.</li>
            <li> It is highly fragranced with a rose scent; but that&#x27;s no surprise as it states this openly on the label.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this and loving it after several weeks, I just picked up a bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel from the store.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the very best to use after cleansing my face without making my skin feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> like I do with Dickson&#x27;s (smaller pores, clearer skin, more removal of dirt/make up/grime.</li>
            <li> I also use this when my skin feels hot.</li>
            <li> First I wash my face with my Vichy face wash, then I use this with a cotton pad</li>
            <li> Smells Great last a long time</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Still, it&#x27;s an easy addition to my beauty routine and feels very pampering and clean, so I&#x27;ll likely keep doing it.</li>
            <li> I started using this toner 2 months ago and really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently begun using toners again, and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:</li>
            <li> I have been using for several weeks and am quite pleased.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not out a whole lot of money - give it to a neighbor for her or him to try!</li>
            <li> I purchased this toner and tried it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li> All natural and light</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you for fast shipping as always!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so having a toner that can keep my skin naturally clear is important to me.  </li>
            <li> would definitely buy some more.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s consistent and works well.</li>
            <li> and I use it 2-3 times a day when I want to freshen up my face on hot days.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and it has helped my complexion and is first class for lessening the time it takes for bruises to fade.</li>
            <li> I did not know what this product would do but it really exceeded any expectations!</li>
            <li> When I first began using this, I adored it.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Ships fast!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin pretty sticky.</li>
            <li> for it also made my skin pretty itchy.</li>
            <li> I always use it after a shower to make sure all soap and shampoo residue is gone as well as after facial masks.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, it&#x27;s the only toner you need</li>
            <li> So in attempt to peel off the label, the pretty packaging which I wanted to display in my bathroom was ruined.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Love the personal service.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth after using this.</li>
            <li> Unusual for a toner!</li>
            <li> For being in business for over 100+ years, this brand knows exactly what they are doing.</li>
            <li> It clears my pores and locks in moisture, which is exactly what my combination skin needs.</li>
            <li> I now use it daily and find my makeup applies more evenly, as well.</li>
            <li> Roses are not my favorite scent but the scents goes away pretty quickly so it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Prompt, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel in several items, this always being the brand of choice, but for beauty products, or ANYTHING that would be put on the skin, this is a fabulous one to chose!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> I personally feel that my oily, acne prone skin does much better with Witch Hazel toner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say it will do this for everyone but this product was EXACTLY what my skin needed.</li>
            <li> I like it - I just finished the first bottle...</li>
            <li> great product- much nicer than usual brands, doesn&#x27;t burn or cause irritation</li>
            <li> My pores seem slightly smaller and my skin tone more even</li>
            <li> The smell is exactly like roses and with my first use I saw a glow in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> And in the morning, my skin becomes so soft and smooth, which never happened befor.</li>
            <li> I feel confident enough to leave the house without makeup now.</li>
            <li> Works just as well and possibly even better than Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle , and i just love it.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m interested in trying the aloe and lemon one.......</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination adult-onset, acne-prone skin and since I have been using this for two weeks my skin has been so much more clear, more even tone and looks brighter in general.</li>
            <li> and then I will apply regular toner on top of it.</li>
            <li> This one leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and has helped my pores and facial scaring tramendously.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite facial toner.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, does the job and smells like a bed of fresh roses.  </li>
            <li> In the hot weather I even put some in the fridge and mist my face periodically.</li>
            <li> I have only been using for a week and my skin does look more radiant.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am 74 and have used many different toners all of my life.</li>
            <li> first I just brought it to tone</li>
            <li> but it really does moisturize too!</li>
            <li> I changed NOTHING else in my skincare routine, just added this toner twice daily, and my skin is better than ever.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is the most impacting of the various characteristics of this product.</li>
            <li> It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana (sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words \\&quot;witch hazel\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> Then over time the water started turning cloudy and had a funny smell.</li>
            <li> Smells divine and leaves my face utterly refreshed, smooth, and (hopefully) youthful and radiant!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll use the bottle up and hope for better luck next time!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use this in my homemade facial wipes and the scent is lovely.</li>
            <li> My skin actually glows now and has a more refreshed look.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t slap it across the pretty label,</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend using them all together if you have combination skin, the tea tree products moisturize my skin and fight acne, and the witch hazel acts as an astringent, making sure my skin isn&#x27;t too oily, and also fighting the acne.</li>
            <li> maybe it made a noticeable difference at first, but then your skin got &amp;#34;used to it&amp;#34;, or it &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34;, then try toning with this witch hazel after you wash your face.</li>
            <li> At first I was using cotton balls</li>
            <li> After reading so many glorious reviews on this product, I finally decided to give this a try..</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and no alcohol in this product, I will definitely order more in future!!</li>
            <li> This product really helps decrease acnes and make my skin smoother!</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks of using this skin toner, my skin looks FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer as I did with my former skin toner that I paid three times more for.  </li>
            <li> i bought it cuz of the high reviews!!</li>
            <li> Love it and will definitely buy again.  </li>
            <li> Delivered on time, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is the first toner that I have ever used that didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout.</li>
            <li> Also its pretty.</li>
            <li> First time using it.</li>
            <li> use Noxzema and apply this toner every morning and night, I only apply sunscreen in the morning &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> My face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This is my first comment, coz I have to.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my skin wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> And to top that off, I&#x27;m definitely an acne picker.</li>
            <li> Adding this to my facial routine changed my skin for the better.</li>
            <li> First time ordering this product.</li>
            <li> was using Body Works&#x27;s Tea Tree Toner which is supposed to help with acne and this Witch Hazel toner works ten times better.</li>
            <li> I love that this brand is all-natural and that I&#x27;m supporting a local company (they&#x27;re based in CT).</li>
            <li> Still absolutely love this stuff but have found that I can get it a lot cheaper from the actual Diva Stuff wesite.</li>
            <li> It seems pretty hydrating, I sometimes forget to use a moisturizer even.</li>
            <li> a hot day,</li>
            <li> My face could have been better big time.</li>
            <li> You really get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Although, I have noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin looks more even than before I started using this</li>
            <li> I use it after washing my face with cetaphil (gentle cleanser), fresher sensitive cleanser, and origins checks and balances, and this stuff is great at getting the forgotten soap particles and minimal makeup residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back in stock.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This toner actually gave me better results than regular &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; toners or astringents, and it smells better too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back in a month to purchase more.</li>
            <li> First, I went to Thayer&#x27;s website &amp; found their price for this product is same/similar to Amazon</li>
            <li> will break me out, but this stuff makes my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> When I first put it on I swear that the scent was pickle-like.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products</li>
            <li> I am an admitted product junkie, but it&#x27;s back to basics with this stuff because it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> is the pretty packaging you can leave out on the counter.</li>
            <li> Will definitely not be repurchasing in this scent, maybe the cucumber scent is better?</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that this is all natural; there are not -oates</li>
            <li> I love this toner I can see a big difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> For the first time in YEARS my skin is clearing up.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth, toned and clear.</li>
            <li> the aroma, the feeling of cleanliness, and my favorite the smaller pores!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first use, it made my face itchy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite I like to put it in a spray bottle and use it on my chest and back ...</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> first used it to help treat my acne break-outs.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE that I have found another American made product too!</li>
            <li> My husband even commented that I smelt funny after I applied it.</li>
            <li> it makes my skin look so much better, and pores smaller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, I just love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> It took about 3 weeks for my skin to start clearing up, but now I nearly acne free.</li>
            <li> within 24 hours of the first use of the toner, everything seemed to even out.</li>
            <li> I alternate this one with lavender one and love them both.</li>
            <li> I leave it on the bathroom counter next to cotton balls and whenever I am there I put some more on.</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially the smell of roses!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have bought it several times already.</li>
            <li> And the price was reasonable!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it&#x27;s my first time trying it</li>
            <li> I put it in  a container with cotton rounds and they are ready to go!</li>
            <li> Love it, I will definitely be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;Four.</li>
            <li> Very soothing!</li>
            <li> (so men can use this without a worry of smelling &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Clear Difference Advanced Blemish Serum</li>
            <li> Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Clear Difference Advanced Blemish Serum</li>
            <li> I feel like it makes my complexion look more radiant and younger as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to incorporate this product into my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Will def come back for more.</li>
            <li> The sea salt toner worked GREAT at diminishing my acne but after using it for too long, my face was turning red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, like any product my face turned dry/pinkish/red for the first 2 uses.</li>
            <li> haha!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin and nor does it make my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Like most of these &amp;#34;Old Fashioned&amp;#34; remedies it also has a variety of different uses.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough :)</li>
            <li> The smell is exactly what I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> ;-))</li>
            <li> ;-).&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I actually just use my fingers to rub it on instead of a cotton ball, which seems to work better for me.  </li>
            <li> And this is exactly what I got with this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what a whole bottle will do!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes pretty well too.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just used my second bottle; I&#x27;ll probably keep using it until I find a better product.</li>
            <li> me start off by saying I LOVE using witch hazel as a facial toner/cleaner/astringent.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can wash my face with a 2% Salicylic Wash (pretty darn drying) and then apply this toner</li>
            <li> I got my first wrinkles going on my forehead</li>
            <li> So now I always apply this first after washing my face...</li>
            <li> I noticed an improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on purchasing this toner again and again. :)</li>
            <li> Yet, it leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> not fake smelling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I still have the acne scars, but I actually feel confident to leave home without make up, cover up.  </li>
            <li> Kept meaning to go to the store and this was a much more convenient way of meeting my facial needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first time using witch hazel.</li>
            <li> It removes dirt and grime very well and leaves my skin looking fresh.  </li>
            <li> Next time I may buy a more neutral or unscented version</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more as I cannot find it in any store.</li>
            <li> toner is very moisturizing for my face and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Thanks !&lt;</li>
            <li> My skin not only feels better but looks healthier.  </li>
            <li> I immediately noticed my skin was softer and smoother after the first use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased it at retail locations for much higher prices.</li>
            <li> Really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this product here on Amazon around 2011, there was like no reviews AT ALL..</li>
            <li> This product is my first witch hazel</li>
            <li> With this price, I definitely get more.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Witch Hazel product I have tried</li>
            <li> Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another product that I love from the same line is the Medicated SuperHazel....</li>
            <li> Even after the first use.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty flowery</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is supposed to have all sorts of benefits for various inflammations (some more anecdotal than others)</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this product for a while, and I&#x27;m glad I finally took the chance of spending $9.</li>
            <li> First off, it smells like heaven and my skin loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been a big believer in witch hazel for many years, but I&#x27;ve never tried an alcohol-free version before.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel works really well, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchase.</li>
            <li> It sounds weird, I know, but after looking into it I found out a lot of people also experienced this!</li>
            <li> Fast and quality delivery!</li>
            <li> I am very thankful for this product!</li>
            <li> To say the least, I&#x27;m blown away - this is a product of great quality.</li>
            <li> and I am sure it will last for months and months.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and she loves it and is starting to use it in her office :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to twist the cap off to remove the outer safety seal instead of picking at it to tear it first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am now thinking it was not the oil that first caused it on my hands but contact with the toner that had leaked into</li>
            <li> It cleans the skin, but leaves it so soft, smooth and toned.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> It came exactly when it said it would</li>
            <li> I know many people love this stuff but after trying it a few times my face just burned way too much after using it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as described and fast!</li>
            <li> It is very well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> so I know exactly what I am putting on my body.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because after applying it a glossy film was left on top.</li>
            <li> Refreshing change from regular witchazel.</li>
            <li> with or without washing my face first -</li>
            <li> The smell is also pretty good！</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> and this really does the trick!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely stunned about how well this works!</li>
            <li> This is my first toner ever.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> I love the way the product gives the illusion of smaller pores...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble finding good products made by companies that don&#x27;t do any animal testing, so was</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this toner for a while because of all the good reviews and decided to buy it a few months back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good with cotton balls or pads instead of something harsh like Seabreeze or Stridex.  </li>
            <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for me at this time of year when my oily skin needs just a little bit of help keeping the dry skin away yet</li>
            <li> This is has been added to my new more natural skin care regime.</li>
            <li> is such a mild astringent that I feel free to use it any time my skin feels oily.  </li>
            <li> : I have very oily T-zone, sometimes sensitive, acne-prone, easily congested skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly blotting with oil absorbing sheets (my life savers!!!!)</li>
            <li> a must-have especially if you live somewhere with a lot of humidity, I live in Miami, FL so a good toner is a necessity.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and it makes my skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> For acne prone skin I think Alba Botanica&#x27;s Natural Acnedote Deep Clean Astringent is much better at reducing oil on the face and minimizing pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week, but so far, I love it!  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so clean and soft and just overall healthy.</li>
            <li> It made my skin soft, smooth, clear, and really clean by removing any residue that the cleanser hadn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Its gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate but still leaves my skin feeling moisturized and totally clean and free of buildup in my pores.</li>
            <li> more clean clear and younger looking.</li>
            <li> it is a slight slight rose smell but in a good way...</li>
            <li> it smells great, i can usually smell the rose for a little while after applying it.</li>
            <li> , at the first time I put this product on, I feel my face is so fresher than it ever before, no sticky, no oily but so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Looking at my bottle one day recently I noticed that it had alcohol in it (never bothered my skin though) and decided to look for some without alcohol in it in an attempt to get an even more pure product.</li>
            <li> This toner smells amazing and does not sting my face like other toners.</li>
            <li> rose scent, which is not overpowering like other beauty products on the market.</li>
            <li> if you do not like rose I would try one of the other varieties.</li>
            <li> As well as the face, this is nice to use on other areas of the body, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, legs, feet, &amp; after shaving.</li>
            <li> makes my skin look healthy will be buying more as long as they make it only issue</li>
            <li> This makes the solution smell so good, and it&#x27;s gentle on my little one&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, gentle, and it tones down the redness on my face, for sure.</li>
            <li> A couple weeks ago I decided to switch to a more natural face care regimen and using the advice of other reviewers I purchased Dr. Woods Black Soap, the Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel and organic argan oil (all from Amazon for cheap!)</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way on a cotton-ball and the light rose scent is much more tolerable than some other more pungent brands.</li>
            <li> It helps keep my face clean and clear without being drying.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for all skin and especially skin sensitive to alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Great facial product with minimal side effect reactions.</li>
            <li> Ok I understand all the hype behind this amazing product.</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh, clean, not dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great alcohol-free astringent with a subtle, rosy scent.</li>
            <li> She loves it, makes her skin glowy and clean, and plus it&#x27;s helped to clear up her acne.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to get away from the Clean &amp; Clear Astringents.</li>
            <li> They have amazing natural products, I&#x27;m constantly using it!</li>
            <li> It made my entire face itch, burn and turn bright red.</li>
            <li> and it makes her skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It makes my face soft , silky and clean</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, instead it leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Im still trying it but tell now I found that my face is so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> , my skin feels purified, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling soft and clean..</li>
            <li> leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and I have not had an issue with my skin drying out or getting flaky.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft &amp; feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean and soft</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, refreshed and clean feeling.  </li>
            <li> I always feel soft and clean aftering using this toner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t strip your natural oils but leaves you skin clean.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the smell doesn&#x27;t last, but I quickly realized that the toner made my skin very oily, even if I don&#x27;t have oily skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a gentle toner and the fragrance is lovely.</li>
            <li> It tones my skin nicely, and helps with both the sensitive nature of it and the rosacea that I&#x27;ve finally gotten under control.  </li>
            <li> My facial aesthetician sells this product at her spa as well, so I feel further reassured that this is regarded as a good product by a skin care specialist.</li>
            <li> : I love that it is all natural, alcohol-free, has natural moisturizers, and contains witch hazel.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a toner to make my skin soft &amp; keep it clear and oil free all day!</li>
            <li> The rose scent is a bit too \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; for me, but that is just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> I love the soft floral scent and the way it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> and so i thought this should be good for me... yet who knows each individual is still different.</li>
            <li> I would even say this (along with a good moisturizer) has helped my skin over the last several weeks and contributed to my decrease in breakouts.</li>
            <li> So far, I have only tried the Rose scented.</li>
            <li> love the smell, much like roses, and works well enough.</li>
            <li> this product is not that magical, i feel uncomfortable when i using it,it do smells good, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This toner gives me a very refreshed look after application and I can actually see healthy skin.</li>
            <li> I have acne and this definitely soothes it, plus the scent is a natural aloe and rose scent.</li>
            <li> and I have a lot of tiny bumps, blackheads, hormonal flare-ups, and mostly scarring from squeezing which I really shouldn&#x27;t do but can&#x27;t help it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use something more natural, and I think this helps my skin keep young.</li>
            <li> I get hormonal cystic acne breakouts when I&#x27;m really stressed on top of my regular period</li>
            <li> Makes my face feels refreshed and very soft, mild scent.</li>
            <li> but I really enjoy product packaging and this was a major pet peeve for me.</li>
            <li> gave me some redness, but I m not sure its because of the product, other wise , nice smell , and feel..</li>
            <li> After the very first use my skin felt not only clean but moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin but cleanses the face very well.</li>
            <li> Like others here, I very much appreciate that it has no alcohol and that it is affordable, two unusual features of Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I read one person said that it caused the oils to come out of their pores the first few days, but it was a kind of cleansing, and it stopped after a few days and then they really loved it.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a toner than gave me the same clean feel without the alcohol and this toner does it!</li>
            <li> Made my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean but not tight.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had much luck with any that I&#x27;ve tried until I tried this!  </li>
            <li> I use a cotton ball to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much, so it will last me for a good long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost positive that the description did NOT include this fact at the time I decided to purchase).</li>
            <li> Cleaned my skin without any burning and my skin positively glowed after.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner for years but all the positive reviews enticed me to try it.</li>
            <li> The smell is positive and I can already see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> This toner, from the research that I did, got a lot of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I used it for about three weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any positive effects.</li>
            <li> I was attracted by those positive reviews of the product and bought it with a doubt.</li>
            <li> First purchased in October 2011, getting ready to reorder now (August 2012).</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to more expensive natural toners.</li>
            <li> I love it and wonder how my skin survived so long with out Thayers.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and cleansing but it did not clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> , that is after I tried pretty much every toner out there.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel in the summer just to clear my pores after washing my face and to cool off when I was outdoors with no makeup.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even really know what it was supposed to do exactly.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is how much you get for your money-</li>
            <li> Fast shipping exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything from the store</li>
            <li> At the beginning I did not notice a great deal of difference in my complexion, but I did notice that it did not make my face red like other toners I had tried immediately after using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks and much luck to you!</li>
            <li> I like a real -scent , not fake perfumey scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I got it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Mine was been super-soft lately, it works nice as a refresher - it does minimize pores too!</li>
            <li> I thought at first it did not do much for my skin</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old and honestly my skin really does looks years younger.</li>
            <li> After using it my skin feels totally refreshed soft and the rose scented water really uplifts my mood.</li>
            <li> So I have been trying this out and must say it has a soft sweet scent,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s make my face feel so good and soft without the burning affect of other toners.</li>
            <li> After awhile the product clouded up and the smell has kind of a sour smell now.</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and, while I loved the smell, wasn&#x27;t wowed by it.</li>
            <li> Witch hazel is a natural astringent and this product has the addition of rose petal water, aloe vera and vitamin E, and it is very nourishing and non-drying (in fact quite the opposite, softening!)</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, so at the most time of my life I was suffering from bigger and very visible pore, blackhead, and acne etc..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been doing a good job clearing my face off pimples, blemishes and whiteheads for the past 7 months.</li>
            <li> Going to try and find a small spray bottle to keep some on hand during the day when I need to be refreshed &amp; to keep makeup looking good.</li>
            <li> use it every day on sensitive skin and no bad smell</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for the real deal in terms of what Witch Hazel can really do, and, most importantly, what it was intended for; for the real deal before manufactured watered down brands overran the shelves, then this is the one to try.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a more subtle effect, but you will still be able to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> It smells lovely lovely but subtle.</li>
            <li> I feel so refresh after I put it on fast drying and leaves s soft clean feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> At first my skin had some reaction to it, but then it was fine after several uses.</li>
            <li> I have been doing this routine twice daily, and my skin looks fresh and clean, no clogged pores or blackheads, and my skin looks firmer and tighter.</li>
            <li> I mean whether or not it REALLY does much, it feels great.  </li>
            <li> I would rather price my own products a little higher than buy cheaper ingredients that I can&#x27;t trust--and I think my clients appreciate my stance.  </li>
            <li> The smell is gentle and sweet and cozy, I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I actually tried the lavender/cucumber one, but switched back to the rose one because it works better for me personally.</li>
            <li> but it has a nice fresh clean and very delicate water like appearance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this, and I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s being made!</li>
            <li> This particular brand feels good going on, leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight.  </li>
            <li> Even after the first use, the next morning I noticed a huge difference with my skin....</li>
            <li> Have a great smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, leaves the skin between dry and moisture!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so keep using brand named mild toner: shishedo, clarins etc.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and a lot of products just don&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I feel it mild, but it never disturbed my sensitive skin so far.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It reduces the visibility of capillaries and is a mild natural cleanser.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just as effective and less drying</li>
            <li> cause this toner can dry it out more if not).</li>
            <li> As an adult with mild acne, this product helps keep the breakouts, somewhat, in check.</li>
            <li> My face don&#x27;t feel dry any more.</li>
            <li> it seems quite calming to my super sensitive, prone to redness skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s super gentle--perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin, and anything with fragrance, alcohol, chemical coloring, mineral oil, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it helps minimize irritation, especially on my neck and has also eliminated my very mild and infrequent acne spots on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It does clear it up quickly when I use the witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I never regret with my bold action this time.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased another type of Rose water, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> My face feels super clean after using, and the fragrance is subtle, yet lovely.  </li>
            <li> I love this product so much I immediately ordered a replacement so I wouldn&#x27;t be without it for long.</li>
            <li> I have used this before in the past and loved it so much that I got some for my mother.</li>
            <li> there are several people said it has a \\&quot;strong smell\\&quot; and \\&quot;smell cheap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t as strong as the one I bought last time.</li>
            <li> only reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because of the scent--to me, it&#x27;s a bit grandma-ish, and strong.</li>
            <li> Feels very soft and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> It works great at removing the deep down dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> Even better, I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair since I started using it.  </li>
            <li> I guess it was a smart move, sell expired stuff on Amazon, they&#x27;ll never</li>
            <li> Certainly have made a face routine with this</li>
            <li> This also helped me with my acne problems and certainly helped prevent breakouts by cleaning my pores.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this by pure accident.</li>
            <li> While I do not think that it minimizes my pores, it certainly did not enlarge it or cause any excess oil secretion.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve certainly noticed clearer/glowing skin</li>
            <li> This is the number one reason I ordered the large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At around $9.00 you get a fairly large bottle compared to department store toners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a fairly large bottle for the price</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy again.</li>
            <li> I like that it is pure and non-toxic.</li>
            <li> (I also take the murad Pure Skin clarifying Dietary supplement)</li>
            <li> so this is a long-term use product for your chronicly large pores.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I use to have large pores but ever since I&#x27;ve used this with skin laboratory&#x27;s 20% Salicylic acid peel</li>
            <li> I wanted pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Large area of allergic rash......</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Why mess with something so amazing?</li>
            <li> For the very first time I used a face toner that doesn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin .</li>
            <li> one of the very first ingredients before witch hazel is fragrance and my face is extremely sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> Using this product only made me realize that I&#x27;m personally sensitive to Thayer&#x27;s which is interesting since their ingredients aren&#x27;t exactly toxic.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and soft!</li>
            <li> And a little cheaper than Whole Foods :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Foxbrim brand made my skin feel dried out in so many ways!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, but so far, I&#x27;m really loving it.  </li>
            <li> Decided to give the Rose Petal a shot due to the high ratings and it did not work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been keeping it in a zip-lock in my gym bag, just in case the top comes loose, and I have had no spills.</li>
            <li> The bumps never amounted to pimples (but I still DID get pimples), and it was highly noticeable, especially if the light hit me just right.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s fast drying, and the slight smell of rose petals tops it off.</li>
            <li> Slight rose scent but not too much for the men in my family to use, as well.  </li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t dry out my delicate face or neck skin, yet</li>
            <li> The nice tight snap cap is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this because of the inexpensive cost, but after time, and once I could afford higher end beauty products, I found myself coming back to this toner.  </li>
            <li> In such a short period of time it&#x27;s managed to eliminate most of my blackheads AND shrink my pores, something I&#x27;ve been trying to do unsuccessfully for years!</li>
            <li> I notice smaller pores, more even skintone and my face just feels and looks soft!</li>
            <li> is that first I use Noxzema&#x27;s original deep cleansing cream ([[ASIN</li>
            <li> It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I can see the fine lines starting to disappear!  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first, mainly because the product looks like a cliche &amp;#34;miracle elixir&amp;#34; from 1875.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this toner in particular.</li>
            <li> The scent is blissful and the efficacy is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> Contains a rosey scent and very affordable for its large size.</li>
            <li> but this is by far the easiest less intrusive most effective for what I need and that&#x27;s just simple cleansing, toner, and astringent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, the rose petal version of this toner smells a little aggressive.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use on your eyelids and seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Very good for my complicated skin.</li>
            <li> Honestly, i have very dry sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s hot and muggy, this is a great way to clean my face from sweat.</li>
            <li> moistrurizing very well, can smell rose a little bit.</li>
            <li> This gently scented toner is just right for my sensitive skin and I and expect to have it in my bathroom forever!</li>
            <li> Because this obviously does not smell like a perfume, this scent is more natural and pure.</li>
            <li> I like that the top is a squirt top so only a little comes out at a time.</li>
            <li> Very natural products!!</li>
            <li> The toner is great, doesn&#x27;t dry my face like other toners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good quality REAL Witch Hazel</li>
            <li> Taking the extra step to tone the skin with a product such as this Thayers Rose Witch Hazel, yields a very high increase in the efficacy of any serum &amp;/or overnight treatments</li>
            <li> This is a great product and something that&#x27;s part of my everyday facial care routine.  </li>
            <li> My only huge issue with it is the smell.</li>
            <li> It tingles just slightly after I apply it and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s witch hazel, which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks,  is a great astringent.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s no big deal, the huge difference in price makes up for that.</li>
            <li> Which is amazing because my face usually is easily dried out by ANYTHING I put on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my break outs, they&#x27;re not as intense,my skin is much tighter, and pores are smaller.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how something so simple could make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I use my cotton ovals to do mask with it twice daily after cleansing, it feels so comfortable and gentle after applying it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it&#x27;s a nice, faint whiff of rose.&lt;br /&gt;The softening effect.</li>
            <li> However, it also makes your face soft, and completely dirt and oil free.</li>
            <li> IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS PACKAGED VERY WELL</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very picky</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely DESPISE however, about this product is the packaging.</li>
            <li> I guess the aloe really does work.</li>
            <li> I had bought witch hazel before but didn&#x27;t think to look at it too much and realized when I got home that it contained alcohol.</li>
            <li> reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If anything,  it makes my face sooo much oilier and greasier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for almost 3 years and really really like it.</li>
            <li> It does everything it promises too also...leaves my skin feeling clean, but NOT dry.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and it always leaves my skin looking and feeling very refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a real person and so are you (hopefully)</li>
            <li> I have used up a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well as the Clearasil brand toner.</li>
            <li> The pads are ready &amp; hassel free.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Leave me skin feeling soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to help or hurt much.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> This toner really cleanses and moisturizes my oily/combo skin needs.</li>
            <li> go through a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is still very moisturizing for a toner.</li>
            <li> My acne scars are fading fast which could be from either or all of the three products I&#x27;m now using.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really understand the use of toner</li>
            <li> Alcohol free was a big plus.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate though I have found if I use too much I can feel it on my face.</li>
            <li> It has been very helpful for the dermatitis that I have on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have oily/sensitive skin with light rosacea and this toner cleans off any traces of cleanser and preps my skin for the next step in my regime.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it really helped her.  </li>
            <li> With that being said, it didn&#x27;t do much to help treat my acne, so my seach continues for another toner.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I have very temperamental skin with dermatitis, acne and rosacea...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to any woman or man of any age, the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> and I feel like this really helps keep in moisture</li>
            <li> I really cleared my complexion and gave me a rosy glow.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife as she really enjoys the smell of roses.</li>
            <li> I have been battling acne for fourteen years and after trying a plethora of products OTC and prescription, I&#x27;ve decided natural remedies are worth a shot.</li>
            <li> So gentle</li>
            <li> she didnt like it as much as the walmart one</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> really like the scent, texture (it&#x27;s a bit moisturizing), and how it preps my skin before my moisturizer (I use jojoba oil).  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, either.</li>
            <li> St. Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control - use to gently exfoliate twice a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very lightweight liquid and isn&#x27;t greasy in the slightest.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Which I really would rather not smell on my face.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and acne.</li>
            <li> If you have acne-prone skin, I would highly suggest this miracle worker as well!</li>
            <li> It cleased my face very well</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and it just leaves a fresh feel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really torn on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> and it does so much for my skin.</li>
            <li> it is so gentle for my face and do not have alcohol.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very soothing - reminds me of my grandma 😊</li>
            <li> The price is also quite affordable (I got mine at Whole Foods for $9.99</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so fresh and soft</li>
            <li> I really like this toner.</li>
            <li> This might be the product I&#x27;ve been searching for my whole life.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use products like this very often</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and fresh.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that my skin is much clearer.</li>
            <li> I really like the Thayer&#x27;s brand as a toner to help with my rosy cheeks.</li>
            <li> it keeps my skin very moisturized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light enough scent that I can handle it for now.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels.</li>
            <li> I used to use Mario Badescu cucumber toner, but it really was too drying.</li>
            <li> and I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Unlike lotions, it doesnt make my skin real oily.</li>
            <li> but it did seem like too much for my skin</li>
            <li> You can see how much dirt it removes after you&#x27;ve already washed your face.</li>
            <li> really like it, and probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My face hates water and all cleansers, no matter how gentle, so I&#x27;ve stopped washing my face and started using this stuff instead.</li>
            <li> and it really helped for him.</li>
            <li> Very devoted, have been using on my face and the faces of my babes for years.</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended this toner, and I bought it despite me not even needing it really, but I felt I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since my acne was getting out of control.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price.</li>
            <li> My face thanks Thayers</li>
            <li> Really shrinks pores and leaves skin with even tone.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this toner.  </li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li> No allergic reaction and results fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> 2) it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Gentle, clean-smelling.</li>
            <li> So much nicer for a toner than the toners in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> and you can use it as much as you want throughout the day.</li>
            <li> After I shower and remove all my makeup from the day I put some of this on a cotton ball and gently apply it to my skin.</li>
            <li> It really did not work anything for</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It smells like heaven and really clears up any spots on your face without drying them up with alcohol.</li>
            <li> The alcohol free is also a big bonus.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all thanks to this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from seller.</li>
            <li> Very drying even without any alochol.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it in the evening after the last step of cleansing and before the fist step of moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin fresh and not dried out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell and you just slap some on your face after you wash, morning and night.  </li>
            <li> , I found that it also worked really well on my son&#x27;s weeping eczema.</li>
            <li> will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So i have a reason this toner is really organic with no chemical</li>
            <li> I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> that my sister bought me (also on Amazon, we really can use the internet for everything, huh?)</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really tried it yet..</li>
            <li> The toner keeps my face fresh and soft while the tea tree oil prevents pimples/oil build up.</li>
            <li> and I really prefer this.</li>
            <li> Very calming.</li>
            <li> Gentle for skin and does just what it says it will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and really balances, tones and cleans the remaining traces of junk off your skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does smell like roses</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> and it looks so much smoother when I wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>

            <li> it really takes off the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t breakout as much since using this product.</li>
            <li> Found later that it was available at Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t yet see much improvement</li>
            <li> Gently cleans and removes makeup.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just really like that this product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t break out as much anymore</li>
            <li> this has really helped my skin will continue buying</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this toner and the way it makes me skin feel after using it.  </li>
            <li> Wondering if it is real one from the manufacturer or a faked one.</li>
            <li> works very well</li>
            <li> really like it</li>
            <li> I gave it to my sister ultimately as I really cant stand the smell.</li>
            <li> and I was made whole and told to keep the remaining product.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m going to go toner free.</li>
            <li> Staying in the shower longer than you absolutely must will cause the skin to lift and peel.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean and not dry, smells like roses.</li>
            <li> so this really helps.</li>

            <li> Smells like real roses.</li>
            <li> feel very moist after use.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast and they were nice enough to pack it in a ziploc-type back in case the bottle leaked.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the aloe or the roses, but it really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> REAL ROSES DO SMELL LIKE THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> Absolutely astounded.</li>
            <li> Now is this really a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; thing to do?</li>
            <li> , it really takes all the dirt out of my face.</li>
            <li> i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
            <li> While witch hazel isn&#x27;t the star of this product, the astringent is very soothing and even somewhat skin-smoothing.</li>
            <li> dont breal out as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much softer and cleaner looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> The toner is really soothing</li>
            <li> The packaging is just a plastic bottle, which looks rather &#x27;cheap&#x27; on my vanity, so I actually pour it into a spritzer bottle, and I spritz it onto my face, neck, and body after washing.</li>
            <li> It really tones everything up.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Prior to using thayers, I would try all different facial cleansers, toners, moisturizer, serums, creams, etc and never be happy with my skin.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much I scrubbed, I couldn&#x27;t get the lingering essence of grandma off my skin.</li>
            <li> very moisturizing but does not make skin oily.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Thayer toners!</li>
            <li> This toner is not only alcohol free but has vitamin E as well.  </li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean and refreshed - not dry.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner is gentle, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my pore size.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend using it throughout the day as a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; as the product recommends unless you have very oily skin -</li>
            <li> The bottle that I bought recently in a store was paraben free.  </li>
            <li> The bottles available through Thayers website have different ingredients listed too.  </li>
            <li> Will absolutely purchase again.</li>

            <li> It really does seem to make skin look fresher and newer...</li>
            <li> It was much brighter and toned.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this after cleansing my face at night or morning.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often...very touchy skin...</li>
            <li> Reasonable Price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides as make-up remover, I use Witch Hazel as a gentle substitute of alcohol for wound cleansing.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff</li>
            <li> Very cooling.</li>
            <li> , my skin now thanks me.</li>

            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cloying with fragrance, and it&#x27;s fresh, not heavy.  </li>
            <li> but I found it on vitacost for a much cheaper price</li>
            <li> By the way...i have pretty normal skin</li>

            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know really what to think about this product.</li>
            <li> I peeled it and then the whole Thayer&#x27;s label got messed up.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy mixing it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Gentle, recommended.</li>
            <li> i really recommend this product, it can be used as mist or toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a convert, I really like it.</li>
            <li> and it really works and does not disturb your makeup.  </li>
            <li> It really works to even my tone.</li>
            <li> but I expected more.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping, product as described</li>
            <li> and I will absolutely purchase again through this business.</li>

            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> very hydrating without that sticky gunky sensation.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> My skin is very acne prone, I break to practically every product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to like this product, every way I tried to use it, it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I came across this product in my search, and saw that they sold it at Whole Foods</li>
            <li> Delivery is fast.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This toner doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in term so tightening pores</li>
            <li> which I really and no alcohol.</li>
            <li> but it had been very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> Love the toner itself, BUT when it arrived, my package was wet and the bottle was leaking from the lid.</li>
            <li> (what does a grandma really smell like?</li>
            <li> but I really like the smell</li>
            <li> but no that much</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t really feel any softer and doesn&#x27;t really glow either</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading so much about toners.</li>
            <li> for I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really in need for a toner of this type.</li>
            <li> Which is all that really matters.</li>
            <li> also really like the smell.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s quite gently on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a rather really self-conscious person,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> It really cleanses your skin well and there is no burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> The smell takes some getting used to as it really smells like roses</li>
            <li> It is gentle on my skin &amp; non-drying.</li>
            <li> It has a smoother and softer feel to it than just straight Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> But anyways, when I do break out, now a break out consists of 4-6 pimples whereas it used to be my whole face.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> and it does not cost much.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is witch hazel based instead of alcohol.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone struggling with acne!</li>
            <li> I like to use a toner after washing my face but don&#x27;t want to pay the department store prices, and this is a product that works well for me and is priced reasonably.</li>
            <li> Fast service delivery with quality packaging.</li>
            <li> I have smaller pores now, no roughness or blemishes, and my skin is baby smooth.</li>
            <li> Gentle and cleanses without drying skin.</li>
            <li> Very disconcerting.</li>
            <li> But maybe I used too much or something.</li>
            <li> Fast</li>
            <li> Who knew alcohol free would make such a difference.</li>
            <li> delivered fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really helps a lot</li>
            <li> it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily.</li>
            <li> I was purchasing this off of Amazon until I saw cheaper price at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> the witch hazel is so gentle</li>
            <li> My skin feels much smoother and softer after use.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really cleans my face and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> it works really well.</li>
            <li> But, this toner was very softening and moisturizing EVEN in that problem area.</li>
            <li> It really tightens my pores.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> and this is very soothing and calming when applied to those areas.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing, cleansing toner.</li>
            <li> Please do the patch test before applying to your whole body.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing lotion, leaving my skin feeling silky and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I feel it&#x27;s very soothing and beneficial for keeping my skin moist;</li>
            <li> Very hydrating and soothing.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, and it works well tightening my pores.</li>
            <li> Gentle after washing toner.</li>
            <li> It was much pricier at around $14.00 there.</li>
            <li> The smell was way too much for me too.</li>
            <li> and it is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so gentle that I don&#x27;t *have</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> very useful！</li>
            <li> My skin is so much softer and it shrank my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for years to combat shiny skin (my T-zone gets shiny FAST)</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Smells like roses and really softens and refreshes my skin.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is very pleasing too.</li>
            <li> Very soothing.</li>
            <li> I very seldom break out now.</li>
            <li> and i love it, and second leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I skip lotion and apply Rose every few hours around the house.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better is if it were all natural.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li> Has a faint rose scent, which i love.</li>
            <li> Three days later it&#x27;s completely gone and my skin just feels better.</li>
            <li> My skin always looks wonderful when I use it regularly, and I feel like I could use it at any time of the day to freshen up without over irritating my face.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday, as it&#x27;s gentle and effective in controlling overproduction of oil.</li>
            <li> It left me red and dryness but not this Rose water.</li>
            <li> Because I stripped away my natural oil, my skin only produced more to make up for it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no need to ever buy a chemically produced astringent when you can have all natural ingredients that essentially produce better results.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Only toner I have ever liked, only toner I will ever use.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much more hydrated and clear in just a couple weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Apply Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera to dried face with a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Apply Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera to dried face with a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> Although I have a more intense beauty regiment because I suffer from hyperpigmentation, I use several several different products, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love using natural products on my skin, and this has definitely become a \\&quot;staple\\&quot; for me!</li>
            <li> The aloe is a nice touch and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after use thanks to it.</li>
            <li> My face is clear and my pores more refined, and I haven&#x27;t even been having the occasional blemish I used to get.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, use every evening as a toner to remove any trace of make up and oil that my soap left behind.</li>
            <li> Good with normal skin tone, not sure if it works for oil skin.</li>
            <li> later I removed the rose and witch Hazel toner from the plastic baggie and went to open</li>
            <li> Just received it a few days ago, but I&#x27;m really loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned through my own trials and tribulations that what works for one (or even many) definitely doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll work for me, so I warn you not to assume this product will work wonders for you.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, not tight.  </li>
            <li> For easier application and to not waste the product I put it in a small plastic travel bottle with an applicator top or a spray bottle, to easily dab or spritz.</li>
            <li> Super delicate smell, love the package design, always leaves my skin feeling refreshed  even after  a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something natural to accompany my soaps that I hand make and I have found it...!!!</li>
            <li> The rose scent may be too intense for some, so add the plain solution to create an acceptable dilution.</li>
            <li> I never really know when it might have a mini fit, say, right by my nose.</li>
            <li> Have used other more expensive toners before - but this one by far works the best.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s suitable for dry, oily, sensitive, and acne skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better for normal to dry skin, leaves skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same as what is found at Super Supplements or Vitamin Shoppe (et.al).</li>
            <li> Very big bottle, delivered quickly and exactly as it appears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and haven&#x27;t really seen too big of a result, but I feel very clean in the face and my skin has brightened up CONSIDERABLY.</li>
            <li> After much researching, I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a shot, mainly due to the good price and numerous raving reviews, and the fact that it contains no alcohol and is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first bought it a year ago because I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> We had been using just the plain witch hazel and a friend told us to try this one with the Rose Petal</li>
            <li> It helps to make it smell fresh down there and makes for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had faster results than any medications, than any pretty packaging promising the moon--with basic, simple, honest, and natural products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and is exactly what they put in those expensive &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; sprays; I ordered a small glass spray bottle and pretty happy with the cost-savings.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, I just leave my face with this alone - it keeps it from becoming too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got everything you want from witch hazel, and the smell isn&#x27;t a strong, strange one.</li>
            <li> I originally use regular Witch Hazel for my toner but found it very drying.</li>
            <li> Smells like a rose but is not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> skin didn&#x27;t break out when using it, but it also didn&#x27;t seem to pick up that much dirt compared to an OTC toner such as clean &amp; clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this product is suitable for every skin type, my mother has very dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My blackheads are slowly but surely becoming fewer and fewer, and my skin is far more radiant.</li>
            <li> unlike many other withc hazel out there.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, this product broke me out.</li>
            <li> So I bought this as a replacement, because I do like the witch hazel but wanted something that would also moisturize my skin, plus something that smelled better than the twiggy smell the other one had.</li>
            <li> OMG, not sure if it is because of this toner, but my skin noticeably looks more radiant after using this toner!</li>
            <li> will make this a normal part of my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm every day and the effects don&#x27;t seem to wear off like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> So excited to finally find Witch Hazel without alcohol.  </li>
            <li> but it truly is much better than the other witchhazel that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I noticed there is lavender and many other choices.  </li>
            <li> 32 yo female with combination, acne prone, melasma rich, pregnancy mask skin.</li>
            <li> Cleans your skin better than any other product out there and reduces pores without drying out your skin.</li>
            <li> And i&#x27;m glad it arrived on time with my other products.</li>
            <li> I like it better than the other toner I&#x27;d been using...</li>
            <li> Better than other toner.</li>
            <li> Most all other moisturizers that I use make me break out.</li>
            <li> I believe other people may have had a better experience than me</li>
            <li> Besides that, it definitely cleans my face and has significantly improved my complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my complexion since using it, which is odd but fine by me.  :-)</li>
            <li> was inspired to purchase the Thayers witch hazel in peach after finishing half my existing rose bottle, but unfortunately the alcohol in it (rose is alcohol free) did not react so well with my face.</li>
            <li> I used it only when it comes as a free gift or sample, but after I read couple reviews on youtube, and I checked on amazon, this toner is highly recommended by people, so I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of witch hazel, and natural skincare in general.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t drying but it definitely gets my skin clean.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this toner to clean his ski, as he is prone to break out occasionally.  </li>
            <li> After becoming addicted to this product, and purchasing it in stores, I decided my habit needed a better outlet.</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts me several months, so it is a great value.  </li>
            <li> You can just spray it on your face several times a day to keep your complexion moisturized, clean, and your oil production under control.</li>
            <li> not a miracle cure if you have acne, but will definitely get any grime/dirt off your face and leave you feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> I put it in a small spray bottle to use as a facial mist instead of just using a cotton pad to apply and it works great.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love what it does to even out redness and blemishes and to improve the general appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> for this was a bit steep for me at first, but when I received it and started using it, I definitely think that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually use this and some light moisturizer after I wash my face and it is very refreshing (since my skin is dry as well</li>
            <li> and I do feel like it actually does clean out my pores while moisturizing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It give me an instant clean feel</li>
            <li> used to use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby oil to remove make-up as it does a great job too, but Witch Hazel achieves the same effect, if not better, without any grease.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty big bottle and very much worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> so use this every morning to clean my skin prior to applying a serum &amp; sunscreen moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It feels very refreshing and makes my skin a good base for lotion application.</li>
            <li> It does seem to clean up left over residue and makeup that didn&#x27;t come off via washing</li>
            <li> It helps to clean my face after facial wash.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised by how fast it really transformed the texture of my skin and helped my breakouts after it was very disgruntled from infection.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use warm water (not hot or it&#x27;ll dry your face) to wash your face in order to open up your pores and and wash all the dirt away.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this based on the other reviewers reviews.</li>
            <li> So much more effective than other toners with harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but used for weeks and still have older age acne, pimples between my eyes and a couple other area.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> High quality witch hazel really does help tone and soften skin.</li>
            <li> I feel like it really cleans my face and pores well because I see whats on my cotton ball after wiping down my face with this toner and its not pretty lol.</li>
            <li> After I use this, I usually apply jojoba oil to really fight any blemishes and maintain smooth, clean skin.</li>
            <li> I live in a very humid climate and have combination skin that gets very oily in the t-zone.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel anything special or different with this</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s high quality, and smells better than other brands of witch hazel for some reason.</li>
            <li> and so many people raved about this product I had to try it and have high hopes for it to do all the things other reviewers say it does.</li>
            <li> A real keeper as far as I am concerned!!</li>
            <li> It does make my skin feel a bit softer, though I typically put a layer of lotion on top of it because my skin gets very cracked otherwise.</li>
            <li> Glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like regular witch hazel</li>
            <li> went on a business trip and left this at home and freaked out, luckily GNC and Whole Foods sell</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have known that rose petal is your typical old lady scent, but somehow I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out regular skin and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This smells like roses and leaves my skin feeling soft instead of dry like most astringents.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh with a long lasting clean feeling without over drying!</li>
            <li> From past November till January my skin care routine that I started from mid-october started showing amazing results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to write something about this amazing product.</li>
            <li> Looks like ordinary water but its effects are amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like this toner and wish I could just force myself to stop slipping from my skin routine because it really makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I did try another brands supposedly &#x27;authentic&#x27; rose water, and finally found the worse smelling product on the market.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how her skin-whispering facial skills told her that, but as she left me with amazing, soft skin, I believed her.&lt;br /&gt;(My</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues using this toner.</li>
            <li> Also, WOW, it does so much cleaning!</li>
            <li> I also exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs, but this is the first product that has prevented them completely.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I think this is a good product just not good for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents and had no issues.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking it!</li>
            <li> Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the rose petals or what</li>
            <li> I buy simply because I am a full time college students</li>
            <li> It worked for me and I am pretty much sensitive to everything else.  </li>
            <li> Nice to put on my skin, but I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s benefiting my skin at all.</li>
            <li> First off, my product was shipped and delivered on time, and arrived completely in tact, sealed and everything.</li>
            <li> I will probably also will use a stronger rose-hip oil, non-creamy blend for scarring in the future since I have used this in addition to shea, cocoa, and conconut oil instead of the lavender oil-based products I have bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now instead of using the alcohol to disinfect my skin in addition to a tea-tree oil cleanser, I am glad I switched to this in addition to a 10 percent, glycolic acid natural cleanser from Be Natural Organics and a stay-on</li>
            <li> Put some on a cotton pad and it wipes away the daily grime and leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed.</li>
            <li> never used a toner before, but apparently there&#x27;s a bit of debate as to whether or not they&#x27;re even worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this particular Thayers witch hazel religiously for almost 3 years now but my most recently bottle caused my skin to become very irritated.</li>
            <li> So, so far it&#x27;s been a catch-22 and in the mean time I got a generic &amp;#34;sensitive skin astringent&amp;#34; from the dollar store which pretty much works great, but has a smell I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin and needed something a bit more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> but it is gentle enough that it is pleasant and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Even when it dried, and makeup was over it--the smell was too strong!</li>
            <li> Love the product, just used it for little over a week and find it very soothing.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about ordering this because regular witch hazel doesn&#x27;t smell good.</li>
            <li> New Holy Grail product added to my skincare regimen!</li>
            <li> A new staple at my home!</li>
            <li> I had been needing a new toner and at this point I would of done anything to help my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s toner for several years now, but the smell was becoming more harsh and I was nearly choking on the &amp;#34;fumes&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Using this a couple of times a day, little pimples went away leaving my 12 year old&#x27;s skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like so many other toners do, and leaves my skin squeaky clean and radiant.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say oily, but it was more like the toner was being squeezed back out of my pores after it had been absorbed, and my face was basically wet!</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel is also soothing and it has all natural ingredients, even the Rose is a natural fragrance not like the fragrances they put in all other kinds of products.</li>
            <li> Thayers must have introduced new packaging which I really like</li>
            <li> I purchased mine from Whole Foods, but was going to order a new bottle from Amazon until I saw the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Brand new and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and refreshed, have not had a breakout so often with this product and it lasts very long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, either.</li>
            <li> It seems more even and less oily.</li>
            <li> Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel better as it feels like it leaves less residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> Since this toner&#x27;s alcohol free, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Being alcohol free is also a plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out nor aggravate my acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, day by day my skin became more tolerant of the toner and instead of the slight stinging</li>
            <li> It has a delicate rose smell that&#x27;s not overpowering, and it&#x27;s much gentler than just using outright witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> and this is the main component of my toner.</li>
            <li> The price is decent, too.</li>
            <li> This toner does a decent job at moisturizing and soothing skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not have the money to by the top of the line products that I usually use since I am getting married and have a wedding to pay for.</li>
            <li> Really nice for use after wet shaving too soothe your skin, possibly in conjunction with an alum block.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent makeup remover and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> And with the amount inside the bottle, it will last a good few months.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to look smooth and clear.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to use as a toner.  </li>
            <li> Smells a lot like an older person (one who showers of course).</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel used to be an older time skin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Super Detox Elixir?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY acne products and this is the only one that I see actually working on my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it with a cotton ball and not only is it refreshing, but all the red spots on my face disappeared.  </li>
            <li> this is a good second toner after you use the harsh stuff.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write a review on this, mainly to see the impact it had on my face, and woahh it did.</li>
            <li> This is a main staple in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Is amazon selling something else, or perhaps an older product?  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 nights now, but it&#x27;s definitely not breaking me out.</li>
            <li> just started using it, got a bigger bottle than I expected which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> have tried several kinds of face lotion, and was hooked on Eucerin for quite some time, and this would only sit on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> classic product for all things that need Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I have decent skin</li>
            <li> I also use it on my son&#x27;s back after removing his medication patch to help heal the skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I did have an initial break out on my nose, but it went away fairly quickly with continued use.</li>
            <li> I am not a big believer on things working so quickly</li>
            <li> Thayers witch hazel has been a favorite staple in my facial routine for the last year compared to witch hazels you buy in store</li>
            <li> The bottle was the main reason I was attracted to this product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn my face, smells decent.</li>
            <li> Since a main ingredient in the Proactive toner is witch hazel, I thought I&#x27;d try Thayer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Maybe when I am a bit older I will appreciate a product like this...just not now.</li>
            <li> I was going to go out and buy the Ponds caring classic (5 stars review)</li>
            <li> : I received the package very quickly and at first I was a little apprehensive because the liquid looked like baby oil inside the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and leaves it very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> No alcohol + the addition of aloe makes this gentle, even for some folks&#x27; very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Very soothing witch hazel for my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This toner really works, better than plain which hazel and definitely better than the more expensive brand name I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> This is coming from someone who has very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> If you are very sensitive, this may be the toner you have been looking for!</li>
            <li> Gentle and all natural!</li>
            <li> Order arrives quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I made sure it was on tight and still it leaked.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am confident that it cleans out any residue left over at the end of the day before I go to bed, and at the same time, it&#x27;s gentle and soothing and never harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> After reading so many of the positive reviews here I was anxious to try this product</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll continue using this for a long time because it makes my skin glow, feel clean, moisturizes/evens out my complexion</li>
            <li> In winter just put a rose oil or other over it for extra skin hydration.</li>
            <li> I breakout so much to new things that I&#x27;m really in fear when I try new</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand because it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, even pure Aloe Vera which is soothing and isn&#x27;t supposed to burn.</li>
            <li> I put this on his face, and it was TOTALLY clear by the evening!!</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the smell but some of you may not; it sticks around for a little bit after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does help a little though, and it&#x27;s better than nothing.</li>
            <li> (lavender is a favorite) and a little goes a loong way.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to see what my skin will look like after long term use!</li>
            <li> Most of the time I don&#x27;t even use cotton balls and just splash a little on my face.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feels, but one day my skin was a little taught.</li>
            <li> but I prefer a little more witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> This Thayer facial toner is all natural and absolutely fantastic for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Once you smell it a little more it does smell like roses.</li>
            <li> Feeling a little help for my nose pole, not so sure yet, because I just start to use it.</li>
            <li> It simply does exactly what it says it will!</li>
            <li> but I think with a little more time....</li>
            <li> Sometimes to give it a little more oomph I add a drop of tea tree oil on the cotton</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I saw the light before those products could do any serious damage.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and suffer from mild acne that has left scars on my face.</li>
            <li> but it lasts forever, smells amazing, cools and cleans my humid skin after a hard day</li>
            <li> its very gentle and very helpful when i have occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much that I got it for my 17 year old little sister</li>
            <li> Let me be clear that this toner is not bad, in fact, it&#x27;s a lot better than other toners I&#x27;ve tried because it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it also did not fulfill the hopes that I had when trying it.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and not strong.</li>
            <li> (I use the soap first and, with a bristle skin brush and warm water, I scrub my face in tight circular motions and then pat dry and apply this toner with a cotton ball)</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a new, more natural beauty routine and after doing some research, I purchased this product along with Leven Rose Jojoba Oil, Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural, Viva Labs</li>
            <li> Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always heard that Witch Hazel was amazing for your skin, but I never liked the smell.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the skin and calms my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product so far</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone that wants to tone his/her skin without stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and cooling, and I&#x27;m not worried about using any of the ingredients around sensitive parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> This really helps to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> I honestly really prefer my sensitive skin astringent from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> and my skin is soft and I haven&#x27;t been breaking out on my forehead as much as well.</li>
            <li> My face is clear and hydrated for the first time in my adult</li>
            <li> but I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I have very persistent adult acne that I have battled with since I was about 22</li>
            <li> Using this really helps restore a natural balance while also getting rid of any dullness.</li>
            <li> It feels so natural and still picks up dirt- not as much dirt as the harsher brands though, so if you have oily acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> This is something really natural and gently for my face.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin and isn&#x27;t stripping at all.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so am really cautious about the products I put on it.</li>
            <li> Not harsh and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I really like this natural toner.</li>
            <li> but then I don&#x27;t have a real sensitive nose like some people do.  </li>
            <li> This is a gentle toner, not heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I was a littel nervous because I have sensitive skin, this was gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural, gentle toner.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so clear, and really hydrates it, even without a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do we&#x27;ll with moisturizers, since my skin is so sensitive, so this really helps out.</li>
            <li> Makes my face very radiant and soft.</li>
            <li> I really want to recommend it to the person who with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is sensitive in places and not so much in others.</li>
            <li> have very acne-proned, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very oily and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel clean but not overly dry.</li>
            <li> I would have thought it would be drying when it fact it makes my skin feel soft and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Not harsh at all, very soothing.</li>
            <li> Really keeps my skin soft and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I say normal meaning</li>
            <li> Love it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> and it is the first toner that hasnt dried out my face and left it bright red.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years now and  love it.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell like actual, fresh roses.</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel toner whenever I run out of my regular Loreal Hydra fresh toner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it anymore, since it hindered my skin more than it improved it.</li>
            <li> I do love it and it picks up dirt well with a cotton round.</li>
            <li> Most toners are too harsh for me and seemed to break me out a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to update my review in a few weeks with more specs on how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been mixing my own toner using this and Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and some distilled water.</li>
            <li> I normally use witch hazel for my face.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I tend to add a few layers on top of my darker spots, hopefully it will even out my skintone.</li>
            <li> Still need your normally makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and normally my makeup</li>
            <li> I use this on emerging zits and trouble spots, and it&#x27;s lovely without being too drying.</li>
            <li> refreshing- without the harsh drying or stinging of alcohol-based toners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra money because of all the benefits.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t feel like normal toners.</li>
            <li> The rose petal scent is natural, not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and love the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I use it every day, but I am sure to use it after a harsh glycolic treatment which I do a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel on my skin since many toners tend to be too harsh.</li>
            <li> Well worth it and a giant bottle for the quality and price.</li>
            <li> use it everyday, love it</li>
            <li> The only thing is the smell, it&#x27;s not bad and it fades away, but it has that old fashion smell that remind me of my grandma beauty routine when I am using it.</li>
            <li> skin is normal</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this at first, and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I received this within a few days of ordering and have been really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get many wrinkles, but must always battle the downsides of youthful skin while trying not to be too harsh on my &amp;#34;not a spring chicken&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use for a few more weeks to see what it does.</li>
            <li> This Works wonders on my combination skin (normal, oily t-zone).</li>
            <li> Many toners have harsh chemicals and alcohol in them.</li>
            <li> This Winter weather is really harsh on my skin and this product has helped my skin to be more moisturized even with makeup on.</li>
            <li> and recently I have been trying to purchase more natural facial products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used everything from birth control pills to prescription-strength topical cream that totally dried my face out (and launched me into severe break outs as soon as I stopped using it) to homemade masks that felt nice but didn&#x27;t do much against my acne.</li>
            <li> I normally apply it after washing my face and before I moisturise.</li>
            <li> I have behind one ear from oxygen hose, and it appears to have done that a world of good with just one application.</li>
            <li> Still a good product, just broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> The shipping on it was kind of slow</li>
            <li> I think it does a good job of wiping off any dirt/grease and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or dry out my skin like more astringent facial cleansers and a little will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for sensitive to normal skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, and the rose scent calms me down.</li>
            <li> And the smell is completely artificial, very unnatural and too too strong!!!</li>
            <li> It smells good and suits me a lot, my skin is a little dry and mix.</li>
            <li> I have really oily skin, so using oils on my face seemed kind of silly to me, but before using this, I used a lot of hygiene products that had synthetic fragrances and chemicals in them, and they would dry my face out and during the day my face would secrete even more oil.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out your skin, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this witch hazel or the new face oil is the reason for my much improved skin, but I love this product.</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel is fine, so it&#x27;s some other ingredient that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  </li>
            <li> I ran out this week and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to throw out the bottle until the new bottle arrived in the mail, hoping I could eek out a few more skin nourishing</li>
            <li> but honestly you can get the same product at the dollar store for a lot less $$.  </li>
            <li> The rose scent is noticeably less, which is not a big deal</li>
            <li> Most toners make my skin feel dry and ashy, but this is a completely different product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easily twice the size of the BB version, and essentially the same ingredients!</li>
            <li> Recently, I decided to give it another shot, since now I use more makeup and did not want to dry my skin out with an alcohol-based toner.</li>
            <li> have combination skin with dry patches around my cheeks, and an oily t-zone, and let me just say--this product makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, but I love a toner with a slight fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My skin is too dry in the winter to use the toner without a moisturizer, but in the summer I might be able to use only the toner in the morning.</li>
            <li> Smell is delicate and pleasant and it does an knock-out job removing last traces of makeup.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS NOT HARSH, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL NICE AND IS NOT LIKE OTHER NAME BRANDS THAT COST BIG BUCKS.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any toners with alcohol in them and the ones I have tried that don&#x27;t have alcohol don&#x27;t seem any better than plain water.</li>
            <li> I went right back to Thayers</li>
            <li> but  Every once in a while one will sneak up, usually back to when I am not eating right.  </li>
            <li> I especially like to use it right before bed.</li>
            <li> The effect upon using is instant - there is a tingling sensation and the skin feels fresher, cleaner right away.</li>
            <li> My pores feel so clean, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all!</li>
            <li> As for the rest of my face...I have decent clear skin already, but this product has really added a natural, if you will, glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> I had read that for some skin types, soaps of ANY kind will create a never ending cycle of dried out skin followed by break outs (due to more oil being produced to make up for the dry skin).</li>
            <li> think it is a good toner, only not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organic ingredients really help to keep my skin tight and smooth.</li>
            <li> I went back to only useing it twice a day and my face is fine now.</li>
            <li> hot water, half a teaspoon of Thayer witch hazel, one tablespoon of coconut oil and a spoon of Dr Bronner&#x27;s mild baby soap.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very clean and does not feel harsh in any way.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets huge extremely itchy mosquito bites</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I notice any difference between this and regular witch hazel, but I am happy with it overall.</li>
            <li> After a few more minutes, my face was red, blotchy and hot to the touch.</li>
            <li> I will be searching for other products available from this seller.</li>
            <li> not bad, really, a little bit too floral for me at the first sniff, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same, high quality product I was purchasing locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this toner due to all the high reviews.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I was wondering if the product could live up to the reviews when it comes to oily skin (I&#x27;ve tried everything), but I put it to the test.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it as a new toner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And look out for the launch of our new site this month which will feature product reviews, treatment reviews and spa reviews.</li>
            <li> And look out for the launch of our new site this month which will feature product reviews, treatment reviews and spa reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s time to find new product for yourself.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> This IS my new toner.  </li>
            <li> I am new into witch hazel.</li>
            <li> but my skin cant live without this stuff..</li>
            <li> I live in Florida so makeup just melts off.</li>
            <li> This is the onyl new thing introduced to my face, as nothing in my diet or anything else has changed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> but I know she can&#x27;t live without the stuff.</li>
            <li> I thought it&#x27;s my allergic reactions to new product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these as new morning beauty routine for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim to try something new</li>
            <li> cleaned my face, used the new rosehip oil and and went to bed awhile after that and read for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super sketchy about what I put on my face, and reading other reviews I decided to try it, and it has cleared up so much of my skin</li>
            <li> Normally I would be hesitant to give a product, especially a beauty/cosmetic product, five stars, but I absolutely love this product, and I think it would be useful to many people and non-irritating/not a waste of money to people who end up not loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so soft and is going well with my new acne regimen!</li>
            <li> half the attractiveness of this product!(or use a sticker that will easily peel off )</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only ten dollars which is huge plus.</li>
            <li> As for the smell, if you don&#x27;t like heavy florals then I suggest trying a different kind.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it has been good, which means I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative effect from using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and clear and glowing and looks very</li>
            <li> It soaked up excess oils and dirt left behind from my clarisonic and smelled great.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is noticeable but subtle.</li>
            <li> The scent smells like an older woman&#x27;s perfume, so if you are sensitive to smell, this might be too over powering or bothersome.</li>
            <li> and I really think it&#x27;s helped my skin become less red and more even in tone.</li>
            <li> Its gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave any film behind on my skin, just a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The rose smell is less similar to an actual rose and more artificial, like grenadine.</li>
            <li> After I wash, I use Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and a few drops of tea tree essential oil on a cotton ball and swab my face.</li>
            <li> I think it has helped dry up any blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li> Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel has improved the texture of my facial skin in just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The rose smell is subtle.</li>
            <li> I gave myself a few days of not using the Rose scented one to give my face a break, but when I started using the unscented one, the same thing happened</li>
            <li> With no harsh chemicals, this gentle and naturally fragrant alcohol-free toner seems to truly improve the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> has helped my skin heal quickly and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Use:&lt;br /&gt;For use as a daily facial toner, makeup remover, light moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> with any skin regime, it is important especially for those with oily skin as such as myself to follow up with a moisturizer after using a toner.</li>
            <li> Not to mention super dry skin from the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the product for at least five years and it really has kept my skin in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> I give it only 4 stars because I am not a huge fan of the rose smell.</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser, as good as the expensive toners sold at make-up counters for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the smell at first (reminds me of elderly women) but got used to it quick.</li>
            <li> This is a second time purchase and the original bottle lasted us a super long time with daily use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this given the fact I couldn&#x27;t really see much real benefits to it, but boy am I glad I did!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling I normally do with other toners.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, also removes left over traces of make up.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive combination skin prone to irritation-related breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I know workers are very busy but please place sticker on another part of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Very unexpected, coming from a toner that I had never had any issues with.</li>
            <li> The smell takes awhile to get used to, but I like the idea that it&#x27;s a very natural product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this toner feels like water on the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I use it every morning on my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is totally different from any toner I&#x27;ve used before in that it is very, very gentle and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product every night and it has helped her teenage skin very much.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don;t feel irritated at all when using it, considering that I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> skin is very sensitive and this product has not irritated it one bit.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feels refreshed and very soft.</li>
            <li> I found this when I was searching for just the right natural pre-wedding skin care routine last year.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells great (very light), but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change since using this daily over the past week.</li>
            <li> Really great as far as witch hazel goes but its still a little harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to really clean my skin, and clear it up after coming back from a weeks worth of flying back and fourth to Florida and Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I put it on under my daily moisturizer, because my combination skin can get pretty dry in winter, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is actually very refreshing to add to my daily routine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received it a few days ago, started using it right away, it made my face feel tight, not the kind of \\&quot;tight\\&quot; that is \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Within days my skin has already started to clear up!</li>
            <li> I think it is helping my skin stay clear, too!  </li>
            <li> I woke up to clear skin!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are clearly stated on the bottle and have nothing that I can&#x27;t pronounce, stop hating people!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also anxious to try the lavender version :)</li>
            <li> First time tried this one felt stinging on the face then retried again the same.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to like this stuff as much as I do, it&#x27;s definitely the first thing I reach for when my face needs a refresher.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I look so young!</li>
            <li> Delicate for my sensitive skin and has a nice soft fragrance</li>
            <li> i found it in this all natural product!</li>
            <li> As long as the product does the job, it is worth using.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle).</li>
            <li> It works just the same as any other toner but feels smoother and better for your skin.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was taken back because I was used to the types of toner that would make my skin tingle.</li>
            <li> This doesnt smell like old lady!</li>
            <li> This is not a good replacement for the rose water toner issued to student of modeling schools.</li>
            <li> As a facial aftershave, this works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this product and will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Like it much better than my usual toner I&#x27;ve been using for years.  </li>
            <li> I was using regular witch hazel from the drug store, and boy, does this smell soooo much nicer!</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I also have a fine misting bottle that I mix half w/</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like using creme or gel based moisturizers because my skin is a bit sensitive</li>
            <li> They are so soft!</li>
            <li> theres no alcohol in this so it has a different feeling from other toners - you do need to use more liquid to cover your face compared to alcohol based cleaners - but that is not a show stopper.</li>
            <li> I picked up a bottle in my local health food store and a mere week later was astonished and very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It took me a year to get through the first bottle, and I&#x27;ve already repurchased the second.</li>
            <li> After I let her try it once, my 7-year old likes to steal into my bathroom and use it too!</li>
            <li> This toner stopped my breakouts completely!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, my face is glowing and soft!</li>
            <li> I found this product when I finished my first standard Walgreens witch hazel.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m pretty amazed at how well it actually works.</li>
            <li> first time I used it I went outside to run errands with my son.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if I love it yet.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: found this exact item for almost 3$ cheaper will go to GNC next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On my first use it made my face tingle almost burning, and I was very red.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and feelings refreshed!</li>
            <li> I poured this witch hazel into a small, travel-size spray bottle to use it as a refreshing spray.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this being an anti-aging product, but at 23 I figure it won&#x27;t hurt since you can never start too early!</li>
            <li> Definitely not Thayer&#x27;s, more likely some generic drug-store brand.</li>
            <li> just do not feel it is different or better than other things I use,</li>
            <li> Later my hands felt mildly hot and tingling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and love.</li>
            <li> I originally bought it as an astringent for my face, but I ended up getting a severe sunburn around the same time and this product actually helped a lot with my sun burn.</li>
            <li> feel it&#x27;s very affordable given the quality of the product as well; especially as compared to the more harsh distilled drug store varieties which lack the benefits of this formulation.</li>
            <li> It might seem a little strong when you first put it on (especially if you&#x27;re using a lot!)</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback by the strong smell</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not really an issue, the bottle is quite large and a phenomenal price, I forsee it lasting quite a bit, but after that I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> the smell is an artificial rose smell, which may not be for everyone, but others have remarked that it has that clean soap smell instead.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the subtle, natural rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have had acne and super oily skin since I was in middle school, and while its not usually as harsh as it was then, these last few months I have been breaking out even more around my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my already extremely dry skin and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing, softening, and gives you a serious glow that I can&#x27;t really explain.</li>
            <li> It moisterized my face instantly and calmed my skin after I clean my face with my battery operated facial brush.</li>
            <li> i use it as a facial toner on a daily basis and makes my face feel so clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit much, I was expecting it to be more subtle -</li>
            <li> so use to the other alcohol type of toners which are stronger and leave your face squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> Even without acne, it will improve your complection and clean and moisturize your skin without any harshness like other toners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but is very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle on face especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to discern long term effects, but I can only imagine good things.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was nice enough to start with, but it caused massive breakouts which only cleared up when I went back to using my homemade witch hazel toner mix.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the rose actaully does anything other than create a scent, but next time, I will try another scent of the same product.</li>
            <li> I love using witch hazel as a toner or to just clean my face off when I feel like it needs it, but the rose scent of this stuff is horribly overpowering.</li>
            <li> I looked for a long time to find something that was alcohol free with aloe vera in it that I could use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Prior to using this, my skin was pretty clear.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to Clinique as long as this product is still available.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few months and my complexion has improved greatly.</li>
            <li> I use it every day after cleansing my skin and it dries in a minute and absolutely does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not pleasant to apply to the face because of the grandmother-y rose floral scent.</li>
            <li> I really like that this product is alcohol-free, and that it does not dry out your skin or irritate your eyes.  </li>
            <li> The basic premise is that they can help clean out those last lingering bits of dirt and oil after cleansing your face (some people going so far as to argue that it \\&quot;restores the pH balance of your skin\\</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this leaves it fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> True to life rose scent and no smell of witch hazel, which IMO stinks.  </li>
            <li> first may make the skin appear red and sticky, but it completely goes away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> this is the first &#x27;natural&#x27; toner that I have tried and I&#x27;ll never look back.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using it on a sunburn you don&#x27;t want to peel, only take SHORT showers with cool water.</li>
            <li> The full chemical toners work much better unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually the first toner I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s kept my skin soft, reduced the size of my pores, and kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I have acne and oily skin, the scent for this product is way too strong, makes my skin very dry, I only used twice</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this toner helps me keep it clear without over drying.</li>
            <li> I have mature skin which is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have mature skin which is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively clean out the soap residue like other strong astringent toners I&#x27;ve used before, but it seems to perform just as well.</li>
            <li> not too strong, not too weak, just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily since I first purchased it, and hardly have any more breakouts these days.</li>
            <li> I have used other toners that make my skin scream for lotion afterwards but this one makes my face feel clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li> have been asking what am I doing differently because my skin is positively glowing.  </li>
            <li> I put it on as usual with a cotton ball and all of a sudden my face turned bright red and started to burn.</li>
            <li> My last bottle lasted me almost a year before I ordered my current bottle, and I use it pretty much every day</li>
            <li> This product is natural and FEELS natural!</li>
            <li> I have also used on legs and other areas to cool irritation and prevent ingrown hairs and it works well for that.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last very long anyway.</li>
            <li> but it is especially good in the winter when it&#x27;s cold and dry.</li>
            <li> I like this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Dickinson&#x27;s, which I can buy for less at local drugstores.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with some light acne marks, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I recommend using a cotton ball (consisting of the product) and going over your face lightly after your regular face wash/cleanser, or even if your skin is feeling oily, dry...</li>
            <li> This witch hazel stops my skin from feeling tight after being washed, and make my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This tonic is what I have been looking for rose is very hard to find .Very</li>
            <li> It made my skin very soft and actually changes the whole appearance of your skin.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type but without applying a lot of moisturizer after use, it would really dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> , my pores are a lot smaller and my favorite bit is that all my little blemishes/pimples have completely gone away!</li>
            <li> My skin is mostly normal (not very oily or dry), and it is very sensitive and clogs easily.</li>
            <li> I use three types of moisturizer at any given time, try a new shampoo every two weeks, and currently own at least 6 types of facial sunscreens.</li>
            <li> My face cooled down and stopped breaking out, but I started getting a fair amount of weird pimples and breakouts and ingrown hairs on my legs which very very very rarely</li>
            <li> /&gt;-To freshen up in general: When I have been particularly sweaty for whatever reason, I&#x27;ve put this on a tissue or and used it to freshen my face, underarms, cleavage, neckline, etc.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more even and clear, less acne especially around that time of the month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin,,, nough said!</li>
            <li> Just purchased at whole foods in Lexington Kentucky as I am a Flight attendant with eczema, severly sensitive dry skin and allergies.</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]], and finally I use Skingenixx Super Hydrating Moisturizer</li>
            <li> I use it daily after I wash my face with an organic purifying cleanser (no alcohol, no animal testing, pure fruit extracts).</li>
            <li> The large pores on my cheeks appear smaller as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would help with my large pores and oily skin, but It doesn&#x27;t have any real lasting effects that I can see.</li>
            <li> I have a problem where once I see my pores are smaller, I stop using it, and then see the large pores return</li>
            <li> (2) just get a cheap little travel bottle that squeezes (like $0.50 at REI)</li>
            <li> I also bought a little spray bottle on here - and have filled that too with this.</li>
            <li> With the help of cotton pads with those little scrubbers on one side, I&#x27;ve pretty much gotten rid of my blackheads that have plagued me since high school.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera in the solution keeps the skin from becoming too dry while the witch hazel helps dry up the weeping parts.</li>
            <li> The product DOES NOT have methylparaben and polysorbate 20 based on the picture of this product you click before it takes you to its page with an older picture and apparently ingredient list, and it is now completely natural and just uses vitamin E as a preservative.</li>
            <li> only nit picky little complaint is that a large sticker was placed on the product&#x27;s attractive vintage-style label,and when I tried to remove the sticker it tore away at the label.</li>
            <li> Took me a month to figure out why my skin started to break out more than it did and looked dull.</li>
            <li> Not acidic, so there is no typical sensation on the skin at all!</li>
            <li> Not for all skin types,  it smells good, but feels a little heavy</li>
            <li> I can see how some of the other reviewers might find the scent a bit strong, but I use a lot of essential oils now</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the right toner for a very long time, and this is it!</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t as gentle as I expected for my dry winter skin, I went with fresh floral toner instead!</li>
            <li> So far I love this Witch Hazel, its not like all the other that dry you out.  </li>
            <li> I had a huge rash from an allergic reaction the other day, then put this stuff all over it and, the next morning, my skin was very clear in comparison to the night before.  </li>
            <li> while this cleans my skin great and freshens me up when I&#x27;ve been all sweaty or dirty.</li>
            <li> It helped clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> Day 2 after I stopped using this product, my face was clear again.</li>
            <li> Leaves face smooth and makes a good base for applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I used recently and decided to let my 7 year old grandson try after feeling the gentle soothing product on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also tightens my pores and has helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a really  old old old stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the clear bottle Witch Hazel from Thayer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My skin glows and is clear</li>
            <li> clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of toners and use them every night to clear away residue from the day before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear (based on my diet as well) and not oily.</li>
            <li> This toner does not prevent or clear up acne; however it does tighten and hydrate skin after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin really clear and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s help clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> The water was clear and transparent at the beginning, but became unclear and milky after a while.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t clear up any of my skin issues.</li>
            <li> It clearly states that it is &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting this to help improve my skin, to clear it up and brighten it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve recently decided to switch to natural products to see what would happen since I really have nothing to lose.</li>
            <li> Working well as a toner to help clear my son&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Idk which one is helping making my face stay clear ...</li>
            <li> It has clearly been tampered with.</li>
            <li> It smells divine, makes my skin feel so soft, and I have noticed my skin is starting to look so much</li>
            <li> just so that&#x27;s clear.)</li>
            <li> I have never, ever had this clear of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clear my acne</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> As soon as I stopped using it, the pimples started to clear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product only about 2 weeks ago and really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using it 1-2 times daily after cleansing and it is doing a great job picking up things my cleanser leaves behind!</li>
            <li> and I do believe continued use of this will clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning after applying it at night, my skin looks clear with tighter pores.</li>
            <li> It keeps it moist and clear.  </li>
            <li> Feels soothing and soft on skin.</li>
            <li> it leaves it feeling soft</li>
            <li> My make up stays on so much longer when I use this prior to putting it on.</li>
            <li> I just made myself all natural face wash, toner and nightly serum</li>
            <li> I want her to use natural products like this as opposed to Clearasil (drying).</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> This toner doesn&#x27;t seem to help with breakouts but it soothes my skin and leaves it soft and moisturizerized after drying treatments.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars is that it is quite fragrant, which might be troublesome for those sensitive to fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural with certified organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I have to use a toner after washing my face, I just don&#x27;t feel complete without the smoothing effect a toner provides.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, but now my complexion is really starting to even out.</li>
            <li> So far I have used it to prep my skin for waxing, and as a astringent-</li>
            <li> Appears to be all natural from the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> Have been receiving compliments lately about my more youthful skin (38yrs now)</li>
            <li> Thayers makes my skin soft, evenly toned and</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin especially in T-zone area</li>
            <li> and I like it so far,</li>
            <li> I am not a user of toner, but this popped up when I was researching for hydration for my skin that was natural and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about natural skin products.</li>
            <li> So far this has done the trick</li>
            <li> Its all natural</li>
            <li> I came across this product at a a natural health foods store in the area.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much of an astringent effect from this, likely because it is the hydrosol and the &amp;</li>
            <li> my skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Desert Essence 100% Natural Jojoba Oil - use as moisturizer before bed</li>
            <li> I have been using it daily for approximately three months and have found it great for the following uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She is 68yrs old.</li>
            <li> Or to just use straight as a facial toner.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients this never irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> I have highly sensitive combination-type skin</li>
            <li> and I am very picky about the products I use (especially on my face).</li>
            <li> Since nothing else in my skin care routine has changed yet I determined it to be Thayers, probably because of the natural oils and tannins.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I wash my face, morning and night, and it leaves my skin toned but soft.  </li>
            <li> I really feel like it adds some moisture back into my skin after cleansing, even before I add a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And it really does work, the amount of gunk left on my face after washing</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft but not oily.</li>
            <li> This product is cheap, but not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Also, I have read about some of the natural healing qualities of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would be much gentler than regular witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> it seems in &amp;#34;my old age&amp;#34</li>
            <li> For reference I have oily/combination acne prone skin (also quite sensitive) and this toner works wonders without irritation.</li>
            <li> use this toner when I need a gentle product, such as post acid peel, post waxing or sunburn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> since we both have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Fixed my skin</li>
            <li> The scent, while not horrendous, is probably not something that sensitive noses will want to put up with.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this product, I was drawn to the all natural ingredients and lack of alcohol.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and sometimes have breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have pores on the larger side and using this twice a day has REALLY helped</li>
            <li> Natural and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain too much, but i will say this did clog my pores and give me tiny whiteheads...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural and</li>
            <li> Leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I think I developed a pimple using this because of its oily texture.</li>
            <li> The icing on the cake is that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> I have incredibly sensitive skin</li>

            <li> Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Florida in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to perfumes and fragrances you might want to skip this product.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> As far as toning don&#x27;t see a difference yet.. Been using for almost a month</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night and my skin is much softer after use and my poors do appear smaller.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural moisturizer-</li>
            <li> It leave my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> and when I use it on a regular basis it really does help minimize redness.</li>
            <li> but I  do like this one so far too soon to tell ifi</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot because it&#x27;s such a gentle toner</li>
            <li> I recommend this to others with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My pores have reduced in size and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of 70 year old cat lady&#x27;s house.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and hydrated throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Very happily surprised with this.</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading reviews about a natural toner.  </li>
            <li> This toner preserves the natural moisture</li>
            <li> I like it so far.</li>
            <li> But, better late than never.</li>
            <li> my skin felt soft soon after i used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so soft and hydrated without it getting oily from lotions and moisturizers.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Well this arrived early yesterday</li>
            <li> Now all I have are scabs from where the old blemishes are healed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is old school and legit.</li>

            <li> I have sensitive skin, but this does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> I had used one originally to help apply it, and it turned my towels into a splotchy mess.</li>
            <li> old skin so moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two bottles of this so far.</li>
            <li> Made my skin ultra soft.  </li>
            <li> still really like the smell and and am using it up on my legs for extra moisture.  </li>

            <li> if this is what natural products will turn out to be.</li>
            <li> and my face is particularly sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times so far as a night routine after cleaning.</li>

            <li> Fastest shipping so far</li>
            <li> Changed my acne and rosacia face to soft, clear and supple.  </li>
            <li> but the natural ingredients were the selling point for me.</li>
            <li> My face skin is really sensitive so it may tend to make me break out.  </li>
            <li> I still had really clogged pores while using this daily.</li>
            <li> And you&#x27;re set for a few hours of protected and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Will keep using it forever, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> and I am sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> In 5 days use my skin is tighter looks younger and is also getting much clearer.</li>
            <li> I have a very combination/oily skin type and this is the only product that I can use as needed without a fear of drying out my skin.</li>

            <li> but it feels so soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive.</li>
            <li> I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does.</li>
            <li> They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient.</li>
            <li> I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they</li>

            <li> My sensitive skin refuses to accept anything else.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this toner is an all natural product.  </li>
            <li> As far as improvements in my skin, I don&#x27;t see a lot of difference</li>
            <li> I will keep using it because I like having something natural to use underneath my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> In addition to making your skin feel refreshed, overtime the toner really does make your pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really working for me, only have to use soap maybe once a week.  </li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had to wash my face twice in order to completely remove the product from my face.</li>

            <li> Like the water so far.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lightly moisturizing, but not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have combination skin (sensitive and acne prone).</li>
            <li> It  does what it claims and is soothing on mature skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed considerable pore shrinkage</li>
            <li> And it seems gentle enough for the under-eye area.</li>
            <li> My skin became really sensitive</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> All natural</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s refreshing but not in the least bit drying.</li>
            <li> I now only use this and Cetaphil cleanser, which really seems to contribute to the improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what.  </li>
            <li> My 15 year old son swears by this for his acne.</li>
            <li> but no problems so far.  </li>
            <li> It is non drying, all natural</li>
            <li> Not harsh at all, either.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling soft, moisturized, and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Face feels soft after applying it, but the smell is that of a grandma style perfume.</li>
            <li> , I went back to Whole Foods and bought the alcohol-free, unscented toner.</li>
            <li> My face isn&#x27;t severely sensitive either,</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is ready for my next step on my regimen.</li>
            <li> A soft smell of rose...not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s is gentler and leaves my skin feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> but if you have sensitive skin, it will eventually happen to you.</li>
            <li> my face has never been clearer or so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a few days (as a toner) and already see fantastic results.</li>
            <li> purchased this product from Natural Grocers because they didn&#x27;t have Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel (the brand I used to use).  </li>
            <li> The product also showed a difference when my 56 year old mother used it</li>
            <li> This toner makes my skin soft without making it greasy, absorbs oil, and has dramatically improved the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> It does leave the skin feel soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My skin is also sensitive even with products that are labeled natural and don&#x27;t contain synthetic ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I no longer have to carry oil absorbing sheets with me daily.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and even.</li>
            <li> Reason why I use this is because I have supper sensitive skin</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> but once they do, my skin feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of my skin lately, and decided to try a toner.</li>
            <li> No burning because it is alcohol free and does not leave a sticky feeling residue behind, only smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> It helps to reduce aging and offers a detox of the your skin every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer this inexpensive alternative to the Proactive toner.</li>
            <li> It has no alcohol and has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin but saw the reviews for this toner.  </li>
            <li> AS FAR AS QUALITY IS COCERNED.  </li>
            <li> I am currently using the Thayers Cucumber toner (just to change up a bit) and i like the results on my skin but not so much the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s literally 100% natural and they even use organic ingredients..</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I dont see a difference in my skin, but I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> And lo and behold, rashes developed again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I am now 30 yrs old.</li>
            <li> I wanted to go natural, and amazon told me this was &amp;</li>
            <li> I am also vegan, so the fact that this is natural and doesn&#x27;t test on animals is an added plus.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this seemed to irritate it.</li>
            <li> My 24 year old daughter insisted I try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> No heavy residue.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because of its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is not harsh on my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order it again and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t sting my face at all, even in the sensitive blemished areas with acne.</li>
            <li> When I was young, one of my uncles always followed his shaves with Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> And WOW.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive and oily skin, so even if I put water on a cotton ball and rub it on my face, it will irritate me</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> , Works well if used sparingly for sensitive adult acne</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft without drying it out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft afterward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product now for nearly 3 months, and I fully attribute my clearer complexion to it.</li>
            <li> But, I can say it helps keep my skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I feel like it also helps my face feel completely cleansed after I wash my face, to prep for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> that it contains natural products like witch hazel.</li>
            <li> My face was SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells like roses, but roses kinda smell like old ladies to me.</li>
            <li> and I spray it directly onto my skin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft and has helped remove any excess dirt on the surface of my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft</li>
            <li> As a busy mom I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face.</li>
            <li> Simple ingredients, gentle on skin and works well.</li>
            <li> Use it directly after showering.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive baby skin, and almost everything burns.  </li>
            <li> No harsh stinging or dryness.</li>
            <li> With such a big bottle, its worth the price</li>
            <li> After going through a bottle of an expensive name-brand toner much faster than I would have liked, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to this , it may be a good product, but, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It is as good as those expensive brand names, but the price is 1/10 of them.</li>
            <li> People are claiming this is good for sensitive skin, but be wary it might not work for everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is very dry in Phoenix right now</li>
            <li> After using the whole bottle, I switched to another brand that was half the price, but it really made my face feel tight and dry and didn&#x27;t smell as nice.  </li>
            <li> I ALWAYS follow up my shave routine by rubbing this over my neck and face to cool down my skin and close the pores while cleaning out any gunk and residue I might have missed.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s a natural product doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe.</li>
            <li> And it is a third of the price, more natural, and bigger than any other supposed &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to go against what so many other reviewers have experienced (</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simple ingredients doesn&#x27;t mean you need more.</li>
            <li> Better than the other expensive store brands for me:))</li>
            <li> I packed a full new bottle in my luggage on the plane and when I got off, half the solution was gone!</li>
            <li> I needed something to clean my face with in the late afternoons when my face doesn&#x27;t feel so fresh without having to actually wash it.  </li>
            <li> The tingle, however, tends to dry a lot of people&#x27;s skin out and that was exactly what was happening with mine.</li>
            <li> Its much cheaper here than at Whole Foods and all the other health food stores</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face</li>
            <li> This is the final clean up of the deeply ground dirt and impurities, that even my facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t remove.</li>
            <li> a subtle rose instead of a fake perfume rose.  </li>
            <li> Well, turns out that is true because I have noticed less oil on my face.  </li>
            <li> I cracked open the new bottle I just ordered, and I&#x27;m positive they have changed the formula since I last purchased.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, neck and in the little crevices of my ear to get everything squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone and I had a few really tiny, expected breakouts for the first few days, but they went away quickly and my skin looks much better.</li>
            <li> To make application easier, I clean out an old moisturizer jar and put a stack of round gauze pads inside.</li>
            <li> I tend to breakout or have a lot of redness after shaving mainly because I have sensitive facial skin.</li>
            <li> It used to be dry, red, irritated and super peely.</li>
            <li> But I was so happy to be proven wrong!</li>
            <li> Facial masks usually leave some sort of residue, so it is great to remove the traces without being harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> However, when you feel the difference on your skin, you will realize exactly what I did---that it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra dollars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel for years instead of more expensive toners as I find it as effective, if not more so.</li>
            <li> Final thoughts are I have sensitive combination skin prone to rosacea and blackheads, and I wish I had known about this product, well, in high school.</li>
            <li> Less waste going on a cotton ball and more for my face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a 22 year old single mother of many pets, and a little accident prone.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry, sensitive skin (not helped by Colorado&#x27;s year-round low humidity), so I&#x27;ve always been a bit gun-shy of toners, because they&#x27;re usually full of alcohol and other stuff</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toner to say the least, I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find it.</li>
            <li> My skin is absolutely glowing, it has never been this soft or supple for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I love it, seriously.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt clean, firm and a bit dewey.</li>
            <li> And then, this year I came to the USA, and the first product I purchased for facial daily care is THAYER.</li>
            <li> Even after I stopped using the product, it took a while for my face to clear back up to normal.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and have had it for the past five months and FINALLY have to repurchase!</li>
            <li> Trial and error - guess I&#x27;m going back to my regular witch hazel (don&#x27;t fix what&#x27;s not broken!)</li>
            <li> I recommend starting out with using it only at night for the first week</li>
            <li> made me breakout even more, not sure if this is what happens at the beginning before actually improving but will not use again!</li>
            <li> I used to purchase the Burt&#x27;s Bees rosewater toner, but it is becoming harder and harder to find in stores, so I switched to this after reading Amazon reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it like a month but noticed the different the first week.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells pretty gross; it reminds me of rubbing alcohol mixed with some perfume to cover the smell (bearing in mind that it contains no alcohol).</li>
            <li> So be careful to read reviews about skin products when buying from amazon because it seems to be a pretty frequent mistake on their part.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it because it&#x27;ll last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very subtle rose scent is uplifting.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin with combination of oily and dry on certain areas on my face.</li>
            <li> I will never use another toner as long as I live!!</li>
            <li> For comparison, there are a lot of eye creams I cannot near my eyes without burning, stinging and/or swelling.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective: Allows a further cleansing of the skin, leaving it refreshed and comfortable, as opposed to stripped and tight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product and will be back for me!</li>
            <li> do not work for this company &amp; I have never given such high praise for anything I bought as Amazon.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t recommend high enough!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this little clear liquid that didn&#x27;t sting or burn at all had somehow left my skin this smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like no other toner I&#x27;ve ever used before!</li>
            <li> My skin has made a complete turnaround from being patchy and oily at the same time with random breakouts to being smooth, clean, and soft.</li>
            <li> So I ordered the cucumber toner a few days ago (even less harmful than rose one by the database website).</li>
            <li> Very large bottle, too, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is very fragrant, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very sad this product didn&#x27;t work out for my skin type because I read all these great reviews.</li>
            <li> Just use a light hand, apply with a cotton ball or round and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> It is more like a fresh natural flower smell rather than an artificial odor</li>
            <li> It is a good product, It personally did not strike me as amazing or horrible.</li>
            <li> if it takes some pink away, it definitely doesnt make it more pink which some stronger toners do.</li>
            <li> A bottle really lasts me a long time too</li>
            <li> I observed no negative reactions and it&#x27;s quite affordable as a toner for only $10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this was a completely different product as to a normal toner with alcohol.</li>
            <li> ; I&#x27;ve bought in the past has been mostly rubbing alcohol (incredibly harsh and drying) but this is the real thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different facial products - scrubs, masks, different face washes, astringents, toners, and so on - and none of that other stuff helped with the bumps.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the next morning my face was normal</li>
            <li> I normally use a regular witch hazel as an astringent</li>
            <li> i was so excited when my package arrived but the toner was not clear like i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> This toner is a lifesaver and has brought my skin back to its normal glow.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and really gets anything that&#x27;s left behind after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> It is mild and removes makeup your cleanser did not totally clean.  </li>
            <li> This morning I only had to put a small amount of BB cream and a very light amount of powder on my face (I am considering looking into home-making natural makeup as my next project).</li>
            <li> and I have to say that this is certainly helping it not be so dry.</li>
            <li> Also, \\&quot;The compound bergamottin is found in grapefruit, and when it interacts with certain enzyme systems in the body, it can prevent these enzymes from breaking down statins, which causes the drug to accumulate in high levels in the body.</li>
            <li> seems to calm it down.</li>
            <li> I use this product to calm my skin down when I&#x27;ve had a reaction to something</li>
            <li> and this seems to calm all that down.</li>
            <li> I notice it helps calm my skin down after I had been using Retin-A</li>
            <li> It has taken me years to figure out what is best for my skin, and for about a year I have been cleansing my skin with African black soap and then using a benzoyl peroxide acne treatment every morning and night, and still, I would have an average of 3-5 pimples every day, mostly small, but sometimes big.</li>
            <li> : the bottle is quite large, so what I do is pour some of this product into a smaller container for daily use, and keep the remainder refrigerated.</li>
            <li> Then, I started using it again and right away the big red rash came back.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most things usually irritate it and either make it dry out, burn, or itch, and this product causes none of that whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews on other sites with people stating the same problem - the fragrance was breaking them out because their skin was/is sensitive to most</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for an alcohol free toner to use on my acne prone skin which is often dry and irritated due to retin-a micro.  </li>
            <li> This product takes traditional witch hazel to a new level.  </li>
            <li> soothing; definite new medicine cabinet staple</li>
            <li> I get it from amazon only because I live in Alaska now and can&#x27;t find it in my town.</li>
            <li> Yes, your skin will feel tight without oil for the first few minutes, but the moisturizer is really important.</li>
            <li> It lasts for ages and it&#x27;s free from all those nasty chemicals and is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference in my skin yet, it&#x27;s only bee a few days since I started using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much either.</li>
            <li> At least get the easy off stickers</li>
            <li> I did notice that the scent of this particular bottle was much stronger than of those I had previously used.</li>
            <li> ~the toner is very moist for the dry skin.</li>
            <li> My nose gets really oily yet my cheeks get really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I also use after shower, as a moisturizer, keeps my skin very moist and helps with dry skin ( use before lotion or oil).</li>
            <li> What really suprised me was that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have older skin which is fairly dry and sensitive.</li>
            <li> it is much milder than another brand have found that using it daily both prior to putting on my make up and again after to set it.  </li>
            <li> , two months later I still occasionally have a zit or two, but my complexion is much clearer and my acne scars seem to be fading somewhat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the gauntlet of facial creams, washes, and pills-- including Acutane which left my face chronically dry in some spots and super oily in others.</li>
            <li> I sometimes just use the witch hazel to give me that fresh feel after running around for half the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through bottles and bottles of this - it always leaves my skin feeling fresh and a slightly hydrated before I continue with the rest of my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> The only issue that I have (which really isn&#x27;t an issue) is that if you are traveling, I would suggest moving the product to a different container because it will leak.</li>
            <li> I noticed some complained about the scent being too strong.  </li>
            <li> have really good skin (only because I&#x27;m obsessed with taking care of</li>
            <li> I quickly realized what I&#x27;d been missing.</li>
            <li> I normally hate anything scented, but the fragrance is nice and light.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this as a toner than more expensive brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at a lot of Makeup Tutorials &amp; Beauty Trends on YouTube, &amp; one YouTuber mentioned that she has very sensitive skin (I do also) &amp; has to use a specific type of Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> The alcohol-based toners make my face even more oily after initially making it tight and dry.  </li>
            <li> Used it only once so far, but it smells divine!</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve started using this in 2014, I&#x27;ve seen a major reduction in pore size, skin elasticity, and youth.</li>
            <li> I have not heard any complaints or comments, so apparently it works!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in her facial cleansing routine and WOW!</li>
            <li> This product is familiar to me as my mother and grandmother and great-grandmother used it in the past.</li>
            <li> I have noticed such a difference in my sensitive skin since using this!</li>
            <li> I have only tried this product for my daughter&#x27;s acne last night, but the fact that she allowed me to apply it to her face AGAIN the following night is promising!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using plain rose water for a few years but decided to try this one when I read about the decrease in pore size.</li>
            <li> My skin feels fresh and tight.</li>
            <li> Makes my face really calm...not dry at all!</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling clean and toned without that dry cracking feeling you sometimes get with other products.  </li>
            <li> I recently completely revamped my skincare routine and this along with the other products I purchased has really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to diss all you fabulous 60+ ladies, but this does have that typical smell that one would describe &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; mainly because it smells SO much like roses.</li>
            <li> A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other toners such as Weleda, &amp; Michael Todd True Organics.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic change or anything, but it&#x27;s so far one of my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> I took one star off because I find it leaves a mild film and slight shine on my skin, but since I use it at night it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> Even as I&#x27;m getting older my skin still breaks out sometimes and regular facial moisturizers clog my pores.</li>
            <li> nothing artificial or super strong).</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, so I try to use products that have natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was a little unsure if I should try the rose scented witch Hazel over my usual aloe</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to my friends and family and therefore I highly recommend to anyone currently using regular witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a product that would take away my greasy italian shine and</li>
            <li> I previously had light acne around my hairline due to my bangs, and it has cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li> This is a really large container of toner that seems like it is going to last a really long time!</li>
            <li> It was twice as expensive but this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and see a difference in my skin tone and general skin health.</li>
            <li> and my complexion is generally clearer.</li>
            <li> Month Later: I have lowered my use to once a day, at night, to clear away any excess dirt or makeup that was overlooked by the makeup remover + face wash.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell really</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it really helps fight acne which I have a bit of</li>
            <li> I have to use about 6 cotton balls until they come back clear.</li>
            <li> One of these bottles lasts me at least 2-3 months, so the price is actually pretty reasonable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took over 2 months to clear the rashes, and even after my skin was healed the blemishes and tiny blotches still remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does the job of witch hazel but actually soothes my skin and leaves my skin soft and feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> it may not suit Asian sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is pretty big for a toner so it will last for a long time</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and try to stay as natural as I can with facial products.</li>
            <li> My sensitive skin often stings after a regular toner</li>
            <li> As a 63 year old male I started to see the wrinkles develop.</li>
            <li> My older skin isn&#x27;t dry, but it doesn&#x27;t need anything that will make it that way.</li>
            <li> I have seen a big difference with how soft my skin feels and how my acne is clearing up.</li>
            <li> Although so far I don&#x27;t see my skin has any different.</li>
            <li> It has natural moisturizers instead of 100 different chemicals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I expected and works really well at removing excess dirt and makeup that my face wash misses.</li>
            <li> Since I was 14&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of Clinique&#x27;s toner for combination/oily skin, which seems to do all the things I want, but the alcohol strips my skin of its natural oils and can make my face red and blotchy.</li>
            <li> So I drew short straws in the skin department and have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> I am a big skeptic - but this stuff won me over, completely.</li>
            <li> It is thorough enough to tone, but offers moisture to the beard .</li>
            <li> I like the old fashion look with the label you can read through the back of the bottle.</li>
            <li> All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]]</li>
            <li> This toner has left my skin so soft and moist, all while controlling my acne.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I&#x27;m a white man in my early 30&#x27;s, for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apparently have an allergy to witch hazel, so I gave this to my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Caucasian, sensitive skin, occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a toner to pamper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Finally found an all natural product that cleans, moisturizers, and shrinks pores without making my face shiny or greasy.</li>
            <li> especially for sensitive skill</li>
            <li> The facial lady also told me it&#x27;s sensitive,</li>
            <li> So far I have only used this 3 times, and I like it.  </li>
            <li> Busy with my second bottle and cannot think of a reason to switch to another product.</li>
            <li> My main concern was that it would dry or crack my skin</li>
            <li> I mainly use this product after I wake up in the morning because it&#x27;s keep my skin from being overly dry.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> Big wow for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can barely see it now.</li>
            <li> Natural Hawaiian Facial Cleanser Pineapple Enzyme&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use this (natural) over those acne toners that have alcohol and different chemicals.</li>
            <li> Dab the cotton balls until they&#x27;re wet and rub gently on your face.</li>
            <li> This is natural, has vitamin E, and moisturizes my skin enough to not have to use a lotion/cream type moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This was unusual for me as I&#x27;d never really had issues with my skin.</li>
            <li> So if your sensitive to smell i would actually recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin but can use this daily without drying.</li>
            <li> you will no regrets with it at all.</li>
            <li> Its barely been a month</li>
            <li> I used this in combination and woke up the next morning with baby soft skin that lasted through the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 years old and up until recently struggled with hormonal cystic acne.</li>
            <li> fast and arrived as expected</li>
            <li> Removed the seal on the cap,the inner seal as well, then twist the cap back the normal way.</li>
            <li> I usually use Biore and liked it but felt like it dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this toner &amp; find that with my oily skin it doesn&#x27;t make it worse (or really better).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always avoided toners because most have alcohol - something that makes my skin worse, but that didn&#x27;t keep me from searching for one.</li>
            <li> Also, the rose scent is not overpowering and usually disappears after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just addicted to this and how it makes my skin feel, and I know I will have to buy more when I run out,</li>
            <li> Fake rose smell</li>
            <li> I got the shipment in time - however the top cap was broken.</li>
            <li> but I am sure there are worse things to smell like.  </li>
            <li> It really smoothes out my skin, gets rid of blemishes, nourishes my skin, and it smells lovely, not like most nasty alcohol-based toners.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made my oily areas better, but it hasn&#x27;t made them worse</li>
            <li> This smell is not like fake rose smell which lots of stuff have.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice though and doesn&#x27;t have any unnatural, weird ingredients...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to those who want to use a toner, but don&#x27;t want their skin stripped dry.</li>
            <li> I ran out of it within 20 days due to my large amount of usage every day.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling a little tight, not my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am a 34 y/o African American with blemish and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> bought this toner at Whole Foods just because it was the most pleasant-sounding witch hazel product at Whole Foods, and I felt like splurging given my breakouts, and I was tired of using rubbing alcohol on my face throughout finals that has most likely been a bad decision for my skin and wanted something else.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been 4 days and my skin is almost back to being fully clear!</li>
            <li> It seems to keep my face from getting dry like it normally gets.</li>
            <li> When I use it regularly I notice my skin looking smoother and my giant pores looking more subtle.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m um... &amp;#34;middle aged&amp;#34; and my skins tends to be normal to dry).</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my skin felt a bit odd afterwards -</li>
            <li> Frist, I have normal to dry skin tone.</li>
            <li> However, since moving to the Pacific Northwest, my skin has been dry and flaky, unresponsive to my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> Has worked better than any other toner in the past.</li>
            <li> I use as a quick face wash that I keep on my nightstand for lazy nights.</li>
            <li> I followed quickly with my usual moisturizer and voila.</li>
            <li> I do still experience breakouts using this toner, but I usually have to follow with a mild acne cream regardless of what toner I use.  </li>
            <li> I am too lazy to wash my face so this is a quick way to get it done.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very faint but pleasant.</li>
            <li> I could easily go without  any other product after this,because this one gives me a little bit of moisture.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, but this paired with a chemical-free soap by Out Of Africa (began using both at the same time) has really cleared up my skin...and even helped with diminishing blackheads on my nose and chin that I have never had much luck with getting out.</li>
            <li> not that squeaky, shiny clean astringent normally leaves behind.</li>
            <li> is a decent size of bottle, it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, makes me skin feel really soft and helps to diminish the little acne bumps on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I do think it is a little expensive, but I am happy with  my purchase.  </li>
            <li> It also copes very well with other types of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see as much improvement as other people did in their skin, but I was using a million products.</li>
            <li> This really seemed to do something because it doesn&#x27;t stink and have that salty, briny smell that other witch hazels have.</li>
            <li> I also like peppermint, non-sticky hand sanitizer spray in general but that is only minimally related to keeping your face clear by keeping your hands clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have using this for a few days now, and I think I already see a little difference, my skin feels softer and has a healthy glow to it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much of it other than a mild irritation that the paper portion of the label was wet and ruined.</li>
            <li> Not a single breakout</li>
            <li> My kids even live using it, esp during winter months when it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommendations: For anyone looking for a general toner that covers all your bases, I would recommend this one due to its low costs and large quantity.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not very expensive compared to other products.</li>
            <li> I am a young adult in my early 20&#x27;s and started looking for something that was not going to strip my face dry like rubbing alcohol because my face is started to get dry during the winter months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this toner sometimes irritated my skin and left red splotches on my face.</li>
            <li> (only been about 2 weeks now) to see if my overall redness goes away completely.</li>
            <li> I was using Apple Cider Vinegar to reduce my acne scars and help get rid of my cystic acne,  but once I bought this toner, my face not only brightened, but so far, no extra cystic acne!  </li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin like alcohol-based toners.</li>
            <li> (I can see the makeup and dirt on my cotton pad) and my skin does feel tighter and refreshed, but not dry.</li>
            <li> but I personally like the faint rose smell of this product</li>
            <li> It does not dry up my skin.</li>
            <li> It does not contain alcohol, and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This will not dry your skin and leaves it feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> this toner does not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> My face is not dry.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin, or sting at all.  </li>
            <li> not dry the skin at all.</li>
            <li> This toner will not dry out your face like the Tea Tree toner.</li>
            <li> I usually hate having to use products, but I really enjoy this toner, and I love using it.</li>
            <li> Also, it keeps my face nice and soft during this cold winter times in NY.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and it does remove left behind dirt well.</li>
            <li> have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, not dry, oily or combination</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It helps my pores shrink and my face dose not dry out.</li>
            <li> and it does not dry it.</li>
            <li> Does not dry your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still confused as to what a toner is actually used for, but I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It does not dry the skin out and helps your skin to feel refreshed and hydrated.</li>
            <li> It did not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my face with the hopes that it would help with the glow effect so face would not appear dull; however I used it for my face after washing and didn&#x27;t notice any type of glow or anything special.</li>
            <li> However, Burt&#x27;s bee toner made my skin a little irritated if i used it right after facial exfoliation or waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped calm down large breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t make existing acne worse at all.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to this tonic permanently as my toner because my skin is very sensitive and dry during winter months.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use toner&#x27;s which contains alcohol as it dries up my skin resulting in dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It tightens my pores right up and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like any other toner would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell a little funny; my boyfriend says I smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it caused me a little breakout.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who tries it.</li>
            <li> it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion, helps with large pores, treats acne, and helps with various other skin conditions.  </li>
            <li> My face feels clean and refreshed with absolutely no drying or tight feeling after.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say other than the fact that it&#x27;s the same price as more expensive products available at the mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried countless other products (Proactiv, Murad, Neutrogena, and Clean and Clear just to name a few) with no luck.</li>
            <li> But after a few days I noticed that my face was more oily than usual and within 5 days of using this product, I had a major breakout that I could not control.</li>
            <li> Whenever I&#x27;ve had a breakout, it has helped reduce the size and redness of blemishes overnight, and made them feel less hot and irritated instantly.  </li>
            <li> If my skin feels oily during the day I will quickly wipe over my face with this and have instant oil slick relief.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very dry skin, live in New England, and have forced hot air for heat</li>
            <li> Make sure you keep the cap closed however because fruit flies will randomly appear out of nowhere and gravitate towards this bottle haha.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work really well, but it also doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, like other toners I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has also helped immensely with acne, seeing as I haven&#x27;t really gotten any other than one or two zits every now and then</li>
            <li> Some areas (specifically my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone), are very oily and acne prone, while other patches of my skin are extra dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I remember it being prime not long ago.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin sooo soft and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Finally I fell back on the old standard, witch hazel</li>
            <li> I tried going back to regular witch hazel just to save a few bucks, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this... Tried it for a few days and it doesn&#x27;t have the tightening and toning effect I expected.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know exactly when the trouble started, but after having the product maybe a couple of months, I began noticing that it was giving me a rash.  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra few bucks than regular witch hazel.</li>
            <li> yet this has no ill affects on my at all, it&#x27;s not drying or harsh.</li>
            <li> Just beware the first few days if you skin&#x27;s on the temperamental side.</li>
            <li> I figured putting it on a cotton ball first is a waste of both cotton and solution.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already reordered this a few times since I first tried it months ago</li>
            <li> Well, in the expensive all organic deli near my house, I found this brand as the only one that wasn&#x27;t full of alcohol and paraben, but it was so expensive I couldn&#x27;t bear to buy it even though I read online that it was a good one.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry area, so I stopped washing my face in the morning</li>
            <li> I immediately grabbed my other bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner that I spent barely $4 on at the local Target store and sure enough, there is a slight alcohol</li>
            <li> Not to drying and when used after makeup removal it really gets down in your pores to get the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry during the winter time, but this toner is very soft and moisture.  </li>
            <li> Just washing your face &amp; going straight to the serum is a major waste of serum.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought this product due to its 12 oz size since it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Other than that it seems to be a decent product.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t sting at all, in fact it&#x27;s kinda hard to believe that it&#x27;s a toner, but I&amp;#34;m trying it for the first time and so far it hasn&#x27;t irrated my skin or increased my break outs.. which is a</li>
            <li> I have now divorced Lancome, Clinique and every other high priced skin toner.  </li>
            <li> Unlike toners I have tried in the past that dry out my skin, this one leaves it clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use this toner any day over the acne toners that dry my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is slightly cheaper on Amazon than Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> My mom uses it on her mature, dry skin and likes it as well.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin</li>
            <li> This natural toner is alcohol-free so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry skin and makes it feel soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using this, my skin has gotten a lot less dry/red - would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I previously used witch hazel but the smell became too much</li>
            <li> This product has made my skin so soft, I no longe have dry patches.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that has a tendency to be quite dry and</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and after cleansing my face with a cream cleanser by purity I used a cotton ball to remove any traces of makeup and my skin didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; or dry after use.  </li>
            <li> I then allow it to dry completely.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my skin will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> A few days later, I decided to give it another chance thinking the first time I may have been a chemical reaction with my foundation/moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this witch hazel because it does not dry out your skin</li>
            <li> and I am glad this might have saved me from a few small scars.</li>
            <li> Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap - use to wash face twice daily</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle that does the job almost as well as my super expensive brands.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a hot mess!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge difference in my skin, perhaps a little less breaking out, but I cannot say that it&#x27;s from using this item.</li>
            <li> I sound like a bad commercial, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> The top spout is small enough to let out trickles, so you don&#x27;t waste toner by oversoaking.  </li>
            <li> After washing my face with either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castile Soap or Dr. Woods Black Soap, I take a cotton pad, liberally squirt on the Thayers Witch Hazel, rub the cotton against the solid sea salt bar and use it as a facial toner and as a toner to eliminate razor bumps after shaving.  </li>
            <li> are the reason I have clear skin (I&#x27;ve been struggling with slight adult acne).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as drying as my previous witch hazel that had alcohol in it and makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> IF YOU ARE A BIT SENSITIVE TO SCENTS, BE WARY THAT IT MAY BE STRONG TO YOU.</li>
            <li> Soothing and gentle, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using it either.</li>
            <li> Worth ten times more than other expensive brands !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other fragrances are available.  </li>
            <li> I ended up breaking out after three days of use which is not normal for me as an adult or even in my younger years.</li>
            <li> I bought this particularly for the dark circles I have around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The problem is it was delivered in a plastic bag inside a box, which would have been fine except the lid was broken &amp; lost some of the product inside plastic bag.</li>
            <li> It smells like roses too which is an added bonus for your pretty little face!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I am late 20s and have combination oily skin and have typically only used Clinique products (or other high end skin care lines i.e. Origins, FRESH,</li>
            <li> I have very dry and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it makes a real change in my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs or other side effects.</li>
            <li> This product causes little to no irritation and I feel is really helping my skin while reducing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It smells a little bit too much for me</li>
            <li> I ran out of my other toner and was looking for a new one</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dry skin but found that witch hazel would dry my skin out and it would take a couple of days for my skin to return to normal.</li>
            <li> final advice is, sensitive skin, oily skin, dry skin, what have you, try it!</li>
            <li> He had a small bit of sun exposure around neck and on face, very gentle.</li>
            <li> After &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; my face I put a little on a cotton ball and gently go over my entire face.</li>
            <li> After i had severe troubles due to new cosmetic, i had to stop make up and should put only toners.</li>
            <li> I have always been very hesitant to apply toner after cleansing, due to my extremely dry patch around my mouth/chin area.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on how it made my skin feel and it seem to make the acne and other imperfections disappear.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn’t good or bad.</li>
            <li> and of course watching tons of videos of people who have good and bad experiences with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is going to sound stupid, but the graphics on the bottle were the primary attraction.  </li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t have in common with the MA brand is alcohol, which is a very drying ingredient, both for the face and natural hair brushes.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but love knowing that something I use twice everyday is likely going to slow the aging process of my skin.</li>
            <li> we will see nice price I hate spending much on toners</li>
            <li> Sure, that could partially be due to genetics; however, I like to think that my proactive skin care activities help facilitate what might be blocked from naturally occurring if I used those expensive large department store, brand name, cosmetics with harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find affordable vegan-friendly beauty products, so I was really lucky to stumble upon this.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that an expensive product does not always mean that it yields the best results.</li>
            <li> Also, Amazon was stupid enough to put their sticker RIGHT on top of the paper label for the product.</li>
            <li> I still have half a bottle left (it lasts a long time) but will absolutely be ordering again and again, and again.</li>
            <li> Aside from the breakouts, old scars were fading, dark circles under my eyes looked lighter and less puffy, and I did like leaving the bathroom smelling of roses, but it would be a really strange catch-22 to use something that&#x27;s helping remove old scars but replacing them with new ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> less acne, small pore size, and a even light up skin color.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin that only gets oily (slightly) in the t zone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything, but combined with moisturizer, it keeps my face very hydrated with no dry patches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other toners but they were all too drying and left my skin red and sensitive.</li>
            <li> My skin is slightly on the dry end and gets dryer with certain, unfavorable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The dark spots are gone and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new breakouts yet.</li>
            <li> If I wore makeup I use my regular Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to get the mascara and heavy stuff off, and then use a little Shea Moisture African Black Bar Soap on my Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It surely doesn&#x27;t feel bad, at all, it is a good/ decent</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may take your skin a few days to adjust to this - particularly if you currently do not use a toner.</li>
            <li> I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products.</li>
            <li> Pimples and small bumps have completely disappeared and red marks from old acne scars seem to be improving.</li>
            <li> I have allergic reaction to chemicals in other products but this product has showed no adverse reaction on my skin so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for about a month now in combination with some other natural products.</li>
            <li> After 4 days of the other stuff I decided to also throw in this toner and wow, I felt and saw a difference.  </li>
            <li> Feels soft unlike any other toner I&#x27;ve used when I put it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it would be, and I only use a squeeze or two at one time, so this is going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The absence of alcohol makes this a soothing toner.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and have always struggled with small areas of dry, uneven skin on my forehead and cheeks, and blackheads on my nose and chin, but now I was seeing more blackheads and bigger dry patches, in addition to redness all over my face.</li>
            <li> which will probably been in another month and a half, max.&lt;br /&gt;This, along with my new Olay Pro-X Brush, CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer, and</li>
            <li> Already i see a huge dramatic change in my skin.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my face it usually tingles in the areas on my face that are usually very oily, the tingle ends pretty quickly and isn&#x27;t really uncomfortable more just unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It is not a strong, long lasting or perfumey scent, but it is definitely very rosy.  </li>
            <li> Before, I had tried so many expensive toners, but most of them only leads me to a big disappointment and</li>
            <li> My supposedly long lasting 15-h foundation only lasts 2 hours before melting</li>
            <li> While not a very masculine smell, I actually like the rose-petal scent.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this for anyone suffering from acne and/or uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> It can get pretty hard to get it in stores where I&#x27;m from.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, less oily and pores looks smaller now.</li>
            <li> Was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water Toner but saw this and decided to try it as it is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a little annoyed with Amazon&#x27;s ingredient list of this product because it is completely different from the list off the bottle from Whole Foods that is the exact same product and off Thayer&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> Clear my dark spots .</li>
            <li> Not sure how much it has helped my skin&#x27;s health.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this toner which speaks volumes seeing as I am a &amp;#34;gotta try everything out there at least once&amp;#34; type of gal and seeing as there is so much out there, I often never buy something for a second time.  </li>
            <li> usually wash my face with a gentle cleanser and then apply the witch hazel with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> will continue to buy this as long as ingredients stay the same.</li>
            <li> But the effect cannot last long.</li>
            <li> I use it as a facial toner but also for minor cuts and scraps.  </li>
            <li> I use this every morning and the bottle will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The bottle should last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> If you try this, I suggest only trying in a small area at first as a control and compare to similar other area to see how it works.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long, kinda hoped it would.</li>
            <li> Helps with keeping my skin moisturized and also helped me control the sudden adult acne breakouts that I suddenly started to experience a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> pour some Witch Hazel on a cotton pad until the pad is soaked and just wipe it around my eyes, since I only apply some minor eye make-</li>
            <li> and i can feel my skin tighten and to think that I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 weeks, imagine what it can do to my skin in the long run...</li>
            <li> Out of the long list of products I&#x27;ve tried over the years this is the only one that has remained a part of my skincare regimen since my teens.</li>
            <li> itll last me a long time.</li>
            <li> I do have a feeling that this will last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Remember the old cat lady down the street when you were growing up?  </li>
            <li> Use it anytime I feel that my skin&#x27;s a little oily throughout the day, and it never causes me to break out (and I have very sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li> While I have oily skin this will clear it up and last for a little while</li>
            <li> The toner leaves my face feeling soft instead of dry like other toners do.</li>
            <li> Even though I use this stuff every time I work out (about 8-10 times a week), I can tell that this is going to last me a long time!</li>
            <li> This product is not available in the area where I live.</li>
            <li> This is definitely something I will use for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to keep my facial routine as natural as possible, washing with raw honey and using alba botanica&#x27;s aloe&amp;green tea oil-free moisturizer, but I decided that I wanted to use a toner.</li>
            <li> I wash, occasionally use a clarisonic or exfoliant, dry, and follow with soaked cotton and toner.</li>
            <li> reading the full ingredients listed on the bottle I found that it contains grapefruit seed extract (I seriously don&#x27;t know how I missed this fact when reading the product details!</li>
            <li> my pores were refined and the black heads were nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, red or peeling at all.</li>
            <li> B0013OFRUK Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen]]</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry after using it, compared to regular witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Its totally acne prone at the t-zone and dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> A long-forgotten facial treatment is witch hazel on a cotton ball to cleanse and refresh the complexion, no matter if oily or dry.</li>
            <li> but my face is definitely a combination of dry and oily patches.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin even with regular usage</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone combination skin and for the dry spots on my face, it doesn&#x27;t quite moisturize them enough.</li>
            <li> FINALLY  a toner that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  </li>
            <li> A whole bottle should last me 6 months at least.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave you dry, it actually moisturizes my skin and makes it glow!</li>
            <li> I love that all the ingredients are simple, there are not fillers or crazy sounding chemicals.</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of facial toners but my skin would dry up.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it helps with acne since I don&#x27;t normally break out, but I do get my occasional zits, however after I started using this in my skin routine</li>
            <li> apply some of this on toilet paper and wipe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cleansing and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight afterwards like a lot of other toners.  </li>
            <li> but it is very sensitive, prone to breakouts and uneven tone.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple develop since I started it, the bumps are shrinking and vanishing, and I feel like I&#x27;m actually taking care of the skin that I have.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the witch hazel used in this formulation is pure and not the watered down decoctions typically used in cheaper (Wal-Mart and dollar store brand) types.  </li>
            <li> I had been having alot of trouble with adult acne, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that worked without overdrying my skin~until this!</li>
            <li> I use when my face feels tired, it just brings the color right back.</li>
            <li> The rose smell made me sick after the second use and I didn&#x27;t see the results I had when using the Thayer witch hazel-lavendar.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and tight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to give this another chance but it made my face seriously break out after two uses.</li>
            <li> It has always been embarrassing, especially since other people have actually asked me about the bumps.</li>
            <li> After cleansing I use this prior to my other facial products.</li>
            <li> Though I cannot really tell if it&#x27;s working, ( i have this issue with other toners ), i use it everyday</li>
            <li> It is more expensive than some of the other comparable witch hazel toners.  </li>
            <li> If your skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive, I&#x27;d recommend it, but otherwise you may want to stick to plain witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I would agree, smelling from the bottle directly could be a bit of a head rush, but a little dabbed onto a cotton ball</li>
            <li> some results after just a few days of use, but as I continue to use it the results are more dramatic.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (you know that feeling after using a product where your face feels so dry that you need moisturizer in order to relieve the tightness?)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, dry skin with a few outbreaks now and again, and since using this product my face isn&#x27;t as red and the outbreaks are few and far between.</li>
            <li> After first use, I felt like it was a little too harsh with my cetaphil, so I tried it with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is not strong smelling like other witch hazel, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> I know my pores are tightened, and I like it to leave my skin enough natural oils so that it doesn&#x27;t work extra hard to replace them and thus make my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> I used rose body lotions before and never feel this bad.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and helps my acne be not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> After a fiasco involving a tea tree oil cleanser, My sensitive skin was left with painful, huge zits all over my face.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well for homemade bug repellent.</li>
            <li> it really masks the generally icky smell of witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Not to sound weird</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care for the smell but at least I don&#x27;t smell like alcohol</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cleans dirt off of my skin, it&#x27;s satisfying to see the dirty cotton ball and know that dirt is no longer on your face!&lt;br /&gt;On par with Humphrey&#x27;s Witch</li>
            <li> I love using this with cotton balls, AFTER I&#x27;ve washed my face, or anytime during the day my skin feels dirty, oily, itchy, etc.</li>
            <li> It has also helped clear my forehead acne, and minimize acne scars and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy it again once it runs out, go back to my old product, or go with another product the Amazon search has helped me find.</li>
            <li> Or when I see a pimple coming in, I soak a cotton ball and use a band-aide to keep it on the pimple for a few hours and it helps to clear it up faster.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> When I flew back I was careful and tried to saran wrap the bottle opening before screwing on the cap.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but my face and skin has really improved only after using it for just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I am finishing the bottle because I already spent my money on it, but I so wish I could have it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not worried if I forget my face lotion from time to time as long as I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> Also helps with minor sunburns, cleaning off makeup, and toning face after shower.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone to try (as long as you don&#x27;t dislike the smell of roses).</li>
            <li> I plan to use this for a long time as it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Hope this product will be around a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was prompt, actually earlier then expected.</li>
            <li> I use it all year long</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try because I haven&#x27;t used toner in a long while</li>
            <li> It is so soothing and moisturizing, and it keeps my skin soft in the harsh winter months.</li>
            <li> will use long term but we will see.</li>
            <li> , I just wish I had started using it a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> Why did I wait so long to buy THIS??</li>
            <li> I bought it to reduce my pores, and it seems like it did to a minor degree.   </li>
            <li> They are expected to last around 3 months.</li>
            <li> I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning.</li>
            <li> It cleans and lessens the appearance of my pores and cleans, refreshes, and moisturizes my face after a long day.</li>
            <li> and I hope this product has not done long term damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> I havent used this product for long</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy as long as amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> But, I do see results in how my skin appears, although minor.  </li>
            <li> will repurchase for a long time.</li>
            <li> I get eczema on my face if I am out in the sun too long or get too stressed, and this does not bother my eczema in any way.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: when I got this the bottle was pink and had a lady on it, now it&#x27;s smaller and has some sort of burley man?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite concentrated and one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals and they&#x27;re natural remedies.</li>
            <li> (I wish I had this on hand all winter long) and</li>
            <li> I know witch hazel is good for your skin, but really hate the smell.  </li>
            <li> Like the other 1-star reviews on here, after using it for about a week I broke out severely (small and large pimples all over my face) and my face is oilier than it&#x27;s ever been.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me this did absolutely nothing!!!</li>
            <li> I even use this in the harsh, dry winter and my skin is still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I noticed the leftover impurities left on my skin continued to be less as I continued to use it daily.</li>
            <li> (At this point I&#x27;m convinced I look ten years younger, but it&#x27;s been less than a week</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and sensitive and it neither dried out my skin nor irritated it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything for my skin yet, but at least it smells wonderful (and isn&#x27;t doing anything bad!).</li>
            <li> (After one month, I barely used half the bottle.)</li>
            <li> More often than not, wearing makeup - even supposedly moisturizing makeup - leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a much drier, hotter climate with very hard water.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin which toner usually burns</li>
            <li> trapped inside the fine lines which always makes the lines look worse.</li>
            <li> I have crazy sensitive skin that breaks out if you even look at it wrong, so this stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> pond&#x27;s evening soothe wipes nightly, which helped) for the past 11 days, and my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li> I may try other flavor later.</li>
            <li> and I foresee me using it for the long run!</li>
            <li> Just wish I had discovered it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> I occasionally get cystic pimples, almost always due to PMS, and it clears those up faster than anything without dryness.  </li>
            <li> I started to break out (outside of the usual) and my pores were actually getting larger.  </li>
            <li> I wish I knew about this product long ago!</li>
            <li> Will not use it for toner again, maybe just for steam treatmeant to open pores for other product penetration.</li>
            <li> Despite other reviews I read , the scent DOES linger for several hours.</li>
            <li> No stinging or redness has resulted, unlike with other similar products.</li>
            <li> Nothing else was different in my skincare routine to cause the burning to occur, so I have no explanation other than the formula was made incorrectly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other stuff and always come back to this.</li>
            <li> this is a better toner than any of the high-end, expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried, at a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I use this witch hazel every other morning or for a mid day pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> Even though there isn&#x27;t any alcohol in it, I can only use this every other day or else</li>
            <li> Not only does this toner remove excess oil, makeup and other impurities from your skin, but it also does the job without the added alcohol content.</li>
            <li> This totally does that I use it about every other day or if I have eaten something oily to get the oil off my skin.</li>
            <li> The other alcohol-free option is cucumber, which I want to try next.</li>
            <li> looking forward to trying other products in the same line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use as long as I can get it!</li>
            <li> I have actually started stockpiling it; and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never done with any other product.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase and will be trying some of the other Thayer&#x27;s products in the future!</li>
            <li> but it also has a lot of other benefits such as Aloe Vera and Vitamin E.  </li>
            <li> I know Thayer makes other variations of their witch hazel toners, and I&#x27;d definitely want to try their lemon or lavender to compare.</li>
            <li> and I also use it mixed with a little regular witch hazel after shaving,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> unfortunately it dried my skin out a little too much</li>
            <li> Also if you have ever used dickinson&#x27;s or other generic witch hazel brands from target/walmart, etc.</li>
            <li> My skin has not seen break outs in a long time!</li>
            <li> When I run out, I want to try other variations made by the same company.</li>
            <li> While I was using Thayers, I didn&#x27;t change my skincare or use any other new products on my face, so I thought maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well with my existing skincare products, and I decided to use Thayers on my neck without using anything else as a test for a few days.</li>
            <li> I have tough skin, it&#x27;s not sensitive and usually won&#x27;t breakout so easily.</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this toner for very long (~1 week)  </li>
            <li> --alcohol tends to be very rough on my skin and causes my skin to turn red afterwards.</li>
            <li> One bottle of this lasted me a &#x27;very&#x27; long time and has improved my skin without making it oily or drying it out.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single cystic zit since I quit using other products and only use this.  </li>
            <li> first two days I used it were pretty bad.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all</li>
            <li> I have a combination of oily and dry skin.</li>
            <li> After using, my skin feels refreshed and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or too dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t fee dry</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily, but helps me not to feel dry.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I apply this toner and forget to apply moisturizer afterwards but my usually dry cheeks remain well moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin had looked dry for a quite while</li>
            <li> (although I didn&#x27;t feel it was dry, I could see the dry lines in the mirror).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li> I did not experience dry patches.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I would recommend this toner b/c it is not drying.</li>
            <li> I tried using an astringent, but they leave my skin dry</li>
            <li> So I tried this Thayer toner, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, and it moisturizes the dry areas on my skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like astringents can, and I feel like my skin has been clearer as well.</li>
            <li> It never leaves my skin feeling dry either.</li>
            <li> I simultaneously have acne issues and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This toner does not make me break out or cause my skin to dry out.  </li>
            <li> , it cleans my face, and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I had a chronic problem of dry skin with acne.</li>
            <li> I used Cetaphil cleanser for dry skin, then applied this toner with a cotton pad and then applied my acne medication.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin♡</li>
            <li> While toners with alcohol dry out my face however, this hazel toner did not</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, my forehead is oily and my cheeks are dry.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Helped my acne, and dry skin?  </li>
            <li> I just end up waiting a while for it to dry off before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> then I follow it up with the Thayers, then before my face is completely dry, I use a high-quality moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li> Avoid if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> Leave my skin refresshed and not overly dry</li>
            <li> no longer have dry or overly-oily spots on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, just refreshed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry me out, but helps reduce some of the oilyness and redness.</li>
            <li> I then let it dry and apply Aveeno&#x27;s SPF 70 sunscreen ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but it may still be dry</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out either like</li>
            <li> My skin is oily in the summer and dry in the winter, and in the summertime I use Sea Breeze before this</li>
            <li> My skin tends to get dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I don&#x27;t even apply lotion afterwards and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> and this reduces dry patches and keeps my face hydrated</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this every day but sometimes I use it twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry out skin either.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and leaves it feeling refreshed and moist.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll dry me out.</li>
            <li> I let it dry into my skin and was amazed.</li>
            <li> I just apply and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I am been using it for about 3 weeks, and I like it because unlike my alcohol-free Neutrogena toner, this one doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> My complexion seems to be clearer and my skin not as dry.</li>
            <li> I have combo dry skin and oily T zone, this has helped my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin and these help.</li>
            <li> If you have really dry skin, this won&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> I wash my face, dry it, use the toner, and put a moisturizer on after.</li>
            <li> I just let it air dry</li>
            <li> and when anyone else in my household has a bug bite or dry skin we use it for that as well.</li>
            <li> Does dry out and irritate areas where I have a problem with perioral dermatitis, so I avoid those areas.</li>
            <li> My skin is sometimes dry and/or sometimes oily, so i never know what product to use on my face.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with both dry and acne-prone skin since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 24 now).</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t makes her skin dry.</li>
            <li> , I have dry to medium skin</li>
            <li> I had never used a toner before, but my face has been so dry and no amount of moisturizer would help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fighting dry skin as it is.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to be on the dry side and this toner leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that&#x27;s dry around my chin and cheeks, and oily on my t-zone.</li>
            <li> Well if you have dry skin you do not want to use this</li>
            <li> I had been having some issues with redness, and dry, flaking skin on my face for a bit.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but it contains witch hazel which helps with breakouts and tightening pores.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not have over production of oil, my skin is not as dry in the cheek area, and my pores are minimized.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry dry dry because of environmental damage and climate.  </li>
            <li> (so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin), Paraben-free, Propylene Glycol-free and used un-distilled Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I was going with the \\&quot;dry the pimples</li>
            <li> I thought the witch hazel would dry me out, but this stuff is so soothing.  </li>
            <li> The winter is so incredibly dry</li>
            <li> I like to use this product over an astringent when my face is feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard witch hazel and toners can dry out your skin</li>
            <li> but this has never made my skin feel irritated, dry, or oily.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m telling you my skin was as dry as skin can be.</li>
            <li> I apply in the morning after a shower with a cotton ball and my face does not get itchy or have dry flakes on my face all day.</li>
            <li> It cleans my face and neck without leaving my skin dry.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and softens my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, at all.</li>
            <li> I use it after washing my face, and then apply moisturizer once dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel dry at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the face awfully dry and works well alongside my Eucerin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If it helps, I have dry and oily skin.</li>
            <li> This product is Alcohol-free, so my skin won&#x27;t feel dry.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t over dry or get irritated</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin.</li>
            <li> I found her washing off a clearasil pad she had applied because she couldn&#x27;t tolerate the dry after effect.</li>
            <li> With this toner, because there is no alcohol included to dry up the skin and it has aloe vera, it makes my skin glow and feel refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I use this to wet toilet paper so as not to add additional solids to my septic tank.  </li>
            <li> Fresh scent with no sticky feel left behind at all!</li>
            <li> So far i&#x27;ve used about a third (4 fl ounces) over 4 months, which is something i at least do once a day.  </li>
            <li> I really like how it helps to pick up any traces left behind from my cleanser, oil, make-up,etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found some MESSY products online that she simply does not wish to be bothered with, especially the ones that give her a dry &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe my skin is more sensitive or something, but I absolutely hate the smell too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Thayers since late high school years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and love it, but I am a little confused by amazon&#x27;s listing of ingredients, it states that there is methylparaben (a gentle preservative), and I was a little upset by this, because we all know that parabens are not good for us.  </li>
            <li> I notice a visible difference when I miss a single day.</li>
            <li> I use this with cotton balls every single day.  </li>
            <li> I love it, haven&#x27;t noticed crazy differences but the red little bumps under my eyes seem to be going away.</li>
            <li> In general, I think toners are a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how old these bottle are</li>
            <li> and I have dark circles under my eyes, and since I have been using this my cheeks are not as red and</li>
            <li> Developed a small reddish and scaly rash.</li>
            <li> have a sensitive skin that is prone to small breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Ever</li>
            <li> I added this after looking into natural remedies (my usual dr bronner&#x27;s peppermint and coconut oil weren&#x27;t working anymore).</li>
            <li> Another victim in the product graveyard.</li>
            <li> I used that used to irritated my sensitive skin, leading to more horrifying, teen breakouts.</li>
            <li> and the cap is so loose that whenever i accidentally flip over, it spilt all the time.</li>
            <li> are starting to reduce and the redness/swelling is going down.</li>
            <li> That MAYBE the only down side, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> I think it is all down to personal preference with scent.</li>
            <li> The only down side is</li>
            <li> only down side is the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed it seems to have toned down the red marks.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I initially hated this product, but I stuck through it for a few more days to see if there was any change in my skin, because I couldn&#x27;t ignore all the positive reviews!</li>
            <li> It does seem that only a little on a cotton ball goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this over a month and a half ago, share it with someone else, and still have a quarter bottle left - so if you use it, on average, once a day, it should last you around four</li>
            <li> It is quite big and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I then looked at the inner seal to see if the edge had lifted a little to cause the minor</li>
            <li> Recently I tried a more expensive brand of rose water just out of curiosity and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use very few products with scent.</li>
            <li> and the bottle lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> After 1 use (not joking) my skin broke out and was completely dry!</li>
            <li> it doesnt dry out my skin!~</li>
            <li> I can notice my skin looking less red and irriated.</li>
            <li> I was used to my previous toner helping remove traces of make up left after washing, and this one does not do that</li>
            <li> less oil, skin was smoother, and pores much SMALLER!</li>
            <li> initially receieved a small sample bottle from a tradeshow and then purchased the larger bottle online after using it all.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, there are other things in life to be critical about, other than the smell of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 2x daily along with black soap for just one week, and my bumps have reduced dramatically in size and prevalence.</li>
            <li> This product actually makes me feel relieved - the bumps are one less thing to worry about.</li>
            <li> I use this after I use my Shea Moisture Black African Soap and these two together</li>
            <li> I bought this to be used along side Dr. Woods Black Soap for my entire family.</li>
            <li> Regular witch hazel purchased at a drug store sells for half of the price of this product, hence the four stars.</li>
            <li> I usually apply the toner to my face, neck, chest and upper back using a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> It is a big bottle, and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch</li>
            <li> It removes anything that is left over from my cleanser (usually nothing) and preps my skin for the next step in my regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of acne treatments and toners that tend to dry out my skin, while not really seeming to alleviate the acne.</li>
            <li> I use this and the black soap, on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I dont know if they changed the formula, this felt different from previous 2 bottles that</li>
            <li> and I notice that my skin is smother and less irritated (red).</li>
            <li> trick is to find one that does not leave your face feeling sticky or greasy, not clean enough or too dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensative skin and have had trouble in the past with toners.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to those who have similar problems such as I do.</li>
            <li> To make this short, cause it seems I have gone off subject</li>
            <li> #34;everyone&#x27;s&amp;#34; number one pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toner after I wash my face with African black soap every morning and every night for a week now.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s does the job just as well as my previous toner and is several dollars cheaper!</li>
            <li> The biggest surprise for me was that none of these products were the super expensive make-up counter creams.</li>
            <li> If for no other reason use this product to remove the residue left behind by cleansers or facial cloths.</li>
            <li> but it definitely helps dry out the little pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, little oily on nose, i am using the third bottle, I don&#x27;t intend to change it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a little over 3 months, my skin has cleared up a lot and been far less oily.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> but I do feel my pores tighten without drying my face( very dry fave person here).&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> My husband has very dry skin but refuses to use moisturizers because he doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> so my skin has been very dry as well.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also shared this with my sister who has very dry patchy skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this past few weeks, but so far, it is meeting all my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great.</li>
            <li> So as every lady online knows, your skin care regimen evolves and changes, and it&#x27;s often difficult to find new products that work as well as your old, but after a while your skin&#x27;s PH balance gets used to the products and poof--</li>
            <li> Because my skin is sensitive to what I put on it, it&#x27;s really difficult to try new products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for about 2 or 3 weeks now and my face is radiant and glowing with tight pores.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing I have used on my face that gets rid of these little bumps, almost like acne.</li>
            <li> And you only need a little to spread about your face.</li>
            <li> I squirt a little on a cotton pad and it takes like ten seconds.</li>
            <li> I use on my neck and face and anywhere else I get little acne or razor bumps from shaving such as chest.</li>
            <li> but this gets the last little bit.</li>
            <li> I personally mix just a little bit of apple cider vinegar with this to make a skin balancing toner.</li>
            <li> Plus it stings my eyes a little which the last bottle never did.</li>
            <li> This is the little trick that we always do back to my country.</li>
            <li> I also get little white heads and &amp;#34;blood-blister&amp;#34; zits.</li>
            <li> I mux in a little Orange essential oil into this</li>
            <li> For some reason, it feels a little above my years.  </li>
            <li> The second time I used it, still breakout and a little allergic rash on my cheek.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t over dry my face like other toners.</li>
            <li> it doesnt dry my skin as other toners do.</li>
            <li> I have tried other toners and they make my skin feel too dry...</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling really dry like other toners do.</li>
            <li> Smells a little like Ponds Cold Cream Cleanser :)</li>
            <li> I have oily skin that is so sensitive and hard to care for</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time too!!!</li>
            <li> That means I&#x27;ll have oil fields on my nose forehead chin and parts of my cheeks, and red flaky dry irritated skin around my nostrils and a few other places.</li>
            <li> My face is more of a normal-combination (normally, not to oily, but not too dry), but I had some bad break outs in the past that left some discolored scars/skin</li>
            <li> This is a must if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s great for your skin and doesn&#x27;t have horrible chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> What shocked me most was that even after I washed my face thoroughly with a cleanser and wash cloth, I still removed dirt when I used the Thayer&#x27;s on a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some red bumps on my chest area lately and this cleared em up after only 5-6 uses...</li>
            <li> I use this toner at least 3 times a week, especially after I finish shaving because it doesn&#x27;t sting my face and seems to help with preventing ingrown facial hair.</li>
            <li> Dark skinned male trying to treat for dark spots from ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;ve never really known what toners are supposed to do, I just know that you&#x27;re supposed to use it after you cleanse.</li>
            <li> I have only had this toner for a few days and can  already see a change in my skin.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s been having as much trouble as I do with combination skin/acne.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this toner for a few days now, but I have noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a few days</li>
            <li> It came just as expected.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I remember a few years ago, I tried a Witch Hazel toner from the local grocery store, and the smell was just so off-putting that I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and it seems to be helping my acne.</li>
            <li> Never really saw any benefit from them.</li>
            <li> it did help s rough patch on my face..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even improved the uneven patches on my cheeks and forehead, and I can see a definite improvement in the redness as well.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I can tell the difference in the cleanliness of my skin it has reduced the oil and blackheads that surface daily.</li>
            <li> Used it on my face and now my pores are closed.</li>
            <li> When I think of all the money I spent on dept. stores..</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days</li>
            <li> It is harder than you might think to find alcohol-free witch hazel blends</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have to be careful with the products I use on my skin.</li>
            <li> but my wife always tries to put it on me.</li>
            <li> My skin is the softest it has ever been after this stuff sinks into it.</li>
            <li> The price is affordable and the toner lasts for a few months with constant use.</li>
            <li> it only just arrived few days ago...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use a cotton ball; after my face has been washed and dried, I squirt about 1/2 of a teaspoon of toner into my palm, rub hands together and apply to my entire face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I use it to remove my makeup before bed with a cotton round and occasionally before applying makeup in the morning.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few months, I took a look at my skin prior to applying makeup and realized that the brown spot was gone.</li>
            <li> I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry.</li>
            <li> Merchandise has been shipped efficiently and packed carefully for every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only  been  a  few days</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> I have oily combination skin and luckily am not really acne prone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now, but it leaves my skin feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> This was just as expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw an improvement in skin after a few day&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> i contacted thayer about it and told me i should return it for it may be harsh on my skin because there was a batch with extra witch hazel that did not pass their standards.</li>
            <li> but the product leaks out around the edges of the closed cap.  </li>
            <li> I oil cleanse my skin a few times a week and use this on a cotton ball afterwards to remove any last traces.</li>
            <li> I will absolutely never be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have skin that is acne-prone, but also gets dried out, and this toner seems to give my skin just enough moisture, without making it oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> and it was just as expected.  </li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s an all natursl product I was not as careful as I should have</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple weeks ago and have been using it diligently everyday whenever my face is in need of a proper refresh.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for inexpensive, effective, natural products to use on my face, as skincare products can sometimes be outrageous with their prices and claims.  </li>
            <li> the calm),&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the cucumber, since I like the smell of cucumber and hate this rose petal</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rose Petal witch hazel as a base for my scent-free deodorant.</li>
            <li> bottle last for a long time, I am just a little under half way done with it now.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m a bit older and have little broken red blood vessels on my cheeks and since using this stuff those have minimized.  </li>
            <li> have an extremely oily t-zone with very dry cheeks, to the point where I deal eczema patches on my cheeks during the winter.</li>
            <li> I ended up buying the plain version later.</li>
            <li> was doing badly and when it got better, so I can&#x27;t say with certainty that the improvement was due to this product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have absolutely no problems (:&lt;</li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;re not happy with it after the first or second use, keep at it for at least a week before passing judgement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 15 yrs old boy with pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> and my face feels less dry.</li>
            <li> did not help with clearing breakouts, but did seem to balance my skin so it was less dry.</li>
            <li> Last year, after trying a combination of Estroblock pills + black soap (loved by all internet women struggling with skin problems it seems), I had the WORST break-outs of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this product - and a little goes a looooong way!</li>
            <li> Also the smell was little bit different from previous ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days now and have noticed that my red bumps on my chin has gone down.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, too, so</li>
            <li> I get acne, dry skin and just overall not nice.</li>
            <li> Overall, my skin feels cleaner and less heavy with oil.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this would work because it is so mild, but after a few weeks I feel a noticeable  difference.</li>
            <li> The oiliness has decreased some but the dry spots are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after washing my face with black soap and it instantly moisturizes my skin.</li>
            <li> The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it less than a week and my skin is already re-acquiring the glow I had lost since gaining quite a few pounds/ being under stress recently.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or tight after using this.</li>
            <li> Works like toners with alcohol but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make it feel tight.</li>
            <li> It never leaves it feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> Since there is no alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or make my skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> that witch hazel has any advantages over other toners.</li>
            <li> I have extremely irritable skin, and this toner always comes to the rescue.</li>
            <li> Usually this is the only thing that I have to put on my face at night after washing.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> (I read other comments and now I have learned my lesson)&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> Other than that one zit</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and struggle with breakouts and irritation from other products or procedures like waxing or threading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experience with other toners.  </li>
            <li> I will try to find other ways to use it too.</li>
            <li> There were other factors and changes that I made from between my skin</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase at a local organic grocery store, and I see no difference between those bottles and this one I ordered.</li>
            <li> Other types of acne, it doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I use it every day now under all other products.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had a facial, you will notice that usually after extractions, your aesthetician will apply with hazel to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to find an alcohol-free witch hazel oil and this one has a lot of other goodies added too.</li>
            <li> I put some other creams on my face afterwards...but even this alone moisturizes my face plenty.  </li>
            <li> but I use it conjunction with other products.</li>
            <li> This product allows for maximum absorption of other beneficial skincare products, like serums &amp; moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It is so different from toners I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like the product.  </li>
            <li> I just did a lactic acid peel and this was extremely cooling on my skin.</li>
            <li> Will try the other scents too .</li>
            <li> I was on Amazon just to purchase other things when skincare caught my eye.</li>
            <li> The scent does not linger, so there is no concern about clashing with other fragrances [or attracting bees, if you are a gardener].</li>
            <li> I use it on my face 2-3 times a day to help remove make up dirt and other toxins...as well as other skin irritations...</li>
            <li> I usually use regular witch hazel to tighten pores and tone face</li>
            <li> Not sure about other seasons but &#x27;tis par for the humid summer in my urban area.</li>
            <li> I keep the cotton ball next to her bed just in case but usually there is no need.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do user other products and have changed on other products which of course may effect my skin.</li>
            <li> I have always been a user of anything &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; on my face due to it&#x27;s benefits for skin.</li>
            <li> The smell reminds me of a grandmother&#x27;s perfume; not exactly my style</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I doubt any other toner could beat it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is actually in my bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a week now in combination with some other products.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other toner...</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s caused by the other product because I have used this before two years ago.</li>
            <li> But there are other things to use it for, so I&#x27;ll get use out of it...</li>
            <li> then the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I recommend this toner.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that if you squeeze the closed bottle (why you would, I don&#x27;t know!)</li>
            <li> something that other (pricey) toners could not do.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS BEYOND EXTREME</li>
            <li> My other advice would be to try Cocoa-Nut Creme by AAA Shea butter for moisturizing among other scarring/aging purposes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and nourishing to my combination skin.</li>
            <li> so I can;t compare this to any other brand,</li>
            <li> After cleansing my face I apply this with a cotton ball, then do my other lotions and potions.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try it as an alternative to my other toners.  </li>
            <li> Some nights I use a night cream and other nights</li>
            <li> I have extremely greasy skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how one knows when a facial product is working.</li>
            <li> I found a cap from my other bottle.</li>
            <li> Makes pores look smaller and dries out small pimples without drying out skin.</li>
            <li> I traded my other toner (which was a No. 2 toner from a well known cosmetics brand because of the alcohol in it) for this one.</li>
            <li> considering all the other benefits I get from the stoner</li>
            <li> not sure that it actually does any cleansing perse</li>
            <li> /&gt;It occurred to me there was no hot stinging sensation from the oil at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve noted other reviews where people were put off by the scent of this product.</li>
            <li> I see my skin clearing up already and its only been a few days!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of my other brand of unscented witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s due to the glycerin.</li>
            <li> I see here in the reviews that it did that to some other people as well.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other toner for my face.  </li>
            <li> Refreshes after cleansing but will allow other products you might use do their trick, e.g. anti-aging, skin lightening creams, alpha hydroxy, etc.  </li>
            <li> Does dry out my skin a little</li>
            <li> You have to be very careful about the counterfeits on here as I ran into some already.</li>
            <li> Use this in conjunction with Raw African Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> , I wait a bit then just wash my face with super cold water to close my pores</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals and not too harsh, as sometimes products meant for oily skin dry my face and make me break out.</li>
            <li> This toner takes off all the extra dirt that my facial cleanser leaves behind.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few toners I have used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> so my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry once it&#x27;s dried off.</li>
            <li> Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing.  </li>
            <li> My skin broke-out with the most horrible cystic acne, I began to use a cream on my face to clear it, and it started drying out my skin a bit.</li>
            <li> so my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry once it&#x27;s dried off.</li>
            <li> I quickly washed my face with cold water</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d think someone had drained 6 pounds of bacon on it and cheeks that get dry, red and patchy if the wind blows a little too hard on them.</li>
            <li> It is way less red than usual too.</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have either bought or noticed an inaccurate product ingredient list and am disappointed with amazon for being so bad at updating ingredient lists for better or for worse, but in this case it would be updated to a better list.</li>
            <li> I also noticed there are other types of this toner with different scents like lavender and citrus, so if you&#x27;re not a rose fan try another scent.</li>
            <li> but something is not right with the formula.</li>
            <li> To anyone with acne-prone skin or even oily skin like myself, feverishly searching for an end-all cure: anything you try you gotta give it a little bit of time to work(more than a week unless you&#x27;re experiencing allergic-type reactions), and expect that immediate results just aren&#x27;t in the cards for us.</li>
            <li> And then some toners that are alcohol-free don&#x27;t actually do anything to clean your skin, so they are worthless.  </li>
            <li> cow, my face was burning and extremely itchy!</li>
            <li> , in the end alcohol is no good, especially for me (since I have very dry skin already).</li>
            <li> My face is softer and my extremely oily skin has become much less so.</li>
            <li> It is the only one I&#x27;ve used in at least half a year, and I do not have any plans to try any other toners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i went from mediocre dull skin to the type of skin you dont think could even be real without visual effects.  </li>
            <li> but it was delivered with a huge ugly bar-code sticker across the front.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is the stuff of what I needed as a teen with pretty bad acne.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad eczema and inflammation especially around my nose and t tone.</li>
            <li> On average I use 4-6 oil blotting papers each time to remove shine.</li>
            <li> --i really can&#x27;t say anything wrong about it</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Helps with dark circles under your eyes.  </li>
            <li> So along with the under-the-skin lumps, and acne, I had dark spots everywhere.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is there is a flaw in the cover.  </li>
            <li> I estimate would last at least 5 months.</li>
            <li> I put this on at least twice a day and my skin feels instantly refreshed!</li>
            <li> If the itch comes back, which it probably will in a few seconds, I rub it again and that usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over eight years, and needless to say, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about - average cleaning but without alcohol</li>
            <li> I have been using a different toner for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use to improve the texture of my face and have had no success.</li>
            <li> My mom has been preaching the benefits of Witch Hazel for years, but I just started using this regularly in the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t broken out since I have been using it</li>
            <li> The Seller of the product I purchased, Oxkom, a family owned business that reaches out to their customer base to make sure expectations have been met.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, and isn&#x27;t irritating at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is non irritating and leaves my skin soft and refreshed, just as promised.</li>
            <li> Love the smell as well as well as the properties it provides for the base</li>
            <li> Also, the ingredients list was much less complex in comparison to similar products.  </li>
            <li> it takes sometimes to finish the whole bottle and a lot less expensive.</li>
            <li> All my efforts from 3 months went down the drain in just 4-5 days of usage.</li>
            <li> Watch for sales, as the price goes up and down.</li>
            <li> Calms my skin down.</li>
            <li> It has cleared my pores and toned down the oil production  </li>
            <li> Other cheaper brands contain 14% grain alcohol (ouch!)</li>
            <li> Nothing else to say other then GET IT!</li>
            <li> I will not use any other toner ever again!</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t sting like other toners would do!</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this twice already and got my mom, sister, and other family members hooked!</li>
            <li> use witch hazel all the time and have never had anymore of a reaction to it than plain water and have no allergy to roses either having at times in my life from when I was a child crushed the leaves and spread them on my hands and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually get excessively dry using toner but this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have some in a small spray bottle to mist on my face for a dewy look when my face is dry.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and the toner is ordinary for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> original witch hazel smells so damn bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other toners like Origins and Clinique and it always breaks me out.</li>
            <li> so it makes my dry patches go away little by little, and the aloe vera helps heal my zits!</li>
            <li> - most commonly I get a bad breakout, but sometimes a rash or itch or burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I personally do not think it smells that bad, and the odor really goes away once it leaves the bottle, there is no linger.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed and skeptical that this one wouldn&#x27;t work for me either, but let me tell you it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> then the fact my sensitive dramatic skin doesn&#x27;t break out from this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with Dr Woods Shea Black Soap and my complexion</li>
            <li> Also, wrinkles are less noticeable now because the witch hazel cleans out the dirt, oils &amp; make-up</li>
            <li> After check previous reviews, I know I am cheated too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week now</li>
            <li> My face has been less oily, with fewer blemishes and my skin tone seems to look healthier.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave the cotton ball dirty or make my skin tingle, but it left the natural oils.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;d probably like it less scented,</li>
            <li> and it is also making it less noticeable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother and I&#x27;ve had less break outs.</li>
            <li> My skin looks clearer, smoother, and less oily.</li>
            <li> However, because it&#x27;s alcohol-free, it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> Bought half a dozen of these already.</li>
            <li> However I read on ewg that dickinsons version is safer and has less chemicals.</li>
            <li> I also feel I should mention I have combination oily skin and slight acne</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon for nearly half the cost as the one in my deli.</li>
            <li> Holy cow!</li>
            <li> I then fold the towel in half and cut holes for eyes and a mouth and a slit for the nose.</li>
            <li> this toner, and half water</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, 2-3 times a day, and I&#x27;ve noticed less blemishes on my skin.</li>
            <li> One bottle typically lasts me a month, and that&#x27;s with using it 2-3 times per day to control shine and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> The Black Soap is a castile soap.</li>
            <li> (It smells like roses, but slightly \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot;</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less oily during the day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a toner in the morning and evening for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> Is use this as a toner with dr. Woods black soap face wash...</li>
            <li> so I brought this product because after I wash my face with the black soap I felt I needed something that didn&#x27;t have alcohol in it to wipe my face with before using my moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My skin is less oily and a lot healthier looking</li>
            <li> I see a slight improvement to complexion.</li>
            <li> may be seeing a slight improvement in my skin tone</li>
            <li> I have a slight case of rosacea on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using Clinque&#x27;s Clarifying Lotion</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t skimp and buy your mother&#x27;s typical witch hazel which is diluted with alcohol.</li>
            <li> returning the item would cost me half the price i paid for</li>
            <li> In fact, I usually have to moisturize my face A TON after washing it, but if I use this toner after I was my face, I don&#x27;t feel as dry!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s less.</li>
            <li> I also half it with water</li>
            <li> Helps my skin feel less oily throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no drying out of my face, which I did with my previous Clinique products.  </li>
            <li> Buy one get one half price.</li>
            <li> My face is SO much less oily and my pores are minimizing.  </li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for years, and wanted to find a less costly alternative.</li>
            <li> And i have less oily Tzone since i use it.</li>
            <li> and it is still slightly damp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly tingles when applied.</li>
            <li> Also slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> lots of ideas on pinterest, half way though the bottle already</li>
            <li> I actually like the smell since it&#x27;s subtle.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the harsh cool tingle that you get from those terrible acne soaps; it&#x27;s gentle like little bubbles popping against your face.</li>
            <li> My face usually feels very dry after washing or taking a shower</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been into expensive, high end, skincare products</li>
            <li> and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so it usually reacts poorly when I try new products out...</li>
            <li> Since I can&#x27;t return this, I&#x27;m going to give it another try when my skin calms down a little bit.</li>
            <li> My skin felt cleaner and slightly tighter within minutes of applying this - but not too tight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and doesn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals like so many other products.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going to mess with a toner, this will be the one I use.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of pink in my skin and although Im not sure</li>
            <li> If I feel not good later, I&#x27;ll change my review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s when I saw a small puncture in the center of the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it every day or every other day to refresh my face or take off any concealer that was left behind after shower.  </li>
            <li> Other witch hazels smell terrible and kind of burn/sting the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a little odd</li>
            <li> It also helps moisturize my skin without the nasty breakouts later, though when my skin is a little drier than normal, I use Cetaphil (normally around the eyes and forehead).</li>
            <li> This toner is very delicate, smells like roses and does not dry your skin while removing dirt and makeup.</li>
            <li> The cup is closing tight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel tight on the skin afterwards</li>
            <li> My face feels toned &amp; tight after using.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight after toning.</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel tight, in fact, it feels moisturized but in almost an oily way.</li>
            <li> After using it my pores felt tight.</li>
            <li> but it also leaves my skin feeling a little tight now...</li>
            <li> I use it once a day as well as whenever my skin is feeling a little oily or tight.</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel before from my local store and it was not pleasant smelling, but I knew the benefits of witch hazel.  </li>
            <li> am sorry, but this is just not natural enough for me.</li>
            <li> It is so much less harsh than the Clinique toner I was using before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously found some distilled witch hazel products to be a bit harsh or drying to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am acne-prone (which is quite unfair since I am almost 50).</li>
            <li> i have weird combination skin which is also very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Splash a little on you legs when youre wearing a skirt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now</li>
            <li> A little goes a along way.&lt;br /&gt;Should always keep this in med cabinet.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin a little too shiny</li>
            <li> My skin felt a little too oily after using this.</li>
            <li> However, even with the aloe, the product is just a little too astringent for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a coincidence because of hormonal fluctuations or perhaps other circumstances.</li>
            <li> I like it to tingle and maybe even burn a little, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over three weeks</li>
            <li> the flavor is a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a little &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume smell.  </li>
            <li> The forum stated that witch hazel helped with conditioning the skin after shaving and then to put a little aftershave for a finishing touch.</li>
            <li> I put it in a little spray bottle and I spray my face evry day after my shower before make up.  </li>
            <li> I apply it before I put on my moisturizer and let it sit and tingle for a little bit on my face.</li>
            <li> But it irritates my skin a little bit.</li>
            <li> It cleared up what little acne I had, and it helps de-puff the bags under my eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> smells a little good.......other than that</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get dirt off like my Chanel, but I do see a little bit of skin and some dirt</li>
            <li> I feel like it made me break out a little on my cheeks</li>
            <li> (Giorgio Armani) works well in winter or summer but needs a little help with summer humidity.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m sold for life as it has worked as well if not better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> - I thought it was a little pricey -</li>
            <li> little by little</li>
            <li> My pores have diminished a little ..</li>
            <li> In fact, I even spritzed a little on my neck when out of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if I need a little freshening up throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> One thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the little stickiness from the glycerin in this product.</li>
            <li> However, I now have little patches that are dime sized on my face.  </li>
            <li> my scabs were healed and there was just a little redness from where they were.</li>
            <li> I have tried other witch hazel solutions in the past.</li>
            <li> Probably because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol like the other toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It can make my face a little tacky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little miracle all on its own.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The oils do take a little while to absorb</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it would be an overpowering scent</li>
            <li> but it Burns little bit when I apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Witch Hazel for a little over a year now.</li>
            <li> I figure those little guys will sneak in anyway</li>
            <li> I put some of this stuff in a little spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> It stings my skin a little.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stink like other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin burn a little bit.</li>
            <li> It made me breakout a little too.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t terrible or strong, but I definitely dislike it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is subtle, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy to pay exorbitant amounts of money on expensive &#x27;toners&#x27; that are basically witch hazel with fragrance added, and a fancy name slapped on the bottle...when you can buy plain or rose petal witch hazel for a few dollars, and it is not going to irritate your skin like some of those toners do!</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was in a tall narrow plastic zip lock bag and had leaked a little inside.</li>
            <li> After letting my face air dry, I take a very small amount (about 1/8 of a teaspoon) of the Coconut Oil and mix it with 1-2 drops of the Jojoba Oil and rub all over my face.  </li>
            <li> far as the few complaints about the smell, I think that they are a little silly.  </li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews on how this product could either work really well for you, or make you break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I put some on a cotton round and go in an upwards/anti gravity motion from my d&amp;eacute;colletage</li>
            <li> few weeks.</li>
            <li> I wipe my face with it everyday.</li>
            <li> Soak your fingertips in a few tablespoons before doing your cuticles.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal systic acne and use a lot of harsh drying treatments on my face when I have a breakout.</li>
            <li> It seems strangely heavy for a toner.</li>
            <li> They all either dried my skin out, dehydrated it despite all of the moisturizer in the world, or just didn&#x27;t do anything for the acne.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, it hasn&#x27;t dried out my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin, but I get dried areas around my lips, nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday as toner.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and is a must-have in my low-maintenance sulfate-free morning wash regimen.  </li>
            <li> Then I use a cotton ball and a few drops of this and rub it in circular motions like the bottle says.</li>
            <li> i ordered and i use this everyday twice morning and night</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> that it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol or harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a few reviewers found the scent to be over powering.</li>
            <li> I put it on a cotton round and swab my face.</li>
            <li> Also something without a harsh scent for Ihave sensitives with that as well.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toner that would take off the residue left behind after my cleansing.  </li>
            <li> They went away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> everyday use</li>
            <li> It makes my skin not look dried out, because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol as one of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> i use it everyday - morning and night; and it lasts 2 months.</li>
            <li> my pores and made my trouble areas</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I also have adult acne.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t used it in a few years.</li>
            <li> Use everyday twice a day after washing.  </li>
            <li> I use everyday.</li>
            <li> It also takes off any facial makeup that my remover leaves behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years as a toner and on bug bites.</li>
            <li> is how my face hasn&#x27;t dried out at all.</li>
            <li> This product has become a staple in my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toner that would take off the residue left behind after my cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this morning and night for a few months now.</li>
            <li> but I didn’t like how saturated they got and also seemed to waste the product.</li>
            <li> , how can you go wrong, and all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It cleans and tones without harsh chemicals or alcohol.</li>
            <li> What a waste.</li>
            <li> I posted it on my Facebook because this is a must have for people with trouble skin.</li>
            <li> I have had a few breakouts, but I can&#x27;t say this product was the cause.</li>
            <li> Switched to a thin, white rag after that.</li>
            <li> and I already gave up, $10 wasted, wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> I have also used the witch hazel for a few insects bites and scratches from my startled cat as he jumped from my lap.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Toner for a few years.  </li>
            <li> nothing heavy or pungent.</li>
            <li> Though, he said his skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after he uses it.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and my skin has not been dried out or irritated by it.</li>
            <li> Then, I apply the product with a cotton round.  </li>
            <li> I also have an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> no, I&#x27;ve wasted money, etc.\\</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for a few months before I reviewed, so here is my review after having used it for about 2 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I noticed the amount of acne</li>
            <li> Why waste a lot of money on a toner when this one gives you all you need?</li>
            <li> However, I haven&#x27;t tested its cleansing power over heavy heavy make-</li>
            <li> They dried me out to the point of my skin peeling in a couple spots.  </li>
            <li> not cheap or overpowering.</li>
            <li> but we&#x27;ve never had trouble with this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use toners from the Body Shop, and after a while I noticed that my skin dried up and become tougher, so I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I use everyday out of the shower - lasts me about 2 months though with everyday use</li>
            <li> I am not comfortable using this and will be throwing it away.</li>
            <li> i put it in a spray bottle and spray my face a few times a day just for moisture</li>
            <li> I look forward to putting this on everyday.</li>
            <li> (Aloe Vera leaves me feeling dried out after 5 minutes).</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something harsh, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger on your face though, so after a few minutes I can&#x27;t smell it on my face.</li>
            <li> but it dissipates as soon as the product is dried.</li>
            <li> No alcohol means no drying, or harsh products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li> sort of like the scent myself, but I will admit it is dead on for &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would continue using this after experimenting with quite a few.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use harsh soap and alcohol based toners anymore without my skin feeling parched.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days</li>
            <li> I use this as an everyday toner.</li>
            <li> It cleans anything left behind after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is not too harsh.</li>
            <li> Just like roses, but the smell fades after a few minutes of having it on your face, so it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything.</li>
            <li> NO NEED FOR EXTRA UNNECESSARY COMMUNICATION</li>
            <li> The marks that I was also worried about disappeared within a few days</li>
            <li> I love Witch Hazel but have always hated the smell.</li>
            <li> after a few days of using it, my face started to itch and rashes</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t linger and dissipates after a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now</li>
            <li> Gets rid of whatever my face wash left behind.</li>
            <li> but this was a waste, for me anyways.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using it</li>
            <li> a few days ago noticed my skin feeling smoother after one use lets hope it keeps improving my skin</li>
            <li> Calms redness and irritation, without harsh alcohols or fragrance.</li>
            <li> While I cannot comment yet on how effective it is for the skin - the smell is just awful compared to this.</li>
            <li> I stand behind my initial recommendation - go with Thayer&#x27;s Rose-Petal!</li>
            <li> i put this on everyday</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out after use.</li>
            <li> I have been using the toner for a few weeks and can&#x27;t say I have noticed a visible improvement in my skin, but I am hoping with long-term use the benefits will be visible.</li>
            <li> Completely wasted my money...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge difference</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan of pickle smell on my face.</li>
            <li> I firmly think that is because the Thayer&#x27;s is removing oil and dirt from my skin that used to get left behind even after scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Usually toners are too strong smell like crap and irriate even the oily parts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about half a year, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> It smells like roses in an odd way - I quite like the smell, but even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> so your skin can adapt, then using it twice a day (my skin was slightly irritated when I went overboard).</li>
            <li> I have noticed that I know have to wear less make up!</li>
            <li> and I have less acne!</li>
            <li> I like to store mines in the refrigerator, and use a small bottle to mix 2 parts of this with one part (maybe even less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this is, but it&#x27;s quite disappointing since I only used about a third of the bottle...</li>
            <li> I mix it with plain witch hazel in a spray bottle to set my makeup when I am finished.</li>
            <li> Normally, my bruises stay for weeks and slowly make that awful transition from dark blue to green to orange to healed, but with this I&#x27;ve noticed that my bruises heal within days with daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Plain witch hazel works well</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use plain witch hazel ever again.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Grabbing a cotton ball with plain water and rubbing it all around my face.</li>
            <li> Pricier than plain stuff.</li>
            <li> I was very wary to try this product, as I hate the scent most products have that claim to be &amp;#34;rose-scented.&amp;#34; While this has no such claim, I was under the belief that it would have a smell due to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice a day for almost an entire year now and the difference in the appearance of my skin in dramatic.</li>
            <li> I notices a dramatic difference in the amount of sudden break outs I get.</li>
            <li> No strong scent.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare, but to me any skincare products should be fragrance-free or contains no strong fragrance(let alone smell bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something that would improve the condition of my skin without irritating it like other products which contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid or a bazillion other ingredients I don&#x27;t know the meaning of.</li>
            <li> I have also put some of this in a small spray bottle and but that in the fridge that I like to use as a little skin refresher during the day.  </li>
            <li> Well when I received my broken,  half empty bottle</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet if this product is actually helping my skin in any way but after I have thoroughly washed my face and rinsed off with cold water I put some of this on with a cotton ball and let it dry before putting on primer (if it&#x27;s morning</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s not super bad, but I usually used to have one or two zits at a time, with the bigger breakout mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad acne, those that are under the skin, pus, inflamed.  </li>
            <li> One thing that bugs me is they&#x27;ve put an ugly barcode across the front of the pretty label and you can&#x27;t peel it off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since anything we put on our bodies is absorbed through our skin and into our bloodstream, I think I&#x27;ll err on the side of caution and refrain from using this product :(</li>
            <li> This has done wonders for my skin in my 30&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t leave a harsh smell, harsh drying sensation and mess-free!</li>
            <li> my blackheads and dark circles have decreased faster than I would have ever expected!</li>
            <li> I have used toners in the past that felt to harsh on my skin, so I stopped using toners.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as harsh as some toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It is slowly clearing up my dark circles (PLEASE NOTE:</li>
            <li> It is my standard post-washing face astringent, and I keep a little in a spray bottle for any troubled skin or sunburns.</li>
            <li> So, although I had high hopes for Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel AF Toner, a small part of me was preparing for disappointment.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m afraid to try new things</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s usually the plain version.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this when I ran out of my usual plain alcohol-free witch hazel.</li>
            <li> IMO it&#x27;s a giant waste of money to use expensive treatment serums on your skin, unless it&#x27;s been fully prepared to absorb it.</li>
            <li> I have used \\&quot;gentle/non-drying\\&quot; toners before while trying to avoid the alcohol ingredient that is so common to freshening astringents only to find that instead, the toners would leave behind an emollient or sticky residue that I ended up having to wash off.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a toner that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave that sticky feeling behind for the longest time.</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel slightly oily, but my skin seems to be slowly clearing up.</li>
            <li> There was a slight floral scent to it when I started using it which slowly started to be eliminated from the product.  </li>
            <li> No more breakouts, no more flaky skin due to over drying, and no more dullness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to replace expensive skin care products with less expensive alternatives while maintaining quality, and this toner certainly fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I mean no positive or negative effect.</li>
            <li> This toner moisturizes my skin for hours at a time, keeping me from being shiny, with very little greasy aftermath.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have bad skin days anymore</li>
            <li> I am going to contact Thayer to see if I got a fake product, if so there will be big problems with the seller.</li>
            <li> so I usually use a toner with acne medicine in it</li>
            <li> I can see an improvement in the texture of my skin and perhaps a small reduction in my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy agin, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> No more alcohol based toner for me.</li>
            <li> not sure that it&#x27;s toning my skin the way I had hoped</li>
            <li> so maybe that was the reason I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it broke my face out in tons of acne after only a couple night&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> should note, by the way, that this keeps happening to me with facial products, so my skin might just be weird.</li>
            <li> I used it in the past, but ran out.  </li>
            <li> All I can say is that my mom swears by this face cleanser/astringent - not sure of the correct cosmetic terminology.</li>
            <li> Just put in a small spray bottle, in gym bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this product is to blame, or if it&#x27;s something else I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Who does not love roae petal toner???</li>
            <li> This is NOT your ordinary witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product 3 times not sure why it works</li>
            <li> I use usually twice a day on my face.  </li>
            <li> green one and mud mask, manuka honey, and this!</li>
            <li> Not sure...</li>
            <li> I will diffidently buy this item again-!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Transfer it into a small spray bottle you can buy at any drugstore, and mist your face every time you need a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> I use it in a small spray bottle and mist it on my face after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The smell feels artificial and old.</li>
            <li> You can find this at drug stores, but the price on Amazon is usually lower.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use toners.</li>
            <li> I love using witch hazel but hate the smell!</li>
            <li> No more over-priced alcohol based toners for me.</li>
            <li> The lid has a fairly small opening, so maybe they changed it since the lid criticisms were published.</li>
            <li> Runs small...</li>
            <li> I used this in the past as i like the smell.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s not potent</li>
            <li> Not sure about the quality, haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a fond believer of no-pain-</li>
            <li> In fact, I stopped using my usual acne wash and lotion for a month</li>
            <li> It helps to soothe my skin, especially when I have some rash or redness because of using wrong skincare products or allergy.</li>
            <li> Had a couple of blemishes and in a few days it was almost unnoticeable!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s floral smelling but not overwhelmingly so</li>
            <li> For a person who has oily skin, it made sense to me that I use a product that would help strip away that excessive oil and</li>
            <li> I usually just put a bit on my face after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I apply with a small cotton ball after washing and before moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how my results will be, however I had to write about the scent.</li>
            <li> whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that this toner helps to keep my skin tone even, and pores small--</li>
            <li> I usually apply it after I wash my face, and I do so using either a cotton ball or those cotton rounds.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if its evening my skin tone</li>
            <li> , I have used those in the past.  </li>
            <li> and I tried this as a last resort to buying expensive products for my face.</li>
            <li> I still may get some small zits here and there, but nothing like I was getting</li>
            <li> I am not sure how</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t attract bees.</li>
            <li> , I got small breaks outs again, just not as severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just could not get past the scent.</li>
            <li> I usually mix this with lavender or tea tree oil and use as a toner at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m unable to comment on what the results will ultimately be-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder it</li>
            <li> Not sure what else it is supposed to do for you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if buy again,</li>
            <li> think if this product didn&#x27;t have glycerin in it, I wouldn&#x27;t be experiencing an excessive oil issue.&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin can also cause allergic reactions in some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more outbreaks.  </li>
            <li> i usually associate it with st Ives</li>
            <li> In the past, I used the toners by Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> , no more burn.</li>
            <li> I usually do after washing.</li>
            <li> not sure what it does</li>
            <li> ill make this brief.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this product.</li>
            <li> But I keep on getting small pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens over the past year and there was no miracle that took place</li>
            <li> I have to say: I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I have gotten in the past.</li>
            <li> I have always had small pores</li>
            <li> I usually use the body shops Petri toner.</li>
            <li> No burning, no feeling, not sure if its working.</li>
            <li> Received it within a few days!</li>
            <li> It smooths out your skin, prevents breakouts, minimizes pores and makes your face smell like a bed of roses (without being too heavily scented!)</li>
            <li> My skin definitely took a beating to this weird weather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got natural ingredients, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what some paraben or crazy methysulphate type ingredient will do to your health.</li>
            <li> I use to use a different toner that would dry out my skin really bad.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter, because it closed and cleaned my big ugly pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have any pimple fighting medicines in it, but that would defeat the purpose, and I think the witch hazel does essentially the same things just not so violently.</li>
            <li> No strong chemical smell and no choking!</li>
            <li> Ever since puberty hit me, I&#x27;ve had an issue with small, hard bumps that have plagued my forehead, temples, and even my cheeks.</li>
            <li> However it is not suitable for me as it dries up my skin.  </li>
            <li> a few of the marks were there a week after I cleared them which was not a good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my previous review because I am really annoyed at something done by AMAZON.</li>
            <li> Not sure I will keep buying it, big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have really weird skin, dry on my cheeks but oily on my forehead, and I have blackheads &amp; zits galore.</li>
            <li> I noticed it was less irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Seriously, didn&#x27;t even get the usual PMS breakout.</li>
            <li> and since I hardly wear any makeup if at all, that works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, I look every time I&#x27;m somewhere where it might be sold</li>
            <li> I hardly even use my Retin-A anymore.</li>
            <li> I can hardly see my pores now.</li>
            <li> Getting hard to find this stuff for some reason.</li>
            <li> And I have always had hard skin to manage.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes hard to find in person</li>
            <li> This brand is hard to find in the drugstores.  </li>
            <li> Witch Hazel is hard to find in retail.</li>
            <li> I even picked at it a little bit with disinfected hands and tissues because I was frustrated I did not have time to go get a facial when school assignments and exams prevented it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even had bad reactions from products for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I was surprised it broke me out so badly.  </li>
            <li> I am 15 with combination skin and a bad history with acne and this helped clear up some of my blemishes.</li>
            <li> After reading these negative reviews I went home to take a look at the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it at least twice a day for about a week</li>
            <li> and I suspect it is at least partly attributed to this toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel before but never liked the odor.</li>
            <li> I ran out of some expensive spray astringent for my face, so I poured some of this into the empty bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is delicate and does not burn my face.</li>
            <li> Common sense, people.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with irritation, and have been using it at least twice a day for 3.5 months on my drier, hormonal-acne-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> but if she&#x27;s noticed this on me, she hasn&#x27;t complained about it.</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel to take away the swelling, itch and pain from bug bites.</li>
            <li> Also, avoid anything but the mildest soaps and NO scrubbing, itching, rubbing or anything that will weaken the delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Its convenient if i&#x27;m running late in the morning and don&#x27;t have time to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I have face break out problems so trying anything out there at least once.</li>
            <li> Leave the mask on your face for at least 15 minutes, and your skin will feel refresh and comforting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all-natural and therefore contains none of those nasty chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce and is also alcohol free (alcohol can be drying).</li>
            <li> To all those who think it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s really not.</li>
            <li> 5 negative stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Well duh,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eczema:  I tend to get eczema on my face which really sucks.</li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Almost no rose scent at all.  </li>
            <li> Seeing as I&#x27;m a sucker for organics</li>
            <li> It can burn delicate areas and dehydrate the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for at least three years at this point.</li>
            <li> so I won&#x27;t be using it anymore, at least not every day.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working but just a bit slow.  </li>
            <li> I just put some on and they slowly go away.</li>
            <li> and before I put my face moisturizer with spf on and once before bed after removing my makeup and then I apply another thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Amazon, don&#x27;t stick your stupid labels directly over the products packaging!!!</li>
            <li> The past few months, my face has been the worst it&#x27;s ever been in my whole life.</li>
            <li> No more smelling vinegar on my face!  </li>
            <li> Upper lid was broken and the plastic seal was punctured.&lt;br /&gt;Package was leaking !!</li>
            <li> I rarely get break outs, however after a week of using this product, my skin broke out horribly, even in places it doesn&#x27;t usually get acne/pimples in.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a bad breakout in the time that I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel in general, but I still get one or two every now and then.</li>
            <li> I now shave both my head and my face, then rinse with cold water to close the pores, slap on a little witch hazel, and finish off with a little aftershave.</li>
            <li> My usual routine includes washing my face with Cetaphil, applying Aztec Secret Indian Clay mask, Thayers Witch Hazel toner, and Age Defying Skin Clearing vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite a bit past puberty, but I still break out like a teenager with regularity and was getting tired of it.</li>
            <li> While I prefer no fragrance, this has a subtle fragrance I can handle.</li>
            <li> Putting toner on my legs just to use it up is kinda ridiculous, though.  </li>
            <li> so I did not realize that it was the cause of all my skin problems and kept using it for about a year,leading to serious consequences.</li>
            <li> And I still have serious acne problems even it has been one year since I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Subtle, feminine, and not overly astringent.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s MUCH less expensive than the department store brands.</li>
            <li> I like the subtle smell of roses and the way my skin feels after putting this on.</li>
            <li> I would order it again but think it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed especially if you have the hard to control combination skin types.</li>
            <li> If I was dehydrated enough my skin on my nose would start to peel, BAD.</li>
            <li> ; 😱 and facials, steaming, expensive make up helps somewhat however, you can&#x27;t always wear makeup or have facials everyday.</li>
            <li> Why waste hundreds of dollars on expensive toners?</li>
            <li> everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time with expensive toners...</li>
            <li> I was first very disappointed by the smell.</li>
            <li> hard to find products like that!</li>
            <li> it is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from bad skin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> I usually get expensive, don&#x27;t need to with this product</li>
            <li> I often buy things only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought it multiple times and have never been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not more expensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least a couple years now &amp; hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> My face had been breaking out so badly the past couple months with an oily, greasy-looking t-zone and random severe dry spots.</li>
            <li> -1 star due to scent, which I find unpleasant after a while).</li>
            <li> totally addicted.</li>
            <li> Made my skin feel silky and refreshed - although I was tired, my skin didn&#x27;t show it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have never liked using toners because they always smell weird</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even broken out since I started using this all-natural product.</li>
            <li> It also is not at all irritating</li>
            <li> The cap was broken off during shipping, but the seal underneath is still intact.</li>
            <li> When Im too tired to wash my face</li>
            <li> the product, but confused by the ingredient listing.  </li>
            <li> I am just too tired to take my makeup off.</li>
            <li> but no on a regular base.  </li>
            <li> and I was tired of applying greasy face cream.</li>
            <li> never felt stinging or annoyed by the smell.</li>
            <li> Made me breakout and was irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken, tear punctured, product leaked...</li>
            <li> I cannot believe a scrub leaves behind.</li>
            <li> This was a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> But this product allows me to additionally cleanse, refresh and soothe my skin without irritating any bit of inflamed skin</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t broken out from using this yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally addicted.</li>
            <li> Yet the cap was broken.</li>
            <li> since I used this toner, my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wiped it away leaving the bottle looking the worse for it and sticky with label</li>
            <li> Not great...</li>
            <li> i feel as if anything my skin has gotten much worse.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always disgusted by how much my face wash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients on Amazon&#x27;s product page is outdated.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference on him, but then again he&#x27;s going through that adolescence age and doesn&#x27;t keep up with the routine I&#x27;ve given him.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and hate using toner with alcohol in it.</li>
            <li> Very subtle and soothing.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little shocked that something so liquid could moisturize so well</li>
            <li> I had used witch hazel along time ago on my skin and had a bad reaction (dried out and broke out)</li>
            <li> I have had terrible bouts with adult onset acne.  </li>
            <li> I bought this toner after someone had mentioned I try using witch hazel on my 12 year old&#x27;s horrible bout of acne.</li>
            <li> Ugly short fat squatty ugly bottle.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin but always take care of my skin and usually avoid bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> and it dried out my face :(</li>
            <li> and I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted!</li>
            <li> Absolutely obsessed with this combo.</li>
            <li> This may seem silly</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with how this toner makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The title speaks for itself hahah sorry</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to this stuff!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this product or Seller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe it was the way it reacted to my skin, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after you can&#x27;t go wrong....</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> I was so insecure.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention, you can&#x27;t go wrong with rose-scented</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there is no cure for dyshidrosis and witch hazel</li>
            <li> Or do they have the wrong ingredients</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am allergic to it.</li>
            <li> You wont be sorry</li>
            <li> im sad</li>
            <li> I randomly get pimples.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a weird feeling.</li>
            <li> This toner gave me horrible tiny bumps and clogged all of my pores.</li>
            <li> Ill be ordering another bottle soon</li>
            <li> No reason to spend a lot of $$ on expensive toners -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m obsessed.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot speak to its effect on troubled or fussy skin.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am not happy!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to give this product 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Desperate, I decided to cut out the expensive Estroblock pills and stop using face wash.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this stuff burns my face.</li>
            <li> Give this combo a try, you won’t be sorry.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It leaves this weird oily, sticky residue coating on my face that I can&#x27;t describe.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this toner.</li>
            <li> Does not smell at all like regular witch hazel, which I find horrible.  </li>
            <li> I had tried other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; ones before that unfortunately smelled terrible!!</li>
            <li> Needless to say that I was distraught.</li>
            <li> developed!&lt;br /&gt;I was completely shocked and confused.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out very badly.</li>
            <li> Through some bad eating habits, stress, and a cold, my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out yet.</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t buy my bottle from Amazon, I would hate to think that someone with troubled skin like mine (made worse by outdoor exercise) will miss out on this product because of misinformation.</li>
            <li> (now I&#x27;m feeling terrible for the thousands of times I&#x27;d applied the harsh acid toners to my face.)</li>
            <li> The reaction got worse and worse until, within a minute of using it, a nasty rash spread across my face and stayed their for a couple of days even though I cleaned the witch hazel off my face immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its crazy to imagine not using a toner and leaving all that on your skin unknowingly.</li>
            <li> It does not linger though, so not to worry if you are like me and crazy senstive to scents.</li>
            <li> She said I was in desperate need of one.</li>
            <li> any crazy ingredients are in it.</li>
            <li> can practically fry chicken with the amount of oil</li>
            <li> My cotton pad is dirty every time I&#x27;m finished wiping my face</li>
            <li> Plain witch hazel smells terrible.</li>
            <li> but this product proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one, folks!  </li>
            <li> Appears to work as well as my very expensive toner.  </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have very difficult combination skin.</li>
            <li> After one week of use, my skin has broken out very badly.</li>
            <li> It keeps my rosacea under control, and has done the impossible, cleaned out my blackhead problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I did have a nasty batch of ingrown hairs on my legs--the really awful sort with red, painful bumps and whatnot.  </li>
            <li> So basically I lost 1/2 of my product from bad bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that I cannot say anything bad about this.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily skin bad</li>
            <li> And after using it for TWO DAYS, I broke out bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad I can&#x27;t use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see anything bad happened to my skin after over 3 weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> gave it 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stink as bad as some people said it does.</li>
            <li> nothing bad on it.</li>
            <li> This has drastically cleared my skin, I used to have bad breakouts around my period</li>
            <li> However, it has a bad smell after I put it on my face.</li>
            <li> Too bad I found this product just now.</li>
            <li> Used this on a really bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised, helps in some bad skin condition as cleanser and stringent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look like I had a bad sunburn that I was recovering from.</li>
            <li> My lips start to peal really bad.</li>
            <li> I was badly burnt and this healed it almost over night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Garden tomato wasn&#x27;t that bad though.</li>
            <li> Man, is this stuff supposed to smell this bad?</li>
            <li> I am amazed that Thayers can create a product that works but dosent smell bad.</li>
            <li> I am seriously shocked at how well this takes off my eye makeup after washing face, and it reduces redness, tightens pores and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> This has no alcohol, which is terrible for the skin and unnecessarily dries it out.</li>
            <li> and I was so shocked on how it worked well with my skin.</li>
            <li> the moisturizers I was using, were making my face break out and were giving me painful cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> itchy, ugly looking, and dryout.</li>
            <li> Put it in the fridge and apply it cold!</li>
            <li> Does anyone know what this could be? :(</li>
            <li> milky white!!!I can&#x27;t believe I bought it from amazon, I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> As one who suffers from awfully stubborn combination skin, I found it very difficult to find anything that would keep my acne in check.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ugh, the burt&#x27;s bees one is nothing but alcohol! :(</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with what I received.</li>
            <li> and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of witch hazel and</li>
            <li> So, this morning I applied the toner on before I applied my make-up, then I applied an oil base foundation just to see if it could handle the oil.</li>
            <li> But I hate Thayers toner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t hate it</li>
            <li> HATE the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> and I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> Blech</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give that alcohol burn that I hate.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of witch hazel</li>
            <li> I quit using it, I find toners annoying to apply anyway.</li>
            <li> or I would get those terrible under grounders that hurt so flippen bad you want to just hide under the covers until its gone.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, making me sick.</li>
            <li> BAD DECISION!  </li>
            <li> I had pregnancy acne very bad</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find out it leaks!</li>
            <li> I have insane combination skin, with a forehead that gets so greasy</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t drying whatsoever, even living out here on the east coast in this terrible winter</li>
            <li> My skin broke out horribly.</li>
            <li> Its part of my skin regimen that has helped me get rid of my nasty cystic acne</li>
            <li> My Fiancee said it smelled like pesticides when he leaned over to kiss me which made me crack up hysterically</li>
            <li> but I have terribly acne prone skin</li>
            <li> and this product broke me out quite terrible.</li>
            <li> I used to have horrible skin like a teenager.  </li>
            <li> I had to wash it off my face soon after I applied it, because it gave me a terrible headache.</li>
            <li> have managed to cover up the terrible smell of witch hazel!</li>
            <li> Well, after trying a drugstore foundation a while ago, I broke out into the worst acne I had ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> I usually hate the scent of roses!</li>
            <li> It is horrible.  </li>
            <li> It picks up all the nasty stuff that my wash doesn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> This did not improve my skin at all and is the worst toner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> totally horrible!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have horrible skin or acne</li>
            <li> It may work well for somebody but to me it is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> Awful.</li>
            <li> Caused me to break out horribly.</li>
            <li> I used to get miserable bumps in my bikini area, but not anymore with this stuff!!</li>
            <li> but it was one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever put on my face.</li>
            <li> However in my case my skin got oily(even though it is never oily) and all my pores became horribly clogged.</li>
            <li> Instead I always feel like I rubbed some sticky, disgusting thing on my face and need to wash it off.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have the cooling effect of an alcohol based toner.&lt;br /&gt;My skin didn&#x27;t break out when using it, but it also didn&#x27;t seem to pick up that much dirt compared to an OTC toner such as clean &amp; clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a good buy for the price, but I&#x27;m not sold that witch hazel has any advantages over other toners. If you want to use a non-alcohol based toner though, I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I have tried a couple different witch hazels but this is by far the best. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t have that potent smell witch hazel usually has. I don&#x27;t have dry skin but found that witch hazel would dry my skin out and it would take a couple of days for my skin to return to normal. This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all and I feel refreshed after using it. It does the job of witch hazel but actually soothes my skin and leaves my skin soft and feeling hydrated. I will be purchasing this product for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> LOVED the smell and feel.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  The scent is a light, not overpowering rose.  I use this as a toner after cleansing my face or just to refresh my skin and it is perfect. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> great product,  not harsh or does not dry out the skin</li>
            <li> I prefer Dickson&#x27;s itch hazel. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin like I do with Dickson&#x27;s (smaller pores, clearer skin, more removal of dirt/make up/grime. It was refreshing, but I don&#x27;t feel like it DID anything.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, also removes left over traces of make up.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great for after facial regimen and just fredhening up throughout the day... None alchololic and has Aloe Vera</li>
            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;I use this within 2 minutes of washing my face to get rid of any tap water/leftover residue. I put some on a cotton round and go in an upwards/anti gravity motion from my d&amp;eacute;colletage up to my forehead (and around the back of my neck to get rid of shampoo residue). Even when I don&#x27;t wear any make up, I can see the discoloration from tap water on a white cotton round.&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing (but not aggressive at all).&lt;br /&gt;It feels appropriately gentle.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for months (I use twice a day, every day) and I think it&#x27;s a perfect product with a great price.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my skin. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week now but I can already see a difference. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, it&#x27;s fast drying, and the slight smell of rose petals tops it off.</li>
            <li> I am 86 years of age and I use Thayers rose petal witch hazel daily.  My grandmother used it and because of my admiration for her I began using it.  I am delighted to find it available again and I have introduced my daughter to this amazing, refreshing skin freshener and she is now a satisfied &amp;#34;Thayers&amp;#34;  lady.</li>
            <li> I USE THAYERS ROSE PEDAL WITCH HAZEL ON MY FACE AS A ASTRIGENT TO CLOSE PORES AFTER WASHING, THERE IS NO STING AND IT IS NOT HARSH, MAKES MY SKIN FEEL NICE AND IS NOT LIKE OTHER NAME BRANDS THAT COST BIG BUCKS.  IT ARRIVED ON TIME AND WAS PACKAGED VERY WELL TO PREVENT ANY BREAKAGE.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE using this. I have extremely irritable skin, and this toner always comes to the rescue. I love the cucumber one  thayers makes too. I looked for a long time to find something that was alcohol free with aloe vera in it that I could use on a daily basis. This is it! It also has a wonderful rose smell from the rose extract in it as well.</li>
            <li> my skin loves this stuff!!!!! and it&#x27;s very picky</li>
            <li> I really love the scent of this toner. I use it daily, every morning and night. I haven&#x27;t seen any dramatic change or anything, but it&#x27;s so far one of my favorite toner.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff and it makes my skin feel really clean and fresh.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a must after washing your face &amp; before applying moisturizer! The smell is heavenly &amp; I haven&#x27;t had any irritation after 2 weeks of consistent use!</li>
            <li> Product is great! Bottle was damaged but useable.</li>
            <li> Essential in my skin care routine. Great for acne-prone skin. I ran out of this toner and didn&#x27;t use it for while. Took me a month to figure out why my skin started to break out more than it did and looked dull. Plus there&#x27;s no alcohol! I use it day and night.</li>
            <li> Very good for improving the hydration in the face.</li>
            <li> Have used other more expensive toners before - but this one by far works the best. Feels soothing and soft on skin.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, and having used a similar product on my skin, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy I did, because I just love, love, love this stuff.  It has a delicate rose smell that&#x27;s not overpowering, and it&#x27;s much gentler than just using outright witch hazel.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a toner in the morning (sometimes) and at night before bed for about three weeks now.  Through some bad eating habits, stress, and a cold, my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out yet.</li>
            <li> smells great put I put it on my face it leaves it feeling soft</li>
            <li> Love it! Beautiful fragrance</li>
            <li> If you love witch hazel for toning the face you will love the change of scent. This tones the face perfectly and gently.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express how much I love this. I use it as a toner after cleansing and before moisturizing, and also just to refresh during the day. Already plan to order another bottle. Smells great and leaves skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just bought another bottle, even though it&#x27;s pricier than most witch hazel. Well worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> Very good, skin looks bright!</li>
            <li> Love, this product, the aromatic rose petal and the clarifying witch hazel, makes it the perfect clarifying toner,&lt;br /&gt;I would definately purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> My package arrived in perfect condition and this toner feels and smells delightful. There is a floral fragrance but it is in no way over powering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about six months and love it. I tried going back to regular witch hazel just to save a few bucks, but it wasn&#x27;t worth it. Smells great and is very refreshing as you put it on. I use it twice a day, morning and night.</li>
            <li> Product works well I use it about 3 times a week before bed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive alcohol free toner. This is a large bottle that does the job almost as well as my super expensive brands. I really like it and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Product is soothing and cooling.  Refreshing smell too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful toner for after cleansing. It does not dry out my skin. I have ordered it twice and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toner that works for my fairly sensitive skin. Although the rose smell is the scent of old women, I&#x27;m willing to overlook it. I usually get excessively dry using toner but this one is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely DESPISE however, about this product is the packaging. The bottle is ALWAYS LEAKING. I packed a full new bottle in my luggage on the plane and when I got off, half the solution was gone! When I flew back I was careful and tried to saran wrap the bottle opening before screwing on the cap. It still managed to leak everywhere. So basically I lost 1/2 of my product from bad bottle design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s relatively inexpensive so I don&#x27;t mind, I&#x27;m just going to make sure that I put it in a travel safe container next time I fly. Fix your bottle, Thayers!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! It helped clear up my acne. It has a great smell too.</li>
            <li> Just recently stopped using facial makeup  because of the talc, and began using this witch hazel. It feels lovely and smells gently. I&#x27;m 56 and have pretty good skin but sure makes my skin feel great and cleaner!</li>
            <li> This cleanses my skin without the sting of alcohol. My face is moist not that squeaky, shiny clean astringent normally leaves behind. No irritation either.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Does not dry out my skin like alcohol-based toners. Also, it smells great! I&#x27;ve started using it to clean my dog&#x27;s ears too.</li>
            <li> The first few days that I used this product were great, I was ok with the smell that reminds me of my grandmother. But after a few days I noticed that my face was more oily than usual and within 5 days of using this product, I had a major breakout that I could not control. Day 2 after I stopped using this product, my face was clear again. After reading these negative reviews I went home to take a look at the bottle and there it was 11/2007 on the bottom of the bottle. I guess it was a smart move, sell expired stuff on Amazon, they&#x27;ll never know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well now we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t be purchasing this product ever again.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Refreshing and balancing and can be used for so many different things!</li>
            <li> I use this to freshen my face up when I am wearing no makeup. I splash it, spritz it, dab it on. It is also part of my end of day cleansing routine. I wash, occasionally use a clarisonic or exfoliant, dry, and follow with soaked cotton and toner. I personally think it brings my skins PH back to balance making my moisturizer more effective. It also helps remove any trace makeup or product. My skin is on the dry/sensitized side. I also use this when my skin feels hot. seems to calm it down. Rose oil is known for being a soothing ingredient. Probably not the best for super oily folks, maybe try the aloe or lavender version instead</li>
            <li> Using this a couple of times a day, little pimples went away leaving my 12 year old&#x27;s skin clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very oily acne prone very sensitive skin and I love this. My make up stays on so much longer when I use this prior to putting it on. First I wash my face with my Vichy face wash, then I use this with a cotton pad, I wait a bit then just wash my face with super cold water to close my pores then I moisturize :) and my face stays matte for so much longer.</li>
            <li> Great.... I used Rose petal witch hazel before.. it always done wonders to remove make up..</li>
            <li> I was very wary to try this product, as I hate the scent most products have that claim to be &amp;#34;rose-scented.&amp;#34; While this has no such claim, I was under the belief that it would have a smell due to it&#x27;s name. It did, but to my delight, it was a lovely and refreshing scent rather than the sickly sweet rose scent you will find with most other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this as a toner in my new skincare regime, and my skin has never looked better or felt softer. My blackheads are slowly but surely becoming fewer and fewer, and my skin is far more radiant. I think this will remain a staple in my regime for years to come.</li>
            <li> I like this toner although I haven&#x27;t seen my pores getting smaller. I have been using this toner for a week.</li>
            <li> Made my face break out into a rash. I will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> I do like the smell of this product but feel like it leaves a residue on my face. Another victim in the product graveyard.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves skin feeling refreshed and looking radiant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It is very refreshing. My skin feels amazing after using this product.</li>
            <li> Flowery fragrances can give me a headache and I was concerned this would be too fragrant, but it&#x27;s not!  I am very pleased.  There&#x27;s a hint of rose petal but it&#x27;s definately not overpowering!  Leaves your face feeling really nice and refreshed!  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased THAYER rose when I was in China, and I love the smell. And then, this year I came to the USA, and the first product I purchased for facial daily care is THAYER. My skin is sensetive and Oil in T-zone. This product is just fit with my skin type.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Has been wonderful in helping my dry skin.  I&#x27;ve had some red bumps on my chest area lately and this cleared em up after only 5-6 uses... so happy!</li>
            <li> Best of all worlds here: aloe, rose, and witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Refreshing way to remove makeup and cleanse my face at night. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Very gentle and the smell of roses is divine!!!!</li>
            <li> great as a daily toner!</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a couple of days ago and I&#x27;m already a huge fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everyone else says, it smells like my grandmother. Personally, I love the smell but some of you may not; it sticks around for a little bit after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning and night I have used this and I feel a change already. I have eczema around my mouth and I have to say that this is certainly helping it not be so dry. One thing I do have to say though is that it does burn my face. Now, I&#x27;m not docking a star for that because I feel like the outcome outweighs a couple seconds of a burning sensation. So, beware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I cannot say anything bad about this. I love the smell and what it does. Certainly have made a face routine with this and I can&#x27;t see myself without it.</li>
            <li> Glides on nicely and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin like regular witch hazel I guess the aloe really does work. If you want to try the product I would definitely say go for it!</li>
            <li> My second purchase, this product is great! My skin is pretty sturdy and it&#x27;s tough making it look nice, conditioned and smooth and this product surely does that. There is a huge difference between this brand and others; sure you pay more but it&#x27;s sooo worth it. Other cheaper brands contain 14% grain alcohol (ouch!) even though their label says Witch Hazel :^(</li>
            <li> Great toner! This toner will now replace my regular, drugstore-bought brands. It&#x27;s sensitive enough on my skin while still cleaning well, and I feel good knowing there aren&#x27;t a ton of chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> love this stuff. Great for acne and sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product while looking for an alcohol free astringent/toner. Found great reviews on Caswell &amp; Massey site re product. Skin feels great and no dryness from alcohol and the Aloe Vera is a big plus.. My face feels smoother because of the aloe vera.</li>
            <li> You get absolutely the most pleasant and refreshing feeling on your face when you use this Witch Hazel as toner. The rose aroma relaxes you at night while doing everything a toner is supposed to do. This also helped me with my acne problems and certainly helped prevent breakouts by cleaning my pores. This is alcohol free btw unlike many other withc hazel out there. I am just absolutely in love with it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but my face and skin has really improved only after using it for just a few weeks. Pimples and small bumps have completely disappeared and red marks from old acne scars seem to be improving. I have a combination of oily and dry skin. After using, my skin feels refreshed and it doesn&#x27;t leave it greasy or too dry. It smells great too! Thanks for the great product!</li>
            <li> Smells Great last a long time</li>
            <li> I just made myself all natural face wash, toner and nightly serum and this is the main component of my toner. I think it is my best concoction out of the three! My face feels so fresh and clean after! I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this witch hazel.  It works well as a skin toner and smells nicely. It was also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> loved it especially the rose scent Nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over year now.  This is a great product and something that&#x27;s part of my everyday facial care routine.  I&#x27;ve even bought it for my teenage daughters.</li>
            <li> I use as a quick face wash that I keep on my nightstand for lazy nights. It&#x27;s such a gentle toner and the fragrance is lovely. It cleans well (I can see the makeup and dirt on my cotton pad) and my skin does feel tighter and refreshed, but not dry. So glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin feels so nice!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Smells nice and is very soothing while acting as a toner.</li>
            <li> Gentle, yet effective. Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Came quickly. Product as described</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Feels cool and soothing when applied to skin. Leaves face smooth and makes a good base for applying my makeup.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great. I advise that you put it in a travel size spray bottle for best effect</li>
            <li> Wonderful to use; fresh, clean scent, and super gentle.</li>
            <li> Very gentle product and prompt customer service. I will definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li> Good product. Timely shipment.</li>
            <li> Reduces redness and swelling</li>
            <li> This product burns my skin, I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with. It&#x27;s supposed to be alcohol free but something is not right with the formula. I used the cucumber version and it does not burn and feels great. I am going to contact Thayer to see if I got a fake product, if so there will be big problems with the seller.</li>
            <li> Great product.  The smell is hevenly and love that it is alcohol free.  I spritz this on every morning after cleansing and before applying my Serum</li>
            <li> Great for the face ...</li>
            <li> I usually use Biore and liked it but felt like it dried out my skin.  I like this because it has no alcohol.  Alot of people might not like the smell but I find it invigorating and refreshing.  With such a big bottle, its worth the price and I will continue to buy.  It doesnt make my skin break out and the ingredients are a wonderful concoction.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with my skin type. As a fellow online shopper, I think it&#x27;s important to know the reviewers skin type so I can compare with my own. SUPER OILY.&lt;br /&gt;How oily? Let&#x27;s put it this way. On average I use 4-6 oil blotting papers each time to remove shine. I do this 2-3 times a day to not look like butter. My supposedly long lasting 15-h foundation only lasts 2 hours before melting and I don&#x27;t use eyeliner (even though I would love to!) because my eye lids melt everything; pencil, gel, powder, liquid. Anything. That is how oily I am. To add to my problems, I also have mild acne. I treat this with benzoid peroxide face wash, retinoid cream, and benzoid peroxide gel daily. I am simply adding the toner to my routine so any results or side effects are achieved with a combination of products. I will report as accurately as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now back to the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I received the package very quickly and at first I was a little apprehensive because the liquid looked like baby oil inside the bottle. Later at night, I finally opened it and I was wrong. The toner is very light, non-greasy, and smelled like roses. The smell was a bit strong when I first poured it on a cotton pad, but about 5 minutes after application, 95% of the smell went away. So for those who are worried about the scent, it goes away quickly! After applying the toner on my face I felt very clean and normal. I say normal meaning I didn&#x27;t fee dry and I didn&#x27;t feel oily either. It was great. I followed quickly with my usual moisturizer and voila. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2: I woke up and my face was not as oily as before, pre-toner. Upon washing my face, it felt softer and smoother. Definite plus. After using the toner only once, I am already feeling a difference. Overall, my skin feels cleaner and less heavy with oil. If your goal is to find something to clean and sooth, this toner does a pretty good job. As for pore sizes or acne, I will have to update after I&#x27;ve used the products fora few weeks. I&#x27;m going to add the toner to my routine twice a day as recommended and will update soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One Month Later: I have lowered my use to once a day, at night, to clear away any excess dirt or makeup that was overlooked by the makeup remover + face wash. Aside from what I mentioned earlier, I did not notice any additional benefit of this toner. It definitely does help keep my pores cleaner but after a while, I still need to use clay masks or nose strips to remove the blackheads. Overall, I would say that using this toner wouldn&#x27;t hurt. I observed no negative reactions and it&#x27;s quite affordable as a toner for only $10!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations: For anyone looking for a general toner that covers all your bases, I would recommend this one due to its low costs and large quantity. (After one month, I barely used half the bottle.) For anyone looking to target anything specific like oiliness, acne, pores, etc, I would recommend to possibly keep shopping. Let me be clear that this toner is not bad, in fact, it&#x27;s a lot better than other toners I&#x27;ve tried because it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but it also did not fulfill the hopes that I had when trying it. If you have relatively good skin, go for it. This one is both good for your wallet and skin.</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Thayers witch hazel line... I wipe my face with it everyday. I don&#x27;t need to wash my face. (I don&#x27;t use foundation). My daughter also likes this. I want her to use natural products like this as opposed to Clearasil (drying). She loves the smell. We have cucumber and lavender too.</li>
            <li> Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found this. I had bought witch hazel before but didn&#x27;t think to look at it too much and realized when I got home that it contained alcohol. So I&#x27;m using that one for my body and this one for my face. Overall, a good product. My only huge issue with it is the smell. It smells grandma-ish to me and I hate it. I couldn&#x27;t just apply this as a &amp;#34;refresher&amp;#34; because then my face would smell like that. I always have to put moisturizer or something after it to block the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and feels wonderful. Nothing else to say other then GET IT!</li>
            <li> Everyone was raving about this product on various websites and at Amazon too. Buy it! you won&#x27;t be disappointed especially if you have the hard to control combination skin types.</li>
            <li> So good as a toner. very gentle for my skin.and i use it to be the diy mask also. i will re-buy this product. like it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell , very refreshing ,pores look smaller, I really like this product,</li>
            <li> I dont know what it is about this product but i have made it a daily routine. No burn and feels soothing. Best toner out there. I have sensitive skin and im happy say no irritation.</li>
            <li> I usually use this toner in the morning and it&#x27;s a great way to start my day. It is very fragrant, but the smell doesn&#x27;t linger too long on my skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues using this toner. It isn&#x27;t drying but it definitely gets my skin clean.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot! Can&#x27;t complain about it! Completely worth the price!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for YEARS. It has so many great uses. Soak your fingertips in a few tablespoons before doing your cuticles. Splash a little on you legs when youre wearing a skirt. The scent is rosy without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin clean, soft and smell very nice, I use everywhere even after hair removal. Felt really good after used, like you gave something good to your skin. Nothing can beat this witch hazel + aloe vera + rose water + alcohol free! Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> reasonable price. love its scent and works really well. use this every morning and night after wash my face and it&#x27;s big enough for 2months of supply</li>
            <li> but it lasts forever, smells amazing, cools and cleans my humid skin after a hard day and I think well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I saw it in another reviewers comments and I had to give it a shot, so happy I did and kudos to him (whomever he is!) for turning me on to it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this toner!  Yes, it&#x27;s roses, but a subtle rose instead of a fake perfume rose.  I also like the moisturizing qualities.  I do still experience breakouts using this toner, but I usually have to follow with a mild acne cream regardless of what toner I use.  I&#x27;d rather use this toner any day over the acne toners that dry my sensitive skin.  I took one star off because I find it leaves a mild film and slight shine on my skin, but since I use it at night it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> The gentleness of this product might be it&#x27;s downfall. This is coming from someone who has very sensitive skin! Gentle is usually best for me. However, the product just doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of toning my face or keeping the oil at bay. I expect toners to balance my combination skin, and this one doesn&#x27;t quite make the cut. It does help a little though, and it&#x27;s better than nothing. I will continue to use it until I get something better. Then, I will keep it as a backup. Probably won&#x27;t repurchase though.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this based on the other reviewers reviews. It smells great, and does not make my face feel dry although I can smell the alcohol in it. I am now replacing my Clarins toner with the rose petal toner. I am very impressed, and I am happy I went with this toner for my combination-sensitive skin! I believe it also helped with my break outs as well! It seems to really clean my skin, and clear it up after coming back from a weeks worth of flying back and fourth to Florida and Hawaii.</li>
            <li> I use this morning &amp; night.  Does not dry my skin &amp; has a great smell.  I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> this toner is awesome...best ever!!!!been using it now for 5years.  cant beat the price either.  love love love love it!!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price of this product, it is definitely worth the buy. It lasts for a very long time. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and absolutely love the way it feels on my face and the scent.</li>
            <li> Ok first of all the bottle is huge for the price, and the packaging is beautiful. This product is something that I want to love, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that I&#x27;m just putting scented water on my face and calling it toner. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it smells great (very light), but I haven&#x27;t noticed any real change since using this daily over the past week. Still, it&#x27;s an easy addition to my beauty routine and feels very pampering and clean, so I&#x27;ll likely keep doing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the high ratings and reviews for this toner. If anything,  it makes my face sooo much oilier and greasier. Hence, I am breaking out more frequently.  I am finishing the bottle because I already spent my money on it, but I so wish I could have it back. I will not buy ever again and do not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction! Great customer service and products! A+++</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I happened to come across it here on Amazon and I&#x27;ve ordered it over and over and over again. I can definitely see a difference in my skin tone and often get compliments on my skin. I truly believe that this stuff is a big part of that. The smell is amazing and it just gives a nice feel to your skin. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to this , it may be a good product, but, unfortunately. it may not suit Asian sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Oh My Gossshh, ive been had this product for more than 3 weeks or so, first it smells great, i use it every night after my tea tree oil wash from trader joes and i love it, and second leaves my skin soft. Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! It leaves my face super clean, soft and fresh.. I have somewhat oily skin bad it works wonderful:)</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for almost 3 years and really really like it. It&#x27;s so great that I don&#x27;t want to change anymore. I have normal/dry skin. I have tried a lot of toners from Shishedo, Lancome, Estee Lauder to a lot of drugstore brands in the past and I will stay with this one since it&#x27;s the best. I may try other flavor later. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this toner to clean his ski, as he is prone to break out occasionally.  We have been ordering it for 3 years now and my son is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little while now and I aboslutely love it! I can notice my skin looking less red and irriated. I have acne problems so I usually use a toner with acne medicine in it so I was worried if I switched to this I&#x27;d break out. But that hasn&#x27;t been the case. It&#x27;s very gentle but certainly keeps the pores clean. As for the smell, if you don&#x27;t like heavy florals then I suggest trying a different kind. As for me, I love rose scent so it&#x27;s perfect. Will certianly buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever. I use it to cleanse my face every day and my skin is amazing because of it. It has a fresh rose scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering.</li>
            <li> A great classic toner, smells lovely, and doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out. Perfect for the nights when you can&#x27;t bother to fully wash your face to remove your makeup, or for any other time your skin needs a fragrant, refreshing pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. Makes my skin feel soft. Removes remainder of makeup my face wash misses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more natural, alcohol-free toner. This is great stuff! Very pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve been using it at least twice a day for about a week and my face seems to have a bit more of a glow. The price is decent, too.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and is actually moisturizing because it does not contain alcohol. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Best toner I&#x27;ve ever used! very faint rose sent that is sweet and works great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for myself. I can&#x27;t believe that I had never heard of this product before! The smell is AMAZING!!! It does everything it promises too also...leaves my skin feeling clean, but NOT dry. Just very soft and smooth. I won&#x27;t be letting myself run out of this product...I&#x27;m also anxious to try the lavender version :)</li>
            <li> I started using this toner 2 months ago and really like it! It does what it promises i.e. closes up pores. I can see an improvement in the texture of my skin and perhaps a small reduction in my acne. I really like the smell and the fresh feeling after use!</li>
            <li> Fantastic rose smell!  Very clean and soft feel after applying the product.  It is one of the best toner I have used.  Strongly recommend to anyone who loves a product made with nature ingredients and rose smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently begun using toners again, and this is definitely my favorite. It feels great after washing your face and you can feel your skin tightening a bit. Does not sting at all (which most toners don&#x27;t) and the scent is heavenly! Also feels very refreshing in the morning when removing excess oil. Wonderful product and it&#x27;s a big bottle so you get a good value for your money. It does seem that only a little on a cotton ball goes a long way so I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last quite awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: First purchased in October 2011, getting ready to reorder now (August 2012). There is still an inch or so left in the bottle but I want to make sure I don&#x27;t run out! Still love this product and the results with it :)</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It smells great and does a good job as a toner.</li>
            <li> I love thayer&#x27;s, And it smells really like roses.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this product. I like its calming effect on my face. It relieves the dryness after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to waster my time to typing .every body know it is great Value.Is nice toner I&#x27;ve never had .American Love Thayer</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day before moisterizer and haven&#x27;t gotten any pimples since.  Dr. OZ recommends witch hazel as an astringent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle now and couldn&#x27;t be happier with my skin! I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily since I first purchased it, and hardly have any more breakouts these days. Will continue to buy</li>
            <li> it is wonderful cleanser, mild with lovely feel...must have for always.</li>
            <li> I have been using for several weeks and am quite pleased. My skin is soft and the scent is quite lovely. I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing , like an orgasm for your face!</li>
            <li> very good product! like it very much</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. I came in quickly and was boxed well.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! I&#x27;ve been using this toner for a while and it always leaves my skin looking and feeling very refreshed.  Gotten numerous compliments on my skin and I suspect it is at least partly attributed to this toner. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product is not available in the area where I live. I was glad to find it here. It&#x27;s great stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Makes your face feel so refreshed! Truly wonderful product if you have oily skin like me.</li>
            <li> I will not use any other toner ever again! This is the one and only toner you will ever need!</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I had good skin prior to using this. And after using it for TWO DAYS, I broke out bad. Even after I stopped using the product, it took a while for my face to clear back up to normal.</li>
            <li> The best.  Love love it.</li>
            <li> This astringent works fabulously. I recommend it and in no way am I being endorsed to write this comment. I&#x27;m a real person and so are you (hopefully) - BUY THIS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many toners in my 38 years, but this one is THE best.  Don&#x27;t pay tons of money for small bottles of toners, when you can get this huge bottle with the best smelling, most gentle, cleansing toner.  Even after a day in the sun, this will not hurt/burn my face.  It&#x27;s very cleansing and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight afterwards like a lot of other toners.  I originally bought this because of the inexpensive cost, but after time, and once I could afford higher end beauty products, I found myself coming back to this toner.  It&#x27;s the best and I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for a very long time. It has Multi uses and one of them, an aftershave splash is refreshing, cools the skin, pleasant fragrance and reduces redness and lightens sun damaged skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin so keep using brand named mild toner: shishedo, clarins etc. First time tried this one felt stinging on the face then retried again the same. Now just use it for moisturing body and neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted! totally addicted. I ran out this week and couldn&#x27;t bring myself to throw out the bottle until the new bottle arrived in the mail, hoping I could eek out a few more skin nourishing droplets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you have got to try it! I have insane combination skin, with a forehead that gets so greasy you&#x27;d think someone had drained 6 pounds of bacon on it and cheeks that get dry, red and patchy if the wind blows a little too hard on them. I dampen a cotton pad with this and stroke it across my skin, and the results are amazing - cheeks are softened, forehead is cleared of shiny greasiness and relieved of the bumps that can so often be found there. it&#x27;s alcohol free and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, either. the smell is an artificial rose smell, which may not be for everyone, but others have remarked that it has that clean soap smell instead. the last bottle I bought lasted me for about 9 months of once daily swabbings, plus whatever portion my daughter has used, so it&#x27;s also a bargain, even counting the shipping cost!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been having a lot of trouble finding good products made by companies that don&#x27;t do any animal testing, so was I relieved to find that the manufacturer&#x27;s website states that \\&quot;all thayers products are vegetarian and never tested on animals\\&quot;. yay!</li>
            <li> Love the hint of rose smell and has done wonders to my skin, awesome product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product!</li>
            <li> I adore this product! I have used it twice a day for almost an entire year now and the difference in the appearance of my skin in dramatic. This is a beauty must have for everyone&#x27;s skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This smells great and works well.  I find it to be a very effective toner.  It does not dry out my skin like many stronger products.</li>
            <li> I am seriously shocked at how well this takes off my eye makeup after washing face, and it reduces redness, tightens pores and moisturizes. I&#x27;m not worried if I forget my face lotion from time to time as long as I&#x27;ve used this.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My FAVORITE product I use to tone my face after I wash it. Always buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I especially love the one with Aloe Vera!</li>
            <li> After using the regular version and then this, I prefer this one. It does not sting and has a light pleasant scent. A little goes a along way.&lt;br /&gt;Should always keep this in med cabinet. Helps with  hemorrhoids and cleansing in the area. Also helps with minor sunburns, cleaning off makeup, and toning face after shower.</li>
            <li> In the summer months I couldn&#x27;t use this because it made my skin too oily and I would have break outs.  Now that the air is drier and thus my skin is also drier, I am using this again without issues.</li>
            <li> I have used up a whole bottle. It is a toner and a flower water, that&#x27;s amazing because I can make my own rose mask every night~ The smell is gentle and sweet and cozy, I love it so much! Also, I believe my skin is more smooth and the color is much more even than before.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. Honestly, I&#x27;ve never really known what toners are supposed to do, I just know that you&#x27;re supposed to use it after you cleanse. LOL. But, I do love the way my skin feels after using this.  It&#x27;s very refreshing and it smells nice, too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  I have dry skin but sometimes I need a toner in problem spots.  The smell is excellent, it&#x27;s not harsh or drying and this bottle will last forever.  I make my own eye make-up remover using this and olive oil...great product to have your stash!</li>
            <li> I like the kind that has the alcohol in it. Women may prefer it but I use to help with ingrown hairs from shaving.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and hopefully the toner part of it is doing it&#x27;s job. I like using this more than a synthetic toner.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders for my skin, very refreshing.  The price per use is pennies, maybe less - great value.  Make sure you keep the cap closed however because fruit flies will randomly appear out of nowhere and gravitate towards this bottle haha.</li>
            <li> I have hormonal systic acne and use a lot of harsh drying treatments on my face when I have a breakout. This toner doesn&#x27;t seem to help with breakouts but it soothes my skin and leaves it soft and moisturizerized after drying treatments. It also smells wonderful!  I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy agin, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> Amazing scent of roses, I love the product</li>
            <li> I used it for moisturizer. It is as good as those expensive brand names, but the price is 1/10 of them. Highly recommended. I give it a 4 star since I like the smell of rose, but this one is a little too strong.</li>
            <li> Wow! Thus stuff is amazing. I&#x27;m using it with Dr Woods Shea Black Soap and my complexion is amazing. My skin is so soft. Absolutely obsessed with this combo.</li>
            <li> Just received this and I was thrilled by the scent.  True to life rose scent and no smell of witch hazel, which IMO stinks.  It made my skin very soft and actually changes the whole appearance of your skin.  Cools the skin too.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Vry gentle n mild at a great price!</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of witch hazel and this product only smells like roses. Thank goodness! I use this twice a day as a toner</li>
            <li> This product works great as a toner, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I absolutely love the rose fragrance, and it has a nice tightening/freshening effect on my face without drying it out. It doesn&#x27;t make an enormous visible difference after you use it, it&#x27;s a more subtle effect, but you will still be able to feel the difference.</li>
            <li> Love this.I&#x27;ll buy the product again but from a store since I found it cheaper at the store. It help to hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> Very good for my complicated skin. So soothing and smells nice. Not drying at all! Added it to my daily routine and now I am flawless.</li>
            <li> will continue to buy this as long as ingredients stay the same. Works great to really get off any excess makeup, oil, or anything on my face. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily, but helps me not to feel dry.</li>
            <li> Has a great smell and a nice feel on my face.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. Will buy more. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I really like the product, but I don&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well as the Clearasil brand toner. It smells great, and feel good though.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love. My skin is soft and the smell is great.</li>
            <li> A self proclaimed cosmetic skeptic, I&#x27;ve been using this for 3 months now. I am 48 years old and honestly my skin really does looks years younger. Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel w/rose has evened out my skin tone, gotten rid of red patches, and oily t-areas. Also, wrinkles are less noticeable now because the witch hazel cleans out the dirt, oils &amp; make-up trapped inside the fine lines which always makes the lines look worse. I also use it on my neck and it has tightened up the skin under my jaw as well.&lt;br /&gt;I went out to the lake today and throughout the day I spritzed my face with a bottle of toner I kept in my cooler. What a delightful treat from the heat!&lt;br /&gt;I like the soft rose scent. It&#x27;s not too overpowering to me and I follow it morning and evening with a moisturizer. To make application easier, I clean out an old moisturizer jar and put a stack of round gauze pads inside. Then I pour the witch hazel into the jar and cover. The pads are ready &amp; hassel free.&lt;br /&gt;Good thing is it&#x27;s cost effective, lasts a long time &amp; if you don&#x27;t like it you&#x27;re not out a whole lot of money - give it to a neighbor for her or him to try!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product, feels great on your skin, smells beautiful.  Bought one for myself and then ended ordering more for my daughters.  Seems like it will last for ages too. Excellent value for money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this toner and tried it for the first time yesterday. It is Fantastic! I must admit, I was wondering if the product could live up to the reviews when it comes to oily skin (I&#x27;ve tried everything), but I put it to the test. The rose scent is soothing and my skin feels soft and cool. So, this morning I applied the toner on before I applied my make-up, then I applied an oil base foundation just to see if it could handle the oil. After I applied the foundation, I applied the toner on a cotton ball and dabbed some over top of my finished look. It did not smear my make-up at all and it felt like I wasn&#x27;t even wearing make-up. Lets just say there are no signs of oil; AMAZING! I would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I have been using witch hazel for years, but never tried this one with aloe and rose petal; I love it!  The aloe leaves skin soft, not dry, and the rose scent is just right for me (I am so finicky about smells).</li>
            <li> Leave me skin feeling soft and fresh. Sometimes I skip lotion and apply Rose every few hours around the house. Good for sensitive skin. Fragrance is not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has never been more even. I love this product!</li>
            <li> works great for skin irritation</li>
            <li> I like to try different beauty products. Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve tried them all, but tried a lot... I always come back to Thayers brand products.  All natural and light rose scent, which is not overpowering like other beauty products on the market.</li>
            <li> Swear by this now! Use to buy Aveda rose water which is now discontinued, this works every bit as wonderfully! They sell it at vitamin shoppe for double!</li>
            <li> This is a great non-irritating toner. I like using it after I wash my face to balance out the pH of my skin. No more alcohol based toner for me. Witch hazel is much better. This stuff also is paraban free. Definitely good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been used this toner for 6 years, it make my skin become more and more healthier, and the smell is very comfort. I used it to be a toner mask, and it is very popular in Japan.</li>
            <li> Great product. Bought it to remove mud mask &amp; it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> This toner does a decent job at moisturizing and soothing skin.  Having no alcohol means that my skin does not get irritated after using it, which is awesome.  The reason for 4 stars is that it is quite fragrant, which might be troublesome for those sensitive to fragrance.  I think I will try a different toner from this product line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for alcohol free face toner  and found this at Amazon with great reviews.  Yes, as most reviewer said I feel so refreshed after using it even though it&#x27;s alcohol free.  But I don&#x27;t fall in love with rose fragrance so I will try unscented one next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for fast shipping as always!</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to more expensive natural toners. 12 oz is a lot for this great price. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This is ok for a toner but nothing special from my perspective.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to help or hurt much.</li>
            <li> I am alergic to this thing!! I used rose body lotions before and never feel this bad. And the smell is completely artificial, very unnatural and too too strong!!! Now I&#x27;m even sure if I&#x27;m allergic to rose water or just the fragrance thing. I really don&#x27;t dare try any rose water afterwards.....I think I will stick with prodicts with allergy test.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a great product and speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> When I use this toner on a regular basis, my skin looks amazing. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, so having a toner that can keep my skin naturally clear is important to me.  This toner is incredibly refreshing, too!  I do prefer the lavender a bit more than the rose, but they are both absolutely awesome for the price/quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, this is a staple in my medicine cabinet. I&#x27;ve been using it for about half a year, and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this toner &amp; find that with my oily skin it doesn&#x27;t make it worse (or really better). But the smell is nice.</li>
            <li> I really like this. My pores are alot tighter since using this and I feel like it just gets all the extra dirt off my face after I wash it.</li>
            <li> This toner really cleanses and moisturizes my oily/combo skin needs. It leaves my skin smelling like roses for hrs. I like that it is all natural with certified organic aloe vera.</li>
            <li> Because I have never used a product with witch hazel or rose petals this was a completely different product as to a normal toner with alcohol. Compared to what I have used in the passed this is very very easy on the skin it has a strong rose fragrents if you like the smell of Rose this is for you I wish I had went with the lavander.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s toning my skin the way I had hoped but I will keep using it. It make my skin feel rejuvinated &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Too soon to see if it makes my skin look better yet.</li>
            <li> Seems to be doing a good job. I had been using another product that was causing breakouts, but after a week using this they are gone.</li>
            <li> Old fashioned and still as great as ever.</li>
            <li> At first I really liked this product it made my skin feel clean and refreshed. The rose smell wasn&#x27;t my favorite though, it kinda reminds me of something an old lady would use. As I used the witch hazel toner more and more my skin began to break out more than usual and I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in my pore size. I have oilier skin so maybe that was the reason I&#x27;m not sure. I am very sad this product didn&#x27;t work out for my skin type because I read all these great reviews.</li>
            <li> I purchased the witches&#x27; hazel based on the great reviews on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not disappoint! I love the rose fragrance and how well it cleans my face before I layer on some lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a steal since it&#x27;s cheap and takes forever go through a whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy some more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s really refreshing and smells good too! Shipping is prompt as always and so much more convenient than having to go to the store to buy it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell, makes my skin feel great. I&#x27;m so glad I added it to my routine.</li>
            <li> Why use anything else?  My grandma used witch hazel all the time -- it&#x27;s inexpensive, gets the last traces of makeup off, kills bacteria, and conditions with the additional aloe vera.  I have to use a toner after washing my face, I just don&#x27;t feel complete without the smoothing effect a toner provides.  I love the scents available and the rose petal is heavenly :)  Awesome product and will probably use forever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and appreciate that there is no alcohol in the Witch Hazel.  I use it every day after cleansing my skin and it dries in a minute and absolutely does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I am using it for years after cleaning my face and neck. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I use night creame or eye cream after that. When my girl friends come visit they ask me and they take it home to try and love it. I will buy it again and again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner! Great for sensitive skin and has a nice light rose smell that isn&#x27;t too powerful. I feel like it really cleans my face and pores well because I see whats on my cotton ball after wiping down my face with this toner and its not pretty lol. Also leaves my face feeling super refreshed,clean,and feeling super soft. I have hormonal acne and this seems to help a bit with that as well, whenever I feel a zit coming on I soak a cotton ball in this toner and hold it on the inflamed area. Overall I am super happy with this purchase and would buy again. The amount you get for the price is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> This has a nice light scent. I mix it with plain witch hazel in a spray bottle to set my makeup when I am finished. I also use it on a cotton pad all over my face at night before I go to bed. Non-drying</li>
            <li> I have been using this Rose toner for over 2 years. It is a great natural product to use after washing the face, and also great for taking off make up!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to like this stuff as much as I do, it&#x27;s definitely the first thing I reach for when my face needs a refresher. The rose scent is lovely and lingers for quite a while. It isn&#x27;t drying whatsoever, even living out here on the east coast in this terrible winter it is still very moisturizing for a toner.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to my by my BFF. I use it after washing my face or to actually take makeup off. It hydrates so sometimes I don&#x27;t have to put moisturizer on at all.</li>
            <li> I heard some good reviews about Thayers toner and also heard witch hazel is really good for skin. I have combination skin. From past November till January my skin care routine that I started from mid-october started showing amazing results. I was extremely happy with my skin for its baby soft texture, even tone and glowing skin. I never had used toner and serum, so I thought I will give them a try and added to my daily skin care routine. The serum (OZ Naturals - THE BEST Vitamin C Serum...) is pretty okay. Did not do any wonders to my skin. Its just as good as water. I did not see any improvement. I am giving 3 stars for serum coz it did not harm me. But I hate Thayers toner. My skin broke out horribly. All my efforts from 3 months went down the drain in just 4-5 days of usage. Initially, I thought serum is the culprit. But once I stopped using toner, my skin started getting better. But had to really struggle for more the 3 weeks for my skin to improve from the damage caused my toner.</li>
            <li> Put it in the fridge and apply it cold! Such a refreshing sensation!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve seen the difference in my skin&lt;br /&gt;after using using a baking soda scrub and daiso Japan charcoal peel off mask twice aweek I use this&lt;br /&gt;toner morning and night and it feels refreshing&lt;br /&gt;Humphrey&#x27;s lilac and lavender is just as good</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and shipped in a fair amount of time. I love this it makes my skin so soft and smells pretty good. Also the bottle is pretty big for a toner so it will last for a long time</li>
            <li> Absorbed right away, loving it.i don&#x27;t know why many people dislike the smell but I personally like the faint rose smell of this product</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this Witch Hazel. It makes my skin a little too shiny but I only apply it at night. Seems to be a nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use it as a DIY mask.&lt;br /&gt;Generally speaking, it is good for dry skin. But the effect cannot last long.</li>
            <li> After becoming addicted to this product, and purchasing it in stores, I decided my habit needed a better outlet. Finding exactly what I wanted/ needed at a better price just makes it an even better experience. The item arrived on time, and perfect condition. It&#x27;s the exact same, high quality product I was purchasing locally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who aren&#x27;t aware of its awesomeness: it smells wonderful. Roses and nothing else. It tones my skin nicely, and helps with both the sensitive nature of it and the rosacea that I&#x27;ve finally gotten under control.  Witch hazel is an amazing thing. It tones, shrinks pores(within reason), brings a vibrancy to skin, and just feels so good. It won&#x27;t irritate anyone, I promise. ;). Also, I love all things rose, and am very picky about what I&#x27;ll use. I did try another brands supposedly &#x27;authentic&#x27; rose water, and finally found the worse smelling product on the market. I&#x27;ll never vary from this witch hazel again. It&#x27;s consistent and works well. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin feels so refreshed. I go without make up on the weekends and I use it 2-3 times a day when I want to freshen up my face on hot days. It has a nice scent. My daughter loves it too.</li>
            <li> Love this toner. Good price for great quality and value!</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed without drying out my skin.  This toner also soothes exacerbated skin and helps lighten hyper-pigmentation.</li>
            <li> After seeing all the good reviews, I decided to give this toner a try. Although I do like it (it has a nice scent and is very gentle), I don&#x27;t feel that it made any significant improvements to my skin. Also, after a couple months, I found white particles floating everywhere in the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure what this is, but it&#x27;s quite disappointing since I only used about a third of the bottle... Does anyone know what this could be? :(</li>
            <li> I had been using salicylic acid based toners since I was a teen, but my face was always left red and blotchy. A couple weeks ago I decided to switch to a more natural face care regimen and using the advice of other reviewers I purchased Dr. Woods Black Soap, the Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel and organic argan oil (all from Amazon for cheap!) to replace the Clinique products I was using. What a difference! I haven&#x27;t had any blemishes since switching and my face is NEVER red anymore (now I&#x27;m feeling terrible for the thousands of times I&#x27;d applied the harsh acid toners to my face.) My acne scars are fading fast which could be from either or all of the three products I&#x27;m now using. The rose fragrance is light and fades quickly. The toner leaves my face feeling soft instead of dry like other toners do. I have very oily skin, but now my complexion is really starting to even out. I LOVE this stuff and am so happy I switched (thank you Amazon reviewers!) To top it off the three products I&#x27;m using are very affordable and all on Amazon prime. I was paying three times as much (maybe even more) for the Clinique line.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing ever. Has helped my skin a lot, I tell all of my friends to buy it.</li>
            <li> The rose smell is abit too strong!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this toner! I don&#x27;t really understand the use of toner but i do put it on my face daily. I&#x27;ve always put toner on with my hand, just lightly pad on, however when i watch the review of this product people said to apply with cotton. So i tried it with a cotton ball, and the cotton just scratches my face and left some red mark on my face, so i guess i am going back to using my hand...&lt;br /&gt;The toner overall was a nice product, my face feel very good and smells nice after apply it, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> wonderful product--smells great--awesome price--i really can&#x27;t say anything wrong about it</li>
            <li> Love the rose scented witch hazel for toner.  This product is organic and have bought this several times since trying it initially. Alcohol free was a big plus.</li>
            <li> I love thayers witch hazel! I use this every morning on my face as a toner and astringent. It works great! It was shipped quickly and no problems at all. Definitely use this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this product... I have been looking for a toner that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave that sticky feeling behind for the longest time. My skin has improved significantly since I have been using this, it is clearer and has a beautiful glow to it. I use it morning and night after I wash my face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product on Sept. 23rd and received it today, October 6th. It was well-packaged and when I opened it, it smelled very good. It has a nice, light fragrance, hence the 3 stars. Too bad I can&#x27;t use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon reading the full ingredients listed on the bottle I found that it contains grapefruit seed extract (I seriously don&#x27;t know how I missed this fact when reading the product details! I ALWAYS read the ingredients list...I&#x27;m almost positive that the description did NOT include this fact at the time I decided to purchase). Anyhow, those of you on statin medication know that we&#x27;re not allowed to ingest grapefruit as \\&quot;It can interact with cholesterol-fighting statin drugs by increasing the amounts of those medications in the bloodstream.\\&quot; Also, \\&quot;The compound bergamottin is found in grapefruit, and when it interacts with certain enzyme systems in the body, it can prevent these enzymes from breaking down statins, which causes the drug to accumulate in high levels in the body. Some of the conditions this can cause are liver damage and rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle and kidney damage).\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since anything we put on our bodies is absorbed through our skin and into our bloodstream, I think I&#x27;ll err on the side of caution and refrain from using this product :(</li>
            <li> This product is pleasant and refreshing. My husband is okay with smelling like a rose because of how good it makes his skin feel.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product!&lt;br /&gt;-I am late 20s and have combination oily skin and have typically only used Clinique products (or other high end skin care lines i.e. Origins, FRESH, etc)&lt;br /&gt; So far I have used it to prep my skin for waxing, and as a astringent- Worked great for both purposes.&lt;br /&gt;It smells fantastic and leaves my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;I will never but another astringent again!</li>
            <li> I love Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Hips Witch Hazel!! It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like so many other toners do, and leaves my skin squeaky clean and radiant. It&#x27;s a product that I will be in my beauty regime for now on, and on top of working, it&#x27;s all natural/organic. Which is something that has been working for me since switching to more all natural, 100% organic products. No more breakouts, no more flaky skin due to over drying, and no more dullness!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It is the only thing I have used on my face that gets rid of these little bumps, almost like acne. It is not strong smelling like other witch hazel, I really recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and try to stay as natural as I can with facial products. I&#x27;ve always avoided toners because most have alcohol - something that makes my skin worse, but that didn&#x27;t keep me from searching for one. I had heard of witch hazel before but the smell scared me off instantly. I stumbled upon this by pure accident. I was pleasantly surprised! The rose scent is light and fades rather quickly and I feel does an excellent job of clearing off the last remnants of make up from my skin. It doesn&#x27;t irritate though I have found if I use too much I can feel it on my face. It becomes almost sticky. All in all I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and recommend it to anyone with acne prone skin looking to add a toner to their regimen.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that an expensive product does not always mean that it yields the best results. Especially in the case of skincare and cosmetics, it is an on-going quest to find a product that works for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seeing that Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel is ranked the best in facial toners and not outrageous in pricing, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for over 6 months now (twice a day with cotton pad, once in the morning after I wake up, and once in the evening after cleaning my face), and I am very pleased with the product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not break out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not contain alcohol - so it does not agitate your skin, cause redness, nor have a pungent smell.&lt;br /&gt;3. While I do not think that it minimizes my pores, it certainly did not enlarge it or cause any excess oil secretion.&lt;br /&gt;4. It does not dry up my skin. My skin feels fresh and sufficiently moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;5. It has a light, rose scent which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am extremely happy that I gave this product a try, and I will certainly buy it again. My facial aesthetician sells this product at her spa as well, so I feel further reassured that this is regarded as a good product by a skin care specialist. It is always great to find an effective skincare product that does not break the bank!</li>
            <li> I love!  Cleaned my skin without any burning and my skin positively glowed after.  I followed up with moisturizer but I imagine in the summer that will not be necessar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel before but never liked the odor. I love this with the mild rose petal scent.  What a nice surprise to read about the many uses for witch hazel.  It has been very helpful for the dermatitis that I have on my hands.  Will definitely be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> I wanted a alcohol free toner and this one is great. Great product at a great price. I love it</li>
            <li> It smells nice, like roses. After a good hot shower and scrub, I use it to close the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a toner. My skin is mostly problem free and I am looking to keep it that way. It works very nice and leaves my skin clean and soft. Appears to be all natural from the ingredients list. I would not hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li> We love this toner. I have tried different ones which were very drying to my skin, this one is wonderful. Have been using it for years. It is slightly cheaper on Amazon than Whole Foods. This leaves my face feeling soft and smelling so nice, even my Husband likes it and uses it on his own face.</li>
            <li> Usually this is the only thing that I have to put on my face at night after washing. I have very dry skin If I do not use this. I have used it every morning and night for about two months now &amp; I have noticed that my skin is smoother and healthier looking. I also use it on a cotton ball as a makeup remover because it is good for sensitive skin yet effective. Will definitely be repurchasing when I run out!</li>
            <li> The prior reviews were correct. It is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Lovely scent and seems to be very high quality. Ordered another.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Leaves my skin feeling soft</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, this product broke me out. I mainly bought this product due to its 12 oz size since it lasts a while. Not worth it. The smell itself is of faint rose, but it doesn&#x27;t smell 100% authentic rose water. Using this product only made me realize that I&#x27;m personally sensitive to Thayer&#x27;s which is interesting since their ingredients aren&#x27;t exactly toxic. I&#x27;ve use their &#x27;Unscented&#x27; astringent before only to have my face feel that stingy/irritated effect after. Thayer&#x27;s is not a product for everyone. Whether you choose to try it out, is your choice.</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and in good condition. I love the smell of the rose petal witch hazel! I am making homemade beauty products with essential oils and this product works perfectly for that. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t find anything too special with this product. My skin felt a little too oily after using this. But, everyone&#x27;s skin is different, from all the great reviews there seems to be a lot of people pleased with this. The smell is really pleasant on a high note.</li>
            <li> Tried it, got acne. Stopped for two months. Tried it again, got acne.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice, and I guess it works!  I mean whether or not it REALLY does much, it feels great.  I have noticed a bit of a difference in the overall tone of my face SO I would say go ahead and get it if you&#x27;re thinking of it.  Just don&#x27;t buy the large quantity unless you know it works for you!</li>
            <li> Came as ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this as a facial toner post partum since I wasn;t wearing a lot of makeup and wasn&#x27;t washing my face twice a day. Made my skin feel silky and refreshed - although I was tired, my skin didn&#x27;t show it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also used in sitz bath - helps with perineal and vaginal recovery after all-natural birth.</li>
            <li> I like it. I didn&#x27;t see anything bad happened to my skin after over 3 weeks of using this product. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> Good service, Good stuff!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice! I love the rise fragrance very much! And it&#x27;s gentle and soft.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this... Tried it for a few days and it doesn&#x27;t have the tightening and toning effect I expected. It seems strangely heavy for a toner. Left my skin feeling congested rather than refreshed. Regrettable purchase. I wanted it because it combined a lot of awesome ingredients but I prefer the Heritage rosewater and glycerine face spray. I&#x27;ll spritz it on my face after washing and cleansing. Not satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, and I gave it 3 stars because it smells SO GOOD. Unfortunately, it broke my face out in tons of acne after only a couple night&#x27;s use. People are claiming this is good for sensitive skin, but be wary it might not work for everyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to replace expensive skin care products with less expensive alternatives while maintaining quality, and this toner certainly fits the bill. I have oily/sensitive skin with light rosacea and this toner cleans off any traces of cleanser and preps my skin for the next step in my regime. It has a wonderful light rose scent (one of my favorites). It also has a calming effect on any redness caused by my cleansing step. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is mostly normal (not very oily or dry), and it is very sensitive and clogs easily. This toner feels and smells fabulous. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog my skin is  a miracle. I would recommend this to anyone to try (as long as you don&#x27;t dislike the smell of roses).</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv toner for many yaers.  For some reason, the price just keeps going up and up and I frankly don&#x27;t want to pay it anymore.  So I spent some time looking for a replacement and discovered that this product is consistently the #1 Amazon best seller in toners.  The price is fantastic, so I gave it a try. This is a wonderful toner.  There is no alcohol.  The scent is great, and it goes on without drying out the skin.  I really like this product. I have now officially switched.</li>
            <li> Before this I used Dickinson&#x27;s and thought it was awesome because it only had 2 ingredients: witch hazel and alcohol. But recently I&#x27;ve been obsessing over skin care and so I did a lot of research on products, oils, extracts, etc.., in the end alcohol is no good, especially for me (since I have very dry skin already). So I bought this as a replacement, because I do like the witch hazel but wanted something that would also moisturize my skin, plus something that smelled better than the twiggy smell the other one had. I like this one a lot better because it does the same job, smells better, moisturizing (from the aloe vera), and an extra plus because the rose water has anti-aging benefits. ;)</li>
            <li> I love this toner because it is alcohol-free and natural! It is gentle on the skin and calms my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels on my skin. Sometimes I apply this toner and forget to apply moisturizer afterwards but my usually dry cheeks remain well moisturized. My sensitive skin often stings after a regular toner but I get no such reaction from this toner. I plan to use this for a long time as it does what it needs to do. Have been receiving compliments lately about my more youthful skin (38yrs now) and I&#x27;ve certainly noticed clearer/glowing skin but I think it&#x27;s really a combination of this and my more consistent practice of the OCM.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this ! It smells great and makes my face feel so refreshing after a wash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner.  I put it in a spritz bottle and spray my face and neck daily.  The skin instantly feels softer.  The smell of the rose petal is very soft and pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema so I also use it all over my upper body.  Within minutes, the itching is soothed and the skin is softened.  I only wish I could buy this product in bulk.</li>
            <li> OMG, not sure if it is because of this toner, but my skin noticeably looks more radiant after using this toner! My skin had looked dry for a quite while (although I didn&#x27;t feel it was dry, I could see the dry lines in the mirror). I started using this toner 2 weeks ago, twice/day after cleaning my face. I can definitely see the changes on my face! I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the toner I used was a deteriotaed one, until I used it up and recently bought another one which is colorless. The toner should be colorless, but what I received from this seller is milky white!!!I can&#x27;t believe I bought it from amazon, I am so disappointed. I thingk I will need to do a lot more research before I buy something on amazon after this experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of alcohol-free toners over the years and give this thumbs up as gentle and refreshing on my combination skin (oily in the T zone).  Am not as keen on the rose petal scent, however, but can live with it. Overall, a good product and the price is nice.</li>
            <li> cool!! smell so good, and sensitive skin also can use</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this product. It makes my skin very clean and does not feel harsh in any way. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Will re-order. Great product not drying. Good for your pores. Delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for many, many years.  I was glad to find it again and it has helped my complexion and is first class for lessening the time it takes for bruises to fade.</li>
            <li> As a 63 year old male I started to see the wrinkles develop. I remember my mother had great smooth skin and used witch hazel. The very first time I applied Thayers to my face I could feel the skin tightening around my face and especially noticed the wrinkles on forehead become smoother. I also started using it on my neck and noticed an improvement. This stuff works and it&#x27;s not oily.</li>
            <li> I did not know what this product would do but it really exceeded any expectations! I love it and wonder how my skin survived so long with out Thayers. I am 43 and trying with all my effort to keep time from marching across my face. Thayers makes my skin soft, evenly toned and my pores are smaller....I am totally impressed.</li>
            <li> When I first began using this, I adored it.  I applied it with a cotton ball and rubbed it over my face, and it did an unparalleled job of getting grime and oil off.  Even after I&#x27;d cleaned my face otherwise, this stuff still got more off.  I began using this stuff a couple of times per day (it smells gloriously of roses) and my face felt clearer and cleaner than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know exactly when the trouble started, but after having the product maybe a couple of months, I began noticing that it was giving me a rash.  The reaction got worse and worse until, within a minute of using it, a nasty rash spread across my face and stayed their for a couple of days even though I cleaned the witch hazel off my face immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should note, by the way, that this keeps happening to me with facial products, so my skin might just be weird.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, leaves my face smooth and soft.  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I had to write something about this amazing product. I have extremely oily skin and this worked wonders for me. My skin is soft, and has an amazing glow to it. Even the texture of my skin has improved. I bought three bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a facial product junkie (hello, Sephora addict!)  I&#x27;m always trying new skin care products and looking for something that will make my combination skin clean, balanced, and fresh.  This stuff is by far the best toner I have ever tried.  The Clinique stuff always dried out my skin too much (because of the alcohol).  And then some toners that are alcohol-free don&#x27;t actually do anything to clean your skin, so they are worthless.  It&#x27;s hard to find a good one, but this is it!    I use this product after using my cleanser because I want to make sure I get any residue or debris of make-up off.  This gets my skin smooth and clean without drying it out.  Plus, I find the subtle rose scent to be quite pleasant.    I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is great for hemorrhoids and itchy skin. I like that it is alcohol-free. I give it only 4 stars because I am not a huge fan of the rose smell. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell. It also makes my face feel refreshed and healthy.</li>
            <li> It does the job that you&#x27;d expect. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin it leaves a nice complexion after use, and the smell of it is very lovely and nice. I like the product overall.</li>
            <li> Product was great, good size for the money delivered quickly</li>
            <li> I have only had this toner for a few days and can  already see a change in my skin. I use this toner morning and night after cleansing my face. It is so moisturizing and soothing unlike some toners and astringents. Since using I haven&#x27;t had any acne flare ups, so I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. The rose scent its lovely too. I will definitely repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> After a shave, it moistens/softens my skin a little bit and gives a light enduring rose scent to it.  It&#x27;s not a huge difference but it helps</li>
            <li> It comes in a big bottle which is great! I incorporated it as part of my skin regime. Cleanse, toner, then moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great toner! I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for a toner that tightens pores. But this is a good toner otherwise!</li>
            <li> I received  a \\&quot;THAYERS rose petal witch hazel\\&quot; , but I saw \\&quot;2007/11\\&quot; on the bottom. After check previous reviews, I know I am cheated too.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and almost everything that touches my face does not end up good. I did not experience dry patches. I only used 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> Use this product twice daily and I super happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  One bottle usually lasts me several months, so it is a great value.  I use it as a facial toner but also for minor cuts and scraps.  It keeps them from becoming infected yet is more gentle than rubbing alcohol.  It also has a wonderful scent.&lt;br /&gt;I also gave some to a friend after she had a dermatological procedure and it really helped her.  Thayers is a wonderful product.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for carrying it. The service was wonderful and prompt.  The item was delivered on time and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best toner and a good value.</li>
            <li> smells nice and feels great on the skin</li>
            <li> I love this! The smell is amazing and it does wonders for your face!</li>
            <li> This toner is gentle and smells great. I have oily, acne prone skin and this did not irritate my skin or cause me to break out. I also loved the fact that it did not stinng. With that being said, it didn&#x27;t do much to help treat my acne, so my seach continues for another toner. If you have dry skin, I would recommend this toner b/c it is not drying.</li>
            <li> I love this!  I feel fresh and natural ingredients make me feel safe to use.</li>
            <li> A nice toner that doesn&#x27;t dry my face. I have very oily skin especially in T-zone area and this has helped to reduce oil.</li>
            <li> gentle and nice smell. Ships fast! Love!</li>
            <li> As one who suffers from awfully stubborn combination skin, I found it very difficult to find anything that would keep my acne in check. I&#x27;ve tried countless other products (Proactiv, Murad, Neutrogena, and Clean and Clear just to name a few) with no luck. They all either dried my skin out, dehydrated it despite all of the moisturizer in the world, or just didn&#x27;t do anything for the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Thayer&#x27;s twice a day for just 5 days, I can already see an amazing difference. The acne I had is starting to disappear, the ones that I could see were well on their way up (deep under the skin) are starting to reduce and the redness/swelling is going down. My skin doesn&#x27;t get oily nearly as quick in my T-zone and it feels so moisturized that I don&#x27;t even feel the need to use anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who&#x27;s been having as much trouble as I do with combination skin/acne.</li>
            <li> I use this product before my moisturizer. It works fine as a toner. The smell is a litte too strong though.</li>
            <li> This toner is awesome. It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive/dry skin, smells great, cleans well without drying out my skin and feels lovely. One bottle has lasted me forever so it&#x27;s definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it nourishes my skin very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner and feels incredibly soft on my skin.  The only thing that would make it better is if it were all natural.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and keeps my skin toned.</li>
            <li> I ran out of some expensive spray astringent for my face, so I poured some of this into the empty bottle. I spray it on my face and neck every morning and evening. Works as well or better as the expensive stuff and I love the smell of roses!</li>
            <li> I just started using the product and I like it so far, feel cleaner...will see how it affects my skin over time...update...love it....been buying it for all of my friends!</li>
            <li> i have acne and i have been using this as a toner, it has been leaving my face feeling nice and refreshed and not dry</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin super moisturized and flake free throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I have nothing against this product but I really didn&#x27;t like it that much.&lt;br /&gt;1) It has a strong smell ( it isn&#x27;t a pleasant smell but I could handle it)&lt;br /&gt;2) It leaves my skin pretty sticky. (I read other comments and now I have learned my lesson)&lt;br /&gt;3) The smell dwells on my skin even after I put on my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;And for it also made my skin pretty itchy. But I think that&#x27;s probably because I might be allergic to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 2 stars because it doesn&#x27;t stink as bad as some people said it does.</li>
            <li> my skin is clearing up for using all the products messages from you</li>
            <li> I am not a user of toner, but this popped up when I was researching for hydration for my skin that was natural and non-irritating. I have very sensitive skin and am acne-prone (which is quite unfair since I am almost 50). I have been searching for something that would improve the condition of my skin without irritating it like other products which contain benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid or a bazillion other ingredients I don&#x27;t know the meaning of. I purchased this alcohol free Rose Petal Witch Hazel and love it! It has a mild rose smell that I find relaxing. It is cool going on and very soothing. I have had no reaction to it and my skin really seems to love it. I use it in combination with Christina Moss Naturals Organic Moisturizer (also on Amazon) and my skin looks and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This item is use for acne.. bug bites this item has lots of uses. I have yet to see a price. That can compare to this rose water...  fav item in my house</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good stuff.  I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this on my baby wipes for a great feeling and cleaning.</li>
            <li> Use it anytime I feel that my skin&#x27;s a little oily throughout the day, and it never causes me to break out (and I have very sensitive skin).  Definitely recommend this!  The scent is very nice and feminine, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I use it every night after cleansing and have noticed a drastic change in the size of my pores and number of blackheads. I&#x27;m all about natural skin products. I have very temperamental skin with dermatitis, acne and rosacea...it&#x27;s a hot mess! But this is a great moisturizing toner and I foresee me using it for the long run!</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s hot and muggy, this is a great way to clean my face from sweat. I always use it after a shower to make sure all soap and shampoo residue is gone as well as after facial masks. My older skin isn&#x27;t dry, but it doesn&#x27;t need anything that will make it that way. I feel smooth and clean but not tight after using this. Hope this product will be around a long time.</li>
            <li> This product is divine. I was going to attempt to make this on my own and decided it was more cost-effective to purchase Thayers.  The scent is delicate and does not burn my face. My skin loves this and its all-natural.  The next time I plan to order in bulk!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, with a bit of oiliness on my t zone. I used the shisheido toner before, which is great, but currently outside my budget. I wanted something that wasn&#x27;t tested on animals and not too harsh, as sometimes products meant for oily skin dry my face and make me break out. So far this has done the trick, it&#x27;s refreshing and smells great, yes, like roses. It hasn&#x27;t made me break out, it hasn&#x27;t dried out my cheeks. I was used to my previous toner helping remove traces of make up left after washing, and this one does not do that, so I guess I&#x27;ll have to wash extra well. But that&#x27;s not really an issue, the bottle is quite large and a phenomenal price, I forsee it lasting quite a bit, but after that I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> No sting astringent.  Cleans face naturally with out drying, smell great too.  No sting!</li>
            <li> Love using this toner, it is lightly scented (not too overpowering), cleans my face really well and leaves it moisturized and feeling great. My skin feels supple and moisturized without any creams! Love, love, love this toner!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now. I bought this particularly for the dark circles I have around my eyes. It is slowly clearing up my dark circles (PLEASE NOTE: I haven&#x27;t been using it every day/night). As for the rest of my face...I have decent clear skin already, but this product has really added a natural, if you will, glow to my skin. It looks great. I love it so far and I will continue to use it and when I&#x27;m about to run out, I&#x27;ll buy more. Also, the smell is very pleasant, too.</li>
            <li> Love it and it smells so good!</li>
            <li> Great product at a bargain, but unfortunately I do not think it is the best product for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is virtually no smell, which is great for me because I am not a fan of fragrant skincare products. The ingredient list is solid. I noticed my skin tone seems a lot brighter and my skin tone is more even. However, even with the aloe, the product is just a little too astringent for me.</li>
            <li> This product does great to tone my combination skin. I am very impressed. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and doesn&#x27;t contain nasty chemicals like so many other products. It smells like roses which I love.</li>
            <li> I received it a few days ago, started using it right away, it made my face feel tight, not the kind of \\&quot;tight\\&quot; that is \\&quot;stiff\\&quot;.  Love that! I&#x27;ve been using the other \\&quot;famous\\&quot; brand for years, this one surpasses it by far! I do not have an issue with the scent. As a matter of fact, it does have a \\&quot;rose\\&quot; scent, but for me it is not at all over-powering, and it does not linger! Shipped on time, packaging very good. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very gentle on face, no alcohol and soothing aloe vera, great combination.</li>
            <li> I use it daily as part of my skin care routine.  I like the light scent.</li>
            <li> Love it! I noticed an improvement after a week of use! Something that I will continue to buy</li>
            <li> I have oily/combination skin, but I get dried areas around my lips, nose and cheeks. I tried using an astringent, but they leave my skin dry and I don&#x27;t like the smell. So I tried this Thayer toner, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily, and it moisturizes the dry areas on my skin. The scent is great, it smells like rose water, it is a natural scent, light and nice. I&#x27;ve noticed that my makeup stays longer after I use this as a toner. I&#x27;d recommend this to any woman or man of any age, the price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! I also bought a spray bottle and poured the toner inside so instead of using a cotton ball or pad I just spray it on my face for convenience and it&#x27;s so much better!!!! You can just spray it on your face several times a day to keep your complexion moisturized, clean, and your oil production under control. I highly recommend this product. Even after the first use, the next morning I noticed a huge difference with my skin....less oil, skin was smoother, and pores much SMALLER! Get a spray bottle and add some in there, it makes it so much more fun to use!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite witch hazel product. I will always and only buy this brand in the future. Love the rose scent (not too strong) and the added aloe. Simply the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for less than a week now and I can already see a difference. My face is somewhat oily and I have been struggling to find products to help. I thought my make up was the problem so I continued to try every foundation out there. Finally I saw this toner on some beauty blog and decided to give it a try. My face has been less oily, with fewer blemishes and my skin tone seems to look healthier. It&#x27;s still early but thus far I love this product!!</li>
            <li> This is witch hazel like you&#x27;ve never imagined. Pleasant aroma, very gentle on my face, but cleanses beautifully. I&#x27;ll be using this product from now on. Oh, and it arrived promptly too, sooner than promised.</li>
            <li> This product has a rose fragrance.  However it is not suitable for me as it dries up my skin.  So I gave it away to a friend&#x27;s teenage daughter.  I think it is more suitable for girls with oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product because it cleans gently and is a healthy alternative to regular witch hazel because it is alcohol free.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and my daughter likes it too.</li>
            <li> Nice product for a good astringent,  smells nice</li>
            <li> This smells and works great! It has helped me reduce oil on my face and the breakouts I get when I eat pizza.</li>
            <li> I started using this product as part of a new skin care regimen and am very pleased with the results!  I have sensitive skin and most things usually irritate it and either make it dry out, burn, or itch, and this product causes none of that whatsoever.  It is so gentle and has a light rose petal scent that is so refreshing. I use a cotton ball to put it on after washing my face in the a.m. and p.m. Very gentle. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my oily skin!  Leaves it feeling very clean but hydrated!  My mom uses it on her mature, dry skin and likes it as well.</li>
            <li> Good product. Use it everyday as toner. Don&#x27;t have to worry about finding another brand.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Very refreshing and would purchase again.  Oh and the smell, roses....lovely.</li>
            <li> This smells so great and natural. I use it after cleansing and instead of using cotton pads, I squirt several drops into my hands and pat it over my face. Less waste going on a cotton ball and more for my face! I have sensitive, dry skin and I feel like this really helps keep in moisture and my face feels less dry.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I have used Witch Hazel all my life.  The Rose Petal scent is wonderful.  I also tried the Lavender, which is OK and also soothing,  but went quickly back to the Rose Petal.  Guess it is just your own preference as to which scent you prefer.</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel for years after washing my face. The hint of rose is delightful and the addition of aloe Vera seems to leave my skin more hydrated!</li>
            <li> Very clean and refreshing. Removes my makeup cleanly.</li>
            <li> A gentle and very good toner for my face. I have used Thayers Witch Hazel before and always with good results.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Thayers Witch Hazel Aloe Vera rose Petal to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Gentle, yet Effective. My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t as gentle as I expected for my dry winter skin, I went with fresh floral toner instead!</li>
            <li> Maybe this just isn&#x27;t right for my skin type but without applying a lot of moisturizer after use, it would really dry out my skin.  Didn&#x27;t see any positive effects and stopped using it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff, it&#x27;s the only toner you need and I love the rose scent.  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> Working fine for me for now. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I have been pleased with the results. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like astringents can, and I feel like my skin has been clearer as well. It&#x27;s definitely a bargain for the quality you get. I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m editing my previous review because I am really annoyed at something done by AMAZON. The product itself is perfect and I love it. Thayers must have introduced new packaging which I really like but it is not what is pictured. Also, Amazon was stupid enough to put their sticker RIGHT on top of the paper label for the product. So in attempt to peel off the label, the pretty packaging which I wanted to display in my bathroom was ruined. This may seem silly but I really enjoy product packaging and this was a major pet peeve for me. Amazon, don&#x27;t stick your stupid labels directly over the products packaging!!! Common sense, people. I&#x27;ve received products before that have the Amazon warehouse label stuck over important supplement information and ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have seen a big difference with how soft my skin feels and how my acne is clearing up. Will have to keep this stocked</li>
            <li> HG toner. I use it all over to refresh</li>
            <li> This toner has been really good to my skin so far! I am already noticing some improvement to my skin tone and that breakouts are healing faster. Witch hazel is very good for your skin, plus this stuff smells really nice! Very light scent but it&#x27;s rosey and wonderful. I have never liked using toners because they always smell weird or they make my face feel like there&#x27;s a film on it.. This stuff feels really clean and amazing!</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I include witch hazel in my handmade products, and although I can find it cheaper, I exclusively use Thayer&#x27;s because its quality is consistently great.  I would rather price my own products a little higher than buy cheaper ingredients that I can&#x27;t trust--and I think my clients appreciate my stance.  They depend on me to hold the integrity so they don&#x27;t have to worry about it, and I depend on Thayer&#x27;s for its integrity.</li>
            <li> SOOOO good!! Not acidic, so there is no typical sensation on the skin at all! Instead, it leaves very smooth and gentle sensation.&lt;br /&gt;It lasts for a long time. It also copes very well with other types of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and makes my skin feel really soft.</li>
            <li> Not a fan,  made my skin too oily very quickly.</li>
            <li> This toner takes off all the extra dirt that my facial cleanser leaves behind. Leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed. Any product that does not break out my already acne prone skin is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Why buy a bouquet of roses when you can get this. I truly look forward to using it every day. My skin likes it and so does my nose ;) I hope they never stop making this!!!</li>
            <li> I love using witch hazel as a toner or to just clean my face off when I feel like it needs it, but the rose scent of this stuff is horribly overpowering. I just need to open the bottle a couple of feet away and I can immediately smell it. It&#x27;s just not pleasant to apply to the face because of the grandmother-y rose floral scent. If you want witch hazel, just get the original basic kind without fragrance. It&#x27;s literally the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> I needed something to clean my face with in the late afternoons when my face doesn&#x27;t feel so fresh without having to actually wash it.  This alcohol free toner is the best thing that ever touched my face. Its all natural and it smells so good. I really cleared my complexion and gave me a rosy glow. LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Like how toned my skin feels and looks. People are always misjudging my age. I look so young! (!2-15 years, been told.) Company is great! Love the personal service.</li>
            <li> The smell is great. Love it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I adore this toner. I use it every morning and night. I love the way it smells and how it makes my skin feel. It never leaves my skin feeling dry either. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Makes my face really calm...not dry at all!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Never burns and smells great! Thank you for your prompt delivery and great price!</li>
            <li> Smell very good, not irritated skin. No moisturizer needed afterward during summer season. Wish I knew this product exist when I was teen.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this toner for a few days now, but I have noticed a difference in my skin. It smells nice, doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of moisture and still cleans skin well. I have tried so many brands and am glad I have now found a brand that works well and is affordable!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing. My skin always feels nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my wife as she really enjoys the smell of roses. She likes the product a lot which is a score for me as well. Nthing better tan a happy wife. Great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance in this product. It does a very nice job in daily skin care.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery! This is my second bottle and it has been good, which means I haven&#x27;t noticed any negative effect from using it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it a few days, but this paired with a chemical-free soap by Out Of Africa (began using both at the same time) has really cleared up my skin...and even helped with diminishing blackheads on my nose and chin that I have never had much luck with getting out. (I use the soap first and, with a bristle skin brush and warm water, I scrub my face in tight circular motions and then pat dry and apply this toner with a cotton ball) I have really oily skin, so using oils on my face seemed kind of silly to me, but before using this, I used a lot of hygiene products that had synthetic fragrances and chemicals in them, and they would dry my face out and during the day my face would secrete even more oil. I have decided that something has to change in order to get results, so I&#x27;ve been going towards more natural remedies. It does make my face feel slightly oily, but my skin seems to be slowly clearing up. I really like this product so far and it smells nice. I can see how some of the other reviewers might find the scent a bit strong, but I use a lot of essential oils now (lavender is a favorite) and a little goes a loong way. I would agree, smelling from the bottle directly could be a bit of a head rush, but a little dabbed onto a cotton ball isn&#x27;t anywhere near as strong. To anyone with acne-prone skin or even oily skin like myself, feverishly searching for an end-all cure: anything you try you gotta give it a little bit of time to work(more than a week unless you&#x27;re experiencing allergic-type reactions), and expect that immediate results just aren&#x27;t in the cards for us. I have been battling acne for fourteen years and after trying a plethora of products OTC and prescription, I&#x27;ve decided natural remedies are worth a shot. I have had faster results than any medications, than any pretty packaging promising the moon--with basic, simple, honest, and natural products.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Shipping was prompt, actually earlier then expected. I have very sensitive skin that burns very easy. I managed to burn through sunscreen 100 and used this toner to soothe and clean, my skin was, well, soothed and clean. I love it!! It&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> Love this! Was a recommendation here on amazon that I decided to try on a whim and is now my hold grail toner. So gentle but my skin loves it and has never looked better. My only gripe (if you could call it that) is I am not a fan of the rose smell. It doesn&#x27;t linger for long luckily, but if you like the smell of roses than you will love it!</li>
            <li> Hope that worked so well, smell and taste</li>
            <li> bought it for my daugther she didnt like it as much as the walmart one the original witch hazel I normally get @ walmart for a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li> Nice product. Use it everyday and my skin looks nice. Would reccomend to anyone. Only giving 4/5 because the smell is kind of cloying.</li>
            <li> Helps with dark circles under your eyes.  I used it in the past, but ran out.  Will not run out again.</li>
            <li> Even as I&#x27;m getting older my skin still breaks out sometimes and regular facial moisturizers clog my pores. This product is perfect. Used as a toner with a cotton ball it cleans and refreshes without drying.  I also have some in a small spray bottle to mist on my face for a dewy look when my face is dry. Unlike water, this seems to replenish moisture rather than leach it. And with the rosewater its smell is heavenly.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to see what my skin will look like after long term use! Within days my skin has already started to clear up! So happy!!</li>
            <li> It smells so good. Although so far I don&#x27;t see my skin has any different.</li>
            <li> Great Product Fast Delivery as well as follow up to ensure I was pleased with the product. Lovely rose smell, kept skin very smooth silky and toned, would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad there is a witch hazel product without alcohol. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and the rose smell is wonderful.  It feels good using it after cleaning my face.</li>
            <li> nothing bad on it. everything is good!</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s makes one of the best Witch Hazel. This one is no exception, with a lovely natural perfume of pressed rose petals and an added moisturizer from the aloe vera.  I use this everyday and is a must-have in my low-maintenance sulfate-free morning wash regimen.  I recommend to anyone that wants to tone his/her skin without stripping the natural oils.</li>
            <li> I use Witch Hazel but wanted sans Alcohol and decided Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel with Rose Petal/Aloe would be nice. I used recently and decided to let my 7 year old grandson try after feeling the gentle soothing product on my skin. He asked for his own bottle. He had a small bit of sun exposure around neck and on face, very gentle. I use daily after cleansing my face.</li>
            <li> I really love this witch hazel, it&#x27;s made from superior ingredients and is a very potent extract.  I will never buy alcohol extracted stuff from the drug store again.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be using this after my pregnancy to reduce swelling.  Placed on cotton balls and kept in the fridge it gives excellent relief of bum issues.  I&#x27;ve also used it to soothe my child&#x27;s diaper area when an unforeseen food sensitivity causes it to become red and inflamed.  The rose petal imparts a nice smell but I could take it or leave it, I may buy the regular version in the future.  It&#x27;s also great on your face and leaves your skin feeling smooth.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It smells great and is all natural. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin red/irritated. I use it every day. It has natural moisturizers instead of 100 different chemicals.</li>
            <li> In general, I think toners are a waste of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to sound stupid, but the graphics on the bottle were the primary attraction.  I came across this product at a a natural health foods store in the area.  Alcohol-free...I like that too.  I&#x27;ve been steaming my face a couple of times a week, and thought this would be a good way to remove excess cleanser and close my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the scent, texture (it&#x27;s a bit moisturizing), and how it preps my skin before my moisturizer (I use jojoba oil).  I have not had any problems with irritation, and have been using it at least twice a day for 3.5 months on my drier, hormonal-acne-prone skin.  If I&#x27;m going to mess with a toner, this will be the one I use.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I love that its not tested on animals and is organic. Also, WOW, it does so much cleaning! I wash my face in the morning and at night before bed with a sponge and soap. Then I use a cotton ball and a few drops of this and rub it in circular motions like the bottle says. It gets SOOOO much extra junk from on/in my skin even though I JUST WASHED IT! Its crazy to imagine not using a toner and leaving all that on your skin unknowingly. My skin feels soft and smooth after using this. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> I use this after every shave! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. It is nice and moisturizing for the face. It does have a strong rose smell, but it fades after a bit. I use it as a toner and almost don&#x27;t need to moisturize after.</li>
            <li> Absolutelly in love with this product. I recomend this water to everybody!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction! Great product! Super fast delivery. Many thanks!</li>
            <li> good price for it ! I like it very much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t make me dry/flaky/pimple&#x27;d so that&#x27;s the good news. Unusual for a toner! However, it didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me, either. I have very sensitive combination skin prone to irritation-related breakouts. I&#x27;d used dickenson&#x27;s witch hazel before and it was drying but did shrink my pores. Didn&#x27;t notice much of an astringent effect from this, likely because it is the hydrosol and the &amp;#34;good stuff&amp;#34; is in the extract (which always has alcohol). So yes, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; witch hazel in that there is some witch hazel product there, but it&#x27;s a byproduct of extracting the stuff that&#x27;s in the alcohol containing stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the effect!</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product is magnificent. I went online searching for an alcohol free toner and came across this brand. I read all the reviews and decided to give it a try. I wanted to create a skin regime before my wedding to make sure my skin was at it utmost finest. This product did the trick. I use it daily after I wash my face with an organic purifying cleanser (no alcohol, no animal testing, pure fruit extracts). My skin is absolutely glowing, it has never been this soft or supple for as long as I can remember. I do not have the money to by the top of the line products that I usually use since I am getting married and have a wedding to pay for. This product is better than anything you can by at a department store, and trust me I have used the best. If you don&#x27;t really care for the smell of rose I would suggest a different type like lavender. For being in business for over 100+ years, this brand knows exactly what they are doing. I will never use another type of toner! There is no burning sensation or medicine smell from alcohol. My skin is beaming. I have not had 1 break out, 1 zit, my pores are reduced and my skin is so soft. I fully recommend this product to anyone who wants beautiful skin for a value. It is so worth it.</li>
            <li> Helps fade my red marks! I have very sensitive skin this helps get all the dirt off after washing my face</li>
            <li> This witch hazel has not left my daily routine since the day I received it! It is so much better than drugstore witch hazels. It is free of alcohol, and has rose petal &amp; aloe vera, making it a staple for sensitive skin. It clears my pores and locks in moisture, which is exactly what my combination skin needs. It has also helped clear my forehead acne, and minimize acne scars and uneven skin tone. Honesty, this is an amazing product that I never plan to stop using. The scent is so lovely (not the usual witch hazel scent, because of the rose!) and the bottle lasts a very long time! I even use this in the harsh, dry winter and my skin is still soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> this stuff is for my wife,she said It is very gentle and it makes her skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Great buy, it really works</li>
            <li> Since i was a teen i always used a rose water i stoped for a while using it not this brand but another and my skin was always perfect, people used to tell me i have a doll face or porcelain doll face, just because never saw a blemish or pimple on my face it was even, but within time your skin changes i was a teen at that time, of course my skin is not the same anymore i am 28 but as soon i look at this water here i ordered and i use this everyday twice morning and night it feels on your skin so fresh so clean so purified and it gets rid of death cells its amazing rose water i highly recommend this to everyone together with a right nutrition and make sure you also drink lots of water believe me water also helps to desintoxicate your body, good luck.</li>
            <li> I found this when I was searching for just the right natural pre-wedding skin care routine last year. Of course, I wanted my skin to be healthy and glowing on my wedding day so I did lots of research to find my ideal routine. After some trial and error, I came up with the following products:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Dr. Woods Pure Black Soap - use to wash face twice daily&lt;br /&gt;2) Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel - use as toner twice daily&lt;br /&gt;3) Burts Bees Radiance Day Lotion with SPF 15 - use in the a.m.&lt;br /&gt;4) Desert Essence 100% Natural Jojoba Oil - use as moisturizer before bed&lt;br /&gt;5) St. Ives Apricot Scrub Blemish &amp; Blackhead Control - use to gently exfoliate twice a week&lt;br /&gt;6) Queen Helene Mint Julep Mask - use after exfoliating once a week in acne-prone areas only&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This combination of products really has given me the best skin of my life. I did get a zit on the day before my wedding, but that was from stress and I don&#x27;t believe that any products I used could have avoided that. It wasn&#x27;t huge though so I easily covered it with makeup. Other than that one zit though, my skin looked very nice. Also, after the wedding, I started skimping on my routine and did begin breaking out much more often and lost that healthy glow. Once I started back up with religiously following my routine, my skin is very smooth and nice again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the Thayers Witch Hazel is credited for providing younger-looking skin. I am only 24 so I can&#x27;t speak to that, but love knowing that something I use twice everyday is likely going to slow the aging process of my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have rosacea and struggle with breakouts and irritation from other products or procedures like waxing or threading. I use this product to calm my skin down when I&#x27;ve had a reaction to something or I have redness and it works beautifully. My skin feels softer and the soothing effect is instantaneous. I now use it daily and find my makeup applies more evenly, as well. I did research before deciding on which brand to buy. This one is the best. Just wish I had discovered it a long time ago!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! I simultaneously have acne issues and dry skin. This witch hazel stops my skin from feeling tight after being washed, and make my skin feel silky smooth. It&#x27;s a very lightweight liquid and isn&#x27;t greasy in the slightest. And it has a really nice, light scent. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Remember the old cat lady down the street when you were growing up?  They took her, put her in a juicer, then put the smell into this Witch Hazel.  Great for cat ladies, no so much for me.</li>
            <li> Normally I would be hesitant to give a product, especially a beauty/cosmetic product, five stars, but I absolutely love this product, and I think it would be useful to many people and non-irritating/not a waste of money to people who end up not loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I initially receieved a small sample bottle from a tradeshow and then purchased the larger bottle online after using it all.  I have been using it daily for approximately three months and have found it great for the following uses:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As a facial toner/acne treatment: I apply it every night after washing my face.  It helps remove leftover makeup and makes my skin feel clean without the \\&quot;tingly\\&quot; sensation (code: burning) or tightness I&#x27;ve experience with other toners.  It makes my skin feel soothed rather than attacked.  Whenever I&#x27;ve had a breakout, it has helped reduce the size and redness of blemishes overnight, and made them feel less hot and irritated instantly.  I previously had light acne around my hairline due to my bangs, and it has cleared up completely.  I occasionally get cystic pimples, almost always due to PMS, and it clears those up faster than anything without dryness.  When I&#x27;ve had those type of blemishes, I&#x27;ve applied this to a washcloth with hot water and used it as a compress, and the acne has looked and felt better immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-As an aftershave: I use this when shaving my bikini area.  It is very soothing and cooling, and I&#x27;m not worried about using any of the ingredients around sensitive parts of my body.  Even better, I haven&#x27;t had a single ingrown hair since I started using it.  I apply immediately after shaving and whenever I feel chaffed.  I also exfoliate to prevent ingrown hairs, but this is the first product that has prevented them completely.  This is the number one reason I ordered the large bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-To freshen up in general: When I have been particularly sweaty for whatever reason, I&#x27;ve put this on a tissue or and used it to freshen my face, underarms, cleavage, neckline, etc.  It evaporates quickly, is cooling and smells fresh without being overpowering.  It&#x27;s nice during a long commute or after the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can see how some people would not like the scent even though I like it.  It is not a strong, long lasting or perfumey scent, but it is definitely very rosy.  Some people might associate the smell with \\&quot;grandma\\&quot; since rose petal is a classic scent that was very popular for cosmetics and fragrances in earlier decades.  If you find that off putting, I would recommend trying another one of the available scents because I do think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Best toner! I used to use Clinique&#x27;s #2 toner but I read it has alcohol in it. I was trying to find a toner than gave me the same clean feel without the alcohol and this toner does it! I have really oily and fairly acne prone skin. This toner doesn&#x27;t break me out and it gets rid of the grime without drying me out. I use it once in the morning after I&#x27;ve washed my face. And twice at night - I don&#x27;t wash my face at night so I clean it twice with this toner. This toner smells like rose water, which is okay. Roses are not my favorite scent but the scents goes away pretty quickly so it&#x27;s not a big deal. I&#x27;ve also tried the lavender scented toner - I like this rose scented one more. The lavender smells almost medicinal.</li>
            <li> love it! will buy more!</li>
            <li> This is a refreshing toner to use in the morning. Makes skin feel clear and bright. This toner does not make me break out or cause my skin to dry out.  And you only need a little to spread about your face. I like that the top is a squirt top so only a little comes out at a time. That way you can avoid accidentally spilling some. If you do need more you can just squeeze the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is unique and is not my favorite thing in the world. But it wears off quickly and is not that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will make this a normal part of my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> I like this product as a toner, but the smell is GHASTLY. The only way I can describe it is that it reminds me of dill pickles. Which I really would rather not smell on my face. Ugh. Definitely trying a different scent next time.</li>
            <li> I love this! My esthetician suggested it, and it&#x27;s great. It smells wonderful, it cleans my face, and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I will be ordering it again and again and again!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that my mom swears by this face cleanser/astringent - not sure of the correct cosmetic terminology. Does seem add a bit of youth to her features. She is 68yrs old.</li>
            <li> smells and feels lovely on the skin</li>
            <li> I love it !!!&lt;br /&gt;It makes my face soft , silky and clean :)&lt;br /&gt;And looks so rosy cheeks</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and acne. I use this in the morning instead of moisturizer under my makeup. It has not worsened my acne, although it also hasn&#x27;t seemed to improve it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I doubt most people could use a toner to replace moisturizer, but it worked for me!</li>
            <li> This face toner is absolutely wonderful made of Vitamin E, Rose Petal Water, Aloe Vera, and Witch Hazel! This natural toner is alcohol-free so it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. It works great for all skin types and  because it contains witch hazel, it is an especially fantastic remedy for combination skin (commonly a combination of oily, greasy, dry, and normal) and Rosacea. Like all toners, it helps balance, calm and even out the skin tone. Thayers has been around since 1847 and is still in business, so they must be doing it right! If your man doesn&#x27;t mind the rose scent, this witch hazel product will be a wonder for evening out his skin tone as well.&lt;br /&gt;*My favorite part: I love that it is all natural, alcohol-free, has natural moisturizers, and contains witch hazel. To me, that is the perfect combination for a skin toner. Plus, who doesn&#x27;t love a delicious rose fragrance?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard great things about witch hazel so I decided to buy this one because of its reviews. I love the smell and the way it leaves my skin feeling.</li>
            <li> I ADORE this witch hazel. I use this right after my Clarisonic and it not only brightens my skin tone, but moisturizes my face nicely as well! If you have acne-prone skin, I would highly suggest this miracle worker as well! Just use a light hand, apply with a cotton ball or round and that&#x27;s it! I don&#x27;t even have to follow with moisturizer anymore. It&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> For the very first time I used a face toner that doesn&#x27;t irritated my sensitive skin . It cleased my face very well, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin. I only been using it for a week. I&#x27;m going to use it for a full month to see more result and then, I&#x27;ll write a review on it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked. I&#x27;ve tried so many toners out there and none works as well as this. Makes my skin feel so soft and it just leaves a fresh feel. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This rose petal witch hazel was refreshing on my face.  I will try to find other ways to use it too.</li>
            <li> have used witch hazel for skin toning since the &#x27;60&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Love this. Second reoder.</li>
            <li> Prompt, exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love it! Gentle cleansing and smells great!</li>
            <li> Great toner, keeps my skin even and soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really torn on this product. It smells pretty nice and provides some nice, light moisture, but I feel it may be making me break out. I had a regimen of using Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel, occasionally even the Studio 54 version at walgreens, with an occasional use of ACV toner. Prior to using this, my skin was pretty clear. Now I&#x27;m getting cystic acne. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just a coincidence because of hormonal fluctuations or perhaps other circumstances. I&#x27;m going to buy Dickinsons again to see if it makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is kind to my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a nice witch hazel toner. Its non drying. Feels good on skin. I love the rose petal fragrance its refreshing.</li>
            <li> I make a lot of my own personal beauty products, childrens, cleaning&amp; so on. I&#x27;ve used witch hazel in several items, this always being the brand of choice, but for beauty products, or ANYTHING that would be put on the skin, this is a fabulous one to chose! Or to just use straight as a facial toner. Very practical &amp; never disappointing!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite toners ever. I have oily skin and moderate acne. After using it my skin feels totally refreshed soft and the rose scented water really uplifts my mood. Since it&#x27;s made with natural ingredients this never irritates my skin. It&#x27;s gentle so it&#x27;s suitable for dry, oily, sensitive, and acne skin. I will keep buying this!</li>
            <li> It smells lovely lovely but subtle. I use it instead of commercial akeup wipes. I like the way it leaves my face so clean, moisturiized and so very lightly fragrant.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised , love the smell and this product is very gentile but very effective . I have very sensitive skin that reacts to most products . It&#x27;s a trial and error with me . This toner really works, better than plain which hazel and definitely better than the more expensive brand name I&#x27;ve been using. Will definitely be ordering again and I&#x27;m very pleased with the seller also.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and is very nice and soft on skin. Looks like ordinary water but its effects are amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel for about a year now and it does so much for my skin. I notice a visible difference when I miss a single day. My favorite skin product, and this stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My face hasn&#x27;t looked this good since childhood.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner to lock in moisture after you clean your face. It smells great too</li>
            <li> I use this product on my face daily. I love the way it makes my skin smell and feel. I have highly sensitive combination-type skin and I am very picky about the products I use (especially on my face). I am pleased to say that I have had a great experience with this item and I plan on buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Very gentle, I love the soft rose scent</li>
            <li> This product cleans my face so well.  My skin feels so clean and looks to healthy when I use this.</li>
            <li> I do add a couple drops of tea tree oil to mine because I have oily acne prone skin. This really helps to keep my skin clear. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and I will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Really like this product-has a great smell with no burn from alcohol.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells absolutely wonderful!</li>
            <li> THIS SMELLS SO FREAKING GOOD! And does wonderful things for basically every aspect of life.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such an awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I am using this product for 7-8 months now &amp; I don&#x27;t think it makes any difference to my skin. I mean no positive or negative effect. So probably I vl not buy this again.</li>
            <li> did not work for me at all! and i got allergy of this product!! all the red pimple came out of my face!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin. I brought this item based on the reviews. After using it in the morning and night I noticed the amount of oil on my face almost doubled, so instead of using it two times a day I only used it in the mornings.  I didn&#x27;t noticed a difference in my pores after using it. I felt like I was putting water on my face. I didn&#x27;t feel any tingle, or any indication that it was working. This toner is meant to moisturize, if I knew that I would have never purchased it. When I first started using it I noticed that it would help reduce the size of my pimples, now it doesn&#x27;t even do that anymore. For acne prone skin I think Alba Botanica&#x27;s Natural Acnedote Deep Clean Astringent is much better at reducing oil on the face and minimizing pimples.</li>
            <li> I personally feel that my oily, acne prone skin does much better with Witch Hazel toner. This one has a pleasant smell also :).</li>
            <li> This seems to work fine. The rose smell turned me off though because it doesn&#x27;t seem to smell right with the witch hazel. Witch hazel has it&#x27;s own distinctive smell so so this combo wasn&#x27;t the most appealing.</li>
            <li> it is ok and it works</li>
            <li> This product did wonders for my skin. I had a chronic problem of dry skin with acne. If I used a lotion or creme my skin would break out even more but if I neglected to moisturize my skin would flake. This toner was a miracle for my skin. After two weeks of using this toner my skin cleared up and after 6 weeks of use I stopped wearing foundation all together. I can&#x27;t say it will do this for everyone but this product was EXACTLY what my skin needed. I used Cetaphil cleanser for dry skin, then applied this toner with a cotton pad and then applied my acne medication. Works like a charm every day and the effects don&#x27;t seem to wear off like many other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this toner for everything! I use it for morning and night after washing face. Doesn&#x27;t dry skin and makes it feel soft. Also tightens my pores and has helped clear up my skin. It&#x27;s great to awaken and freshen face after a hard work out too. Just put in a small spray bottle, in gym bag.</li>
            <li> I love it . it is so gentle for my face and do not have alcohol. the flame is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate my face.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Smells better! Received this quickly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love this toner very much. It feels just so clean and fresh after use this toner. I would recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and every night after I wash my face. This gentle formula is perfect for my acne-prone skin. My skin has cleared up a lot.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and my skin feels clean after using it. Perfect for the morning or after the gym</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews in Amazon.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.  I use it every night after cleansing.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, instead it leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  It has a strong rose fragerance which is why I gave four stars rating instead of five.  I&#x27;m not sure what other fragrances are available.  At around $9.00 you get a fairly large bottle compared to department store toners. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i had never gotten breakouts before but started getting them as i started excercising. using this product on my face and upper back has kept breakouts off.</li>
            <li> Cool, refreshing, and smells so good!</li>
            <li> I love how its all natural and I am a fast of scent! This will definitely go into my skincare routine!</li>
            <li> Excellent Very very 👏🏻👏🏻🌹</li>
            <li> Can you believe that some people are still getting alcohol in there Rose Petal Witch Hazel?</li>
            <li> I love the soft rose scent of this witch hazel. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin but cleanses the face very well. I also like that it contains aloe vera which is soothing. It&#x27;s just what I expected and works really well at removing excess dirt and makeup that my face wash misses.</li>
            <li> Delicate for my sensitive skin and has a nice soft fragrance</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m not impressed. What I look for in a toner: I like the cotton ball to have dirt and makeup on it that was left over after I wash my face. I like it to tingle and maybe even burn a little, so I know my pores are tightened, and I like it to leave my skin enough natural oils so that it doesn&#x27;t work extra hard to replace them and thus make my skin greasy. Since I was 14&lt;br /&gt;I have used a lot of Clinique&#x27;s toner for combination/oily skin, which seems to do all the things I want, but the alcohol strips my skin of its natural oils and can make my face red and blotchy. I&#x27;ve used a&lt;br /&gt;whole bottle of witch hazel and liked it. It didn&#x27;t leave the cotton ball dirty or make my skin tingle, but it left the natural oils. So, so far it&#x27;s been a catch-22 and in the mean time I got a generic &amp;#34;sensitive skin astringent&amp;#34; from the dollar store which pretty much works great, but has a smell I don&#x27;t like. I&#x27;ve used THIS toner two days this week after I got it and both times I had greasier skin and cakier makeup. I&#x27;m not sure if this product is to blame, or if it&#x27;s something else I&#x27;m using. I read one person said that it caused the oils to come out of their pores the first few days, but it was a kind of cleansing, and it stopped after a few days and then they really loved it. So I was kind of expecting that to happen, and it did. Maybe I should stick with it and see if it gets better. I honestly really prefer my sensitive skin astringent from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money for healthy skin toner.  The rose petal smell lifts me up every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and has minimized my pores in just a week!</li>
            <li> Product feels great on my skin and has made my complexion much clearer in combination in other products.</li>
            <li> It does not have any irritation to my face. I feel comfortable after every use. Makes my face feels refreshed and very soft, mild scent.</li>
            <li> This was the sixth time that I bought this product. Perfect for everyday skin care and reasonable price. Luv it as always~~I highly recommend it~~</li>
            <li> This is great witch hazel but honestly you can get the same product at the dollar store for a lot less $$.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I think it makes my skin better. There were other factors and changes that I made from between my skin was doing badly and when it got better, so I can&#x27;t say with certainty that the improvement was due to this product. But, I definitely feel that my skin tone has evened out a bit. And really, I just love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used rose water to clean my skin since I was 14 and I never had breaking out or acne problem even though I have a oily skin. Rose water is the only toner I used and I am not considering to use anything else. Even after using your cleanser when you use this product to wipe your skin you will see it cleans further, proof is on the cotton :) You can even use it around the eyes, it gives a nice soothing feeling. I think this product is suitable for every skin type, my mother has very dry and sensitive skin and she uses rose water for more than 20 years as her only face cleanser. I loved that they added Aloe vera, it is a great bonus, makes the skin soft and the product smells amazing. It is more like a fresh natural flower smell rather than an artificial odor so don&#x27;t expect a regular cosmetics smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to every body. you will not regret.</li>
            <li> i was looking for a toner to make my skin soft &amp; keep it clear and oil free all day! i found it in this all natural product! i use it twice a day, morning and night and it provides a great base for make-up but makes your skin look great even without it! i highly rcommend this, no chemicals and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a great toner and it makes my skin feel soft, cool and fresh. It has many organic ingredients and the rose fragrance is lovely. Definitely a great buy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, affordable toner, and I am so happy I found such an amazing product. The smell is nice,fresh and clean. I am obsessed with how this toner makes my skin feel. I will continue to buy this product forever!</li>
            <li> I like it - I just finished the first bottle...Does dry out my skin a little but it is a great toner and gets of any extra face makeup off! Ordering another now..</li>
            <li> Nice and refeshing, I like the smell of it, and i like that it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol or harsh chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I think this is a good product just not good for my skin type.  I have oily/acne prone skin and typically only purchase oil-free products but I read so many great reviews on this product I decided to give it a try as I am trying to go more \\&quot;green\\&quot; in every aspect of my life - skin care included.  The rose smells wonderful and the actual product feels very soothing over your skin.  I used this product for about a week once a day and immediately began noticing my face getting oiler throughout the day.  I started to break out (outside of the usual) and my pores were actually getting larger.  Since nothing else in my skin care routine has changed yet I determined it to be Thayers, probably because of the natural oils and tannins.  I stopped using this product and tried Dickerson&#x27;s witchhazel (oil-free but does contain alcohol) which has worked out much better for me.  If you have oily skin I would not recommend this product, I really wish it worked though!!</li>
            <li> Did NOTHING for my skin</li>
            <li> Who does not love roae petal toner??? This is sth must be own from all girlllssss. Fresh clean makes ur face soft and breath pores :p</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a few reviewers found the scent to be over powering. Let me give my honest opinion. The rose fragrance is lovely, clean, and refreshing. Moreover, my husband uses it, and he finds it to be clean smelling; also invigorating; We love it. Cleaning, and exfoliating your skin; coupled with Thayer toner at the end of the routine will render your skin amazing without make-up. Furthermore, there are other things in life to be critical about, other than the smell of this stuff. As long as the product does the job, it is worth using. There is also a fragrance free version; but who wants that? unless your skin is hyper sensative.</li>
            <li> love it very gentle with my skin</li>
            <li> nice clean rose scent, dries smooth does not take alot to cover body good or after shower or bath just as expected</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Smells great and works well on my very sensitive acne prone face!! Makes my face feel fresh with a long lasting clean feeling without over drying! Very gentle! So glad I found this product!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Can&#x27;t wait to try this product out.</li>
            <li> great product- much nicer than usual brands, doesn&#x27;t burn or cause irritation</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance - great for my dry skin - will purchase again</li>
            <li> Not even sure how I happened upon this product but I sure do love it. I haven&#x27;t used a toner for years but all the positive reviews enticed me to try it. I have older skin which is fairly dry and sensitive. The first time I used it I experienced some tingling and was worried I wouldn&#x27;t be able to continue using it. Since then it has been fine. I don&#x27;t find it drying or irritating and the rose scent is lovely - very mild and it doesn&#x27;t linger. My pores seem slightly smaller and my skin tone more even but that may be wishful thinking. Most of the time I don&#x27;t even use cotton balls and just splash a little on my face. Very soothing - reminds me of my grandma 😊</li>
            <li> Works awesome and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> Clear my dark spots . I use it twice a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for about a week, but so far, I love it!  I use this as a toner, and the scent is light, lovely, and real.  My skin seems more even-toned...I think it is helping my tendency toward redness, and it feels like it is good for my skin.  It does not contain alcohol, and does not dry out my skin. My skin tends to be sensitive to any chemicals, so I have to be careful what I use.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product - nice light rose scent - very refreshing. It arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
            <li> This toner is great! I love the smell!</li>
            <li> This toner smells like clean roses and feels wonderfully refreshing on the face. I use this every morning and the bottle will last me a long time. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol in it. I plan to repurchase after I run out.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. No alcohol, non-drying. Beautiful rose scent, and my skin feels smooth. What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of alcohol free toner and was extremely excited to see try this product after reading several positive reviews. It&#x27;s amazing! The smell is positive and I can already see a difference in my skin. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type of person who bounces from product to product, ever in search of that elusive glow the movie stars and television ads promise is just within my reach. However, when I got about halfway done with the bottle (two months after initially purchasing, meaning I had another two months to go) I started to panic that I would run out before I ordered the next bottle. It is that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saw some results after just a few days of use, but as I continue to use it the results are more dramatic. My skin is soft and clear and glowing and looks very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose smell is very refreshing. It might seem a little strong when you first put it on (especially if you&#x27;re using a lot!) but it quickly fades.</li>
            <li> This is the most lovely product!  Slight rose scent but not too much for the men in my family to use, as well.  Highly recommend this product and will be back for me!</li>
            <li> I ordered \\&quot;Thayer - Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal Alc.Fr, 12 fl oz liquid\\&quot;. After I received it, I found \\&quot;2007 Nov \\&quot; is printed on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a really  old old old stuff.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing! My skin has made a complete turnaround from being patchy and oily at the same time with random breakouts to being smooth, clean, and soft. I haven&#x27;t even broken out since I started using this all-natural product. I&#x27;ve been using it twice daily for about 2 or 3 weeks now and my face is radiant and glowing with tight pores. I even got compliments on my skin, which hasn&#x27;t happened for many years now. The price is also quite affordable (I got mine at Whole Foods for $9.99 and it&#x27;s a pretty big bottle). I would strongly recommend this to any of my loved ones, you should try it too!</li>
            <li> This makes my face feel so fresh and soft&lt;br /&gt;Plus the scent is wonderful</li>
            <li> This is NOT your ordinary witch hazel. Would not be without this as a part of my bedtime routine Love the way it smells and makes me feel. Only wish I had found out about this years earlier.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE The smell an it cleans my face so well better then make up remover and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin♡</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. Fantastic price and packaged well.</li>
            <li> I like using witch hazel as a toner but this takes it up a step.  Very nice soft fragrance and feels wonderful on my skin.  Won&#x27;t be my last purchase.</li>
            <li> I put it on a cotton round and swab my face. i use it mainly after work (I work in a sweaty coffee shop lol). it&#x27;s not overly drying. didn&#x27;t do anything for my acne, but feels refreshing. not a miracle cure if you have acne, but will definitely get any grime/dirt off your face and leave you feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> This is great! I use it twice a day.  More skin looks a lot better.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely!!&lt;br /&gt;It does seem to take of my makeup and I feel clean after using it!&lt;br /&gt;My only fear is this may be causing me to breakout! Will update on the condition of my skin in a month or so</li>
            <li> Smells good. Not over powering. I would re-order again.</li>
            <li> So I drew short straws in the skin department and have sensitive combination skin. That means I&#x27;ll have oil fields on my nose forehead chin and parts of my cheeks, and red flaky dry irritated skin around my nostrils and a few other places. Usually toners are too strong smell like crap and irriate even the oily parts. Not this. It soaked up excess oils and dirt left behind from my clarisonic and smelled great.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling clean but not tight. Love the slight rose scent. Great to refresh your face in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Received order really quickly! And I am happy with it. The smell is exactly like roses and with my first use I saw a glow in my skin. As the ingredients mention there is no alcohol in this product. So it is not drying at all.</li>
            <li> The best rose water i have ever tried !!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I use it at night to wash my face. I just spray it on a makeup wedge and wipe it on, the makeup and oil absorb into the wedge, I don&#x27;t even need lotion. I use it as a toner under lotion in the morning. Works great on sunburn. I believe this helps keep my skin younger looking, I have been using it for months now.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner, hands down. And alcohol free with a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Its part of my skin regimen that has helped me get rid of my nasty cystic acne</li>
            <li> ...one of the very first ingredients before witch hazel is fragrance and my face is extremely sensitive to fragrances. It smells fantastic though! My boyfriend likes it, so he gets to use it. I&#x27;m using the Cucumber scented one instead. It doesn&#x27;t smell as nice, but my skin thanks me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years.  I use it after I wash my face, morning and night, and it leaves my skin toned but soft.  My husband now uses the aloe vera formula and my niece is a regular user as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to treat my skin after using my micro needle roller, and it smells so good!  Very light, petal scent, and soothing.  I think it is helping my skin stay clear, too!  I will never stop using this!</li>
            <li> I love it so much, it feels so gentle on the face, the skin tone feels soft after using it, the scent is so good!</li>
            <li> Just started using this. My face feels so smooth after and it smells great. I do think that it makes my face red after using so it&#x27;s causing some irritation</li>
            <li> I really like this toner. I recently completely revamped my skincare routine and this along with the other products I purchased has really made a difference. This toner is very soothing and feels really nice on my skin. I really feel like it adds some moisture back into my skin after cleansing, even before I add a moisturizer. The rose fragrance is very noticeable, so if you do not like rose I would try one of the other varieties. I really like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks I use it morning and night. It feels nice on your face and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin or burn when you put it on. I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s helped with under eye circles. It seems like it&#x27;s going to last forever!</li>
            <li> This might be the product I&#x27;ve been searching for my whole life. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and my skin is radiant and blemish free. Fingers crossed but so far I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product 3 times not sure why it works so well but it does! I&#x27;m a dude and I don&#x27;t use products like this very often but this is by far the easiest less intrusive most effective for what I need and that&#x27;s just simple cleansing, toner, and astringent.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because of the rave reviews and the history of the product but it just doesn&#x27;t clean as well as a toner with alcohol does.  While toners with alcohol dry out my face however, this hazel toner did not and it smelled very pretty.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product, my skin looks and feels amazing since I started using it, I love the smell too.</li>
            <li> I actually think this makes my skin blotchier/reddier. Would not recommend! I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. This would be perfect for dry/normal skin, but it did nothing with mind and only made it blotchy.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and fresh. i have sensitive skin and it is the first toner that hasnt dried out my face and left it bright red. definately reordering</li>
            <li> Beautiful product, skin feels so refreshed, clean and mosturised after using it, and the scent of Rose is heavenly, very calming to the nerves. Love this and will stick to it from now on.</li>
            <li> Love it. Been using it for 3 days and can already see the difference. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find affordable vegan-friendly beauty products, so I was really lucky to stumble upon this. It&#x27;s a good amount for the price, which is great. It also smells great and leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.... not great!</li>
            <li> This is the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used! I use it not only on my face but also all over my body after shower every night. And in the morning, my skin becomes so soft and smooth, which never happened befor. It smells so good as well, just as the rose petal. And I&#x27;m happy to see that it&#x27;s alcohol-free! I would definitely use it every day and I&#x27;m thinking of buying a cucumber one for the summer. Just love it!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this toner.  It has a light fresh smell.  I noticed some complained about the scent being too strong.  I am typically pretty sensitive about scents and don&#x27;t like most women&#x27;s colognes/ perfumes.  I found this scent to be very pleasant and light.  This toner  is very mild and makes skin feel nice and fresh with zero drying effect.  Very gentle.  Highly recommend and will continue to purchase/use for myself.</li>
            <li> Smells SO good!! And it really does work, the amount of gunk left on my face after washing it is seriously gross, this gets it all off!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell. Does not dry out my skin will definitely be purchasing again. Even got my mom hooked on it!</li>
            <li> I had tried many toners before this one and none of them worked as fast or as well as this one. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over three weeks and I have seen huge results! I have super sensitive skin and a lot of products just don&#x27;t work for me. I used to have some areas with color pigmentation and bumps on my cheeks that wouldn&#x27;t go away but after using this my skin looks so good! I feel confident enough to leave the house without makeup now. It smells great, it&#x27;s not expensive, and it really works! Definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> smells pretty, works great</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is so refreshing! I use it right after washing my face and before my lotion. I can actually wipe off dirt and oils even after washing. It really helps with my skin breakouts. It&#x27;s part of my every day skin regime. I also use it to prevent back acne.</li>
            <li> This is like freshness in a jar. Loveeeee the smell. Makes me feel fresh. Not sure how much it has helped my skin&#x27;s health. But i just love the feel and smell of it!</li>
            <li> I was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Tomato toner prior to using this. It was twice as expensive but this stuff is amazing. Works just as well and possibly even better than Burt&#x27;s Bees. I have also noticed that my skin is much clearer. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It&#x27;s gentle, no alcohol and smells very nice. I use it all year long but it is especially good in the winter when it&#x27;s cold and dry.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle , and i just love it. Clean face and great fragrance. I recommended  to my daughter and daughter in law and they both love it. Thank you for this wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love with this toner!&lt;br /&gt;I have an extremely oily t-zone with very dry cheeks, to the point where I deal eczema patches on my cheeks during the winter. I had been using the seaweed toner from The Body Shop for years now but felt that while it does keep the oils at bay around my t-zones, it does nothing for my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried many toners from high end to drugstore, but could never find one that does what I need.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking around one day on Amazon and decided to give this toner a try. I&#x27;m so glad I did! It sufficiently kept my oily t-zone at bay but also moisturizes my cheeks! My skin feels soft but not oily. I purchased another bottle for my sister to try and she loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I can think of is the smell; the strong rose scent might be a turn off for some people. However, the smell does not irritate my skin and I quite like the smell of rose.</li>
            <li> Love the light rose aroma. It leaves the face feeling clean and looking fresh and bright. I have allergic reaction to chemicals in other products but this product has showed no adverse reaction on my skin so far.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural toner to replace my favourite Humphries - I saw that there were many good reviews for this one and considered buying it until I looked at the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;It contains Butylene Glycol &amp; Methylparaben which have been flagged by the skincare website as damaging and carcinogenic to skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry, but this is just not natural enough for me.</li>
            <li> Is it suitable for all skin types ????</li>
            <li> Great toner.  I use it almost every day in the morning without soap or water, simply on a cotton ball.  It helps keep my face clean and clear without being drying.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on my skin since it does not contain alcohol. I really like the Thayer&#x27;s brand as a toner to help with my rosy cheeks. I will continue to repurchase this. I put it in a small spray bottle to use as a facial mist instead of just using a cotton pad to apply and it works great.</li>
            <li> Just started using it every morning and night after I wash my face and my face seems to feel smoother &amp; clearer. I don&#x27;t know if its the witch hazel alone but it definitely helps dry out the little pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> Great product, very well recommended.</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and the toner is ordinary for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the flavor is a little weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is a good toner, only not suitable for me.</li>
            <li> gave me some redness, but I m not sure its because of the product, other wise , nice smell , and feel..</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry/sensitive skin, so I was looking for a rosewater toner when I clicked on this. Decided to take a chance and order it - so glad I did. I use this every day, just after cleansing and before moisturizing. This toner smells fantastic - and the best part is that it&#x27;s alcohol free, so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin. I bought this over a month and a half ago, share it with someone else, and still have a quarter bottle left - so if you use it, on average, once a day, it should last you around four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve started using this, my skin has gotten a lot less dry/red - would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this toner!  I happened upon by accident while looking through beauty products on Amazon.  Based on the reviews I thought I would give it a try because I haven&#x27;t used toner in a long while and I know that should be part of my beauty routine.  I am so glad I bought it!  It makes my skin feel tighter and firmer.  Even under my make-up I feel like it gives my skin a bit of a glow.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the scent.  It has a little &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; perfume smell.  However the scent doesn&#x27;t linger and is soon gone after applied.</li>
            <li> I truly believe that this toner have some kind of magic that soothe my acne prone/ hormonal acne skin. I see a lot of improvement in my skin complexion and I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great toner with a lot of benefits! Oh and I also spray it on my face after I finish my makeup and it makes it look great :D</li>
            <li> I may not buy a toner from a different company again. This toner is great and refreshing, and does not dry my face like other toners. I have combination skin with an oily forehead, and this cuts back on the shine and oil, and my breakouts have reduced since using this. I use it twice a day, and one bottle lasts me 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> i love the smell of this! it keeps my skin very moisturized</li>
            <li> This is one of the few toners I have used that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.</li>
            <li> IN LOVE! it doesn&#x27;t over dry my face like other toners. and it smells light and rosy. great for before moisturizer and i even have a nice glow afterwards.</li>
            <li> Really good and doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin</li>
            <li> Great value, great amount and great smell with effect on my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3-4 years now. I use it as a toner and a moisturizer. It works great when removing make up or moistening your face. I always look forward to using this product because I always have smooth baby skin after I apply it. Keeps my skin hydrated and healthy.  It smells great, it works great. This is definitely something I will use for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I notice any difference between this and regular witch hazel, but I am happy with it overall. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think I will try the lavender version the next time I buy. The rose scent is a bit too \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; for me, but that is just my personal preference. It&#x27;s a light enough scent that I can handle it for now.</li>
            <li> I really like how this feels. I will continue using it. I put on my loton after using Thayer witch hazel toner.</li>
            <li> I got this scent along with another scent and I am very glad I did. Love the scent of roses and anyone who is familiar with witch hazel knows that it doesn&#x27;t smell so great, lol glad I decided to give this try. I use it as a toner and it removes any makeup left over from my face wash while keeping it hydrated. Now I&#x27;m interested in trying the aloe and lemon one....... Hmmmm will do so once I run out of these 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I use this along with Jan Marini Sacylic face wash, tree tea oil, and jojoba oil. I use this product as a toner after washing my face, then apply the tree tea oil mixed with jojoba oil, with a cotton ball. I love it! It makes my face feel so clean, without over drying it. I used to use Mario Badescu cucumber toner, but it really was too drying. This product is cheap, but not cheaply made. My face looks and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> The title speaks for itself hahah sorry I had to write that. This product feels so amazing to me!!! I have NEVER in my life, used a toner that didn&#x27;t burn or tingle...this toner feels like your putting refreshing water on your face. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this...I&#x27;ve been using it for 1-2 weeks now and I am in love with this toner and will never venture away from it EVER. It works just the same as any other toner but feels smoother and better for your skin. I know alot of reviewers didn&#x27;t like the smell but I LOVE the smell. It smells pleasant to me and not too strong and I even use it while pregnant and my senses still like the smell lol. My Fiancee said it smelled like pesticides when he leaned over to kiss me which made me crack up hysterically but I guess everyone has different senses.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toner to say the least, I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to find it. I have been searching for the right toner for a very long time, and this is it! I need not say more. Thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> This toner is probably the best I&#x27;ve tried!&lt;br /&gt;My skin is quite picky when it comes to cosmetics &amp; beauty products - most commonly I get a bad breakout, but sometimes a rash or itch or burning sensation. I&#x27;ve even had bad reactions from products for sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;Thayers toner works really well - leaves my skin clean, fresh and smooth without drying it or causing acne breakouts. That&#x27;s what I expect from a toner.&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;d like to complain a bit then I&#x27;d probably like it less scented, cause my bf doesn&#x27;t like the smell of roses! Can you imagine...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a gentler toner, and this is it. It works well and I really like the smell. I have had a couple of people comment on how good I smell after using it. And it not an overpowering smell, just a light rose scent.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and its a pretty good deal! It smells great and is a good toner/moisturizer for my face. Unlike lotions, it doesnt make my skin real oily. Also, I have read about some of the natural healing qualities of the ingredients. I will keep using this :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought two of these and they work great. Helps to moisturize my face and keep it clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When on medicine (Benadryn) it may be a good idea to not use this product. My face becomes very red, in patches, for a while. May not be ideal for a person with very sensitive skin. Otherwise it works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the way this product makes the skin on my face feel. It doesnt leave any film, it just feels healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about four or five months now and I have seen an improvement. I have combination skin, my forehead is oily and my cheeks are dry. I use this at night before I go to bed and my skin is soft and I haven&#x27;t been breaking out on my forehead as much as well. It is the only product that has shown me results like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a wart on my finger and I put some of the witch hazel on that and it is also making it less noticeable as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle last for a long time, I am just a little under half way done with it now. I just put a dab on a cotton pad every night and wipe it around my face. I was doing it in the morning and at night. In the morning I put on face wash, this toner, and moisturizer but it did seem like too much for my skin and when I went to just putting it on at night and the face wash and moisturizer in the morning that is when I got the best results.  Nights when I forget to put on the toner I can definitely tell the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Smells like fresh roses, none of that witch hazel scent you would think. It&#x27;s refreshing and I do think it has softened my skin. You can see how much dirt it removes after you&#x27;ve already washed your face. Sometimes I use two or three cotton balls of this to clean my face after. Overall I would definitely buy again. The smell alone is amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin has been changing with time and hormones and I need a gentle but effective cleaner. Also something without a harsh scent for Ihave sensitives with that as well. This fit the bill. Everything I was wanting in one product. I feel fresh and clean my skin glows and  I don&#x27;t smell like a chemicial plant. I will countine purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  I love the soft floral scent and the way it makes my skin feel so soft. I am very pleased with the product and the delivery was very speedy.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find good quality REAL Witch Hazel and this stuff delivers!</li>
            <li> I have fairly oily skin and have used clinques clairifying lotion for years. I was skeptical that this would work because it is so mild, but after a few weeks I feel a noticeable  difference. My skin feels smoother and I&#x27;ve had less break outs. It also has a pleasant smell. And while I still have fairly oily skin, I do feel like this product has minimized some of the oiliness I will definitely purchase more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love it, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> LOVE! this product. It smells wonderful, and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. Would definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I love how refreshing this toner makes my skin feel. It contains no alcohol so it is not overly drying. Rose water scented and great for acneic skin.</li>
            <li> This is easily my favorite thing on earth.  The smell is so refreshing!  I&#x27;ll turn 40 soon, and have beautiful skin.  I use usually twice a day on my face.  Add lavender EO to it and make a after-sun spray, basically put it on anything that needs any type of soothing.  I will NEVER be without Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel.  I&#x27;ve tried $$$$ facial remedies, and this works the best for me, and is 8 bucks.  Can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I cleanse my face and use this toner right after and it removes any leftover residue!will definatley buy again!</li>
            <li> I ordered Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel after reading an article about how it can help with itch and irritation from poison oak.  I really liked this witch hazel and it help a lot with the itching from the poison oak I accidentally got into while pruning some shrubs in my front yard.  And  the smell--it&#x27;s heavenly!  I&#x27;m adding it to my emergency kit.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, combination adult-onset, acne-prone skin and since I have been using this for two weeks my skin has been so much more clear, more even tone and looks brighter in general. I love the scent and how moisturizing it is when most toners have alcohol and are very drying. This is going onto my &#x27;must-have&amp;#34; list. No reaction at all. If anything it calms my skin when irritated.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product.  I have mature skin which is very sensitive.  I was looking for a toner that would take off the residue left behind after my cleansing.  This does the trick and it smells fantastic.  Best thing it does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  All of my favorite ORGANIC ingredients (witch hazel, lavender and aloe)  in one bottle--without the ALCHOHOL!!&lt;br /&gt;This is such a mild astringent that I feel free to use it any time my skin feels oily.  It leaves my skin feeling refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasant, light and quickly dissipates as the application dries.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m already sharing the bottle with my daughter, we&#x27;ll be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> This is a great and gentle product. No alcohol!! It really helps to smooth and rebalance your skin. I will never use any drugstore toners again. This is the one you should use! It also smells beautifully and is very refreshing to use throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why the shipping jumped up so much. I remember it being prime not long ago.</li>
            <li> Really nice for use after wet shaving too soothe your skin, possibly in conjunction with an alum block.  The scent is *very* genuine - just like roses.  Not too surprising, since I think the source of the scent is natural.  It blends nicely with more \\&quot;manly\\&quot; scents like bay rum, but adds its own charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it, and probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great as a toner.</li>
            <li> I use this often as an aftershave substitute.  Really pleasant smell but doesn&#x27;t linger, so if you want to apply a cologne, this doesn&#x27;t impose on it.  Definitely does its job, great on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is my second bottle and I will continue to purchase this item. It is cheap and effective</li>
            <li> I bought this a year ago did not use it. I found it a couple weeks and decided to give it another try! Boy was I glad I did that! Its a really good toner and moisturizer! Good for my acne which Ive seen a improvement in. I have been using Gental purpose cleanser, queen helens mask  green one and mud mask, manuka honey, and this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent makeup remover and that&#x27;s about it. Used this about twice a day for a month and I didn&#x27;t see or feel a difference on my skin. No, it didn&#x27;t tighten my pores. And no, it didn&#x27;t moisturize. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but this toner sometimes irritated my skin and left red splotches on my face. They went away after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;If you want to moisturize your skin look elsewhere. I recently started using a cream moisturizer (St. Ives) and after only a week it&#x27;s made a bigger difference than this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really understand the purpose of toner, but I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try with all its great reviews. My face had been breaking out so badly the past couple months with an oily, greasy-looking t-zone and random severe dry spots. This product feels like water but it moisturizes so well and makes my face feel so soothed. Some products make your face burn or tingle or as another reviewer put it \\&quot;attacked\\&quot; but this toner is so calming to the skin and makes me feel refreshed. The oiliness has decreased some but the dry spots are completely gone. I apply it twice a day, morning and night and I love its natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s cruelty-free.</li>
            <li> This is my 10th bottle already. I&#x27;m in love with it. I used it right after cleaned my face and then I will apply regular toner on top of it. Very good smell and makes your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this about a week now, but I like it.  My face feels fresh and moisturized and my pores may be shrinking?  Not sure... I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing the long-term results....</li>
            <li> Lovely when you put in a spray bottle and soothe tired legs!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I thought it would be much gentler than regular witch hazel.  I do not like the smell and it makes my face feel greasy.</li>
            <li> love this for reasonable price and good quality.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t delivered on time bur I like the product.</li>
            <li> It did nothing to my face, i felt that it enlarged my pores in fact.</li>
            <li> Love how it makes my skin feels, but one day my skin was a little taught. I like the smell of the roses. I noticed the leftover impurities left on my skin continued to be less as I continued to use it daily.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff. My face hates water and all cleansers, no matter how gentle, so I&#x27;ve stopped washing my face and started using this stuff instead. My face is clear and hydrated for the first time in my adult life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning I use a cotton pad soaked in Thayer&#x27;s to wipe off oil from the night before then apply moisturizer and sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the evening I&#x27;ll use a makeup wipe to take off any makeup, and then use a cotton pad soaked in this toner to remove the oil residue of the wipe and grab any missed makeup, then apply moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rose scent is my favorite. I had to buy lavender and peach in a pinch and they smelled like a baby&#x27;s butt and peach schnapps, respectively. Neither of which I wanted on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re on the fence about this product just do it. If you don&#x27;t use it every day you can pour it in a spray bottle and spritz your face to feel fresh whenever you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;protip: do not travel with this bottle. It leaks, they all leak, no matter what you do. no, taping it shut won&#x27;t help. either (1) put some cotton pads in a ziploc baggie and pour the witch hazel over them until they&#x27;re soaked or (2) just get a cheap little travel bottle that squeezes (like $0.50 at REI) so you don&#x27;t have to deal with spills every trip. it will spill whether you travel in a plane or a car.</li>
            <li> Pores have gotten bigger it seems in &amp;#34;my old age&amp;#34; 😱 and facials, steaming, expensive make up helps somewhat however, you can&#x27;t always wear makeup or have facials everyday. I heard about Thayers Alcohol-Free Rose Petal WithHazel. Oh my! What an amazing difference when looking at my face in the mirror. This product smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t dry out my delicate face or neck skin, yet my pores...did I mention my invisible pores? My face skin is like being 17 again!</li>
            <li> Feels really refreshing and smells good. my skin looks better after 1 week of use.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this. I ended up putting it in a spray bottle and use it by spritzing it all over my face after cleansing and it feels wonderful! It&#x27;s also a fairly large bottle for the price so I&#x27;m already in love with that aspect. It&#x27;s very refreshing and well worth it if you&#x27;re looking for a new toner. For reference I have oily/combination acne prone skin (also quite sensitive) and this toner works wonders without irritation.</li>
            <li> I use this daily! I love trying new toners and rose petals. Witch Hazel is a fantastic natural toner and smells beautifully too.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 2 days only but I love it already!! It smells heavenly. I used ACV as a toner before and even though it was good for my skin, my husband wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell :). With this Rose Petal Witch Hazel, he grabs a bottle and uses it on his skin!&lt;br /&gt;I used a witch hazel with alcohol before, and let me tell you: what a difference! This one leaves my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m in love! I can&#x27;t wait to try the lavender one.</li>
            <li> I use this most days and I think I might love it. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to tell really but I&#x27;m definitely happy with it. Will update later.</li>
            <li> This priduct almost immediately tightenss pores, evens skin tone, and nourishes skin. I have oily skin that is so sensitive and hard to care for but this product does everything I could ask!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wish for more</li>
            <li> Smells amazing (so much better than the Clinique toner I have been using for a few years) and I feel like it&#x27;s helping my skin. I use it every day either after washing face or periodically throughout the day to clean up and remove oil when I&#x27;m not wearing face makeup. I squirt a little on a cotton pad and it takes like ten seconds. The bottle should last me a really long time.</li>
            <li> Cool and refreshing on the face and it smells really good too.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I STUMBLED ON IT WHILE ON PINTERST ONE NIGHT. I&#x27;LL NEVER USE ANOTHER ASTRINGENT. SMELLS FANTASTIC. DOES NOT DRY MY FACE OUT,  AND CLEANS GREAT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE THE SMELL OF ROSES!!!</li>
            <li> I saw incredible ratings about this product so I decided to try it as a new toner.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure it is a great product but I have terribly acne prone skin and this product broke me out quite terrible. :(&lt;br /&gt;I guess I&#x27;ll stick with tea tree products</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well for homemade bug repellent.</li>
            <li> I love the toner. It smells so good and it&#x27;s helping my skin. I use to use a different toner that would dry out my skin really bad. Thayers Alcohol-free toner is by far the best. It leaves my skin fresh, clean, moisturized. Thank you I love it....</li>
            <li> Good quality &amp; nice product.</li>
            <li> Takes off loads of dirt and makeup without drying and feels good to use</li>
            <li> Leaves your face feeling fresh. The smell is light and dainty and feminine. Love this product!</li>
            <li> It smells nice but really doesn&#x27;t seem to have any benefits.  I won&#x27;t buy it again. I don&#x27;t hate it I just don&#x27;t see any reason to use it, since it improves nothing.</li>
            <li> This toner feels great on the skin and smells so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this toner when I need a gentle product, such as post acid peel, post waxing or sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyday use, I use La Roche Posey Effaclar toner. That is formulated for oily, acne prone skin. The ingredients are fabulous for my every day routine, but not when my skin is sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, and I wish they sold it in drugstores. All the &amp;#34;witch hazel&amp;#34; I&#x27;ve bought in the past has been mostly rubbing alcohol (incredibly harsh and drying) but this is the real thing! I use it as a facial toner twice a day and it makes my skin look wonderful.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face multiple times a day as a quick refreshing cleanser and it is wonderful! I also use it on my legs and underarms after shaving and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps with ingrown hairs and irritation. Because it is alcohol-free, it doesn&#x27;t have any burning sensation, which is great! It smells like roses in an odd way - I quite like the smell, but even if you don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s not overwhelming and it doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> I have using this for a few days now, and I think I already see a little difference, my skin feels softer and has a healthy glow to it. Hope it continues to do the same, would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for about a week but is very gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!! It works better for me then any cream. In winter just put a rose oil or other over it for extra skin hydration.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for inexpensive, effective, natural products to use on my face, as skincare products can sometimes be outrageous with their prices and claims.  I found this toner about a year ago and was drawn to it because it&#x27;s alcohol free.  I love the way it makes my skin look, and I always get compliments on my skin.  People think I look about 8 to 10 years younger than I am.  The only thing I use on my face is st. ives soap, this toner every morning, and a face sunscreen.  I do not use moisturizer, foundation, or powder in the morning, mainly because I think it clogs and enlarges my pores and makes me break out more.  I live in a very humid climate and have combination skin that gets very oily in the t-zone.  Since I have been using this, my skin is a lot calmer and doesn&#x27;t get as oily.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the few complaints about the smell, I think that they are a little silly.  I personally do not think it smells that bad, and the odor really goes away once it leaves the bottle, there is no linger.  The toner I use is defiantly not the strongest scent coming from me on a day to day basis, but everyone&#x27;s body reacts different to stuff so their claims could be valid.</li>
            <li> I did a bunch of research on facial cleaning products, bought a bunch of stuff, and this ended up being the best. I will do face wash and toner only sometimes. It makes my skin not look dried out, because it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol as one of the ingredients. I have dark brown skin, and this stuff was my best skin purchase in months.</li>
            <li> I used to break out from razor burn and then I read forums for safety razor shaving. I already had the smoothest, closest shave in my life, but I still broke out every once in a while. The forum stated that witch hazel helped with conditioning the skin after shaving and then to put a little aftershave for a finishing touch. I now shave both my head and my face, then rinse with cold water to close the pores, slap on a little witch hazel, and finish off with a little aftershave. My skin stays smooth and blemish free.</li>
            <li> I am amazed once again but how effective natural products can be for the skin. I have been using this product for a week and I am definitely loving in. My skin looks clearer, smoother, and less oily. And with the amount inside the bottle, it will last a good few months. Can&#x27;t beat the cost either.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner ever.  I have very dry and sensitive skin.  This one works on me. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few days now and have noticed that my red bumps on my chin has gone down. My skin is starting to look smooth and clear. I&#x27;m extremely pleased so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their customer service is really good as well. I contacted them because I didn&#x27;t receive this within the estimated time frame. They responded right away and I received it in the mail the very next day!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rose smell does the work for &#x27;rose toner&#x27; but the result i got.. wasn&#x27;t as what i expected. i bought this product because one of my friend is using it. she uses it well and recommended to me. since we both have sensitive skin and so i thought this should be good for me... yet who knows each individual is still different. my face started to have break-out and i patiently use it for about 6 months.. nothing gets better. not even toning feel. and the cap is so loose that whenever i accidentally flip over, it spilt all the time. now i just keep it aside and using Neutrogena from drug store. it&#x27;s cheap and so i think you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry during the winter time, but this toner is very soft and moisture.  Fit for my skin</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is refreshing and has helped my pores and facial scaring tramendously. It leaves my face with a beautiful glow. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> Very good and gentle, it is exactly what it says on the bottle. No alcohol. Has a faint rose scent, which i love. Good quantitiy- i use it everyday - morning and night; and it lasts 2 months. It actually does make your skin smoother and softer. I did not have any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;I can however understand that it might still be a bit too strong for sensitive skin - i tried it on my husband and he felt that it stings.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is gentle and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural face cleaner. My face feels clean and refreshed with absolutely no drying or tight feeling after. This is has been added to my new more natural skin care regime.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised on how it made my skin feel and it seem to make the acne and other imperfections disappear.  Great product and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! It has a very pleasant smell and it is very refreshing. I use it in the morning and before bed. It&#x27;s great before putting on makeup and as a toner before bed. My skin has cleared up a lot blemish wise. I will definitely be buying more of this product in the future!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I used to have horrible skin like a teenager.  I have been using this for a few years now and  love it.  I put it in a little spray bottle and I spray my face evry day after my shower before make up.  My hubby also uses this after shaving.</li>
            <li> Great product! Refreshing and gentle on skin. Using with acne medication and it&#x27;s helping skin heal. Love it and will continue using.</li>
            <li> Fixed my skin oh so well!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;Minimized my pores and made my trouble areas clear!&lt;br /&gt;It first may make the skin appear red and sticky, but it completely goes away after a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;The rose smell is a great bonus to the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. I am very pleased with it</li>
            <li> Never knew how important toner was until this acne-prone girl started using this stuff and realized that it&#x27;s MAGIC!  Not drying - just ... MAGIC. :)</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews on how this product could either work really well for you, or make you break out like crazy. I gave it to my boyfriend who has mild breakouts here and there and it really helped for him. Every time he uses it his skin is glowing. I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product a few days but I really like it so far. It had a nice smell and a light tingle but is not drying.</li>
            <li> I love how gentle this feels on my face. It is so soothing and moisturizing, and it keeps my skin soft in the harsh winter months. I apply it before I put on my moisturizer and let it sit and tingle for a little bit on my face. It isn&#x27;t the harsh cool tingle that you get from those terrible acne soaps; it&#x27;s gentle like little bubbles popping against your face. Love it! Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> Smells and works great :) gentle</li>
            <li> Best toner ever! I really dislike harsh chemical toners, so when I found this stuff... I fell in love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product twice daily for about a week now and my skin already feels softer. I have very sensitive skin and it has not caused any redness or burning. The large pores on my cheeks appear smaller as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent product that is gentle on skin and smells like roses. The package arrived on time and I had no issues with product leakage or breakage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel for years but not alcohol free. I wish I knew about this product long ago! I really like it and it smells great. Sometimes, I will use it with apple cider vinegar as an astringent for my face and to clean off deodorant residue (armpits). My face feels great after I use it; not tight. It is great to use as a refresher; especially since I have oily skin. Unfortunately, I also have adult acne. It helps reduce the inflammation of the bumps. I also use it after I wash off my facial mask. Facial masks usually leave some sort of residue, so it is great to remove the traces without being harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I usually purchase at a local organic grocery store, and I see no difference between those bottles and this one I ordered. It came just as expected. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using plain rose water for a few years but decided to try this one when I read about the decrease in pore size. I love it!!! I try to use twice a day and after a week can already tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells and makes my skin feel!</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite facial toner.  It&#x27;s mild and gentle, and has no alcohol.  It&#x27;s very economical also.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite witch hazel of all time....love. Very devoted, have been using on my face and the faces of my babes for years. As far as the seller goes-good transaction; good price would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love that this is alcohol-free: very soothing.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove any makeup traces after washing my face. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smells great too. The rose scent is noticeable but subtle.</li>
            <li> There seems to be 2 versions of this product.  Sans alcohol or with alcohol.  The alcohol free version is the one with better reviews.  Both bottles seem identical so make sure you read which product you are getting.  I got the alcohol free version and it is by far one of the best toners I have used.  It&#x27;s gentle, does the job and smells like a bed of fresh roses.  This is a must ingredient in any female medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect toner, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve found. I love that this is alcohol free. It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s great for anytime use.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful, soothing, hard to find product. I had purchased an aloe/witch hazel product years ago and hadn&#x27;t been able to find one again. I was thrilled to find Thayer&#x27;s. A well made, useful product.</li>
            <li> My cousin recommended this toner, and I bought it despite me not even needing it really, but I felt I didn&#x27;t have much to lose since my acne was getting out of control. It feels absolutely refreshing and I love the rosey smell. I would certainly buy again. I&#x27;ll have to update if it helps my acne but since using it, my acne hasn&#x27;t flared up.</li>
            <li> LOVE this toner!! The scent is AMAZING, it is refreshing and has helped my skin texture and tone. This is definitely my holy grail of toners!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy that gets some acne on my face and I decided to use this for after I wash and use a scrub on my face. It seems to keep my face from getting dry like it normally gets. My skin also doesn&#x27;t look super oily either.</li>
            <li> I will diffidently buy this item again-! It hydrated my combination face without leaving it oily. I have been looking for something natural to accompany my soaps that I hand make and I have found it...!!! I also really like the smell, so refreshing..!!!</li>
            <li> Always a great product</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff! I tried it on a whim and I&#x27;m SO GLAD that I did! Will use this from now on to take off my makeup and also as a toner after washing my face.....can&#x27;t wait to try the lemon kind!</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin at all. Soothes my skin and has a pleasant scent too!</li>
            <li> Best toner I have found. It is very gentle and it makes my skin clean and soft. The first time I used it, I was taken back because I was used to the types of toner that would make my skin tingle. The tingle, however, tends to dry a lot of people&#x27;s skin out and that was exactly what was happening with mine. This will not dry your skin and leaves it feeling fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pleasent but strong. It does not linger though, so not to worry if you are like me and crazy senstive to scents. There is another version of Thayer&#x27;s that does not have scent in it but I haven&#x27;t used it in a few years. I think the rose water in this is gentle and softens your skin more then that one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it at night after doing OCM followed by the asian skin care method and before my lotions. It&#x27;s part of my nightly routine that has cleared up my skin and makes me look younger.</li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves face feeling clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I use it as a toner after washing my face. Only used it for three days and already my skin is clearing up! It is way less red than usual too. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> It smells like a rose! So lovely. I guess I am going to buy this one again after using mine.</li>
            <li> Love the rose water. A little pricy but worth it.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> This product was everything I expected, and leaves the skin feeling soft. I appreciate the subtle, natural rose fragrance. While I prefer no fragrance, this has a subtle fragrance I can handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the clear bottle Witch Hazel from Thayer&#x27;s. The smell made feel nauseous and like I needed to throw up. I don&#x27;t even have that strong of a gag reflex. I don&#x27;t use this, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rose Petal one has much better smell. I think that it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s more dilute (contains less witch hazel) than the clear bottle and the strong rose smell masks the actual scent of witch hazel. The scent, while not horrendous, is probably not something that sensitive noses will want to put up with. It is STRONG. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t smell like actual, fresh roses. If anything, it smells like rose perfume for old ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel not a miracle cure all for acne or oiliness! It won&#x27;t make all your zits just magically disappear. Personally, though, it DOES noticeably reduce the amount of oil around my T-zone area, which never hurts when dealing with acne. It also seems to make my skin smoother. I haven&#x27;t stopped using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO: Reasonable price. Visible results.&lt;br /&gt;CON: the &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; smell</li>
            <li> I love rose petal witch hazel for my face... this bottle I purchased for my soap making and bath bombs... great product and great price.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it&#x27;s just makes my face looks so fresh and nice...it&#x27;s a got to have!</li>
            <li> I mist this on after washing my face or shower, and my skin seems to thank me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Transfer it into a small spray bottle you can buy at any drugstore, and mist your face every time you need a pick-me-up.</li>
            <li> I got the toner yesterday, put it on last night.  In the morning when I looked into the mirror my pores were refined and the black heads were nearly gone.  Not only does it work really well, but it also doesn&#x27;t burn your skin, like other toners I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell a little funny; my boyfriend says I smell like &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; (whatever that means).  It doesn&#x27;t matter, because it closed and cleaned my big ugly pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never felt so good about a product before.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Oh. My. Best stuff ever. Worth the extra few bucks than regular witch hazel. My face thanks Thayers and so do the boys (and girls!) :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty good but I like Mario Bedescu&#x27;s cucumber toner better. It&#x27;s good value for the price but I feel like there are other more effective ones out there.</li>
            <li> Loving this witch hazel. I find myself using several times a day just so refreshing- and my skin is seeing the benefits. In the hot weather I even put some in the fridge and mist my face periodically. I bought initially to use after epilation and waxing to prevent bumps or breakouts- and it has absolutely worked fabulously for that as well!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, as I have very sensitive skin but haven&#x27;t had any problem with this! I some time soak cotton pad with and leave it on my skin for a couple mins. Feels very soft and fresh afterwards.</li>
            <li> Loved is so much that I have shared it with my two teenagers.  They love it as well.  Really shrinks pores and leaves skin with even tone.  I doubt I will ever buy anything else.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet but the bottle came in good condition exactly as described.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel toner whenever I run out of my regular Loreal Hydra fresh toner. It smells really good and skin feel fresh after usage. Purchased two bottles just in case I run out of my regular toner.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried this.  I read a lot of the reviews before I decided to go with this as a toner.  I don&#x27;t use a cotton ball to apply it.  I have it in a spray bottle and spray it all over my face and neck.  I really like the smell of this toner.  It is a pleasant smell and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I love old apothecary brands, and Thayers is no exception! The rose smell is a little overpowering at first, but dries to a nice cclean rosy scent. Definitely a perk that it is alcohol-free, and works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I have tried this toner for more than 6 months now and do not feel like it has done much for me. It is refreshing and cleansing but it did not clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this product, I was drawn to the all natural ingredients and lack of alcohol. While I love the smell of roses it may be overpowering for some since it almost is for me. But the product has allowed me to have a clean refreshed feeling face without the skin drying effects of many facial products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toner for years and it is absolutely my favorite. I have sensitive skin and sometimes have breakouts. It is so calming and soothing for the skin.  This has no alcohol, which is terrible for the skin and unnecessarily dries it out. This is fantastic for all skin types and conditions.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and is exactly what they put in those expensive &amp;#34;rejuvenating&amp;#34; sprays; I ordered a small glass spray bottle and pretty happy with the cost-savings.</li>
            <li> Super mild toner with a lovely scent. I think it does the job although im not too sure about it cause im so use to the other alcohol type of toners which are stronger and leave your face squeaky clean. But I&#x27;m definitely happy with this one purely because I enjoy the smell and the soft feel of it so much.</li>
            <li> I think this toner is actually turning back the hands of time!  I love it and wish I started using it years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought this product mainly to use as a toner.  I read that rose petals and witch hazel are great products for the skin.  Well, after a couple of weeks use, I did not see any changes in my skin.  I used the entire bottle and still I did not notice a difference.  It smells good but perhaps my expectations were too high.  I will not purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Use everyday twice a day after washing.  At night I use OCM with castor oil and hemp seed oil. In the morning i use my clarisonic with the gel cleanser. I have very acne prone skin and this has helped immensely. Keeps my skin supple and smooth. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me and I put up with it for what it does to my skin. I have pores on the larger side and using this twice a day has REALLY helped and I&#x27;ve tried tons of things. This is now a staple in my skin care, I use it every time after I wash my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on a business trip and left this at home and freaked out, luckily GNC and Whole Foods sell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO if you get waxed and have any redness or irritation, this will cure it VERY quickly! after one use you can see the redness start to go away. After a couple of uses, the irritation is gone. Such a great product!</li>
            <li> this is the first &#x27;natural&#x27; toner that I have tried and I&#x27;ll never look back. It&#x27;s very refreshing on my face unlike the alcohol toners that I used before and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It has a nice aroma and really cleans deep. I use everyday. This is great to put some in a spray bottle and use just before moisturizer and make-up.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  Everything witch hazel should be, plus lovely smell!  Would recommend to anyone. Helped my acne, and dry skin?  hard to find products like that!</li>
            <li> Not much else to say other than the fact that it&#x27;s the same price as more expensive products available at the mall.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic, keeps my skin looking flawless.</li>
            <li> AMAZING for after shaving in any area of the body. I loved this and will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my face and I like the smell. It arrived so fast and in perfect condition</li>
            <li> It was cheap, a lot of quantity and quality.  blemishes and razor bumps started to reduce immediately!!!!  I use on my neck and face and anywhere else I get little acne or razor bumps from shaving such as chest. But it is great on my face and neck. No allergic reaction and results fast.</li>
            <li> Natural and it feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> I love this! It goes on great and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing and it has a consistency like water. It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and it just pampers your face! I have very sensitive skin and it gets irritated with almost every product I use, but this toner is so light it&#x27;s like the cherry on top to my face routine.</li>
            <li> I usually get expensive, don&#x27;t need to with this product</li>
            <li> I really like the size of the bottle. It looks likes its gonna last me a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;It smells very light. Tamera Mowry recommended it so I gave it a shot. I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Im still trying it but tell now I found that my face is so soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Toner is an important part of skincare. I use it in a small spray bottle and mist it on my face after cleansing and before moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Fast service, love the product. I use it in my homemade eye makeup remover and it works great! I would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so I cannot tell if it will help with my scalp psoriasis. It really smells nice.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Works as described, leaves a very clean, fresh feel.</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like an older person (one who showers of course). I can&#x27;t complain too much, but i will say this did clog my pores and give me tiny whiteheads...though it freshened my skin and gave me a dewy glow. I don&#x27;t use it anymore, since it hindered my skin more than it improved it. I will say my mother uses it now, and seems to be loving it. More of an adult/elderly formula to keep wrinkles at bay, and send others away.</li>
            <li> I love that all the ingredients are derived from plants. I have only been using for a week and my skin does look more radiant. It also smells wonderful. I am going to order the aftershave for my husband.</li>
            <li> I am probably converted and will be using this as my go-to toner moving forward because 1) it&#x27;s natural and 2) it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I do love it and it picks up dirt well with a cotton round. However, because it&#x27;s alcohol-free, it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on your face. I just end up waiting a while for it to dry off before applying moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love the smell,and it feels so nuture and clean when I use it</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it leaves my skin feeling</li>
            <li> I had received a recommendation for this product and purchased in on Amazon.  I love the way this product feels.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out (since there is no alcohol), and does a great job of getting the remnants of makeup off after I wash my face at nice.  And it makes my face smell like roses.</li>
            <li> love this toner it works amazing on my skin!</li>
            <li> Just started using it! Smells so good!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it. I think it is a good toner and removes your makeup residue.But it irritates my skin a little bit.</li>
            <li> Gentle, clean-smelling. Soothes my skin after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, makes me skin feel really soft and helps to diminish the little acne bumps on my forehead. Other types of acne, it doesn&#x27;t help at all. The scent smells like an older woman&#x27;s perfume, so if you are sensitive to smell, this might be too over powering or bothersome. But I feel its worth it.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s favorite toner! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  So much nicer for a toner than the toners in the drugstore.  I will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product and smells really good. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month now and I really think it&#x27;s helped my skin become less red and more even in tone. I use a mild cream cleanser daily, an exfoliating treatment every week or so, and a clay mask treatment every week, but I always make sure to follow each one up with Thayers. It tingles just slightly after I apply it and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> There are sooooo many uses for this stuff! I have crazy sensitive skin that breaks out if you even look at it wrong, so this stuff is AMAZING! They recommend using it as a toner, but that of course made me break out lol! So I put it in a spray bottle, and use it to &amp;#34;refresh&amp;#34; my face during the day! It&#x27;s heavenly! After I&#x27;m done doing my makeup I find the makeup settles into my awesome wrinkles 😖 so I now spray this on top of my makeup and it eliminates that! My kids even live using it, esp during winter months when it&#x27;s dry and I can never get them (boys) to use lotion!</li>
            <li> This is amazing  use it for anything from acne to foot soaks so universal! Has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am 74 and have used many different toners all of my life. This is the best and smells and feels very nice.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much st first I just brought it to tone but it really does moisturize too! I feel so refresh after I put it on fast drying and leaves s soft clean feeling on your face. My skin glows and is clear so I smile just a bit more.</li>
            <li> I love this toner, the smell is very pleasant and it leaves my skin hydrated, sometimes I don&#x27;t even have to apply moisturizer after using this since it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I have very sensitive skin, and suffer from mild acne that has left scars on my face. I wanted to give this toner a month&#x27;s use to verify if it would do my skin any good, and honestly it was worth it. Breakouts have been diminished for sure, and I noticed my scars are healing better and my overall tone is evening out. I have noticed a difference in pore size but not substantially. Great skincare product, will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it after I take my makeup off to get any reside that might still be on my skin, or I use it when I don&#x27;t wash my face at night (days when I don&#x27;t wear makeup). It&#x27;s refreshing and makes me face feel clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing. Keeps my face clean and oil free without drying my skin. The rose gives it a very nice scent too. And you can&#x27;t beat the price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for two years now, and my skin has been the better for it. It keeps my rosacea under control, and has done the impossible, cleaned out my blackhead problem. With the help of cotton pads with those little scrubbers on one side, I&#x27;ve pretty much gotten rid of my blackheads that have plagued me since high school. So it only took me 20 years to get on that. Well, 18 since I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 years.... anyways!! Final thoughts are I have sensitive combination skin prone to rosacea and blackheads, and I wish I had known about this product, well, in high school. Also, your face smells like roses for a min, sooooo, who can argue with that?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks, twice a day, and my skin is brighter, clearer, and healthier in look and feel than it&#x27;s ever been. I am a big skeptic - but this stuff won me over, completely. I actually look forward to using it, because it balances out my combination skin, it smells great (some people say \\&quot;too old lady\\&quot;, but I&#x27;m 29 and think it smells amazing), and it&#x27;s refreshing. I rarely have to use moisturizer when using the toner twice a day. It cleared up what little acne I had, and it helps de-puff the bags under my eyes in the morning. I changed NOTHING else in my skincare routine, just added this toner twice daily, and my skin is better than ever. I sound like a bad commercial, but it&#x27;s true. Haha :) It&#x27;s an all-around wonderful product and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Does not dry skin. Leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It also takes off any facial makeup that my remover leaves behind. Smells great, and I&#x27;ll for SURE be purchasing this again when I when I run out! Lasts forever though!! Just apply with a cotton ball for best results. :)</li>
            <li> love the smell!  it really masks the generally icky smell of witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is doing anything for my skin yet, but at least it smells wonderful (and isn&#x27;t doing anything bad!).</li>
            <li> Smells nice at first I couldn&#x27;t tell if this did anything for my skin but then went on vacation and didn&#x27;t use it for two weeks. This was when I realized it makes my pores smaller and then they went back to bigger without it. I use it every day now under all other products.</li>
            <li> Excellent.smells wonderful</li>
            <li> LOVE this product - a great natural way to remove make-up!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Theresa Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel makes my skin feel so clean and soft.  I use my Mia2 to clean my face then I follow it up with the Thayers, then before my face is completely dry, I use a high-quality moisturizer.  I love the soft scent of the Thayers and the reasonable price.  This is my second bottle and I plan to continue using it.  The seller is great and the delivery was speedy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few years as a toner and on bug bites. It smells really nice, and is a very gentle astringent.</li>
            <li> Feels very good on face; nice scent; does not dry skin.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it because of no difference. I think I developed a pimple using this because of its oily texture.</li>
            <li> No harsh chemical and has a great smell. You don&#x27;t feel the burn but feel cleansed and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells lovely!</li>
            <li> Moisturizing, reliable, and somewhat effective. A very good go-to toner.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE and so addicted.</li>
            <li> You really have to love the scent of rose in order to love this. It has seemed to calm my skin and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with it, but I&#x27;m always thrown off by how powerful the scent is.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say anything special about this toner, it does it&#x27;s job but I was expecting much more after reading the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I feel it mild, but it never disturbed my sensitive skin so far.&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a solvent for making cosmetic lotion myself, which works fine.  I will repeat buying.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is the most impacting of the various characteristics of this product. This toner moisturizes my skin for hours at a time, keeping me from being shiny, with very little greasy aftermath. All-in-all a good product.</li>
            <li> I love what witch hazel can do, and it&#x27;s great for keeping makeup out of your pores, but I&#x27;ve only ever used it for heavy stage makeup because of the lingering smell. Even when it dried, and makeup was over it--the smell was too strong! Heaven forbid someone else get close enough to my face to smell the witch hazel on me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until now, of course. This stuff is great! It&#x27;s got everything you want from witch hazel, and the smell isn&#x27;t a strong, strange one. And even though the rose-water/witch hazel scent is pleasant, it doesn&#x27;t linger on your skin. I put it on under my daily moisturizer, because my combination skin can get pretty dry in winter, but it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and is actually very refreshing to add to my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle was larger than I pictured in my head, so I believe this will last me quite a while. But when I run out I will happily be buying this witch hazel again, and I&#x27;ll be recommending it to my mother and girlfriends in the meantime.</li>
            <li> While I was excited to use this product, my skin does not like it. Having used it for 3 weeks, I have stopped as pimples have been appearing on my face more and more as I use the product, and my skin is much more oily than it has ever been before. It may work  well for others but only did harm for me.</li>
            <li> It is very smooth and not strong. I like it. After i had severe troubles due to new cosmetic, i had to stop make up and should put only toners. This is my choice and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This toner is amazing! It smells like a beautiful soft rose and makes my skin feel healthy and moisterized. The reviews definitely don&#x27;t lie. I&#x27;ve never had a toner this good. It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny and you can use it as much as you want throughout the day.</li>
            <li> After I shower and remove all my makeup from the day I put some of this on a cotton ball and gently apply it to my skin. It feels nice so far. Doesn&#x27;t sting or burn. Doesn&#x27;t get oily either. Has a light pleasant fragrance. Tones and improves skin over time I suppose. So far so good!</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  It&#x27;s gentle and effective.  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I had pregnancy acne very bad and it all cleared up in a month. Ordering more right now</li>
            <li> love this. great for toning with no drying alcohol.</li>
            <li> im in my way to have the second bottle ,this toner is awesome for your face &amp; neck each of you girls should have it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am now addicted to this stuff! It makes my skin look and feel fabulous. I love the scent too.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and really makes me feel like my face is cleaner. When I use it regularly I notice my skin looking smoother and my giant pores looking more subtle. I really like this toner and wish I could just force myself to stop slipping from my skin routine because it really makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for all skin and especially skin sensitive to alcohol.  My husband even uses it now to reduce razor burn and help prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 2x daily along with black soap for just one week, and my bumps have reduced dramatically in size and prevalence. Ever since puberty hit me, I&#x27;ve had an issue with small, hard bumps that have plagued my forehead, temples, and even my cheeks. The bumps never amounted to pimples (but I still DID get pimples), and it was highly noticeable, especially if the light hit me just right. It has always been embarrassing, especially since other people have actually asked me about the bumps. &amp;#34;Do you have sun poisoning or something?&amp;#34; So yeah, I&#x27;m super self-conscious about it. I&#x27;ve tried so many different facial products - scrubs, masks, different face washes, astringents, toners, and so on - and none of that other stuff helped with the bumps. I eat healthy and drink water like I should, but it didn&#x27;t help. With Thayers Witch Hazel, I feel like I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works for me, and the difference is noticeable even though I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second-best thing about this product is how my face hasn&#x27;t dried out at all. I have the type of skin that can get oily, but my skin still flaked, especially on my nose and forehead. My face has NOT been flaky at all after I started using this product. My skin is very smooth, and I find myself rubbing my face with my hands to feel the smoothness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely sticking with this product. I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple develop since I started it, the bumps are shrinking and vanishing, and I feel like I&#x27;m actually taking care of the skin that I have. Everyone always talks about scrubs and exfoliation, but I feel like the RIGHT way to go is to nourish the skin, and this product does exactly that. The icing on the cake is that it&#x27;s natural. I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up from me, for sure. This product actually makes me feel relieved - the bumps are one less thing to worry about.</li>
            <li> It really did not work anything for me.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my dry skin could not benefit from it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it has a great flower smell.</li>
            <li> Just as described A++++++</li>
            <li> This doesnt smell like old lady! It makes my skin feel so soft and is going well with my new acne regimen! My face has never felt better :)</li>
            <li> I remember a few years ago, I tried a Witch Hazel toner from the local grocery store, and the smell was just so off-putting that I couldn&#x27;t use it. THIS, however, smells AMAZING... and it works so well. It retains the cleansing &amp; purifying properties that Witch Hazel is so known for, but it adds light-weight moisture to the skin and leaves it feeling clean, smooth &amp; silky. And the scent alone is so pleasant, I keep wanting to use this several times a day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Never using a toner again, this makes your skin feel very smooth and refreshed. Gets the job done without drying out your skin</li>
            <li> I have true combination skin accompanied by clogged pores.  This toner is wonderful because it keeps my skin from flaring up.  It does not contain alcohol so it is very gentle, however, it do feel that it clears my skin.  I ran out and forgot to order, and after a week I could see my skin was suffering.  I even got my boyfriend, who refuses to use anything on his skin, to use it because it finally calmed his stress pimples!</li>
            <li> smells a little good.......other than that, this does nothing for me.  i might as well rub water on my face.  it doesn&#x27;t do anything.  i see no difference in my face.</li>
            <li> So far, It&#x27;s pretty good. Mind to my skin. Great toner. But I don&#x27;t like the smell. The smell feels artificial and old.</li>
            <li> It takes away the creases everytime I rub this on my face</li>
            <li> Feedback from my wife:  Heard for years of people using witch hazel for a toner.  After going through a bottle of an expensive name-brand toner much faster than I would have liked, I thought I&#x27;d try it.  SAME great outcome without all of the additives and at one sixth the cost!  It is now a staple!</li>
            <li> Witch Hazel used to be an older time skin cleanser.  And it still is.  It makes my skin tingle.  I doesn&#x27;t make my skin dry. And it readies my facial skin for nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Love witch hazel and with the added rose petal and aloe, has made this a staple in beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my face with the hopes that it would help with the glow effect so face would not appear dull; however I used it for my face after washing and didn&#x27;t notice any type of glow or anything special. Will not use it for toner again, maybe just for steam treatmeant to open pores for other product penetration.</li>
            <li> This is not a good replacement for the rose water toner issued to student of modeling schools. It is very strong and burns young tender faces.</li>
            <li> Love this toner . I spray my skin 3 or 4 times per day,my skin looks very smooth  refresh  and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;I get so many complements , I don&#x27;t use any make up and my skin it just glow .</li>
            <li> My wife ordered it. she didn&#x27;t complain, so I guess it is good. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love the rose scent not too strong. It feels great on my skin. I can read and understand the ingredients. The only downside is the plastic container. Personally I don&#x27;t like plastics so I&#x27;m using brown glass bottle.  You can&#x27;t beat the price, better than the Burt&#x27;s bee toner which costs more for smaller quantity.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff, it&#x27;s amazing to clean your face and moisturize it at the same time. This and the astringent helped me get rid of ALL my acne. Bought half a dozen of these already.</li>
            <li> This is essential to my skin care routine. I love that it cleans my face with no harshness whatsoever. This is always in stock at my house. I&#x27;ve even got my husband using Thayers.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and really gets anything that&#x27;s left behind after I wash my face. Went on vacation recently and neglected to take some with me. It was sorely missed. Will definitely be a repeat purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! I have only been using this for a few days and it seems to be helping my acne. My face doesn&#x27;t feel too dry or tight after using this. I like that it is pure and non-toxic. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Love it....using it at night and morning! Face feels so clean!</li>
            <li> This product has become a staple in my everyday routine. I previously used witch hazel but the smell became too much so I looked for an alternative. Adding the rose petal makes this formula smell and work beautifully!</li>
            <li> This has been a lifesaver and I&#x27;m so happy that I found this product! It smells like heaven and really clears up any spots on your face without drying them up with alcohol. I use this after I use my Shea Moisture Black African Soap and these two together are the reason I have clear skin (I&#x27;ve been struggling with slight adult acne). I really love this product and have had it for the past five months and FINALLY have to repurchase! This is a must if you&#x27;re looking for something that&#x27;s great for your skin and doesn&#x27;t have horrible chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to be used along side Dr. Woods Black Soap for my entire family. The smell is absolutely amazing! I have incredibly sensitive skin yet this has no ill affects on my at all, it&#x27;s not drying or harsh. The results of these two products after one week of use for my entire family is amazing and I love having found natural products that work with real results.</li>
            <li> I am very thrilled with this product.  I purchased the Rose Petal one because I heard how great rose oil is for the skin.  Well, turns out that is true because I have noticed less oil on my face.  I will be using this product for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My husband loves the rose scent when I use it. It is not a very lasting scent though. I have incredibly sensitive skin (im bright red and blotchy for an hour after a shower) and this toner does not dry my skin out. I have used it on a spot of eczema/dermatitis above my eye and it seems to help that also.</li>
            <li> I love it..it doesn&#x27;t dry my facial skin.its perfect toner for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many brands of Witch Hazel and this brand is by far the best because it does not dry your skin.  It has rose petals and aloe in it which keeps your skin clean and toned but not dry at all.  AND there&#x27;s no alcohol in it.  I will be using this product from now on!  Packaging was good and arrived on time.  I would highly recommend this to family, friends and to reviewers who read this.</li>
            <li> nice smell - safe for my girls to use &amp; works</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first, mainly because the product looks like a cliche &amp;#34;miracle elixir&amp;#34; from 1875. But frankly this is a great product. I read more reviews talking about it&#x27;s great anti-inflammation abilities and they&#x27;re true. I tend to breakout or have a lot of redness after shaving mainly because I have sensitive facial skin. After one night of application a majority of the irritation was gone. Three days later it&#x27;s completely gone and my skin just feels better. The alcohol free is also a big bonus. Definitely going to buy again.</li>
            <li> I have heard that witch hazel was good for your skin before but always just forgot about it. But one day I was at the store and came across Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel and bought it. After 1 use (not joking) my skin broke out and was completely dry! I was really disappointed and skeptical that this one wouldn&#x27;t work for me either, but let me tell you it&#x27;s amazing! It doesn&#x27;t have alcohol in it so it won&#x27;t dry you out. My skin looks the best it has in a long time and it&#x27;s all thanks to this. It helped with my acne and shrunk my pores and the fine lines on my forehead have disappeared. So glad I took a chance and bought this! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Great product, great service. Would order from them again. Love the Rose scent. Put in a spray bottle for a great refresher throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I love the smell and have noticed my skin does not have as many breakouts (even when PMSing). Will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Dr. Perricone&#x27;s Super Detox Elixir? What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Murad Clarifying Toner?  What&#x27;s the second ingredient in Olek Henriksen Grease Relief Face Tonic?  I could go on and on.....but I&#x27;ll just let you know. It&#x27;s witch hazel, which you can find in your local pharmacy for a few bucks,  is a great astringent. And its one in its purest form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is witch hazel? It is the leaves and bark of the North American shrub known as Hamamelis Virginiana (sometimes you might see this on a label as an ingredient in your favorite toner or astringent instead of the words \\&quot;witch hazel\\&quot;).  Witch hazel naturally grows in Nova Scotia in Canada, and Florida in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Witch hazel can be used for so many things but using it as your daily astringent can not only give you great skin but also a lot of bang for your buck! In addition, witch hazel is an herbal and natural product and thus it is great for sensitive skin. You can apply it after shaving, waxing and any kind of skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason you can find witch hazel in so many skin care products.  It has so many benefits: it reduces excess sweating and oil secretion, helps with large pores, treats acne, and helps with various other skin conditions.  The astringent also has anti-inflammatory properties. If you have ever had a facial, you will notice that usually after extractions, your aesthetician will apply with hazel to your skin. Witch hazel can also help prevent the development of acne as well as treat existing acne and pimples. This is the reason why it is frequently used in acne skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another approach for using witch hazel astringent is treating psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema, diaper rash and poison ivy rash in the natural way. Witch hazel is also one of the best herbal remedies for alleviating sunburns and windburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the best part is that you can pick it up at your local pharmacy for about five bucks!

            <li> I am reviewing this product entirely on how it smells. I had to wash it off my face soon after I applied it, because it gave me a terrible headache. If you are sensitive to perfumes and fragrances you might want to skip this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily. It smells wonderful and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of toners and use them every night to clear away residue from the day before moisturizing. This product is a great option if you&#x27;re not looking for anything fancy. You can find this at drug stores, but the price on Amazon is usually lower.</li>
            <li> Slightly too moisturizing for my oily skin, but definitely is a good toner. It has a very strong rose fragrance, but the vitamin E is slightly too predominant for my liking. The vitamin E smell is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars. Overall, a good toner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does anything to my skin but I love the scent and the sensation of it.&lt;br /&gt;After applying it, my skin feels purified, clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Just like I remember it. Excellent.</li>
            <li> At first the product worked great. Then over time the water started turning cloudy and had a funny smell. Would not repurchase and would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is awesome I love it, haven&#x27;t noticed crazy differences but the red little bumps under my eyes seem to be going away. However I read on ewg that dickinsons version is safer and has less chemicals.</li>
            <li> I started using astringent in 2011. I am a young adult in my early 20&#x27;s and started looking for something that was not going to strip my face dry like rubbing alcohol because my face is started to get dry during the winter months. My folks have used Thayer&#x27;s for years and when I went back home during holiday break I thought I would give it a try since it is good enough for my dad to use. After a couple of week I can totally tell a difference! My skin is clear (based on my diet as well) and not oily. I use this twice a day and it works wonders on my skin. I tried the rose because of the smell but the lemon is better suited for me. Plus the lemon has the Aloe Vera that I like as well.</li>
            <li> This is stuff smells lovely and it makes my skin feel so, so good. I&#x27;ve actually received complements from friends about my facial skin after using it without them knowing that I started wiping my face with it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Does great wonders to my skin! I use it at night time before applying my topical acne treatment. My skin is soft, less oily and pores looks smaller now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have been using it for a few years, that is after I tried pretty much every toner out there.  This one works for my oily, aging skin that is prone to acne.  It has a little bit of a tingle but it feel good.  I am a life time user of this now.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I like it, I use it after I shave my face, the &amp;#34;rose scent&amp;#34; goes on a bit strong, but subsides within a minute.</li>
            <li> This is so refreshing, but toning after I shave!  It is thorough enough to tone, but offers moisture to the beard . and helps to moisturize the face, so my serums go on smoother!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have a sensitive skin. Most toners are too harsh for me and seemed to break me out a lot. Therefore I was very pleased to discover that this was as gentle as claimed. I am able to use this to soothe my skin after a peel with no problems. My skin feels moisturized. I have even used it as a cleanser since it seemed to clean my face and yet maintain the moisture...........&lt;br /&gt;I will surely purchase this product again. Thanks for making it available on time.</li>
            <li> Well, I meant to order the one with cucumber as I love cucumber products on my skin but this turned out to be a great toner as well.  The alcohol free aspect of the product is very important to keep skin from getting too dry.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I like its package</li>
            <li> It smells really good, and it&#x27;s a good toner for the price.  Also, it does not bother my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use toners. Never really saw any benefit from them. I actually purchased this to use in a mister to set my makeup and remove the powdery look. I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with chemicals in it. Saw a recommendation for using rose water and decided that would be perfect. Then I saw this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for setting makeup as well as using to refresh my skin throughout the day using the mister. More often than not, wearing makeup - even supposedly moisturizing makeup - leave my skin feeling tight and uncomfortable. This stuff seems to dig beneath the makeup to relieve that tightness. And it smells so lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite seeing no need for a toner, I have started using this with a cotton pad after cleansing and I&#x27;m liking how it feels and makes my skin look. I deal with some redness on my cheeks, chin, and forehead and this seems to calm all that down. Doesn&#x27;t eliminate the redness entirely but I do notice some difference after using it. I&#x27;ve always preferred to apply moisturizer over damp skin and this works great to leave my skin moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does have a rose scent, but it&#x27;s very light. My mother has a problem with anything rose-scented but if she&#x27;s noticed this on me, she hasn&#x27;t complained about it.</li>
            <li> I would continue to use this for the smell alone.  It&#x27;s become part of my morning routine, and makes my skin feel refreshed and clean.  When traveling or in a hurry I will use this to clean my face real quick, but I mainly utilize it as an extra layer of moisture.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and clean!  Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Lovely light rose scent and so refreshing on your skin! I use this twice a day and have noticed a definite difference in the softness and overall health of my skin. Very happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a refreshing toner for ages and this fits the bill to a tee!  Smells divine and leaves my face utterly refreshed, smooth, and (hopefully) youthful and radiant!  (At this point I&#x27;m convinced I look ten years younger, but it&#x27;s been less than a week so I&#x27;ll refrain from calling this a miracle cure - so far so good though!).</li>
            <li> Fast shipping from seller. Great product. I use this daily and love what it does to even out redness and blemishes and to improve the general appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> One of the best toners. Very gentle, non-drying, and smells great.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with hopes that I would really make my skin feel clean.. I like witch hazel products that &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; out the skin and then I put a moisturizer over and it makes me feel very clean. I should&#x27;ve known because this is alcohol free that it would not do that! It does leave the skin feeling a bit sticky.. Would probably be great if you are very dry! It&#x27;s not offensive and my skin isn&#x27;t picky so I&#x27;ll use the bottle up and hope for better luck next time!</li>
            <li> Very drying even without any alochol. Avoid if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> I love how good this toner smells, and it makes my face feel very refreshed after I use it after I cleanse my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$10 for this was a bit steep for me at first, but when I received it and started using it, I definitely think that it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s much bigger than I thought it would be, and I only use a squeeze or two at one time, so this is going to last me a long time.</li>
            <li> So pleased to find witch hazel without alcohol.  Feels and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Brisk fresh treat for my  skin .Has become my morning routine .  My skin has found its youth once again. Try it !</li>
            <li> Very pleased..Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is a great toner with a nice light scent.  It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.  The toner doesn&#x27;t burn at all, even on open skin.</li>
            <li> It was a present to my sister. She was so glad.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for,Great</li>
            <li> Lovely smell! Highly recommend this witch hazel. The aloe seems to mellow it a bit, which is good. And the smell makes you want to put it in everything!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I break out in a couple of days when I stop using it. Super gentle and moisturizing, as well as being effective.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product. It came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! Makes my skin softer when I use it. The smell is nice too as I love the scent of roses!</li>
            <li> Used it only once so far, but it smells divine! I&#x27;ve been wanting to find an alcohol-free witch hazel oil and this one has a lot of other goodies added too. I&#x27;ll try to update my review in a few weeks with more specs on how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> It gives my face a refreshed feeling.. It&#x27;s like water so you will have to use some the of cotton swab pad or something..it did help s rough patch on my face.. As far as toning don&#x27;t see a difference yet.. Been using for almost a month</li>
            <li> This toner smells very nicely.  I like the old fashion look with the label you can read through the back of the bottle. The cup is closing tight. To open - I just flip the top up and the toner dispenses through a tiny hole, very precise.  I enjoy using it in the evening after the last step of cleansing and before the fist step of moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was fast.</li>
            <li> I like using this as a toner.  Leaves my skin fresh and not dried out.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Leaves your skin feeling soft and clean..</li>
            <li> I just received this product this week and have only used for a couple of days, but I&#x27;m already hooked. I&#x27;ve been using Clinique&#x27;s toner for several years now, but the smell was becoming more harsh and I was nearly choking on the &amp;#34;fumes&amp;#34; each time I used it. Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel popped up after I added a similar product to my cart and I decided to give it a try after reading the raving reviews. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This stuff smells amazing! No strong chemical smell and no choking! I use it morning and night and my skin is much softer after use and my poors do appear smaller. I will never go back to Clinique as long as this product is still available.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, little oily on nose, i am using the third bottle, I don&#x27;t intend to change it. It smells good, feels good, price is good, it is just good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayers, keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years.  I would not change it for the world.  It keeps your skin tones and closes your pores.  Will keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful! Love it!</li>
            <li> Loved the combination with rose water!</li>
            <li> I recently moved to a much drier, hotter climate with very hard water. As a result, my previous skin issues were greatly excacerbated. I have combination skin, and have always struggled with small areas of dry, uneven skin on my forehead and cheeks, and blackheads on my nose and chin, but now I was seeing more blackheads and bigger dry patches, in addition to redness all over my face. After much researching, I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a shot, mainly due to the good price and numerous raving reviews, and the fact that it contains no alcohol and is natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using this product for about 5 days now, but I can tell you that it has definitely earned 5 stars in my book! In such a short period of time it&#x27;s managed to eliminate most of my blackheads AND shrink my pores, something I&#x27;ve been trying to do unsuccessfully for years! It&#x27;s even improved the uneven patches on my cheeks and forehead, and I can see a definite improvement in the redness as well. It has a pleasant smell, and feels pleasant and tingly on my skin when I apply it, which is usually after washing my face twice a day. My face feels so clean afterwards, and it&#x27;s not drying at all. I will continue to use this product and hope I keep seeing such wonderful results!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel as a toner for years. I love using witch hazel but hate the smell! After reading all the rave reviews on Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, I was intrigued to try it! I purchased it at my local Vitamin Shoppe. That night after cleansing my face as usual, I swiped my face with it and immediately started to feel my face getting hot but thought it was a temporary reaction. I came out of the bathroom and my husband said I looked sunburned! After a few more minutes, my face was red, blotchy and hot to the touch. I re-washed my face and tried cooling it with a washcloth. Thankfully, the next morning my face was normal but I went and returned the Rose Petal. Obviously I&#x27;m not allergic to witch hazel but I must be allergic to the rose oil or something. Trial and error - guess I&#x27;m going back to my regular witch hazel (don&#x27;t fix what&#x27;s not broken!)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t really smell and you just slap some on your face after you wash, morning and night.  I put some other creams on my face afterwards...but even this alone moisturizes my face plenty.  Making my 2nd order now!!!</li>
            <li> Leave my skin refresshed and not overly dry</li>
            <li> Excellent product and a reasonable price.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect when I bought this toner. I had been using the Chanel one (blue bottle) that gets rid of ALL dirt and makeup leftover from the day. So I already knew this wasn&#x27;t going to be able to do that for me, since no other toner I&#x27;ve ever used has. But that&#x27;s no big deal, the huge difference in price makes up for that. This is really nice, feels cool going on, especially if you keep it in the fridge. It doesn&#x27;t get dirt off like my Chanel, but I do see a little bit of skin and some dirt and since I hardly wear any makeup if at all, that works for me. What bothers me most is probably the smell! Oh man, this smells very much like &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t mean to diss all you fabulous 60+ ladies, but this does have that typical smell that one would describe &amp;#34;old lady&amp;#34; mainly because it smells SO much like roses. My boyfriend mentioned it after I had it on my face, so use it sparingly. Lately, I&#x27;ve been mixing my own toner using this and Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar and some distilled water. The rose water masks the smell of apple cider vinegar and it seems to be improving my skin. I notice smaller pores, more even skintone and my face just feels and looks soft!</li>
            <li> Like most other reviewers, I love this product.  This toner does not prevent or clear up acne; however it does tighten and hydrate skin after cleansing.  It is gentle enough to use on your eyelids and seems to help with fine lines and wrinkles.  It smells good to boot.</li>
            <li> Tis toner is just awesome for acne problem skin! I love it and this brand is all I use ! Love this product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Great results for aging, sun-damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after every face wash.&lt;br /&gt;I no longer have dry or overly-oily spots on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> My husband does like the smell but I do.  Very nice and refreshing.  Leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this toner, it smells real good. My skin feels smooth and supple. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and hate using toner with alcohol in it. So I have been trying this out and must say it has a soft sweet scent, leaves my skin feeling soft, clean and I have not had an issue with my skin drying out or getting flaky. So far I am happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> gives a nice clean feeling without feeling as it is adding anything extra to your skin, just cleanliness. I have acne prone skin and this seems to help as my skin doesn&#x27;t break out with this product as it does with many others</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for myself. I was looking for a natural moisturizer- I am very sensitive to many chemicals that are so prevalent in many of today&#x27;s products. It has a soft rose scent and it keeps your skin soft and supple. Definitely a keeper!!&lt;br /&gt;In addition to this, I found that it also worked really well on my son&#x27;s weeping eczema. The aloe vera in the solution keeps the skin from becoming too dry while the witch hazel helps dry up the weeping parts. This has been an absolutely excellent product and has really been instrumental in helping my son&#x27;s eczema begin to heal.&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Great product...works very well!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s the rose scent, maybe it is the fancy old time label. I don&#x27;t know. All I know is that I wish this stuff came in a gallon sized jug. It smells amazing, and it is refreshing and moisturizing. Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> As others have stated, this product is very refreshing and smells great. I use it several times a day with no problems with over-drying.It is, by far, the best toner that I have used. After reading so many of the positive reviews here I was anxious to try this product and I am happy to say that it lived up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Love this product -- use it every morning to refresh my face! It&#x27;s wonderful for a toner before moisturizer! Love it!</li>
            <li> I just love this product so much. Use it every day as part of my skin care regime. Will buy again from this vendor, for sure. Quick delivery! Happy customer. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. Great smell and very refreshing for the skin. I keep it in the fridge which makes it even more soothing.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I find it to be the best toner available at a reasonable price. A little bit goes a long way and I began using this product based off of the reviews. Give this a shot, it is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I love Thayers! I use this in my homemade facial wipes and the scent is lovely. Wonderful product, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very pleasant and mild scented toner, and I think it works well on my oily skin.  Very large bottle, too, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing and it smells good. its really worth it!!</li>
            <li> I used to use Burt&#x27;s bee Tomato garden toner, which is also a good toner. However, Burt&#x27;s bee toner made my skin a little irritated if i used it right after facial exfoliation or waxing. Thayers toner is way soothing and does not irritate my skin. So i have a reason this toner is really organic with no chemical added.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the best toner i&#x27;ve used so far. I also recommended some friends to switch to this toner and they all love it.</li>
            <li> New Holy Grail product added to my skincare regimen!</li>
            <li> I used this after I washed my face every morning and every night but I did not see a difference in my face complexion or textuer.</li>
            <li> love it , make my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Love this product. Especially that I can add it on to an order and save a trip to try to locate it in a drugstore! This has done wonders for my skin in my 30&#x27;s and doesn&#x27;t leave a harsh smell, harsh drying sensation and mess-free!</li>
            <li> I was looking to clean up my skin care regimen and am so happy to have found this product. I use it morning and night. I adore the clean and fresh rose scent. I love the packaging. And I love how my skin looks and feels. I will absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I believe I got a rash from this item. Perhaps I am allergic to Witch Hazel. If you try this, I suggest only trying in a small area at first as a control and compare to similar other area to see how it works. Let me know if you do test and get any kind of reaction and/or if you are allergic to Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff! It&#x27;s also very soothing on my skin and it feels refreshing after applying it. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out too much either. My skin actually glows now and has a more refreshed look. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every morning to clean my face. I love it&#x27;s gentleness and rose pedal smell. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I&#x27;ve been using for 3 years</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!!! Even my husband loves using it!!!</li>
            <li> So far I love this Witch Hazel, its not like all the other that dry you out.  This leave me with a glow after I use it.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this. Leaves my skin feeling so clean and the smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot! it has light smell that lasts for an hour. it nourishes the skin</li>
            <li> I love it. It leave my skin moist and soft. My face is not dry.</li>
            <li> It is really good! Super fast delivery :) I want to buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product! Good price. Efficient shipping 😎</li>
            <li> Smells great and does a nice job as a toner.  Really like it.</li>
            <li> refreshing. rosy. love to mix it with some heavier creams for a lotion on a hotter day.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a week, very happy with the product</li>
            <li> I love this product! It cleans my skin, it smells great, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin! If I have a problem with acne, Thayers Witch Hazel clears it quickly! I have added it as a permanent​ part of my skin care routine!</li>
            <li> shipping was without problem...my son uses this on his face for acne and seems to be helping</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time tonight and this stuff smells amazing! Smells just like roses...not overpowering. I washed my face and sprayed on while my face was still damp. (Put in spray bottle  and it&#x27;s sitting on my bathroom sink). My face feels refreshed and I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update after using this product. I&#x27;m excited that I can use witch hazel without the alcohol!</li>
            <li> Has the best smell, leaves your skin feeling refreshed and has drastically started to even my skin tone in the past two weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, no alcohol, moisturizes, cleans well for in the morning so I don&#x27;t have to use soap on my face in the morning when I washed the night before.</li>
            <li> Have been testing out toners recently when I came across this since I was looking for a rose toner and I LOVE it. Its gentle and doesn&#x27;t leave any film behind on my skin, just a nice smell. I also use it as a rinse for my natural hair makeup brushes which I also love as it leaves a nice smell on them along with making the bristles soft and shiny. I also feel I should mention I have combination oily skin and slight acne and when I use it on a regular basis it really does help minimize redness. And I gave a sample to my mother who has rosacea and she is now also in love with it.</li>
            <li> Why waste hundreds of dollars on expensive toners? Great facial product with minimal side effect reactions. Leaves the skin feeling smooth, soft, and clean.</li>
            <li> Appears to work as well as my very expensive toner.  Love the slight rose fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have very persistent adult acne that I have battled with since I was about 22 (I am now 37) this is one of the best toners I have used it really is gentle and effective and leaves skin very soft. I use the clarsonic, this toner and murad acne clearing solutions and this has been the best routine for my persistent acne thus far. (I also take the murad Pure Skin clarifying Dietary supplement)</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. I have mature skin which is very sensitive. I was looking for a toner that would take off the residue left behind after my cleansing. This does the trick and it smells fantastic. Best thing it does NOT dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Why do you have to plaster stickers all over the front of the bottle ????  Great product but ungiftable.  At least get the easy off stickers</li>
            <li> ive only used once so far so good we will see nice price I hate spending much on toners but I  do like this one so far too soon to tell ifi will use long term but we will see.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect summertime toner to keep your skin looking and smelling fresh and dewey- like a rose. It&#x27;s a great &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; if you have been working outside all day-just wash your face and then use Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel toner with a cotton ball and you will glow for your evening activities!</li>
            <li> Good but drying in the winter months. Heals blemishes and burns. Minimizes pores.</li>
            <li> thought it was a different product</li>
            <li> Great product.A great skin toner and a refreshing aftershave(especially bikini area).My only nit picky little complaint is that a large sticker was placed on the product&#x27;s attractive vintage-style label,and when I tried to remove the sticker it tore away at the label.I know workers are very busy but please place sticker on another part of the bottle.Don&#x27;t slap it across the pretty label,that&#x27;s half the attractiveness of this product!(or use a sticker that will easily peel off )Thank you.</li>
            <li> I normally use witch hazel for my face. It reduces the visibility of capillaries and is a mild natural cleanser. When I saw this product I was intrigued by the addition of rose petals (mild vitamin c and antibacterial) and aloe vera (soothing for skin). This product not only smells wonderful, but I notice it has more cleaning power and seems to sooth my face. I love it...</li>
            <li> So as every lady online knows, your skin care regimen evolves and changes, and it&#x27;s often difficult to find new products that work as well as your old, but after a while your skin&#x27;s PH balance gets used to the products and poof--it&#x27;s time to find new product for yourself. I heard that witch hazel was good to use as a toner as long as it is paraben-free, and decided to do a search to find the best. Well, in the expensive all organic deli near my house, I found this brand as the only one that wasn&#x27;t full of alcohol and paraben, but it was so expensive I couldn&#x27;t bear to buy it even though I read online that it was a good one. This is where the internet always comes in these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I found it on Amazon for nearly half the cost as the one in my deli. So I ordered two, and had them shipped to my apartment. After first use, I felt like it was a little too harsh with my cetaphil, so I tried it with [[ASIN:B00LFT0CEO TreeActiv+ Tea Tree Oil Acne Solution for Advanced Acne Treatment - All Natural Acne Spot Treatment - Blemishes Gone or Your Money Back!]] that my sister bought me (also on Amazon, we really can use the internet for everything, huh?) and this was a way better combination. Since the Tea Tree face wash and oil are richer in the oils that my combination skins, the witch hazel acts as a sort of in between step for the two that makes sure that it isn&#x27;t too much oil, and you still get the moisturizing aspect. I also use a [[[ASIN:B00U1J83SQ TreeActiv Anti Acne &amp; Rosacea Treatment Sulfur Mask Plus Rhassoul, Bentonite Clay Mask with Witch Hazel &amp; Aloe Vera - Refreshing Lemon Scent (1 Jar)]] that does the trick as well.  I definitely recommend using them all together if you have combination skin, the tea tree products moisturize my skin and fight acne, and the witch hazel acts as an astringent, making sure my skin isn&#x27;t too oily, and also fighting the acne. Bonus: all of these products smell amazing, so score on that!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it makes any difference on my skin but I love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a favorite of mine.  I love Thayers witch hazel, it&#x27;s high quality, and smells better than other brands of witch hazel for some reason. However this rose one also smells like beautiful roses, so your skin get the benefits of both witch hazel and rose essences, which is a perfect combination to clean &amp; soothe any type of skin. It&#x27;s nice alone but I use it conjunction with other products. This product allows for maximum absorption of other beneficial skincare products, like serums &amp; moisturizers. IMO it&#x27;s a giant waste of money to use expensive treatment serums on your skin, unless it&#x27;s been fully prepared to absorb it. Just washing your face &amp; going straight to the serum is a major waste of serum. Taking the extra step to tone the skin with a product such as this Thayers Rose Witch Hazel, yields a very high increase in the efficacy of any serum &amp;/or overnight treatments you may use!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re someone that feels like none of the treatment products you use ever truly work for you, or maybe it made a noticeable difference at first, but then your skin got &amp;#34;used to it&amp;#34;, or it &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34;, then try toning with this witch hazel after you wash your face. You&#x27;ll be so glad you did! :) ♡JL</li>
            <li> The Rose Petal Witch Hazel is very refreshing and the fragrancy is soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking at a lot of Makeup Tutorials &amp; Beauty Trends on YouTube, &amp; one YouTuber mentioned that she has very sensitive skin (I do also) &amp; has to use a specific type of Witch Hazel. Alcohol FREE Witch Hazel. I didn&#x27;t even know one could GET that! So I went to CVS when I was out one day &amp; looked for it. Not one product was Alcohol Free. I decided to use my &amp;#34;Handy Dandy Trusty ol&#x27; Friend&amp;#34; that is Amazon.com, &amp; I found the exact one she was talking about! I ordered the Thayer&#x27;s Alcohol Free Rose Petal Witch Hazel w/ Aloe Vera, let me just tell you... it is a top quality product. It does not hurt, sting, burn, nothing! Even if you have a cut on your face, it does not aggreviate it. The fact that it smells like Rose Petals is a refreshing touch. And refreshing it is! I would like to put some in a spray bottle &amp; refrigerate it for the Summer. Ahhh! Now, just to let you all know, I ordered it from OxKom. They were great! Speedy delivery, great care in packaging. You cannot go wrong with this product or Seller.&lt;br /&gt; ~ UPDATE: For those who are asking if this Witch Hazel does any thing for Eye Bags or Puffiness, it does not, because after answering this question for someone else, I saw a note at the bottom of the page.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a week or two now, and I absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve always used a facial toner with some sort of rose in it, but the witch hazel is phenomenal. I definitely will be repurchasing!</li>
            <li> Love this product very soothing to the skin</li>
            <li> I have had acne and super oily skin since I was in middle school, and while its not usually as harsh as it was then, these last few months I have been breaking out even more around my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a skin care product that I felt the need to write a review for before this one. This literally cleared up my skin over night. After a few more nights of using it my skin is better than it has been in years. It hasn&#x27;t even been a week! I&#x27;ve tried SO MANY acne products and this is the only one that I see actually working on my skin. And it is a third of the price, more natural, and bigger than any other supposed &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re on the fence about buying this, just do it. It&#x27;s cheap, and it works.</li>
            <li> After reading about the benefits (softens skin) of rose water, rose hip oil, and rose essential oil, I started searching for natural products to add into my nighttime skincare regime. I didn&#x27;t want to add anymore steps to the process but did want to incorporate rose. Since, I already use witch hazel after cleansing and needed more, the rose petal witch hazel was an easy solution. It works very well.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Works like toners with alcohol but doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or make it feel tight.</li>
            <li> Tightens pores. Smells great !</li>
            <li> I was happy to find with hazel without alcohol. Delivery was fast and product arrived in good condition.  I use this to wet toilet paper so as not to add additional solids to my septic tank.  It has a pleasant scent and works well for my purposes.  I do think it is a little expensive, but I am happy with  my purchase.  The nice tight snap cap is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Rose scent is light. Very refreshing</li>
            <li> Refeshing alcohol-free toner! I have been using this morning and night for a few months now. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry, just refreshed. 12oz is a nice big bottle for the price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Tightens pores but....it smells like pickles! Not a huge fan of pickle smell on my face. It stays after it dries too.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot because it&#x27;s such a gentle toner however I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better product out there to really help balance PH levels in my skin so I&#x27;m still searching for that</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. No more over-priced alcohol based toners for me. The scent is light and refreshing (*if you do NOT like the smell of fresh rose petals, this isn&#x27;t for you). It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin (I&#x27;m um... &amp;#34;middle aged&amp;#34; and my skins tends to be normal to dry). I use it every night.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore my witch hazel. I have always switched toners but I in the end, Thayers always comes out the winner. I have very sensitive skin and this works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this! Perfect face toner! ❤️</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and Thayers is fantastic! I was a little unsure if I should try the rose scented witch Hazel over my usual aloe but I had no reaction what so ever and LOVE the scent!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Used it to make padsickles for postpartum. Its what everyone is recommending. Haven&#x27;t really tried it yet..</li>
            <li> Best way to restore skin&#x27;s glow and resiliency. After being in grad school and working full time, my lack of sleep really started to show in my skin. Using this really helps restore a natural balance while also getting rid of any dullness. Since I&#x27;ve started using this in 2014, I&#x27;ve seen a major reduction in pore size, skin elasticity, and youth. Plus this stuff smells great and is a great prep for any major moisturizing routine.</li>
            <li> I use this with cotton balls every single day.  It&#x27;s great to use after cleansing your face. I recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell first of all. I noticed my oily akin is not so oily applying 2 times a day. Ive even been getting compliments my skin is glowing. I love this toner best thing ever.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is so different from toners I have tried in the past. I doesn&#x27;t burn at all (no alcohol) and my skin has improved. It seems more even and less oily. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry, red or peeling at all. I even put it on my legs after shaving. Also, the rose scent is not overpowering and usually disappears after a few minutes. Would give more stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of concerns after sifting through all the reviews but there was no reason to worry about this purchase. As a facial aftershave, this works pretty well. The scent is not overpowering and wears off after around an hour. It should only be an issue if you splash a ton of it on. The rose smell is less similar to an actual rose and more artificial, like grenadine. There was no medicinal smell. I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to scents and had no issues. The witchhazel is not as stingy as alcohol and softened my skin nicely after using a drier kind of shaving soap. The lid has a fairly small opening, so maybe they changed it since the lid criticisms were published. I also had no allergic reactions or irritation from using this. The rose is good, but I think I&#x27;d go with something else like Unscented next purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently read a blog that talked about how great witch hazel is for your skin... and I am so happy that I bought it! I use this after the shower in the morning and at night before I use my Vitamin C Serum. I bought those cotton pads and just wipe it across my face. At first I was using cotton balls but I didn’t like how saturated they got and also seemed to waste the product. This has drastically cleared my skin, I used to have bad breakouts around my period or I would get those terrible under grounders that hurt so flippen bad you want to just hide under the covers until its gone. Havent had one since adding this to my routine! Buy this and use it! Great product.</li>
            <li> Very nice I have acne prone skin this does not break me out its summer now so I&#x27;ve been using this a couple times a day it feels refreshing I also use it as my toner after I wash my face &amp; before I put on face cream so fare I&#x27;m happy with it I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week &amp; will order again :)</li>
            <li> the perfect toner for sensitive/combination skin! alcohol toner can be harsh on my skin at times, but this is perfect! it smells great, i can usually smell the rose for a little while after applying it. i don&#x27;t think the smell is too strong at all. i can use this daily without any irritation. this will definitely be apart of my daily routine!</li>
            <li> This is the best toner that I found for my combination skin.  I put it in a spray bottle and use it daily.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate or dry me out, but helps reduce some of the oilyness and redness.</li>
            <li> Runs small...I ordered a 36...fit like a 34.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering the second bottle. It&#x27;s nice, natural toner just perfect after you washed your face. Smells very nice.</li>
            <li> After reading so many glorious reviews on this product, I finally decided to give this a try..I had been having alot of trouble with adult acne, and couldn&#x27;t seem to find anything that worked without overdrying my skin~until this! This toner has left my skin so soft and moist, all while controlling my acne.  This used in conjunction with Derma e anti wrinkle face wash has gotten my complexion back to beautiful!</li>
            <li> Even when I think my face is completely clean after washing it, I use this on a cotton pad to balance the pH and cleanse it even more and I&#x27;m always disgusted by how much my face wash leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful and works great. My skin loves this product :)</li>
            <li> Great scent and fresh!</li>
            <li> I bought this product from vitamin shopee seeing all these reviews on amazon&lt;br /&gt;And I am so happy that I did&lt;br /&gt;It feels so nice when you apply it on your face&lt;br /&gt;No burning no stinging. Smells nice and really cleans&lt;br /&gt;My face feels so smooth after&lt;br /&gt;Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this toner helps me keep it clear without over drying. My skin looks great without having to deal with moisturizers that end up clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> moistrurizing very well, can smell rose a little bit. Don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s 100% natrual (can&#x27;t smell anything if it doesn&#x27;t put any addition inside, it should be nothing, literally not even rose smell.) And the lid just broke somehow after one week of usage.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Cleans my skin with no irritation or drying.</li>
            <li> I have always used witch hazel as an astringent.  I&#x27;m so very happy with this Rose Petal version!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Very gentle on my skin. I already noticed a difference on my face. One of my holy grail.</li>
            <li> I love a rose smell but this is a little too strong for me. Other than that I like the product.  I plan to buy an unscented one and mix the two.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice soothing scent.</li>
            <li> This is my second Thayers toner I purchased and I will purchase them again. They are calming and non-irritating. I recommend this to others with sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> In just a few days, I can tell the difference in the cleanliness of my skin it has reduced the oil and blackheads that surface daily. I wash in the morning when I wake up and at night before I go to bed. My pores have reduced in size and my skin is soft. After I wash, I use Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and a few drops of tea tree essential oil on a cotton ball and swab my face. The toner keeps my face fresh and soft while the tea tree oil prevents pimples/oil build up. LOVE this product in my regimen.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff,smells amazing !&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with it .</li>
            <li> I love that this is Alcohol-Free, I had been using a Witch Hazel that was distilled with alcohol and I really prefer this. The rose petal smell is light and refreshing. Have loved introducing this into my skin care regime.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Light, beautiful smell. Very calming.</li>
            <li> Good product. I think it&#x27;s better for normal to dry skin, leaves skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love this toner!! It feels so amazing on my skin and leaves it feeling clean and refreshed. It has a very light scent which I enjoy.</li>
            <li> I like the feeling after use the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff- and it smells lovely too!</li>
            <li> I used this in the past as i like the smell. I have since switched to infinite skn toner and gave this to my mom and she loves!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells so lovely. A really nice toner product. I had been very loyal to Lush brand toner&#x27;s but this is my new favorite. I think it has helped dry up any blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li> Gentle for skin and does just what it says it will</li>
            <li> I use this toner for several years. I love the rose water and also I use it for mask several times. I will buy another one next month.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin and this is very gentle after cleansing creme and then I use my regular moisturizer I am amazed that there is any make up left after cleansing creme but this gets the last little bit. I&#x27;ve tried other toners but they were all too drying and left my skin red and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product to use as an after-shave balm. The rose scent is too much for me!  Despite other reviews I read , the scent DOES linger for several hours. I&#x27;ve ordered the unscented astringent version.</li>
            <li> Love this toner!  It&#x27;s gentle and really balances, tones and cleans the remaining traces of junk off your skin.  I love that it is alcohol free which is very important and it smells nice too.  It is a good value for what it is and it lasts for awhile, for me personally about 3-4 months.  It&#x27;s my go to for clear healthy skin in combo with the rest of my skin routine.  I will repurchase.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I hate to go against what so many other reviewers have experienced (apparently),&lt;br /&gt;but it&#x27;s my responsibility to report honestly and completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I&#x27;m a white man in my early 30&#x27;s, for what it&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have really good skin (only because I&#x27;m obsessed with taking care of it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE the smell of this product.  It reminds me of 70 year old cat lady&#x27;s house.&lt;br /&gt;It is not manly AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I told one of my girlfriends that I got the rose petal one,&lt;br /&gt;and she said it&#x27;s gonna smell feminine.  She was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second thing, and this may be too soon to tell, because I&#x27;ve only used it for&lt;br /&gt;3 days.  But I&#x27;ve now got a huge zit on the tip of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;That is very unusual for me (these days).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to getting a zit like this once a year, if that.&lt;br /&gt;I was using Nature&#x27;s Oil Witch Hazel (bought from Amazon too) for several months, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;So I can only conclude, since this is the only difference in my skin routine,&lt;br /&gt;that this Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel gave me this zit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m not 100% sure about the zit though (maybe it&#x27;s the storm before the calm),&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try the cucumber, since I like the smell of cucumber and hate this rose petal crap.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I need help with my groceries smelling like this.</li>
            <li> Not for all skin types,  it smells good, but feels a little heavy and it made me break out overnight.....</li>
            <li> Love it so far it&#x27;s not harsh on the skin.  I plan to use this product in the future.  Great for dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and no alcohol in this product, I will definitely order more in future!! Very happy with this, doesn&#x27;t burn my face, like most skin toners, I&#x27;ve got really sensitive skin, and oh yes, did I mention I love the smell?! Roses, how can you go wrong, and all natural.</li>
            <li> Wonderful gentle on the skin I used with my daughter. Advise him strongly Excellent and good price will ask remade</li>
            <li> Smells great. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it makes a real change in my skin, but it hasn&#x27;t caused any break outs or other side effects.</li>
            <li> This product really helps decrease acnes and make my skin smoother! FYI, I am asian so this product works on asian skin as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Please never stop making this! This is perfect for my sensitive skin. Gentle yet so effective!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing. Keeps my skin soft and hydrated throughout the day. No need for a moisturiser afterwards and the scent it wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;No issues with shipping.</li>
            <li> This is really lovely.  It is perfect for what I wanted.  The fragrance is subtle, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily it is much milder than another brand have found that using it daily both prior to putting on my make up and again after to set it.  Very good</li>
            <li> I love Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel.  I use it in a lot of home remedies because it doesnt smell all medicine-like like regular witch hazel does.</li>
            <li> Very happily surprised with this. It really does smell like roses haha. I have some acne problems and this has done wonders! I&#x27;m super sketchy about what I put on my face, and reading other reviews I decided to try it, and it has cleared up so much of my skin and it looks so much smoother when I wake up in the morning. I use this at night after I wash my face, and then put some rose hip seed oil on, and it is awesome!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this toner because I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about the Thayers face toner. I cleansed my face and then put some on a cotton ball and applied it and it set my face on fire!! I didn&#x27;t understand because it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, even pure Aloe Vera which is soothing and isn&#x27;t supposed to burn. Witch Hazel is also soothing and it has all natural ingredients, even the Rose is a natural fragrance not like the fragrances they put in all other kinds of products. So I called Thayers and they said that it should definately not burn your face at all and could be counterfeit. I let the seller know about this and they are looking into their supplier. You have to be very careful about the counterfeits on here as I ran into some already.</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading reviews about a natural toner.  It smells exactly like rose water, not a bit like original witch hazel.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a solid week, 2 x day, and I haven&#x27;t noticed a reduction in pores or wrinkles.  But it sure makes my skin smooth and smell good.</li>
            <li> This rose water is fine, but not my favorite. I may purchase again, if I need rose water for my household, but not for my face.</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks of using this skin toner, my skin looks FABULOUS!  This toner preserves the natural moisture so I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer as I did with my former skin toner that I paid three times more for.  I love this skin toner!  I plan to buy more!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a toner for my face and wanted to make sure that I picked the correct one since i suffer from Cystic acne. I read the reviews and I must say, all that was written was TRUE !!</li>
            <li> I have never used anything like this and decided to give this a try and I was so shocked on how it worked well with my skin. No longer will I go back to what I was using. This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both use this as toner after cleansing.  It smells lovely and provides good nourishment for our skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> I read where it said Rose oil  are Rose Petal was extant for your face and wrinkles.I use it 2 times a day felt so cool on my face I love it.​</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other fragrance than real rose.  What a great addition to witch hazel. So multi-purpose, refreshing and lovely to use. Love it!  Need more!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is much softer than before. Products also go on my face much better. I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my acne or red spots, but I&#x27;ll continue using this to see if it helps. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this product was the strong rose smell. It&#x27;s a tad bit too overwhelming for me, though I don&#x27;t mind too much as the smell fades after application.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> It is very lovely smelling. I use it as a face toner, but it has many uses like for hemroids. There is no alcohol in it. At the pharmacy there was only the kind with alcohol in it. Alcohol stings on cuts so I special ordered this from Amazon. The solution is gentle and makes me face very clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use it for my facials and when I get my manicures to remove product residue and to leave a moisturized feel.&lt;br /&gt;It is also great for make-up correction while achieving a flawless result!</li>
            <li> love this toner ~ light &amp; fresh</li>
            <li> it feel  great on my face. I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks now and see a difference in my skin tone and general skin health.</li>
            <li> great product and cheaper elsewhere. Soothing, works brilliantly to smooth, tone and help with all sort of skin issues. Rose Water is an astringent, tightens skin. Witch hazel smooths and soothes.</li>
            <li> I used to think rose smell was for old ladies.  Either I am old or this mild scent is just so refreshing on my face that I now love it</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this witch hazel or the new face oil is the reason for my much improved skin, but I love this product. I use it after washing my face each night and in the morning, (before putting on the argan oil I also bought) It smells wonderful and makes my skin feel great. I have already recommended this to others. I will definitely buy again. Quick shipping too!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal with no alcohol. I purchased it for my fiancee who loves rose scent, has sensitive skin and needed an astringent. He loves it and uses it every day, twice a day. No stinging or redness has resulted, unlike with other similar products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I used this to mix up a homemade bug spray, soft floral scent was great, not overpowering!</li>
            <li> a super toner..all I can say</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular Thayers witch hazel religiously for almost 3 years now but my most recently bottle caused my skin to become very irritated. I put it on as usual with a cotton ball and all of a sudden my face turned bright red and started to burn. Very unexpected, coming from a toner that I had never had any issues with. Nothing else was different in my skincare routine to cause the burning to occur, so I have no explanation other than the formula was made incorrectly. I did notice that the scent of this particular bottle was much stronger than of those I had previously used. I wouldn&#x27;t risk using a product that has inconsistent results like this and will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning product and the smell is simple mesmerizing. I will be buying more as I can&#x27;t find it in any store.</li>
            <li> Very best thing I&#x27;ve used on face ever.  I apply it with a cotton ball and not only is it refreshing, but all the red spots on my face disappeared.  I don&#x27;t even have to use  moisterizer on my face before applying makeup.  I love the fragrance, although I would try the lavender sometime. My friends think I&#x27;m putting my makeup on differently, but I&#x27;m not, the difference is using this witch hazel.  I&#x27;ve had people tell me how great it is, I just wish I had started using it a long time ago.  But, better late than never.</li>
            <li> I feel like it didn&#x27;t hydrate as well as it should. Maybe it was the way it reacted to my skin, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work for me. Had high hopes based on the review.</li>
            <li> i bought it cuz of the high reviews!! Im so happy i did!! Its perfect for my skin! I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I love the aroma, but I get itchy every time I use it.  I would give 5 stars other wise.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it twice a day - after I wash my face in the morning and night.  It cleans and tones without harsh chemicals or alcohol.</li>
            <li> I love how softening this toner is. I feel like it made me break out a little on my cheeks but I stopped using it there and all was well. It smells lovely and I will repurchase it again!</li>
            <li> really like this.  it&#x27;s refreshing and smells nice.  After I wash my face with cleanser, i use witch hazel and see that i still have make up on.  it really takes off the rest of my makeup. Love it and will definitely buy again.  Quick delivery as well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Wash my face and put it on afterwards and skin is moisturized. Don&#x27;t breakout as much since using this product.</li>
            <li> I like this, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any better than Dickinson&#x27;s, which I can buy for less at local drugstores. I do love the smell, but not the price.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel fresh. I use it daily. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Effective and very gentle. I&#x27;ve replaced my Clinique toner with this witch hazel and couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. After just using it once, my skin looks SO much better! The redness is basically gone, the texture looks way smoother, and it feels clean and hydrated at all times. My skin has a bit of a glow to it now, and just looks really healthy. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
            <li> Amazon kept recommend me one product after another. After I got the best one, then they recommended 2nd best. this is the 2nd best, so i return it and kept the best one to use. What a waste.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth when using this product. I have seen a lot of dirt on my cotton pad even after washing my face and neck. I love the gentle rose fragrance. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long, kinda hoped it would. Found later that it was available at Walgreen&#x27;s. The price was similar, but not paying postage would have helped me. Delivered on time, exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great product, real ingredients. Used for a toner and an ingredient in home made hand sanitizer. Love it for bother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week now and haven&#x27;t really seen too big of a result, but I feel very clean in the face and my skin has brightened up CONSIDERABLY. I&#x27;m holding out for better results!</li>
            <li> My face felt softer , clean and healthier  plus it also smells soo  good and its organic loved this toner I will buy more from this brand !</li>
            <li> I am a 34 y/o African American with blemish and very sensitive skin. This is the first toner that I have ever used that didn&#x27;t cause me to breakout. I have tried a wide variety from prescription to all natural, they all irritated my skin. I gave up and stopped using toners. Based on the reviews I decided to try it. I am glad I did. Non alcohol is the key. In addition to healthy eating, juicing and plenty of water my skin looks clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;10 days later, still working great.  No sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li> Luv it...my skin felt soft soon after i used it</li>
            <li> works great and smells good very soothing</li>
            <li> Holy cow! This stuff is incredible! I even have my boyfriend using it. I&#x27;ve never felt my skin so soft and hydrated without it getting oily from lotions and moisturizers. This actually hydrates my face, makes it smoother, cleans the remaining dirt and debris from my pores and leaves my 30 year old face looking like a super fly and funky fresh 20 year old. Nailing it Thayers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I took this with me to a wedding I went to and happened to forget it in the hotel room. I love this product so much I immediately ordered a replacement so I wouldn&#x27;t be without it for long.</li>
            <li> I use this after shaving. It smells good. Even my wife commented on how good it smells. Not greasy, but soothes the skin. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I do not wear make up so I do not wash my skin as needed or should I say as I should. This is the best toner that I have found that works on my skin.</li>
            <li> Ok I understand all the hype behind this amazing product. I have oily to combo skin. I had to use ot as soon as I got it. First it smells divine!!  It is a calming rose scent. The bottle is very big for a toner ! Also its pretty. Now how it works. I just did a lactic acid peel and this was extremely cooling on my skin. My face feels so soft. It is a keeper!! I wont go without this NOW!! I too am a follower. Why did I wait so long to buy THIS??</li>
            <li> Like this product very much. Had a nice rose scent. Used it on my face and now my pores are closed. The  bottle looks nice too. First time using it. Will try the other scents too .</li>
            <li> This is awesome stuff. It smells great and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s refreshing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Like always, love it!</li>
            <li> It is really nice and refreshing to the skin. I used for a week now. I don&#x27;t yet see much improvement but I do feel my pores tighten without drying my face( very dry fave person here).&lt;br /&gt;Will update my review in couple weeks!!If satisfied will give full 5 star.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it every night to clean my face and remove makeup and go to bed feeling refreshed. No dryness whatsoever. I&#x27;ve used witch hazel before and prefer the smell of roses over that. I will definitely be reordering this when the time comes. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Third time purchasing. Favorite toner!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Gently cleans and removes makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin is ultra sensitive.  I use this as a toner and it is awesome!  It leaves my skin really clear and does not irritate my skin.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I just really like that this product doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol. Good toner!</li>
            <li> Rose is my favorite scent and I love using witch hazel as a face toner.  What a great combination!  It&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, I look every time I&#x27;m somewhere where it might be sold and it&#x27;s usually the plain version.  Glad I know where to go to find it now!</li>
            <li> I love this product very much. I believe that it has helped with my acne and acne scars. I don&#x27;t break out as much anymore and I&#x27;ve heard that rose petal and witch hazel is good for acne and acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;How I apply this is that first I use Noxzema&#x27;s original deep cleansing cream ([[ASIN:B00430CRX6 Noxzema Original Cleansing Cream Ounce]] - I use this every morning and every night.&lt;br /&gt;Then after patting my face with a clean wash cloth, I apply this toner with a cotton pad by dabbing it on my face, all over. I then let it dry and apply Aveeno&#x27;s SPF 70 sunscreen ([[ASIN:B00ABIF5SS Aveeno Sunscreen Protect Hydrate Spectrum]] or Neutrogena&#x27;s SPF 70 sunscreen if you don&#x27;t want you skin to look to oily ([[ASIN:B0013OFRUK Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen]] but it may still be dry so you might have to apply moisturizer afterwards, unless if this toner moisturizes your skin enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Noxzema and apply this toner every morning and night, I only apply sunscreen in the morning &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> works great, nice smell and price.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh feeling after putting this on- I feel very clean and my skin feels soft and smells lovely.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish the packaging were prettier. Next to my asian beauty products, this bottle is sort of an eye-sore. But the quality is what counts and it does a great job!</li>
            <li> The past few months, my face has been the worst it&#x27;s ever been in my whole life. I&#x27;ll wake up with new zits every morning and get more throughout the day. Well this arrived early yesterday and I applied it to my face with a cotton pad and then went back to sleep. I woke up to clear skin! Now all I have are scabs from where the old blemishes are healed. It shrunk my pores and dissolved my blackheads. My face is so smooth and soft. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I posted it on my Facebook because this is a must have for people with trouble skin. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out either like proactive did. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Even without acne, it will improve your complection and clean and moisturize your skin without any harshness like other toners.</li>
            <li> love love love this has really helped my skin will continue buying</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no alcohol, but there is fragrance added.</li>
            <li> love it. its very gentle and very helpful when i have occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome, it feels so refreshing, light, clean. The scent is not harsh or overwhelming, I recommend this products 100% its definitely a must have facial toner!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Rose is my favorite but Thayer&#x27;s also comes in Lavender, Lemon and Cucumber scents, too. All are very pleasant and refreshing. Lately I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel to take away the swelling, itch and pain from bug bites. Works wonders. Also a great astringent and cleaner for the face and neck. I suppose I could use drugstore witch hazel but Thayer&#x27;s is a much better product and smells great. It&#x27;s something nice I do for myself. Ordering and delivery were problem free. Would buy here again.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use this product and I&#x27;m very pleased! It smells wonderful and is a wonderful toner with absolutely no drying of my skin. Love it and will order again!</li>
            <li> I have gone through several brands of toners, alcohol and non-alcohol, and this is the best. It actually moisturizes your skin, instead of drying it out! And after I use it, I don&#x27;t feel like I have to rinse my face. It feels so natural and still picks up dirt- not as much dirt as the harsher brands though, so if you have oily acne-prone skin. this is a good second toner after you use the harsh stuff. My skin is oily in the summer and dry in the winter, and in the summertime I use Sea Breeze before this and it prevents over-drying and still moisturizes without creating extra oiliness. Best of all, it smells great! Like sweet rose petals. If you don&#x27;t like the smell, it&#x27;s not potent anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best toner I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ll be buying many more bottles.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Fast shipping and great product packaging</li>
            <li> This smells soooo good!!! Non stinging and alcohol free</li>
            <li> This is a lovely cleanser that I use after washing my face and before putting on my moisturizer.  The rose smell is light and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have used this each morning and evening before applying lotion in the morning and after bathing in evening.  I have not had any problems with it - the smell is nice and soft - not overpowering.  I&#x27;m 48 and happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My daughter had this on his wish list for Christmas. I ordered it, and when it arrived I decided to try it.  Not to sound weird but I can&#x27;t stop touching my face.  It feels so smooth!  IGNORE the comments about the scent.  It&#x27;s a very light rose scent.  I think some people just find things to complain about.  This product feels like silk. I am 49 so I don&#x27;t break out. I have normal skin that only gets oily (slightly) in the t zone.  My skin tends to get dry in the winter.  This hydrated my skin without making it oily.  I will definitely order a bottle for myself!  I will update this post after she uses this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite toner now.  I&#x27;m so glad I switched to witch hazel, it makes my face feel so refreshed and my skin seems much more clearer now that I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand before and love it.  I also never tried rose petal and so happy I did.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this toner and the way it makes me skin feel after using it.  I have used other toners that make my skin scream for lotion afterwards but this one makes my face feel clean and not dried out.</li>
            <li> This is my first comment, coz I have to. It feels so good after put the toner on.  I will keep re-order it!</li>
            <li> This toner is the best I have ever used. Not only does it have no alcohol, it is incredibly soothing and moisturizing. I love it! It&#x27;s great at night when I don&#x27;t feel up to a whole beauty routine and I just want to wash my face then apply this, this works as a moisturizer for me. I have very very fussy, easily irritated acne prone skin, and this does not irritate my skin at all, nor does it cause break outs. My skin always looks wonderful when I use it regularly, and I feel like I could use it at any time of the day to freshen up without over irritating my face. I am in love with this toner and want to sing it at the top of the world. It is a completely wonderful product with no irritants for me, and it has helped prevent the occasional pimple or zit.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I buy this product and will definitely buy it again. It is really a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> It is cheap compare to what I bought in the store. However, it has a bad smell after I put it on my face. Not the pure rose smell. Wondering if it is real one from the manufacturer or a faked one. Will not choose next time.</li>
            <li> This is a nice refreshing toner that leaves your skin soft and moisturized. I have had a few breakouts, but I can&#x27;t say this product was the cause.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My skin is more even and clear, less acne especially around that time of the month. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my already extremely dry skin and it smells lovely. I&#x27;ve tried other stuff and always come back to this. Love it.</li>
            <li> Good smell!free of alcohol!</li>
            <li> Nice ! AND  price is better.</li>
            <li> I wont use anything else as a toner now. It smells amazing. There is no use in paying more for a fancy toner. This stuff is old school and legit.</li>
            <li> Love it. Just started using over a week and seeing a difference.  When I think of all the money I spent on dept. stores..</li>
            <li> We had been using just the plain witch hazel and a friend told us to try this one with the Rose Petal and we like it even more. Its refreshing and seems to have really helped both my complexion as a senior and my 22 year old granddaughter&#x27;s as well. There is no alcohol to dry out the skin and the smell is quite pleasant. We will be ordering this again. These are reliable sellers and the packaging was well done.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and I will use it for the rest of my life. It&#x27;s refreshing, softening, and gives you a serious glow that I can&#x27;t really explain. It tightens my pores right up and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin like any other toner would. I LOVE the scent, because I love rose. Buy this! You won&#x27;t regret it. Use after cleansing, before moisturizing. Apply with clean hands instead of a cotton ball- it&#x27;s just as effective and less drying/irritating if you have sensitive skin like me. I love this product, my skin wouldn&#x27;t be the same without it.</li>
            <li> Always works as directed</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s a wonderful product. You&#x27;ll love it and use it all the time</li>
            <li> very nice! smells so good! works very well</li>
            <li> happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I found a link on pinterest that taught me how to make a facial toner. This is a great product. I read a few of the reviews and am so happy I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Great staple for my beauty routine. Gentle and effective on my super oily skin</li>
            <li> This smells divine!  Does not dry out my skin, or sting at all.  I like using it after I have cleansed my face to make sure everything is splarkling clean with no residue remaining.  I have sensitive skin, but this does not bother me at all.  A new staple at my home!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the service. The rose scent is pleasant and not overpowering, more importantly, this really helps balance out my combination skin to absorb facial moisturizer more evenly. Very happy and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It is good one, I may buy it again</li>
            <li> I am allergic to heavy scents, so this toner is just great for me.  In addition, it makes my face feel really nice and refreshed.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect cleanser and toner. Very refreshing and has a mild rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;Does not dry the skin at all. Love it. I recommend it to everybody.</li>
            <li> LIFE SAVER! This tonic is amazing.</li>
            <li> I left one before , don&#x27;t know where it is? I&#x27;m repeating it because I havn&#x27;t been able to find this and really like it, i put some in a spray bottle and mist my face over my night cream and over my make up before work. It has a great smell. I would order it again but think it is a little expensive.</li>
            <li> good stuff, feels great on the face</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s not drying, as it&#x27;s alcohol free. It leaves your skin very soft and good smelling. I&#x27;ve been using it to stop mosquito bites from itching and find it works better than the anti-itch creams. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and night after washing up. It does make my skin feel a bit softer, though I typically put a layer of lotion on top of it because my skin gets very cracked otherwise. I have not noticed a huge difference in my skin, perhaps a little less breaking out, but I cannot say that it&#x27;s from using this item. I did discover that it bleaches towels? I had used one originally to help apply it, and it turned my towels into a splotchy mess. Switched to a thin, white rag after that. Knowing that I tend to add a few layers on top of my darker spots, hopefully it will even out my skintone. Other than that it seems to be a decent product. The smell takes awhile to get used to, but I like the idea that it&#x27;s a very natural product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait to write a review on this, mainly to see the impact it had on my face, and woahh it did. I normally have a mixture of dry/oily skin which is a huge disaster. After using this product for a little over 3 months, my skin has cleared up a lot and been far less oily. I usually use this and some light moisturizer after I wash my face and it is very refreshing (since my skin is dry as well I need to add some moisturizer to it cause this toner can dry it out more if not). It smells like roses too which is an added bonus for your pretty little face!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Smells great and works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful and refreshing product. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product, but I prefer a little more witch hazel.  Leaves your skin nice and soft and smells heavenly.  So if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re after you can&#x27;t go wrong....plus you have the toning effects of Witch Hazel which are superb.</li>
            <li> Not blaming the product. It is just my nose. The smell is just so overpowering. I gave it to my sister ultimately as I really cant stand the smell.</li>
            <li> Will purchase again. Great product!</li>
            <li> Note: acne-prone skin/combination.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very gentle on the skin that even on the acne spots that&#x27;s inflamed it doesn&#x27;t sting like other toners would do! Worth every penny!!! Indulge!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought this toner which speaks volumes seeing as I am a &amp;#34;gotta try everything out there at least once&amp;#34; type of gal and seeing as there is so much out there, I often never buy something for a second time.  The addition of the rose petal makes for an incredibly soothing toner than can not only be used for toning of the skin but really as an addition to any home made cleanser for irritated or sensitive skin.  I suspect that I will be buying this for many years to come as I might have found my &amp;#34;go-to&amp;#34; toner.</li>
            <li> The product is great but it was delivered with a huge ugly bar-code sticker across the front.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;Thayers have managed to cover up the terrible smell of witch hazel!</li>
            <li> It smells great, makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> feel great on my face doesn&#x27;t dry it out doesn&#x27;t make me break out either :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks now. I have yet to see it making a difference on my skin, but I will say it is my favorite toner to date. Toners tend to have a burning sensation when used, but Thayers Rose Petal feels so nice and fresh on my skin.I used it morning and night and whenever my skin needs to be refreshed. Sometimes, I don&#x27;t even apply lotion afterwards and my skin doesn&#x27;t dry out. I got my shipment pretty quickly and it was safely packaged. Overall, I&#x27;m highly satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love the rose scent of this...this is a better toner than any of the high-end, expensive ones I&#x27;ve tried, at a fraction of the cost! I also use the Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel pads, which are great for the exfoliation factor. It&#x27;s crazy to pay exorbitant amounts of money on expensive &#x27;toners&#x27; that are basically witch hazel with fragrance added, and a fancy name slapped on the bottle...when you can buy plain or rose petal witch hazel for a few dollars, and it is not going to irritate your skin like some of those toners do! Great product, great value!</li>
            <li> Exceedingly refreshing!</li>
            <li> great product, great value</li>
            <li> After a fiasco involving a tea tree oil cleanser, My sensitive skin was left with painful, huge zits all over my face. My once combination skin turned soaking in oil. Needless to say that I was distraught. I was on Amazon just to purchase other things when skincare caught my eye. I had been needing a new toner and at this point I would of done anything to help my skin! It deserves its highest rating in toners. It&#x27;s only been 4 days and my skin is almost back to being fully clear! I wish I would of taken before and after photos!</li>
            <li> This is the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used. I have dry skin and this reduces dry patches and keeps my face hydrated</li>
            <li> I really love this except for the rose scent. It&#x27;s incredibly strong and I hate the smell. I will re-order again but with a different scent or no scent at all.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few days but I am in love. This is the best toner I have ever used. It&#x27;s gentle and the smell is pleasant and not over powering.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I apparently have an allergy to witch hazel, so I gave this to my friend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It is not for makeup removing. Still need your normally makeup remover. But it is very good toner after cleansing. Skin feels good, not stinging. Nice Rose fragrants. Reasonable price, arrived quickly. great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Well when I received my broken,  half empty bottle I thought. ... a nightmare of customer service awaits me. I was so wrong.  One email later and I was made whole and told to keep the remaining product. FANTASTIC. And to top it off the toner is great.  Removes any left over makeup and grime. Leaving my skin fresh</li>
            <li> This products feels amazing. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Did not realize the Witch Hazel was so diluted with aloe and water</li>
            <li> Makes my skin peel around my nose and mouth.  Some kind of allergic reaction.  I gave it to my roommate, and she loves it.  Her skin is staying on her face, so I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a good sign.  Personally, I&#x27;m going to go toner free.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a sunburn since witch hazel and aloe are best for sunburns. Applied 3x a day for about a week just by dumping it in my hands and patting on the burn. I didn&#x27;t peel, so I&#x27;d consider that a success. It also helps with the itching associated with sunburns. If you start to itch, it&#x27;s time to douse yourself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using it on a sunburn you don&#x27;t want to peel, only take SHORT showers with cool water. Staying in the shower longer than you absolutely must will cause the skin to lift and peel. Also, avoid anything but the mildest soaps and NO scrubbing, itching, rubbing or anything that will weaken the delicate skin. Good luck&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not really a fan of the rose scent, but it wasn&#x27;t very strong and went away quickly.</li>
            <li> This toner smells amazing and does not sting my face like other toners. For an especially soothing experience, I like to take a paper towel and cut it into an oval shape. I then fold the towel in half and cut holes for eyes and a mouth and a slit for the nose. I then soak the paper towel in some of this toner and leave it on my face for 10- 15 minutes. So soothing on a hot summer day!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My face feel so clean not to mention it smells so nice after each use.</li>
            <li> I just love this toner. It leaves my 66 yr. old skin so moisturized and soft. It deep cleans and contains NO alcohol. What more can you want?  I just found this product recently but I plan on reordering and continuing to use it from now on.  It is the best toner I can find in any price range.</li>
            <li> I have acne-prone skin but always take care of my skin and usually avoid bad breakouts. Well, after trying a drugstore foundation a while ago, I broke out into the worst acne I had ever had in my life. And to top that off, I&#x27;m definitely an acne picker. So along with the under-the-skin lumps, and acne, I had dark spots everywhere. I was so insecure. I decided to try something new. I wanted a non-alcoholic toner and decided to give this a go. I&#x27;ve always been into expensive, high end, skincare products but I will never go back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne is almost nonexistent now! The dark spots are gone and I haven&#x27;t gotten any new breakouts yet. It doesn&#x27;t feel tight on the skin afterwards but I can definitely see makeup or dirt on the cotton pad. The only CON I have is that the smell is something I don&#x27;t like. It has that &amp;#34;old-lady&amp;#34; smell and also reminds me of babies. It isn&#x27;t terrible or strong, but I definitely dislike it. It does go away after a while though, and it isn&#x27;t enough to make me quit this!</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Didn&#x27;t see as much improvement as other people did in their skin, but I was using a million products. Now that I use this , with less products, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very good, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand for several yrs., and have been very satisfied w/it.  Just the fact that there is NO alcohol in it is a plus and it has the nicest rose scent to it.</li>
            <li> Adding this to my facial routine changed my skin for the better. It further cleans my pores of anything my face wash may have missed, plus it contains aloe -- a humectant -- which leaves your skin moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention, you can&#x27;t go wrong with rose-scented things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the lavender and wasn&#x27;t impressed. This scent is the way to go.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toner! Not hydrating enough for my skin type. Contains a rosey scent and very affordable for its large size. It contains no alcohol too!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell of roses. I&#x27;ve bought two bottles of this so far. Watch for sales, as the price goes up and down. Regular witch hazel purchased at a drug store sells for half of the price of this product, hence the four stars. But I buy it for the luxury of the smell and feel. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel so dry after using it, compared to regular witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Best product for your skin. Fast service and a great price. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Feels so fresh! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a Holy Grail product. I use it everyday after washing my face with black soap and it instantly moisturizes my skin. I also put it in a fine mist bottle for when my face dries up (rare).</li>
            <li> The toner is great, doesn&#x27;t dry my face like other toners.  Has very nice odor.  My only complaint is there is a flaw in the cover.  It is a nuicense to have to unscrew the cover everytime I want to use it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and normally my makeup (Giorgio Armani) works well in winter or summer but needs a little help with summer humidity.  I had been using Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel in the summer just to clear my pores after washing my face and to cool off when I was outdoors with no makeup.  I ordered this on a whim just because I love the smell of rosewater and thought the scent might be better than Dickenson&#x27;s. Well, to my surprise the product is more gentle on my mature skin and dries with a light rose scent that disappears but is quite pleasing. During a hot, humid summer I have found that the Thayers witch hazel seems not to over dry my skin and leaves it nice and soft with a fresh, clean feeling. It also is not at all irritating and I love the scent. My skin is so balanced now I can wear even L&#x27;Oreal makeup in the summer without feeling that my foundation is going to melt and disappear. Now I can save money with the cheaper makeup and save my Giorgio Armani for times I really want to look special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a witch hazel advocate! I use it for everything, and I love the rose smell!</li>
            <li> I have acne and oily skin, the scent for this product is way too strong, makes my skin very dry, I only used twice and I already gave up, $10 wasted, wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> First time ordering this product. The cap was broken off during shipping, but the seal underneath is still intact. Smell like baby powder. Not sure about the quality, haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Lives up to reviews.  Like it much better than my usual toner I&#x27;ve been using for years.  This IS my new toner.  Love the way my skin feels with this!</li>
            <li> Made my skin ultra soft.  But after I week, I got massive breakouts on my face and chest.  My skin is combination and prone to non-inflamed acne (clogged pores).  I was surprised it broke me out so badly.  It was awesome at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still really like the smell and and am using it up on my legs for extra moisture.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it there, so this was not an allergy.  It&#x27;s just highly comedogenic for me.  Putting toner on my legs just to use it up is kinda ridiculous, though.  I&#x27;ll not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Smells great, clean and fresh. I feel like it&#x27;s help clear up my skin. I don&#x27;t use this every day but sometimes I use it twice a day and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. Caucasian, sensitive skin, occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, I don&#x27;t really like the scent, it smells kind of mature. I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s and it seems to have a powdery scent to it. I actually like Dickenson&#x27;s Witch Hazel better as it feels like it leaves less residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> Does the job just fine and smells great! I love the fact it&#x27;s cheap and will last awhile. I personally mix just a little bit of apple cider vinegar with this to make a skin balancing toner. This doesn&#x27;t dry out skin either.</li>
            <li> This is great for tightening up the face after washing (something men knew about for ages), the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is it feels a bit sticky on the face, but probably that is just the witch hazel, and can&#x27;t be prevented. I still love it.</li>
            <li> I was using regular witch hazel from the drug store, and boy, does this smell soooo much nicer! AND its natural. What more could a girl want?</li>
            <li> The water was clear and transparent at the beginning, but became unclear and milky after a while. I&#x27;m not sure if this is what natural products will turn out to be.</li>
            <li> This makes a wonderful toner. It is harder than you might think to find alcohol-free witch hazel blends so it was refreshing to find this one which works well, smells nice, and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much. I use when my face feels tired, it just brings the color right back. Amazing smell.&lt;br /&gt;Thank  you</li>
            <li> Have been ordering this toner a few times, and going to again - best quality ever, my skin loves it too</li>
            <li> The bottle cap leaks at the bottom from squeezing. For those with allergies, the rose scent is very strong and may irritate.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is the stuff of what I needed as a teen with pretty bad acne. This is an alcohol free version of the witch hazel I used that used to irritated my sensitive skin, leading to more horrifying, teen breakouts. As an adult with mild acne, this product helps keep the breakouts, somewhat, in check. I use it everyday, as it&#x27;s gentle and effective in controlling overproduction of oil. I also, do think it tones my skin quite nicely.</li>
            <li> This is something really natural and gently for my face. It is a great toner, moisturizer and smell good..I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife bought this toner, she said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Body Works&#x27;s Tea Tree Toner which is supposed to help with acne and this Witch Hazel toner works ten times better. This toner will not dry out your face like the Tea Tree toner. I love that the Witch Hazel toner is alchol free and have aloe in it. I notice it helps calm my skin down after I had been using Retin-A and my face is particularly sensitive. I would even say this (along with a good moisturizer) has helped my skin over the last several weeks and contributed to my decrease in breakouts. I hardly even use my Retin-A anymore. This definitely helps control the oil production and balances out my pH.</li>
            <li> I use this toner at least 3 times a week, especially after I finish shaving because it doesn&#x27;t sting my face and seems to help with preventing ingrown facial hair. It has also helped immensely with acne, seeing as I haven&#x27;t really gotten any other than one or two zits every now and then but they disappear pretty quickly. While not a very masculine smell, I actually like the rose-petal scent. It reminds me of a product my mother used to use when I was a child so there&#x27;s some nostalgia involved when using this toner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time using Witch Hazel Toner and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I&#x27;ve used it a handful of times so far as a night routine after cleaning. My face feels fresh, clean, not dry. I haven&#x27;t had a chance to experience any changes, but so far I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, It personally did not strike me as amazing or horrible. Good different toner for those who want a sweet smelling toner for their skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just witch hazel that smells divine. However it costs double the generic witch hazel toner you would find at a pharmacy. It&#x27;s also a lot smaller. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this toner is all that great.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I&#x27;ll use it because I have it but definitely won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> smells good! feel fresh when I use this toner. I love it! I will definitely order this again!!! this is my new favorite!!!</li>
            <li> Love this witch hazel, and i now have my daughter hooked on it too. I am on my third purchase of this same item.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea and have to be careful with the products I use on my skin. I can&#x27;t use any toners with alcohol in them and the ones I have tried that don&#x27;t have alcohol don&#x27;t seem any better than plain water. However, this is amazing. I feel my skin cooling and the scent is so relaxing... makes me happy just to use it! LOL</li>
            <li> Smells divine and works great on sensitive skin! I use it on my face, as well as for after-shave care. I love that this brand is all-natural and that I&#x27;m supporting a local company (they&#x27;re based in CT). It has a distinct, fresh rose smell, so its perfect for all the rose lovers out there. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a toner to pamper sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Cleanses, smells great, moisturizes, and it is organic. Wash face, use this to tone then moisturize. All done. When Im too tired to wash my face I just use LOTS of this on cotton balls and &amp;#34;wash&amp;#34; my face with this.</li>
            <li> I use it in a solution for cloth wipes (I also cloth diaper). This makes the solution smell so good, and it&#x27;s gentle on my little one&#x27;s bum.</li>
            <li> This is lovely. Use it as a toner twice a day (with Swissper pads). Nothing better.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel clean and not dry, smells like roses.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! Bought it because of the reviews and was not disappointed. It makes my skin feel so clean and soft and just overall healthy. Like my skin likes this stuff and eats it up and feels better for it. Best way I can explain it. Definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> This product takes traditional witch hazel to a new level.  The scent!  I am on my 2nd bottle.  I use this (and nothing else) as a facial cleanser and toner.  I DO have good skin and the good advice to all - stay out of the sun and never use soap on your face - use this witch hazel instead - and when you reach my age - you&#x27;ll have good skin too :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 9, 2015 - I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle!  Love this stuff--it&#x27;s all I use to wash my face.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin but this works like a dream on my skin. I wasn&#x27;t using a toner before this. It seems to sooth my skin. I bought it to reduce my pores, and it seems like it did to a minor degree.   I love the smell of this. Some people have written reviews suggesting that it&#x27;s a fragrance that has been added, but it is genuine rose water. The label also tells you that this witch hazel isn&#x27;t distilled. It&#x27;s a purer form of witch hazel and has all the natural tannins.    This really seemed to do something because it doesn&#x27;t stink and have that salty, briny smell that other witch hazels have. If you are very sensitive, this may be the toner you have been looking for!</li>
            <li> I have recently just started using this toner and I&#x27;m blown away! It&#x27;s make my face feel so good and soft without the burning affect of other toners. I&#x27;m really glad I made this purchase!&lt;br /&gt;Update 12/1/15.. Still absolutely love this stuff but have found that I can get it a lot cheaper from the actual Diva Stuff wesite. 😊</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, and non drying formula.  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It came quickly and smells fabulous.  I used it in some hand lotion I made and everyone at my business who tried it loved it and commented on its great fragrance (which I attribute to the Thayers).  Thank you for a great product.  I will always keep it on hand for my home made products.  BRAVO to you!</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the reviews. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I can already see a difference in my skin. My skin tone has evened out and my pores are smaller. I&#x27;ve always heard about using Witch Hazel but never tried it until now. I wished I had picked this up sooner. The rose smell is nice too. Not over powering.</li>
            <li> Love this toner. It is gentle, doesn&#x27;t have an over powering witch hazel smell, and makes my skin feel smooth. It seems pretty hydrating, I sometimes forget to use a moisturizer even. I have seen a huge improvement from where I used to have dry patches on my face, now I notice more even texture. I will defiantly be buying again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome!! Makes my skin so soft. Using this is my favorite part of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Bought this mostly for my husband who has had issues with redness and acne for ever. After about a week of use, twice a day with washing, there has been a noticeable difference. He loves it! I started using and my skin is softer and my pore are no longer as visible. Great investment for the great price!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend wanted this as her older friend uses it and has quite fair complexion.  She loves it. Smells like roses. Works as good refresher and I guess toner.</li>
            <li> Great for calming redness</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used for toning my skin after cleansing. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and leaves it feeling refreshed and moist. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> I have been looking, without success, for an alcohol-free witch hazel - until I came across this product on Amazon. It is delightfully refreshing for the skin. The scent is also lovely, very light and very like real roses, which I grow in abundance. The scent does not linger, so there is no concern about clashing with other fragrances [or attracting bees, if you are a gardener]. This does not irritate my sensitive skin, either, or cause breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a hot day, when your skin feels sticky and clogged up, this is a wonderful way to cool off and give yourself a little treat. I will be buying it again for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it on my face 2-3 times a day to help remove make up dirt and other toxins...as well as other skin irritations...mosquito bites, rashes etc.  My skin is soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This is a witch hazel toner, and works like one. So you get all the advantages of that, but unlike other witch hazel toners, this one smells really really good! I&#x27;ve often found that after a stressful day I come home and I want to use this toner to freshen up my face. I usually hate having to use products, but I really enjoy this toner, and I love using it.</li>
            <li> while this cleans my skin great and freshens me up when I&#x27;ve been all sweaty or dirty. I was hoping this would help with my large pores and oily skin, but It doesn&#x27;t have any real lasting effects that I can see. I have noticed less acne which is always great! you can also use this as an aftershave - i mix it in with 100% aloe vera to make it a better consistency for application it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so light and effective. It doesnt burn my sometimes sensitive skin. It keeps me blemish free and gets any dirt left behind. I love the smell and the refreshing feeling. This is a main staple in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT ! Love it so much so glad I read these reviews and tried it out ! Instant difference in my skin texture and pore size. Pores shrank and my skin was glowing , I love how I wake up with smoother skin after I apply this at night . Best product I have purchased compared to dept store toner/rejuvenating treatments , I am using this on my 13 year olds forehand acne and it is drying it out healing it as well ! It is very gentle on the skin and smells beautiful , but so effective. My skin looks super smooth and healthier ! Try it out worth it. My skin type is combination w some hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 15 yrs old boy with pretty bad acne and this helped my skin looking healthy. It&#x27;s like a miracle in a bottle! It made my skin soft, smooth, clear, and really clean by removing any residue that the cleanser hadn&#x27;t. I do this everday in the morning and night following up with a moisterizer with SPF and then use an acne treatment. If you guys have any chance to purchase this, I highly recommend you to, this is a wonderful toner! :)  I wish you guys the best and most importantly, good luck. :)</li>
            <li> I really love the way this toner smells. My skin feels light and fresh after I use it!</li>
            <li> Very gentle great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Love this to refresh my face during the,day.  Also use to seal my mineral make up.</li>
            <li> Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel has improved the texture of my facial skin in just a few weeks.  One application alone was firming and resulted in an immediate smoothness to the touch.  My pores are now small, fine wrinkles are smoothed, and my entire face is bright and healthy in appearance.  On warm days I reapply the witch hazel often and it is never drying or overly scented; however, I do love the scent of roses!  I have also used the witch hazel for a few insects bites and scratches from my startled cat as he jumped from my lap.  The itching and redness was relieved immediately and my scratch marks are almost gone (no infection or alergic problems probably because of the astringency of witch hazel).&lt;br /&gt;I recommend Thayers Witch Hazel to everyone for its many usages and will continue to re-order and have available for my family and friends and in particular to have available for the visits of my three-year-old granddaughters.  They love the rose water for quick clean hands and the immediate cooling and freshness when it is applied to their faces, back of the neck, arms and legs after a romp in the garden.  It is a special &amp;#34;grandmama treat&amp;#34; and becoming a beloved tradition.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price! I have oily skin so this really helps. Smells great.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of regular lotion. Helps moisturize my skin and leaves it feeling smooth, without any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Finally found an all natural product that cleans, moisturizers, and shrinks pores without making my face shiny or greasy. I can hardly see my pores now. Worked great for me.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toner. I have very sensitive skin and this toner feels like water on the skin. Its very gentle for your face. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> was great. fast shipping</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. She has not complained so if mama&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It made my skin so smooth and soft, and it really does smell so good. Smells like real roses. I have sensitive skin, and this didn&#x27;t irritate it at all. Will totally buy again once I use up my current bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Have purchased over and over again.  I use it after I take my makeup off and after my shower to tone my face.  It is very soothing and has a light natural rose fragrance. It lasts for ages and it&#x27;s free from all those nasty chemicals and is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help my dyshidrosis.  Unfortunately there is no cure for dyshidrosis and witch hazel is an unconfirmed temp remedy.  Does not help at all.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, works great to tone skin!</li>
            <li> I like this toner but it has a strong smell that sometimes is too much. My boyfriend loves it though so I will keep using it!!!</li>
            <li> Better than ex[ected. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a week, but it seems to be working quite well. My skin is very sensitive and acne-prone and I had a few really tiny, expected breakouts for the first few days, but they went away quickly and my skin looks much better. This toner also smells really nice. So far I&#x27;m really liking it! Just beware the first few days if you skin&#x27;s on the temperamental side.</li>
            <li> I love this toner -- it&#x27;s gentle, smells good, and is easy on my sensitive skin.  I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS I use it as a daily facial toner, and the scent is beautiful!</li>
            <li> Gentle cleanser, as good as the expensive toners sold at make-up counters for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I recommonded you this product.It has good price and good feeling.I use it everyday.My face don&#x27;t feel dry any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been all over the place looking for rose water...which works perfectly for my face...good thing this comes with witch hazel.</li>
            <li> smell great. and skill feels great. can use it as mask wiht mask pad. feel very moist after use. especially for sensitive skill</li>
            <li> I use this witch hazel every other morning or for a mid day pick-me-up. Its convenient if i&#x27;m running late in the morning and don&#x27;t have time to wash my face. It is not drying at all! Which is amazing because my face usually is easily dried out by ANYTHING I put on.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I use on my skin, and it works wonders. I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for the world.</li>
            <li> This was in my shopping cart for a while. Even though there isn&#x27;t any alcohol in it, I can only use this every other day or else it&#x27;ll dry me out. i have Asian combination skin. Its totally acne prone at the t-zone and dry cheeks. This toner makes me feel so fresh and clean after cleansing. Shipping was really fast and they were nice enough to pack it in a ziploc-type back in case the bottle leaked. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this toner for my wife and she loves it. Says that it makes her skin smooth, fresh and clean without drying. Will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Makes my face smell awesome! This is a great quality product. Helps my homemade face oils absorbed better and is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been trying any kind of toner. It left me red and dryness but not this Rose water. It treats your skin so nice, soft and smooth. Too bad I found this product just now. My face could have been better big time. LOVE LOVE!! Try it and you wont regret. The price is absolutely cheap but high quality product. I can&#x27;t live without it. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Lovely smell. I normally use a regular witch hazel as an astringent but I&#x27;m not going back. Quick shipping and the product works as advertised. The rose scent is light just enough to make you smile.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Toner for a few years.  After a shower or washing my face, I apply this toner on a cotton pad and rub on my face. And then, I apply facial lotion.</li>
            <li> All the benefits of witch hazel, but it smells much better. I use this on emerging zits and trouble spots, and it&#x27;s lovely without being too drying.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell and feeling</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a big fan of this stuff. My last bottle lasted me almost a year before I ordered my current bottle, and I use it pretty much every day so that&#x27;s a testament to how long a bottle lasts which is great. I only gave it 3 stars though because as soon as I used the last of what I had I cracked open the new bottle I just ordered, and I&#x27;m positive they have changed the formula since I last purchased. Bummer! Why mess with something so amazing? The rose scent is noticeably less, which is not a big deal but it also leaves my skin feeling a little tight now... I always loved this stuff for how dewy and smooth it made my skin feel, but after applying the new batch this morning and yesterday, I noticed my skin has felt tight and not as moisturized afterward. Plus it stings my eyes a little which the last bottle never did. Not sure I will keep buying it, big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. My skin is very sensitive so i&#x27;m afraid to try new things and i&#x27;m glad i did! I noticed a difference right away my complexion ,was brighter and my cheeks where rosy! I hope they never stop making it cause i&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I find this product gentle, alcohol free, yet a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product and love it, but I am a little confused by amazon&#x27;s listing of ingredients, it states that there is methylparaben (a gentle preservative), and I was a little upset by this, because we all know that parabens are not good for us.  I went to grab my bottle to double check, and there is no listing of methylparaben on the label.  Is amazon selling something else, or perhaps an older product?  Or do they have the wrong ingredients listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the product, but confused by the ingredient listing.  I purchased mine from Whole Foods, but was going to order a new bottle from Amazon until I saw the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I dont know what this does but my wife always tries to put it on me. She says it works wonders for after shaves and stuff. I believe her and just let her do her thing. Im just a dummy when it comes to toners lotions and stuff...derp.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I decided to try this when I ran out of my usual plain alcohol-free witch hazel. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the aloe or the roses, but it really irritated my skin. It smells wonderful and made my pores appear smaller, but I also ended up with flushed skin and a face that feels like I have a mild sunburn after two weeks of use. If your skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive, I&#x27;d recommend it, but otherwise you may want to stick to plain witch hazel.</li>
            <li> AFTER USING THIS PRODUCT FOR TWO WEEKS MY FACE WAS SUPER SMOOTH AND CONTINUES TO BE. I LUV THE ROSE SMELL AND BTW...REAL ROSES DO SMELL LIKE THE PRODUCT. PURCHASE A FEW ROSE BUSHES FROM JACKSON AND PERKINS AND TAKE A WHIFF! ANYHOO...GREAT PRODUCT FOR $$$ AND INDICATION.</li>
            <li> After my job got me a free facial, the lady told me some things I should be doing more often, and I was looking for a new skincare regimen, I wanted my skin to feel amazing every day. The one thing she recommended specifically for me was a rose witch hazel toner. She said I was in desperate need of one. I have no idea how her skin-whispering facial skills told her that, but as she left me with amazing, soft skin, I believed her.&lt;br /&gt;(My skin leans toward the oily side, and, as I am 17, it tends to be acne-prone. The facial lady also told me it&#x27;s sensitive, which I never noticed - I&#x27;m usually a fond believer of no-pain-no-gain)&lt;br /&gt;So I went home, and found this gem on Amazon. I poured some on a cotton pad and put it on my face after using my CeraVe cleanser. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I hadn&#x27;t ever used toner. I didn&#x27;t even really know what it was supposed to do exactly. I let it dry into my skin and was amazed. Absolutely astounded. My skin is the softest it has ever been after this stuff sinks into it. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft it was. I couldn&#x27;t believe this little clear liquid that didn&#x27;t sting or burn at all had somehow left my skin this smooth. I don&#x27;t even want to use my moisturizer anymore, this stuff leaves my skin so soft.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sad because I&#x27;m using it day and night, and while only a second or two of pouring on the cotton pad is enough to cover my face, I&#x27;ve already used up about maybe 1/5? of the bottle. I&#x27;m just addicted to this and how it makes my skin feel, and I know I will have to buy more when I run out, which will probably been in another month and a half, max.&lt;br /&gt;This, along with my new Olay Pro-X Brush, CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer, and Yes to Grapefruit Daily Scrub, my skin has never been softer or clearer. I really don&#x27;t have bad skin days anymore, I&#x27;m going out every day without makeup. I rely on this stuff to make my skin soft and happy every day.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best toner I have ever used. I was worried at first about getting the rose scent but it is gentle enough that it is pleasant and not overwhelming. It works great on the skin and has lots of great ingredients. This is a good stable for anyone&#x27;s facial routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using thayers toner for over a year now. I love it! It&#x27;s so affordable and natural. You really get your money&#x27;s worth. I like to move it into a spray bottle so that it&#x27;s easier to apply and no cotton is needed. It&#x27;s light and fragrant-- nothing heavy or pungent. I use it morning and evening after washing and before moisturizing. Great stuff! I&#x27;ll recommend it to any skin type. No alcohol, no irritation. It&#x27;s versatile to any age group and sex. Go for it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol so is non-drying, which is important since I use this product twice a day.  The alcohol-based toners make my face even more oily after initially making it tight and dry.  So I keep going back to this one.  Another good thing about this rose petal toner is that it lasts a long time.  Even using it twice a day, it takes me over 2 months to get through a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past few months and my complexion has improved greatly. I love that it&#x27;s all natural and alcohol-free. The price is affordable and the toner lasts for a few months with constant use. I usually apply the toner to my face, neck, chest and upper back using a cotton swab. I have to say it has also started to help some of blemish marks heal, especially the ones on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers said that this product helped fight acne when used alone, but I haven&#x27;t seen that. In fact, I stopped using my usual acne wash and lotion for a month and I broke out severely. This toner reduces the redness and my face doesn&#x27;t look as blotchy, but alone it did not stop the pimples from forming. Although, I have noticed that my pores are smaller and my skin looks more even than before I started using this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works well on bruises. Normally, my bruises stay for weeks and slowly make that awful transition from dark blue to green to orange to healed, but with this I&#x27;ve noticed that my bruises heal within days with daily application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product to all skin types.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It tones the skin without drying and after 4 weeks of use, I can actually see my pores  getting smaller!!!.  I am very pleased with Thayers Rose Pedal witch hazel and its pleasant mild rose scent. It really makes a difference when you can see results!!</li>
            <li> I think I like it. I am not devoted or in love but sold.</li>
            <li> I got this maybe a month now and I can already see how it is going to become a staple. I never realized how important/great toning is!</li>
            <li> For some reason after reading another review I thought all of these products were alcohol-free, but this one is not.  The rose scent is quite strong. I tried diluting it with tea tree EO but that did not work. I ended up buying the plain version later.</li>
            <li> Love this, my bottle is almost done I need another bottle.</li>
            <li> ~the toner is very moist for the dry skin.It also smells good which makes me feel comfortable. I am very satisfied with it。</li>
            <li> Was using Burt&#x27;s Bees Rose Water Toner but saw this and decided to try it as it is less expensive.  Have found that I like this product better.  Smells good and feels very refreslhing.</li>
            <li> Fake rose smell, it was pleasant. This just wasn&#x27;t the toner for me. Made my face worse with this and Neutragena Oil Free Acne Wash.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from the &amp;#34;Big H&amp;#34; (hemorrhoids) you probably have seen Preparation H bathroom flushable wipes. If you look closely at them all they are are flushable wipes with some Witch Hazel injected into them. I found that it was far cheaper and a much more pleasant experience using your favorite type of flushable wipe and then just spraying on some of this Rose Petal Witch Hazel which has the same astringent qualities and the added bonus of a nice rose aroma. Now is this really a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; thing to do? Well, quite frankly, I just don&#x27;t care, it leaves you feeling clean and the scent is pleasant enough, not over-powering and after a bowel movement who couldn&#x27;t use some &amp;#34;air freshener?&amp;#34; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the skin.!</li>
            <li> Love it.  My skin hasn&#x27;t been as oily since using this product.  A definite recommend.</li>
            <li> It does what a toner is supposed to do. I like it.</li>
            <li> As well as the face, this is nice to use on other areas of the body, neck, hands, arms, shoulders, legs, feet, &amp; after shaving. Nice after a bath. A little goes a long way. I just apply and let it dry. For easier application and to not waste the product I put it in a small plastic travel bottle with an applicator top or a spray bottle, to easily dab or spritz. Apply to clean skin and spread with your clean fingers and hands as you would a lotion. No need for cotton balls or pads unless you are using it for cleaning. Also makes a nice application for a quick light back massage. Love that there is no alcohol, yet it is cooling and refreshing. So far, I have only tried the Rose scented. The fragrance is light and fresh. My husband said he liked the smell and he rarely comments.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where some of these people are getting their information about the ingredients in this product, the list DOES NOT have harmful chemicals or parabens on it. The ingredients are clearly stated on the bottle and have nothing that I can&#x27;t pronounce, stop hating people! People need to stop over analyzing everything and just accept that not every product is going to work for them, don&#x27;t blame the product just try a different one! Anyways I love this brand and product I reccommend</li>
            <li> nice smell, it really takes all the dirt out of my face. it doesnt dry my skin as other toners do. i highly recomend it!</li>
            <li> I am 17 and have sensitive combination skin and this toner has been a great add on to my daily regimen. I use it after washing my face with cetaphil (gentle cleanser), fresher sensitive cleanser, and origins checks and balances, and this stuff is great at getting the forgotten soap particles and minimal makeup residue. The scent is nice and, when applying the toner, my skin feels clean, slightly tingly, but not tight (which is great). I wouldn&#x27;t say it moisturizes my skin to the point where I feel like I don&#x27;t need night cream or day cream, but it&#x27;s the most gentle toner I have used. it&#x27;s no miracle &amp;#34;this is the only thing that has worked&amp;#34; acne healer, but it has definitely minimized my pores. I recommend starting out with using it only at night for the first week so your skin can adapt, then using it twice a day (my skin was slightly irritated when I went overboard). It&#x27;s great right after washing off a mask to clean the missing parts up, it however does leave my skin slightly red (which goes away after 5 min), but overall I am very satisfied. Highly recommend this to anyone! (I even caught my mom using it as she then professed her love for it)</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with sensitive skin or allergies</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s calming and moisturizing and really gets your skin clean.</li>
            <li> This is so lovely!  I use this at the end of makeup removal and it always finds more to remove.  Afterwards, I feel refreshed.  I like the smell too and the fact that this is a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product!</li>
            <li> A long-forgotten facial treatment is witch hazel on a cotton ball to cleanse and refresh the complexion, no matter if oily or dry. Plain witch hazel works well but the rose version is especially lovely. The rose scent may be too intense for some, so add the plain solution to create an acceptable dilution.</li>
            <li> Gentle on sensitive skin and isn&#x27;t stripping at all. Nice smell</li>
            <li> Fastest shipping so far, I&#x27;m a man, don&#x27;t even know why I bought it, but I liked the reviews.&lt;br /&gt; I have face break out problems so trying anything out there at least once. Ladies, men, I don&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;Just using now as directed. i will review it later when I notice noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate</li>
            <li> So excited to finally find Witch Hazel without alcohol.  I hope this seller keeps this product in stock because I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best toners I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have super sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t had much luck with any that I&#x27;ve tried until I tried this!  Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Best toner! Also lavender scent is amazing</li>
            <li> Excellent service, fast shipping!!  So far I have only used this 3 times, and I like it.  Leaves my face feeling soft &amp; feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is gentle on my (admittedly) super sensitive skin that HATES everything.</li>
            <li> Item was just as described, arrived on time and was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Great as a gentle cleanser for the skin.</li>
            <li> The best part of this is that it&#x27;s alcohol-free so my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry once it&#x27;s dried off. Light, soothing and calming on the skin!</li>
            <li> The rose scent is lovely and natural and the hydration is also quite nice.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised</li>
            <li> Love this product. I&#x27;ve also tried the cucumber one available from this brand. Both are great!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and smells great. Can&#x27;t say I regret getting this stuff. I think I&#x27;m sold for life as it has worked as well if not better than any other brand I&#x27;ve used and I love rose scents.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great service</li>
            <li> Pleasant fragrance, and feels soothing on the face.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve used this brand and so far so good. I usually use regular witch hazel to tighten pores and tone face but this has a pleasant scent and seems to make my face smother.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean, no harsh feelings at all, absorbs quickly, it wakes up my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never met this kind of perfect product. smells good and feels so moisturizing after applying this to my skin.</li>
            <li> Okay, I read reviews on this product and decided to try it. From the reviews I&#x27;ve read; people have said the smell is overwhelming, but for me it&#x27;s VERY PLEASANT! The smell doesn&#x27;t linger, it leaves your skin feel moisturized. It does remove any left over makeup that cleansers don&#x27;t get. I feel it does help with your pores, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts. I&#x27;m over 50 and I use this on my neck as well. I honestly can say I don&#x27;t find this product a miracle toner, but I can say I really, really like it. I bought 2 and gave one to my son to use and he&#x27;s 15, I haven&#x27;t seen a dramatic difference on him, but then again he&#x27;s going through that adolescence age and doesn&#x27;t keep up with the routine I&#x27;ve given him. Though, he said his skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after he uses it. I can&#x27;t tell you how it&#x27;ll react on your skin since everyone is different, but if you&#x27;re undecided then try it. For the price you really can&#x27;t beat it...</li>
            <li> I am an Asian (from Taiwan). Back to the days in my country, we always use a toner with a compressed mask. Leave the mask on your face for at least 15 minutes, and your skin will feel refresh and comforting. But not all toner can do this, only those without alcohol or thermal spring water can do that, or your skin may be irritated. I tried many toners, including those from Japan. This one is the best and the cheapest. It helps to soothe my skin, especially when I have some rash or redness because of using wrong skincare products or allergy. It can reduce redness but still moisturizes my skin without stickiness. Also, after applying the mask, I will use some moisturizer. I feel that my face absorb moisturizer very easily. Keep your skin moisturized and away from sun burn are always the best ways to prevent aging apprearance. This is the little trick that we always do back to my country. This is a really amazing product. I have various masks and constantly change my stock. But this one is definitely always on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thayer has lots of toners, but this one is the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin smooth and silky. I use it morning and night after I wash my face and it has significantly improved my skin since the first use. A must have.</li>
            <li> WILL BUY MORE ....I USE IT AFTER SHAVING...</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me. Unfortunately I am allergic to it. After using, my skin was itchy. So I stop using it.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! Incredibly cleansing and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> Changed my acne and rosacia face to soft, clear and supple.  Can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  Buy it you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> We make our own wipes, and this is a must. I have now tried both this one and the lavender, and I like them both. Either one is a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent with no sticky feel left behind at all! That&#x27;s one of the best parts other then the fact my sensitive dramatic skin doesn&#x27;t break out from this stuff. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my skin so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars. Other than that this stuff is good.</li>
            <li> great product, quick delivery, good price. A+</li>
            <li> While witch hazel isn&#x27;t the star of this product, the astringent is very soothing and even somewhat skin-smoothing. While the rose-petal aroma is recognizable, it is not overwhelming or cloying. This product works better than many of the high-end department store toners. Certainly worth trying once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different versions of Thayer&#x27;s after shave toner, and this particular mixture with rose petal/aloe vera is quite nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are ALL a great product, I just like to change out for a different style occasionally.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.  I make my own baby wipes and use this as the cleaning solution.  The smell is heavenly and sort of reminds me of that baby head smell.  Its also a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great as a toner. Very subtle rose scent is uplifting.  Didn&#x27;t do rigorous research on the price of witch hazel - I thought it was a little pricey - but I bought it anyway. I bought it for the packaging. The bottle doesn&#x27;t scream &#x27;&#x27;hide me under the sink&amp;#34; if left on the counter.</li>
            <li> I started using this Witch Hazel about a month ago and I do notice a difference in my skin tone - smoother and more moist. It has a wonderful rose scent and contains zero alcohol - unlike the Witch Hazel you can buy locally at the drug store.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 years now, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;suggestion: the bottle is quite large, so what I do is pour some of this product into a smaller container for daily use, and keep the remainder refrigerated.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have very sensitive combination skin and took a chance trying it but am very glad I did! Works and feels great!</li>
            <li> I originally use regular Witch Hazel for my toner but found it very drying. I have very dry and sensitive skin and needed something a bit more moisturizing. I use this twice a day and my skin has not been dried out or irritated by it. I have been using it for over a month now and have notice improvement with any acne scars or any breakouts trying to pop up. I do have cystic acne caused by hormones, and while those can not always be prevented, instead of taking weeks to heal, they now heal in about a week, The rose scent does not bother me. I only notice it when I&#x27;m applying it. I do not notice it after that. The scent is actually much better than Witch Hazel and I prefer this scent.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely happy and this is now a staple in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> Great great great toner by far the best ive used I have hard water in texas and it works great dont breal out as much. Use this as a toner and grapeseed oil as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my oily skin and acne, did not work on me made me breakout even more, not sure if this is what happens at the beginning before actually improving but will not use again!</li>
            <li> Favorite and great value</li>
            <li> Great product and smells great. If you love the scent of roses you&#x27;ll love this. True to the rose scent and strong.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! I recently tried the lavender but the rose is my favorite! I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s back in stock. It arrived very fast with no leakage or spilling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year and absolutely love it. My face doesn&#x27;t feel truly fresh after washing face until I use this. I use it 2 - 3 times a day and its not drying at all. The scent is wonderful too!  Great seller - item packaged well and factory sealed.</li>
            <li> Gentle, good price, does cleanse. For me it doesn&#x27;t do anything that another toner has not done before... but the natural ingredients were the selling point for me. I have a lot of pink in my skin and although Im not sure if it takes some pink away, it definitely doesnt make it more pink which some stronger toners do.</li>
            <li> I am new into witch hazel. I am been using it for about 3 weeks, and I like it because unlike my alcohol-free Neutrogena toner, this one doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. I could easily go without  any other product after this,because this one gives me a little bit of moisture. I  wash my face, then clean it with this product until the cotton ball comes clean, and then apply my night cream. Each morning if I don&#x27;t take a shower then I just clean my face again and apply my anti-wrinkle cream with spf. I highly recommend this toner, the rose smell is not that strong and at this price you won&#x27;t get anything better.This 12fl. oz. I estimate would last at least 5 months.</li>
            <li> I used this nightly with a swissper cotton pad to take off my make up before I apply moisturizer. I feel so refreshed after I used this and it&#x27;s so easy since no water is required!</li>
            <li> Smells great but extremely drying. I really wanted to love this. The cucumber version doesnt smell as good, but it is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have used this before in the past and loved it so much that I got some for my mother. I recently purchased some again and I am glad that I did. It is not harsh at all on your skin, and the rose makes it smell amazing. I use this every day! I also have a fine misting bottle that I mix half w/this toner, and half water and I use it as a setting spray for my makeup, brilliant! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I loved this product, I use it one my body.  My face skin is really sensitive so it may tend to make me break out.  That&#x27;s my issue, but it is great as a moisturizer everywhere else.  For others probably everywhere</li>
            <li> I have now divorced Lancome, Clinique and every other high priced skin toner.  I simply use a neutrogena soap for oily skin and this witch hazel and my skin looks the best it has in my life!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. :(&lt;br /&gt;It smelled nice but irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great alcohol-free astringent with a subtle, rosy scent. Fast delivery, product was great, good seller!</li>
            <li> Good quality product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love this product - use it morning and evening</li>
            <li> Nice sent but did not help with my break outs. It feels nice and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Amazon for my combination skin problems. I have tried several other toners such as Weleda, &amp; Michael Todd True Organics. I gave it 2 weeks to see if it could help me. This is the first toner that I have used and surprisingly it helps to prevent  breakouts!! I use it morning and night and it also reduces dryness &amp; redness. Only drawback for me would be that its not in a glass bottle. Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Feels refreshing. Could be a placebo effect but even if so, I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice, gentle product. though I have only used it several time...it only just arrived few days ago...it seems quite calming to my super sensitive, prone to redness skin.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t clear up any of my skin issues. I still had really clogged pores while using this daily. The full chemical toners work much better unfortunately.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this toner. The scent is light and refreshing. It has a nice cooling affect. Even after removing my makeup, this will pull dirt from my face I didn&#x27;t know was there, which has exceptionally improved the condition of my skin. It&#x27;s much softer and cleaner looking and feeling.</li>
            <li> Used this on a really bad sunburn. It helped with healing. Also using it weekly now for facial skin toning. Bonus: it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Busy with my second bottle and cannot think of a reason to switch to another product. The toner is really soothing and I also use it on skin burns and abrasions.</li>
            <li> I would give this a thousand stars. I use this product DAILY. Most toners make my skin feel dry and ashy, but this is a completely different product. It smells wonderful, makes my skin feel totally amazing, and best of all, I can soak a bunch of cotton balls with it and keep them in a little bag with me to refresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I love witch hazel, and having it scented with rose is just heavenly.  Love, love, love it.  Nice clean rose scent without being over-powering.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great so far. Smells like roses!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I am able to use a Toner that does not destroy my skin. After the very first use my skin felt not only clean but moisturized. The pleasant Rose scent is a plus. I have never been able to use anything with the Rose scent previously as it was always too powerful, this is just a hint of Rose. So at the age of 57 I finally have a Toner that actually works !!!</li>
            <li> I used to purchase the Burt&#x27;s Bees rosewater toner, but it is becoming harder and harder to find in stores, so I switched to this after reading Amazon reviews. The first thing I noticed is how much you get for your money- it&#x27;s easily twice the size of the BB version, and essentially the same ingredients! The packaging is just a plastic bottle, which looks rather &#x27;cheap&#x27; on my vanity, so I actually pour it into a spritzer bottle, and I spritz it onto my face, neck, and body after washing. I used to use cotton squares to spread it on my face, but I found it wasteful of both the toner and the cotton. The spray option is so much more refreshing and feels gentler on my skin than smearing this unevenly on my face.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is divine- its a light rose smell without being perfume-y or overpowering. I&#x27;ve even caught my boyfriend spraying this on his face after shaving because it feels so cool and refreshing- without the harsh drying or stinging of alcohol-based toners.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product - and a little goes a looooong way! You can also use witch hazel for hemorrhoids, so if that ever happens, I guess I&#x27;m also prepared with 3/4 of this bottle still in my cabinet!</li>
            <li> as pet groomer, I always come home to use this stuff! It cleans so well, I LOVE IT!! Hands down the best without drying your face.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! Makes my skin super soft</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter she loves how it works and smells</li>
            <li> Toner is very important as a part of your daily regimen! Alcohol free is also very important. This is a simple and cost effective option</li>
            <li> Love the light scent and soothes skin so well.  Have decided compliments on my &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; skin since using this, so I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love the way this product makes my skin feel and smell. It&#x27;s really refreshing. I use it at night and in the morning before putting on any makeup.</li>
            <li> Works great. No burning or drying ok skin. It really tones everything up.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  Love the smell, great toner after cleaning face after a day of dirt!</li>
            <li> Love the feel and fragrance of this product. Use it several times a day.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the very best toner on the market!</li>
            <li> This stuff has given my skin a glow i never thought possible. Male here but I love the smell and its feels incredibly refreshing. I also notice my pores visibly smaller. I have only been using the product for about 5-6 days. I can not wait to see what else it does for me. Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> Love this toner, it&#x27;s so soothing and great for my skin...</li>
            <li> love the smell, much like roses, and works well enough.</li>
            <li> First time I ever used witch hazel that is alcohol free. I purchased it to use as a treatment for spider veins around my ankles because I read it will greatly improve those. I don&#x27;t know if it works for that yet because I just got it, but it made my face feel wonderful when I used it after washing. I also used it on a rash I have behind one ear from oxygen hose, and it appears to have done that a world of good with just one application. I&#x27;m thinking this is going to become a staple in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> I really loved the smell and it&#x27;s helping my skin get healthier little by little</li>
            <li> Great for hot summer months when you don&#x27;t wanna be continually going through whole facial wash routine but need a quick refresher.</li>
            <li> I was a little taken aback by the strong smell but it&#x27;s a pretty nice toner so far. My main concern was that it would dry or crack my skin but it makes it softer and helps with complexion.</li>
            <li> Great product to use as toner. I also use it to make my own mask, quick and easy.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering the product. It&#x27;s a perfect natural cleanser for my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of witch hazel, and natural skincare in general. This is a product I keep finding myself going back to time and time again. It&#x27;s alcohol free which is great for my sensitive skin, and the rose petal makes it smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Works and smells good. My pores have diminished a little .. so far so good</li>
            <li> Highly recommend! Love this natural product!</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! I cannot say enough about this product. It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, feels smooth after application and it smells nice, but natural. Clears away makeup residue very well!! Would buy again!!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this toner, I LOVE it!  I have been using the same skin care routine for years now and this is an essential part of that.  Prior to using thayers, I would try all different facial cleansers, toners, moisturizer, serums, creams, etc and never be happy with my skin.  Now I can&#x27;t imagine trying anything else because this works so well.  I wash my face with Dr. Bronners Almond soap and follow with this toner.  I don&#x27;t even use a cotton ball; after my face has been washed and dried, I squirt about 1/2 of a teaspoon of toner into my palm, rub hands together and apply to my entire face and neck.  This gives my face just enough moisture that I no longer need moisturizer or lotion.  I cannot say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> Previously, (years ago) I used this wonderful product and ran out of it. How easily do we forget! This is a great astringent and helps rejuvenate the skin quickly! Had a couple of blemishes and in a few days it was almost unnoticeable! (No joke!) Also, using this for back acne and I am glad to report it is working! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I was a little put off by the smell at first (reminds me of elderly women) but got used to it quick. Makes my skin sooo soft and lasts a long time. Will definitely repurchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews and I am now in love! I have combination skin and I usually only breakout during that time of the month. I was always using salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide pimple creams at night (sex killer! lol) and my face used to have red areas even blemish spots (face picker).After using this every night my face is red-free and blemish spots are not as noticeable. It smells nice like natural roses and leaves my face soft and clean. I&#x27;ve only been using it like a month but noticed the different the first week. Just try it and see!</li>
            <li> This product may be wonderful-- but I will never know. Maybe I should have known that rose petal is your typical old lady scent, but somehow I didn&#x27;t. No matter how much I scrubbed, I couldn&#x27;t get the lingering essence of grandma off my skin. If you want that kind of smell, great-- if you don&#x27;t, go for another scent. Wish I had gone with the unscented.</li>
            <li> smells amazing. works great. very moisturizing but does not make skin oily. i have very very oily skin and i still get the right amount of moisture from this.</li>
            <li> My skin is as smooth a a baby&#x27;s bottom now! I put this on at least twice a day and my skin feels instantly refreshed! It smells just lovely, and I noticed that my skin doesn&#x27;t break out as much ( I have combination skin). It is a big bottle, and a little goes a long way! I&#x27;ve had this for a month now and I still have a ton left. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this given the fact I couldn&#x27;t really see much real benefits to it, but boy am I glad I did! I use this almost every time finish washing or cleansing my face. It is a fantastic moisturizer! I normally don&#x27;t like using creme or gel based moisturizers because my skin is a bit sensitive so this is a life savor. Also, it keeps my face nice and soft during this cold winter times in NY. I am not sure if it helps with acne since I don&#x27;t normally break out, but I do get my occasional zits, however after I started using this in my skin routine I notices a dramatic difference in the amount of sudden break outs I get. It really does help keep a flawless look!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this toner for very long (~1 week)  but it&#x27;s super gentle--perfect for sensitive skin. It&#x27;s alcohol free which is great for my skin--alcohol tends to be very rough on my skin and causes my skin to turn red afterwards. I have acne prone skin and I would recommend this product. My usual routine includes washing my face with Cetaphil, applying Aztec Secret Indian Clay mask, Thayers Witch Hazel toner, and Age Defying Skin Clearing vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m hoping as I continue with this routine, my acne will be eradicated!</li>
            <li> Great seller great product. Fast shipping exactly as promised.</li>
            <li> This Thayer facial toner is all natural and absolutely fantastic for my sensitive skin! Will continue to use now that I have discovered it!</li>
            <li> I always operated under the assumption that alcohol and astringent could tackle my acne. I have blackheads, zits, and cystic acne. I also get little white heads and &amp;#34;blood-blister&amp;#34; zits. This toner actually gave me better results than regular &amp;#34;blue&amp;#34; toners or astringents, and it smells better too. Instead of making my face look redder, it doesn&#x27;t appear to irritate my skin in the name of &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; at all, and makes my face soft and happy. Good for me, as an acne sufferer, on days where my skin is getting by and doesn&#x27;t need to be punished with drying chemicals or creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a cotton ball and squeeze a good amount into the cotton, swab until the surface of the cottage is no longer brown. And you&#x27;re set for a few hours of protected and smooth skin.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, thanks for sending it so fast. Delighted.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product religiously. However, when the place I used to go to stopped carry it I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else. But I figured I&#x27;d look for it on Amazon. The shipping was fast. Would definitely recommend the seller. I mainly use this product after I wake up in the morning because it&#x27;s keep my skin from being overly dry. Great product throughout the year! I highly recommend the Thayer toners! Best Witch Hazel toner that I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Will keep using it forever, as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> Ever since purchasing this product I am happy to declare that not only have I not encountered any witches, I also have not heard that one-hit-wonder band from the 90&#x27;s, Sister Hazel. Works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Smells awesome &amp; is amazing on your skin.:-)I also love mixing it with massage oil for backrubs!;-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever received compliments on my skin before using this. I use it to remove my makeup before bed with a cotton round and occasionally before applying makeup in the morning. Not only does it prevent and help heal breakouts, it gives skin a nice healthy glow and smoother texture. It also smells great and feels very refreshing. One 12 ounce bottle lasts me 2-3 months. I&#x27;m on my third bottle.</li>
            <li> Suited my normal skin just fine. Not sure about other seasons but &#x27;tis par for the humid summer in my urban area. Rose scent dissipates if you&#x27;re sensitive to floral fragrances. I change toners and other skincare products often (good for the skin) so this will be part of my rotation. This toner will last a while.</li>
            <li> Has a nice soft rose smell.</li>
            <li> Familiar with the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my face feeling moisturized and clean!</li>
            <li> So far so good! Non-irritating and refreshing! Skin already showing signs of improvement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff morning and night for many years and believe it&#x27;s why my skin stays almost perfectly free of blemishes and breakouts. It&#x27;s all-natural and therefore contains none of those nasty chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce and is also alcohol free (alcohol can be drying). I like the soft light smell that quickly disappears. The only toner I will ever use!</li>
            <li> This toner has been great! I&#x27;ve used it for about a week now, 2-3 times a day, and I&#x27;ve noticed less blemishes on my skin. And my skin has been staying well moisturized. I can see the dirt it removes even after washing my face with a good cleanser. I&#x27;m very happy and look forward to trying the lavender version next.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I use it every morning on my very sensitive skin.  My complexion seems to be clearer and my skin not as dry.</li>
            <li> So much more effective than other toners with harsh chemicals! I have oily skin and this stuff is great throughout the day! Feels fresh every time!</li>
            <li> After reading reviews searching for a toner, I purchased Thayer&#x27;s rose petal witch hazel. I&#x27;ve used regular which hazel but it wasn&#x27;t a good quality brand and the smell was horrid. This stuff smells really nice. It&#x27;s floral smelling but not overwhelmingly so and I am sensitive to smells. The smell also fades as it dries. In 5 days use my skin is tighter looks younger and is also getting much clearer. Win, wi all around.</li>
            <li> This is so great on my skin, and it got here exactly on time. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Very pleasant. Use it before i go to sleep to remove dirt and excess skin. I have pretty bad eczema and inflammation especially around my nose and t tone. This product causes little to no irritation and I feel is really helping my skin while reducing breakouts.</li>
            <li> Put it in a sprayer and spray on before bed :)</li>
            <li> Not only does this toner remove excess oil, makeup and other impurities from your skin, but it also does the job without the added alcohol content. I didn&#x27;t realize that the original Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel contained alcohol until I read the label on this product. It clearly states that it is &amp;#34;alcohol free&amp;#34;. I immediately grabbed my other bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner that I spent barely $4 on at the local Target store and sure enough, there is a slight alcohol content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, price matters here when you compare this brand to others that can be up to $3-$4 cheaper. However, when you feel the difference on your skin, you will realize exactly what I did---that it&#x27;s worth it to spend a few extra dollars.  I use this product up to twice daily, and immediately felt a difference with how my skin feels. I have a very combination/oily skin type and this is the only product that I can use as needed without a fear of drying out my skin. It also feels more soothing than the competitor that contains alcohol, and balance my skin tone. I didn&#x27;t expect those two bonuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, I&#x27;ve had a brown spot that developed during my pregnancy. I spend a lot of money on creams that promised to help lessen or eliminate its appearance, but nothing worked at all. After using this product for a few months, I took a look at my skin prior to applying makeup and realized that the brown spot was gone. Well, there&#x27;s my solution!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this product throughout the day without worry of over drying my skin, and it feels soothing. It&#x27;s worth the extra money because of all the benefits. One bottle typically lasts me a month, and that&#x27;s with using it 2-3 times per day to control shine and clogged pores. It also effortlessly removes makeup. I&#x27;ll be back in a month to purchase more.</li>
            <li> smells so amazing and has helped to reduce my large pores, I put it on before my makeup, do feel that it is a very good wrinkle calming solution.</li>
            <li> The lavendar witch hazel is so much better.  The rose smell made me sick after the second use and I didn&#x27;t see the results I had when using the Thayer witch hazel-lavendar.</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel for everything from sun burns to mosquito bites and nothing you buy will work better. My daughter gets huge extremely itchy mosquito bites and I tried calamine lotion, anti itch cream, aspirin, everything. Finally I fell back on the old standard, witch hazel and it worked beautifully. I squirt some on a cotton ball and rub it on the itch for about 10 seconds. If the itch comes back, which it probably will in a few seconds, I rub it again and that usually does the trick. I keep the cotton ball next to her bed just in case but usually there is no need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great this about this witch hazel is that it smells beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can of course buy the much cheaper kind at the drugstore but I like this for the lovely rose smell. Especially nice when I use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this so I could mix with non coated aspirin, and alcohol to make a homemade version of tends skin. I haven&#x27;t mix it yet because I love it just the way it is. It makes a great aftershave, and feels really good on you skin. The smell is also really amazing, I mean I love the smell of this stuff. I don&#x27;t usually review products, but this one really impressed me, thanks Thayers!</li>
            <li> First, I went to Thayer&#x27;s website &amp; found their price for this product is same/similar to Amazon but with Amazon when my purchases reaches their criteria I get Free Shipping. That was a + for Amazon :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, when my Thayer- Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal arrived I tried it immediately ............. I am in Love ! If you love roses as I do ... you will love this toner ! The fragrance is not overwhelming .... but just perfect !&lt;br /&gt;I do not work for this company &amp; I have never given such high praise for anything I bought as Amazon. This product is truly wonderful. Its feels wonderful on the skin &amp; the fragrance is heavenly. I definitely recommend this !</li>
            <li> For a person who has oily skin, it made sense to me that I use a product that would help strip away that excessive oil and so for awhile, I used a toner that had alcohol in it.  BAD DECISION!  Because I stripped away my natural oil, my skin only produced more to make up for it.  This toner is not only alcohol free but has vitamin E as well.  I like it!  Leaves me feeling clean and refreshed - not dry.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so am really cautious about the products I put on it. This toner is great-- gentle, and smells heavenly bc of the rose petal water... Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Works well for any skin. There&#x27;s no need to ever buy a chemically produced astringent when you can have all natural ingredients that essentially produce better results.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and feel of this toner. It has a very nice rose scent and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so good and I am pretty sure it is because of this that my acne has gotten better! Will not go without this. Just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunately it&#x27;s not always sold in every store. Thankfully i can get it from Amazon! It smells good and is not a harsh product. I plan to try the lavendar one when i&#x27;m done with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I use with hazel for anything, I use this mostly as a toner (morning &amp; night). It makes my face not only smell good but it feels so soft and nourished. I have combo dry skin and oily T zone, this has helped my skin a lot. Highly recommended and its alcohol-free</li>
            <li> I love this product ( rose scented ), it leaves my skin so soft. Delivery was quick and prompt.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ve only used this for 2 nights now, but it&#x27;s definitely not breaking me out. Just for that it gets 3 stars. I have super sensitive skin, and anything with fragrance, alcohol, chemical coloring, mineral oil, etc. will break me out, but this stuff makes my skin soft and smooth and I do feel like it actually does clean out my pores while moisturizing. I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be able to effectively clean out the soap residue like other strong astringent toners I&#x27;ve used before, but it seems to perform just as well. It also smells pleasant! I usually hate the scent of roses! So that&#x27;s saying something. I plan to update this review when I&#x27;m finished with this bottle. It&#x27;s only ten dollars which is huge plus. To all those who think it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s really not. I&#x27;m a skincare junkie that&#x27;s used high-end brands from USA/Korea/Japan and I can tell you that this stuff is well worth it for the amount that you get.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my normal toner was running out, and I saw this on amazon with good reviews. So I bought this and I absolutely love it! It makes my pores look smaller. I have dry skin so it makes my dry patches go away little by little, and the aloe vera helps heal my zits! When I first put it on I swear that the scent was pickle-like. Once you smell it a little more it does smell like roses. That MAYBE the only down side, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I will keep buying this.</li>
            <li> Love it! Love the smell, love the feel, love the moisturizing! It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve tried so far. STAY AWAY FROM THE CUCUMBER! It&#x27;s murder on your nose. This one is great! And shipping was pretty good, no leaking or damage.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, but so far, I&#x27;m really loving it.  Before using this toner, I wash my face with a cr&amp;egrave;me cleanser.  Then, I apply the product with a cotton round.  Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel Toner is gentle, and I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference in my pore size.  I really like that this product is alcohol-free, and that it does not dry out your skin or irritate your eyes.  I also like that the rose petal scent is not overbearing.  I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Prompt service on this order. Product was very nice and as described. Smells light and refreshing...strong fragrances bother me but this doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I use it after my clarisonic cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find a more natural and organic skin care routine. I have combination skin that can be a bit sensitive. I also have an uneven skin tone.For awhile now I have been using this routine:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr Woods Black Soap with shea butter as a facial cleanser and body wash&lt;br /&gt;Witch Hazel for a facial toner&lt;br /&gt;Burts Bees Radiance Day Cream as a daytime moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil for a night time moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use an Aztec Clay Mask once a week for a deep clean.&lt;br /&gt;Coconut Oil for an overall body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;And I use a Konjac Sponge for a more natural version of a loofah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so far really loving this routine. And to be perfectly honest, the only reason I am using a separate moisturizer for daytime and nighttime is I already owned he Burts Bees Day Cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The Black Soap is a castile soap. I find it makes my skin very clean and surprisingly soft. The smell is okay. It smells like...well, soap. It does not smell like you are in a field of flowers or surrounded by mangoes like most beauty products do, but I am okay with that. I do not find the smell bad at all, just different then what I am used to from more normal products. It can also be used to wash your hair, but I have yet to try that. I have however tried it as a cleaner while doing the dishes and I found it worked well as a household cleaner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love witch hazel. It is a great toner. It feels refreshing and exactly like any other toner I have ever used. But it is better as I feel a sense of joy everytime I use it as I know I am not putting any weird harsh chemicals on my skin when using it. If you don’t use toners, I highly recommend it. There are plenty of websites out there that show all the benefits of using a toner between a cleanser and a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burts Bees Day Cream. I love the smell, it is in a cute little bottle, and my skin feels ready to tackle the day after using it. I am a big fan of most of the Burts Bees products so it makes sense that I like this too. I will however attempt to just use rosehip oil as a moisturizer once this cream is gone, simply because it would be more simplistic to just have 1 and it will save me some money. If that doesn’t work, I will gladly reorder this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosehip Oil is my new love when it comes to beauty products. It has recently gained popularity when model Miranda Kerr admitted to using it nightly on her skin. The smell isn’t good or bad. Meaning that it doesn’t smell wonderful like a perfume, but the smell isn’t bad and take away from the awesomeness of this product. If you don’t like the smell of it, don’t worry. It absorbs very quickly into your skin and the smell goes away once it does. It makes my skin so SMOOTH! And as I said, it absorbs very quickly which I love. I only use around 2-3 drops a night to cover my whole face. SO it will last quite awhile. I also love all the benefits it has. Again, there are plenty of websites out there that preach the amazing reasons to use this essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sure by now we all know the lovely product that is coconut oil. It makes a fantastic lotion. My skin has never been more smooth in my life. The only downside in my opinion is it does not absorb quite as fast into my skin as the rosehip oil does. So I usually put this on first and let it start to work and then do the rest of my routine( hair, brush teeth, face, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Aztec Clay Mask is such a simplistic face mask, yet it works better than any I have every used. It is especially useful for people who struggle with acne. I simply mix it with some Apple Cider Vinegar and put it on. I think go do a few chores like the dishes or starting laundry. I wash it off in the shower. Some don’t prefer to do this, but I haven’t had any problems doing so and I prefer to do it this way as it makes less of a mess in my opinion. I strongly encourage you all to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Konjac Sponges are a newaddition to my routine. They are made from a plant root and another natural ingredient. They are expected to last around 3 months. Even longer if you take better care of them. They are so soft! And I can already tell it helps make my skin more smooth. I find them to definitely be a positive addition to my skincare routine and will be buying more. I use the pink clay facial sponge for my face cleaning. The pink clay helps with dry skin and uneven skin tone. There are a lot of varieties of different ingredients added to the sponges, so I am sure you can find one that works best for your skin. I then use the red clay body sponge for the same reasons. I have really dry skin and these help. I also feel a bit indulgent every time I use them because of how soft they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this has helped if you are like me and looking to lessen the amount of chemicals you put on your skin. Next I plan to try and make a more natural hair care routine, and then find natural alternatives for deodorant and toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I got the shipment in time - however the top cap was broken. The bottle was still sealed, but I can&#x27;t use the bottle without taking the cap off. Still a good product, just broken on arrival.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best toner I have ever used. It does not dry out your skin, it is very gentle. I will definitely repurchase. The bottle lasts a long time too!!!</li>
            <li> we use it everyday in our salon, we love it , our costumers love them, overall, good value for your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good. The scent of this product is very gentle and made me comfortable.</li>
            <li> Love this, smells great and is perfect to use before reading a book, magazine or do anything where you don&#x27;t want to leave oily fingerprints or marks.  My husband has very dry skin but refuses to use moisturizers because he doesn&#x27;t like the greasy feel.  This he&#x27;ll use.  If you have really dry skin, this won&#x27;t do but I love it because sometimes I need &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; hands; the moisturizer will just ruin things.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Thayers Witch Hazel are the BEST toners I have tried which is why I haven&#x27;t let it go! I have oily skin mostly in my T-zone. I research everything before use/purchase and during use. I went on a hunt to find the best toner for oily skin and decided to purchase this back in June 2013. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It give me an instant clean feel and I noticed a control of oil on my face. I do user other products and have changed on other products which of course may effect my skin. However i used this day &amp; night and when I went without using it 2x a day I noticed a difference in my face. So i use 2-3x a day non-stop. I stock up right before i run out! Which I just checked my purchase history and it looks like i purchase every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for oily skin!</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleanses and softens my skin! So gentle and has a light  wonderful scent. I have noticed the texture of my skin change since I&#x27;ve been using this product. I will most definitely being purchasing more. You wont be sorry</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for making postpartum relief &amp;#34;padsicles.&amp;#34; Just put some aloe Vera gel on a pad then some alcohol free witch hazel and freeze until you come home from after delivery.</li>
            <li> With this Rose Petal Witch Hazel, get all the skin soothing, astringent power of regular witch hazel without that funky smell. Thayers is always a great choice for witch hazel, but I am completely in love with the light rose scent of this product. It is my standard post-washing face astringent, and I keep a little in a spray bottle for any troubled skin or sunburns. In fact, I even spritzed a little on my neck when out of perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside: the bottle leaks on airplanes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It cleans and re-freshens! It is not harsh on your face or skin and smells nice also!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel for three days and it makes my skin really soft and even. I have sensitive skin with combination of oily and dry on certain areas on my face. My nose gets really oily yet my cheeks get really dry and flaky. When I got this product I read the description and I knew right away this is going to work! I have been reading comments about how the smell is grandma-like and too strong but I smelled this scent before and it&#x27;s not horrible as some say. It moisterized my face instantly and calmed my skin after I clean my face with my battery operated facial brush. I could still smell a hint of rose a couple hours later but I like the smell. It&#x27;s too soon to say what changes it has made with my acne yet I already give this 5 stars. I trust all the great comments it has been given and the product itself.</li>
            <li> I really love this toner - it leaves my skin feeling refreshed, smooth, clean, and slightly moisturized. I would not recommend using it throughout the day as a \\&quot;touch-up\\&quot; as the product recommends unless you have very oily skin - but I do use it once in the morning and once at night and have definitely seen an improvement in the softness of my face and oil control. I like the scent of the product, although it might not be universally liked. (It smells like roses, but slightly \\&quot;synthetic\\&quot; smelling.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may take your skin a few days to adjust to this - particularly if you currently do not use a toner. The first time I used it my skin felt a bit odd afterwards - and I thought, \\&quot;oh no, I&#x27;ve wasted money, etc.\\&quot; But after 2 days my skin loved it.</li>
            <li> theres no alcohol in this so it has a different feeling from other toners - you do need to use more liquid to cover your face compared to alcohol based cleaners - but that is not a show stopper.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I have used witch hazel before from my local store and it was not pleasant smelling, but I knew the benefits of witch hazel.  I LOVE the smell of this, and how gentle it is on my sensitive skin.  I would recommend it to everyone!  It is now a part of my daily regimen.</li>
            <li> Dried my skin out very badly.</li>
            <li> The bottle that I bought recently in a store was paraben free.  The bottles available through Thayers website have different ingredients listed too.  I&#x27;m not sure how old these bottle are but there&#x27;s a better formula out there.</li>
            <li> I am an admitted product junkie, but it&#x27;s back to basics with this stuff because it works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever tried. I picked up a bottle in my local health food store and a mere week later was astonished and very happy with the results. My face is softer and my extremely oily skin has become much less so. This product smells nice, is not at all harsh or drying, and is just the perfect toner after washing your face. I also wash my makeup brushes with it.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this toner because I heard so much about witch hazel and rose petals. Besides the great smell, this toner does moisturize and cleanse. I haven&#x27;t experienced it helping with shrinking the pores yet but I have confidence in time it will.</li>
            <li> Best facial cleanser and toner. My skin has never looked better!</li>
            <li> I ended up getting this to help improve my skin, to clear it up and brighten it. This totally does that I use it about every other day or if I have eaten something oily to get the oil off my skin. I wash my face, dry it, use the toner, and put a moisturizer on after. So far I haven&#x27;t broken out since I have been using it and my face is softer to the touch and visually. I love this stuff so much that I got it for my 17 year old little sister and she says it almost eliminates makeup residue (theater makeup) and her acne has improved and she has only been using it for like two weeks. Highly Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I got this on02/21/2012. Removed the seal on the cap,the inner seal as well, then twist the cap back the normal way. I was disappointed to find out it leaks! Such an inconvenience!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay stuff. I actually do like the smell a lot. I usually just put a bit on my face after I wash it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I purchased it to make &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; for postpartum recovery since it&#x27;s alcohol free. There was quite a but left do I began using it on my face morning and night and my skin truly has never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li> love it for drier seasons</li>
            <li> just started using it, got a bigger bottle than I expected which was a nice surprise. Feels different from drug store which hazel, not as watery and a nicer smell. I haven&#x27;t noticed a HUGE difference in my skin yet, it&#x27;s only bee a few days since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The only toner I use. After cleansing I use this prior to my other facial products. Been around for years so something must be right! Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I really like this product and was very happy to find it here. One thing that bugs me is they&#x27;ve put an ugly barcode across the front of the pretty label and you can&#x27;t peel it off. I wish it was on the back or the bottom. Part of the joy of this besides the refreshing feeling and pretty skin you get from it is the pretty packaging you can leave out on the counter. Not with this bottle though.</li>
            <li> I use this on my body after a bath, and not greasy absorbs into my skin and it really smells like a pretty rose...</li>
            <li> Nice. No strong scent.  Like that it is alcohol-free.  Leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use it to clean my face at night. It never leaves it feeling tight or dry.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. It makes my skin tender and hydrated. I like thayers unscented toner. The price is also a huge advantage.</li>
            <li> Calms my skin down. I find it to be moisturizing in a way. Smells great and feels good overall. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see if it really helps fight acne which I have a bit of</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It took me a year to get through the first bottle, and I&#x27;ve already repurchased the second. It&#x27;s just a great step after cleansing and before moisturizing. Very refreshing and soothes my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> So many uses for witch hazel and this product has a great smell. Used for post-pardum padsicles. More recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and I have noticed since using this it&#x27;s less oily during the day. Leaves you feeling clean but not dry!love it</li>
            <li> I really like this toner for my facial skin care regimen. I apply with a small cotton ball after washing and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;It is totally different from any toner I&#x27;ve used before in that it is very, very gentle and moisturizing. I love the way it makes my skin feel and smell. The smell is a distinctive rose water smell, but not as strong as plain rose water. I believe it is improving the overall condition of my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Has a light and pleasant rose scent that is not overpowering.  Helps with keeping my skin moisturized and also helped me control the sudden adult acne breakouts that I suddenly started to experience a few months ago.  Worth buying, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Love this! Great seller...reliable, fast, quality product.  Will absolutely purchase again. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product so I&#x27;m not sure how my results will be, however I had to write about the scent. It is horrible.  I love lightly scented rose things like MAC&#x27;s Fix + rose. This product smells very strongly of old person rose and if I get it on my lips I can taste the it throughout the day and it is not pleasant.  Will definitely not be repurchasing in this scent, maybe the cucumber scent is better?</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner after I wash my face. I really enjoy the fact that this is all natural; there are not -oates or -ols in any of the ingredients&#x27; names. What I do is I pour it into a spray bottle and gently mist my face. I figured putting it on a cotton ball first is a waste of both cotton and solution. It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer without claiming to be one. I just let it air dry and my face is moistened! Good product! And it&#x27;s a natural astringent!!!!!!</li>
            <li> MADE MY FACE SO SMOOTH AND SMELLS LIKE ROSES WHICH I WANTED. ALSO CLEARED MY RASH UP PRETTY GOOD THANX</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Feels amazing on my skin and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Yes, you pay a higher price for it, but having something which smells delightful as you use it on your face may well be worth it.  I really love it.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and it&#x27;s really refreshing for the skin. Does a good job of lightly cleaning my face</li>
            <li> I love this toner I can see a big difference in my skin. I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice, tingly feeling on my face and seems to reduce my pore size</li>
            <li> this toner feels really good when applied to the skin, very moisturizing and not tight nor oily. have only been using it for a week but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I like it,it fit as expected,it looks beautful.its price is good.but i wish it more cheap better,that is all.i think.</li>
            <li> A pleasant fragrance of rose.  I keep mine in the fridge for the summer and apply it on my face after cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin. Pimples, pustules, blackheads. I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything from the store and I&#x27;ve recently decided to switch to natural products to see what would happen since I really have nothing to lose. I&#x27;ve been using this toner for about a month now in combination with some other natural products. After washing my face, both morning and night, I just pour some on a cotton ball and go all around my face, neck, chest and back. The cotton ball is literally brown with dirt and oil. I have to use about 6 cotton balls until they come back clear. This stuff is truly amazing. It picks up all the nasty stuff that my wash doesn&#x27;t get. For the first time in YEARS my skin is clearing up. This is better than Christmas to me. As a bonus, I love the smell of roses, and I think the scent of this is perfect, not too strong, not too soft. I also noticed there are other types of this toner with different scents like lavender and citrus, so if you&#x27;re not a rose fan try another scent. But definitely take the risk and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face every morning and night. It leaves my skin so soft and refreshed.  I first bought it a year ago because I wanted to try something new and I am so glad that I did. This is a staple and vital part of my skincare regimen.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel the same when I don&#x27;t use it. There are times when I am rushing and didnt have time and left out the house with just moisturizer on my face, boy can I tell the difference in how my skincare feels throughout the day. .therefore I try never to miss this step. I am not sure if it is the rose petals or what but my skin cant live without this stuff..it is so good that I bought my sisters some and told them if they run out,  that they have to get the one with the rose petals because it is something magical,  lol....but it truly is much better than the other witchhazel that I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I have always been a user of anything &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; on my face due to it&#x27;s benefits for skin. This product in particular is a wonderful combination of aloe, rose, and witch hazel. It&#x27;s gentle but purifies my skin flawlessly!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Witch Hazel for my husband&#x27;s after shave.  I have not heard any complaints or comments, so apparently it works!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Leaves my face feeling fresh. After I let her try it once, my 7-year old likes to steal into my bathroom and use it too!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the seller!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells. I&#x27;ve always used regular witch hazel, but I&#x27;ll be using this for now on.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this as I was looking for a new toner and the reviews were good. Unfortunately for me this did absolutely nothing!!! This did not improve my skin at all and is the worst toner I have ever used. I didn&#x27;t even finish the product, it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> It just doesnt work for me... I did a lot of research about this product, and have seen many people recommend it. But it just doesnt work for me. After I use it, my whole face is a disaster... full of pimples.... it also has super strong fragrance smell....</li>
            <li> I use this product as a toner and it really helps to control my skin redness.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it smells nice and makes my face feel smooth, clean and fresh without feeling dry. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff &amp; has many more uses than just for toner, but that&#x27;s my favorite use.</li>
            <li> Works as intended and advertised, helps in some bad skin condition as cleanser and stringent</li>
            <li> So far I am loving it! Keeps my skin softer than before</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff Smells great</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used. My sensitive skin refuses to accept anything else. The toner being alcohol-free helps so much. The rose smell is subtle. The other alcohol-free option is cucumber, which I want to try next.</li>
            <li> I really love this amazing toner. I ran out of my other toner and was looking for a new one and then I remembered seeing my sister using it. It smells so amaaaaaaazing and it doesnt smell like it has alcohol at all. I also already saw some improvement on my skin cause I have a lot of hyperpigmentation because of this weather. Definitely gonna buy it again!</li>
            <li> I use this to cleanse and refresh my face when I haven&#x27;t worn makeup or anything during the day. It feels nice and smells delicious!</li>
            <li> It really does seem to make skin look fresher and newer...i have to get more</li>
            <li> It might be good to others. The smell is not bad. And it is also useful when first use. But then I don&#x27;t why I got allergic reaction after I use it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle toner...lovely rose scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years and I love it. I don&#x27;t think it does anything for pores, but it does make me feel that I am pampering my skin and gets off all the extra dirt and/or makeup that my cleanser misses.</li>
            <li> This toner makes my skin feel great, I know rose petals are good for more than just skin and love the way it makes the toner smell.</li>
            <li> I used it I could see a difference in the coloration in my face. It was much brighter and toned. I don&#x27;t really care for the smell but at least I don&#x27;t smell like alcohol</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month or two now.  I use it every day or every other day to refresh my face or take off any concealer that was left behind after shower.  The smell reminds me of a grandmother&#x27;s perfume; not exactly my style but I am sure there are worse things to smell like.  I like the fact that this toner is an all natural product.  As far as improvements in my skin, I don&#x27;t see a lot of difference but maybe it takes more time.  I will keep using it because I like having something natural to use underneath my moisturizer.  I will update my review if anything changes.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using Rose Petal  Witch Hazel  w/Aloe Vera......was pleased with the slight fragrance and loved it had no alcohol.  will order again</li>
            <li> This is a nice product , good toner and cleaner for face and neck. I would recommend use if this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. It cleans and lessens the appearance of my pores and cleans, refreshes, and moisturizes my face after a long day. I&#x27;m going to keep using it and see if anything develops, and update this review if need be. So far, so good! I would indeed recommend for reducing pore size and keeping complexion fresh!</li>
            <li> 5 negative stars if I could. It dries my skin out. Period.</li>
            <li> I rememberd Witch Hazel being a thicker lotion, this is more of baby oil feel.  I really like the rose scent.  I guess toner is different then lotion.  Either way, I am happy.</li>
            <li> I really like to use this after cleansing my face at night or morning. Cleans without drying out my face.  I always come back to this and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This tonic is what I have been looking for rose is very hard to find .Very pleased to have found it I do massage facials and its lovely freash feeling is a good way to finish with .Thank you.</li>
            <li> Love this product! This product has tremendously helped my skin, and removed blemishes that I had for years. My skin is smooth, toned and clear. Will order from this seller again.. Fast shipping and great customer service.</li>
            <li> Good product. I use it as a toner in the morning!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this product for a few months before I reviewed, so here is my review after having used it for about 2 months now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this because I was looking for a nice toner to help minimize the oiliness of my face. I&#x27;m quite a bit past puberty, but I still break out like a teenager with regularity and was getting tired of it. Cue this toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began regular applications of it in the morning after waking up, after getting out of the shower, and occasionally before going to sleep. At the beginning I did not notice a great deal of difference in my complexion, but I did notice that it did not make my face red like other toners I had tried immediately after using it. After a few weeks, I noticed the amount of acne I was getting was smaller and the existing acne itself was smaller in size and clearing up faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, two months later I still occasionally have a zit or two, but my complexion is much clearer and my acne scars seem to be fading somewhat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I will by this product again!</li>
            <li> Why waste a lot of money on a toner when this one gives you all you need? It is a perfect toner to use before make-up or after you clean your face, right before you put on your moisturizer when you go to bed at night. You won&#x27;t regret buying one.</li>
            <li> I love it, seriously.  I would buy it again.  I love the way it smells and feels on my skin</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling a little tight, not my favorite.</li>
            <li> i have weird combination skin which is also very sensitive.  most face washes cause irritation on jaw, dryness on my cheeks and do nothing for the oil on my t spot.  thayers which hazel is a god send.  i just wipe my face down twice a day with this and finish with any kind of oil free gel creme. i went from mediocre dull skin to the type of skin you dont think could even be real without visual effects.  its like porcelain!  im sad i only just discovered this stuff!  11/10.  i&#x27;ll never switch back.</li>
            <li> This is so lovely for so many reasons- the aroma, the feeling of cleanliness, and my favorite the smaller pores! In addition to making your skin feel refreshed, overtime the toner really does make your pores appear smaller. I have a problem where once I see my pores are smaller, I stop using it, and then see the large pores return so this is a long-term use product for your chronicly large pores. It is effective though so if you like sticking to a routine, I highly recommend. It&#x27;s also great for evening out your complexion, but if that&#x27;s all you need I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the product, I&#x27;d just use baking soda and water (plenty of videos on youtube).</li>
            <li> This will be the last toner I ever try because it is the BEST EVER!  I am very impressed with the fragrance and how fresh my face feels after I apply it.</li>
            <li> Verry well packaged and arrived on date as promised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite hesitate before I decide to buy this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Because there are several people said it has a \\&quot;strong smell\\&quot; and \\&quot;smell cheap\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But finally I buy it because the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I think \\&quot;the strong smell\\&quot; is ok for me. Actually, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strong.&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend likes it. And the price is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I used the lotion of \\&quot;E\\&quot; brand. It cost more than 20$ for 6 OZ.&lt;br /&gt;This one just cost me 9$ for twice. And I think they have no big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I just use this for several days. If I feel not good later, I&#x27;ll change my review.</li>
            <li> I got hooked on this toner a couple years ago, and haven&#x27;t turned back. Let me start by saying that I have very difficult combination skin. Some areas (specifically my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone), are very oily and acne prone, while other patches of my skin are extra dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several kinds of face lotion, and was hooked on Eucerin for quite some time, and this would only sit on top of my skin. Even though most face lotions are non-comedogenic, (won&#x27;t clog pores), I still get acne on my \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone. With this toner, NONE. Not a single breakout whatsoever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that this toner helps to keep my skin tone even, and pores small-- However the main reason I use it is for its great moisturization. This is totally different from face lotions in that this is very light, and penetrates your skin like lotion simply cannot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the rose petal version of this toner smells a little aggressive. Personally, I prefer the scent cucumber version of this same toner. The rose petal kind of makes my face smell like I shoved my head in an old lady&#x27;s purse... But it works when I can&#x27;t find the cucumber kind.</li>
            <li> Best witch hazel I&#x27;ve used. Smells wonderful and really does what it should.</li>
            <li> I bought it in Feb for others. I kept it unopen in drawer. I recently took it out and found that it was turbid! I wanted to return it but I need to pay for the shipping fee. I think that I have to throw the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff, I love it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a skin toner, as well as a face mist. The best! :)</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t feel like normal toners. It is very smooth and leaves your face feeling soft. The rose petal scent is natural, not overwhelming.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this for post partum care, I havnt used it for that yet. However, I&#x27;ve been using on my face and love the smell and how clean my face feels.&lt;br /&gt;I will be returning to re-review after I use for post partum care.</li>
            <li> Great toner. Not harsh and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Has made my skin very soft, supple, and smooth! Use it after cleanser before bed instead of moisturizer for my oily/combination skin</li>
            <li> Great toner!!!  Will order again, and may try the lavender and/or the cucumber.</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly. It is gentle and non-abrasive and I just love it. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I usually apply it after I wash my face, and I do so using either a cotton ball or those cotton rounds. I seriously love how this smells.</li>
            <li> This stuff is simply fantastic.  I don&#x27;t wear makeup very often...very touchy skin...so I&#x27;m using this as my daily cleanser.  It&#x27;s really working for me, only have to use soap maybe once a week.  My skin is the happiest it&#x27;s been in years!  :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and gentleness of this product!  I have been using it for a while now and have recommended it to several friends.  It does not dry out my skin and I get the benefits of a witch hazel toner!  This product has worked well for me.</li>
            <li> I have uber sensitive skin so I&#x27;m always on the look out for organic products. After reading the reviews and scanning the ingredients to ensure it was all organic, I decided to purchase a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, it made my face itchy. Fortunately, it subsided in about an hour but I was weary about using it again. A few days later, I decided to give it another chance thinking the first time I may have been a chemical reaction with my foundation/moisturizer. This time, I used it before I heading to sleep making sure that I had no products on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy cow, my face was burning and extremely itchy! Within 10 minutes, I broke out into hives. I had to wash my face twice in order to completely remove the product from my face. Really sad that I won&#x27;t be able to use this product any longer.</li>
            <li> Working well as a toner to help clear my son&#x27;s skin</li>
            <li> Fantastic.  Will reorder.  It is effective and great.  I found that using it like a serum is better then cotton balls for me.  The cotton will grab any excess makeup but It works better when i use my fingers.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I used this to clean my hair &amp; face. Both felt so clean &amp; refreshing. My face feels toned &amp; tight after using.</li>
            <li> This smells so good! I love how it makes my skin feel. This came when my mom was here and she immediately ordered a bottle. My hubby secretly tried it and then told me he liked it as well!!</li>
            <li> I saw some video in youtube and recommended this toner. I like this toner very much. My skin is getting soft and moisture. Anyway, worth to try! :)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite I like to put it in a spray bottle and use it on my chest and back ... I love the smell too</li>
            <li> Lovely scent. Lovely product. Witch hazel has always reminded me of my grandmother. That&#x27;s a GOOD thing!</li>
            <li> love love love the product.....fast shipping....will definitely be doing business again with you...thank you</li>
            <li> Good toner. Reasonable Price.</li>
            <li> The worl&#x27;d best toner- smells incredible and soothes your skin! Excellent vendor!</li>
            <li> Smells nice, softens the skin. Not astringent.  I&#x27;m hoping it is a good pore minimizer.</li>
            <li> it is good to make a mask,good moiture</li>
            <li> BEST THING EVER.. so hydrating and purifying</li>
            <li> My go to toner. I have been using rose water for over 15 years, so when I found this combination about 5 years ago, I tried it, loved it and have never looked back. Recently I tried a more expensive brand of rose water just out of curiosity and it was terrible. I went right back to Thayers rose water/witch hazel blend.</li>
            <li> This toner stopped my breakouts completely! My pores have shrunk and my skin feels overall amazing!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product...smells nice and not at all like witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Love this as a toner and cleanser.  It is extremely gentle and soothes nicely.  I&#x27;m 41 and use Retin-A .05 so my skin is easy to irritate, and this has caused no redness at all.  It leaves my skin feeling soft, smooth and refreshed.  My daughter is 18 and recently tried it as well.  She loved it so much I bought her a bottle too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the pleasant rose smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Please do not use if you have sensitive, acne prone skin.  Like the other 1-star reviews on here, after using it for about a week I broke out severely (small and large pimples all over my face) and my face is oilier than it&#x27;s ever been.  It&#x27;s been about a month since I&#x27;ve stopped using this product but my face still hasn&#x27;t cleared up, and it continues to produce excess oil.  My skin does not feel the same anymore and I hope this product has not done long term damage to my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels refreshing Im not sure if its evening my skin tone yet but I love the smell and it does remove left behind dirt well.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love the smell!</li>
            <li> very good stuff. I love the smell, not too strong, not too weak, just right. Feeling a little help for my nose pole, not so sure yet, because I just start to use it. In a word, I love it</li>
            <li> Amazing! Buy this at supper supplements if you can.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this item on Amazon from this seller. Merchandise has been shipped efficiently and packed carefully for every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside, this product is omnipotent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it to help treat my acne break-outs. Soon I realized this is a FANTASTIC eye make-up remover!&lt;br /&gt;I pour some Witch Hazel on a cotton pad until the pad is soaked and just wipe it around my eyes, since I only apply some minor eye make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleanses effectively and gently. Even when the liquid gets in your eyes it doesn&#x27;t irritate them.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby oil to remove make-up as it does a great job too, but Witch Hazel achieves the same effect, if not better, without any grease. However, I haven&#x27;t tested its cleansing power over heavy heavy make-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides as make-up remover, I use Witch Hazel as a gentle substitute of alcohol for wound cleansing. The liquid cleans but never stings.</li>
            <li> Normally don&#x27;t write reviews but I love this toner.</li>
            <li> Love the product!  Gentle but cleans great</li>
            <li> Best Toner!  Have bought numerous times</li>
            <li> After one week of use, my skin has broken out very badly. I do not recommend this for anyone with acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and how clean it makes my face feel, but I was expecting more of a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> best toner i have ever used</li>
            <li> I can  see my face clearing  up  already  and  it&#x27;s  only  been  a  few days</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and have already used 3 times. Leaves my face feeling soft, refreshed, and clean! I read so many reviews and articles on how good witch hazel is and decided to give it a try. Smells like a rose but is not a strong scent. Feels nice and cool when applied, not burn etc. I love that it is a natural product and it is a big bottle especially for the price!</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff and it smells divine!  I have extremely sensitive skin and this works great with no negative effects.  I&#x27;ve used the cucumber in the past, but the rose petal smells much better.  One bottle goes a long way; will buy again--and Amazon has a great price, too.</li>
            <li> Super delicate smell, love the package design, always leaves my skin feeling refreshed  even after  a hot summer day.</li>
            <li> This toner smells wonderful and manages to clean my face even more after washing it. It leaves a soft, moisturizing feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for an alcohol free toner to use on my acne prone skin which is often dry and irritated due to retin-a micro.  This is a great toner which soothes my skin and does not burn or otherwise irritate it.  It removes anything that is left over from my cleanser (usually nothing) and preps my skin for the next step in my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat oily skin, and this is just enought hydration without being oily.  I tried regular drug store witch hazel and another brand, and they both contained alcohol.  They dried me out to the point of my skin peeling in a couple spots.  This is great after I wash and if I need a little freshening up throughout the day.  Smells great and I have seen a reduction in my pores across my cheeks and nose too!  I&#x27;ve tried the lavender too, but I like this one better.  I also LOVE that I have found another American made product too!</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel is a fabulous product!! It smells heavenly - just like rose water. I use it to remove make-up residue.  It is gentle and effective.  It is also great as a toner.  Very cooling.</li>
            <li> A wonderful combination of ingredients.  Love to use it to clean my face in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used that before I came to the States and feels very good. Rose and cucumber are both good. I&#x27;ll try vanilla next time~</li>
            <li> this product is not that magical, i feel uncomfortable when i using it,it do smells good, but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now as my toner and make up remover. I have to say this is my favorite one. Plain witch hazel smells terrible. This one smells like roses. :D One of my friends likes the lavender one. The original and aloe one is okay. I recently moved, and had my local grocery store didn&#x27;t carry this one. The local health food store only had the aloe one. It was aloe Thayers vs. burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s witch hazel/glycerin. Ugh, the burt&#x27;s bees one is nothing but alcohol! :( totally horrible! I will never ever use it again! I had to come online and order my thayer&#x27;s rose right away! My skin misses it&#x27;s gentle cleansing and pleasant scent! GREAT Product!!!</li>
            <li> best stuff use this all the time love the smell and what it does for my skin</li>
            <li> Thayer Witch Hazel AF Toner w/Aloe Vera Vitamin E, Rose Pental 12 oz is one of the famous product if Thayer, I just got it and waiting for effects</li>
            <li> this product left my skin feeling clean and moist, this is a very good buy, and the price meets my budget.</li>
            <li> It smells good and suits me a lot, my skin is a little dry and mix.</li>
            <li> classic product for all things that need Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> wonderfully refreshing smell. kept my face wonderfully soft. did not help with clearing breakouts, but did seem to balance my skin so it was less dry. i look forward to using it because it smells so nice- not cheap or overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never branching out again. I have found my skincare trifecta here on Amazon. Jergen&#x27;s Face Cream, Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel, and Nivea&#x27;s CoQ10 Night Cream. My skin is now supple and glowy. It used to be dry, red, irritated and super peely. If I was dehydrated enough my skin on my nose would start to peel, BAD. I&#x27;d look like I had a bad sunburn that I was recovering from. I&#x27;m so happy with my current skin care products. The biggest surprise for me was that none of these products were the super expensive make-up counter creams. Also, in case anyone is wondering, the rose smell isn&#x27;t perfumey or gross. It smells like the rosebud tea I make with rosebuds.</li>
            <li> Buy it and you won&#x27;t regret it (I hope)! I bought the witch hazel based on a recommendation and reviews, my skin now thanks me. I&#x27;m 28 and I started to break out, after using the witch hazel two times a day I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my break outs, they&#x27;re not as intense,my skin is much tighter, and pores are smaller. I will say that I&#x27;ve also being making my own face masks out of natural ingredients and that too has been helping my skin and not just the witch hazel but it&#x27;s definitely helped. I bought 2 bottles thinking is like it and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> rose is my all time favorite and the Thayer name means quality you can rely on. Getting hard to find this stuff for some reason. I was so glad to discover it could be ordered through Amazon. will definitely purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> I am trying this item. Until now, it looks very good!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. LOVE IT. Pores are smaller and tighter.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! After 2 weeks of use, my face is glowing and soft!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking it.  Makes my skin look nice.  Feels nice.  I just started using it, so will have to see how things go after a while.  But so far so good!</li>
            <li> One of my favorit products to use on my skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective, and beautiful scent</li>
            <li> i use it as a facial toner on a daily basis and makes my face feel so clean and refreshed. and when anyone else in my household has a bug bite or dry skin we use it for that as well. works wonders and I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I love all the Thayers Witch Hazel Products: Rose, Lavender and Aloe.  They all act as &amp;#34;safe for sensitive skin&amp;#34; toners.  I generally stick to Rose as it is usually available via Prime; and, the smell is my favorite even though all are pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use of witch hazel as a toner helps to keep my skin looking nice.  Although I am actually 48, people say I look much younger.  Sure, that could partially be due to genetics; however, I like to think that my proactive skin care activities help facilitate what might be blocked from naturally occurring if I used those expensive large department store, brand name, cosmetics with harsh chemicals.  Make no mistake, I have used those in the past.  Let&#x27;s chalk that episode up to the ignorance of youth.  For a short time in my 20&#x27;s, I mistakenly drew a correlation between cost and quality.  Fortunately, I saw the light before those products could do any serious damage.  Now, I keep it simple and basic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a matter of full disclosure, I use Thayers Witch Hazel  in conjunction with a himalayan sea salt bar.  After washing my face with either Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Pure Castile Soap or Dr. Woods Black Soap, I take a cotton pad, liberally squirt on the Thayers Witch Hazel, rub the cotton against the solid sea salt bar and use it as a facial toner and as a toner to eliminate razor bumps after shaving.  To moisturize, I either use organic coconut oil or Organix&#x27; Theraneem Skin Lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this witch hazel. It helped to clear my face and does not irritate my sensitive skin. The ingredients are great and it leaves my face feeling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I found this product when I finished my first standard Walgreens witch hazel. The fact that this would smell like roses enticed me, and when I learned this had no alcohol I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love it! Must buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing. Should be part of every man/woman&#x27;s skin regime.</li>
            <li> love witchhazel but not the smell. This product smells wonderful. Only thing is it is pricey.</li>
            <li> Well packaged, arrived in timely manner and love this product for cleaning my face! Smells solo fresh and rosey.</li>
            <li> I still use this to tone and moisturize, love it!</li>
            <li> If I could give this 10 stars I would. This is the best anti-wrinkle product out there - I am 38 years old and started using it about 6 months ago. I have decent skin but this ridded me of some of the deeper fine lines that have been creeping up since 35. Great stuff and very cheap for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use another chemical based toner, this stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Very nice toner: aromatic, soothing, generally high quality.  Additionally, the witch hazel used in this formulation is pure and not the watered down decoctions typically used in cheaper (Wal-Mart and dollar store brand) types.  If you&#x27;re looking for the real deal in terms of what Witch Hazel can really do, and, most importantly, what it was intended for; for the real deal before manufactured watered down brands overran the shelves, then this is the one to try.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AMAZING ... I don&#x27;t know yet how my skin will react to it, but I love how it makes me smell!</li>
            <li> I like this toner because it has natural ingredients. I apply it after removing my makeup before my serum.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Wonderful scent and such a great facial cleanser. Bought a three packaged of these so I never run out!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of different toners and this one is my favorite and the best price. It helps keep my oil under control and prevents acne. I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Tried it due to high reviews and they were right-this is amazing! Been using it for a couple of weeks now. I notice my pores have shrunk and my skin is smoother. After &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; my face I put a little on a cotton ball and gently go over my entire face. The oils and remaining cosmetics that come off are just gross. I see now that I had residue left over that would contribute to my breakouts all these years. Will buy again for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks and I already see that my skin tone is more even.&lt;br /&gt;I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin, not dry, oily or combination but it is very sensitive, prone to breakouts and uneven tone. I use this product after I wash my face both morning and night and I don&#x27;t need to use a seperate lotion, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the rose smell. My husband even commented that I smelt funny after I applied it. I don&#x27;t know if the rose actaully does anything other than create a scent, but next time, I will try another scent of the same product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over eight years, and needless to say, I really like it. It smells great and never makes my face feel tight.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have been looking for a toner that is not only good but that smells lovely as well. It keeps my skin hydrated and looking great.</li>
            <li> This is product smells amazing and is very gentle on my sensitive skin:)</li>
            <li> I applied this with a cotton swab after cleaning my skin. It stung and burned and turned my skin red, as though I&#x27;d been sunburned. Maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something in it, or it didn&#x27;t agree with my skin cleanser? Plus it smells pretty gross; it reminds me of rubbing alcohol mixed with some perfume to cover the smell (bearing in mind that it contains no alcohol). Blech that&#x27;s some stank</li>
            <li> My skin is oily/acne prone. I live in Florida so makeup just melts off. I use this twice a day it makes my skin look so much better, and pores smaller. Only toner I have ever liked, only toner I will ever use.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It feels so wonderful on my face and the smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li> Fast delivory. Thanks. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 with pimples and wrinkles and combo uber sensitive skin this is the first product that hasn&#x27;t dried me out or made me break out&lt;br /&gt;Feels very clean and fresh with a beautiful light scent</li>
            <li> I have bought three and used for two years. It is a very gentle toner and smells excellent. Love it.</li>
            <li> what a difference on my skin!! i&#x27;m sensitive and allergic to most cosmetics and skin products. this helped with dryness, pimples, itching. so happy to have been recommended by my acupuncturist. saved my skin..</li>
            <li> I always use regular witch hazel for a skin toner.  This is especially nice because it has the added rose petal water, which gives it a lighter more pleasant scent as well as keeping the skin soft.  I use it every day, morning and night, its a GREAT toner!</li>
            <li> The hint of rose water in this makes a great toner even better.  Will order nothing but this witch hazel in the future.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can use very few products with scent. However, this toner was perfect and was very mild as far as smell. Love the large size and great price.</li>
            <li> Am so glad I saw this product and ordered it. The smell takes me back to my childhood and reminds me of products my mother had. The feeling on my face is so soothing...a bit of a tingle, but so refreshing! Will be including bottles in baskets for annual get-together with high school classmates this spring.</li>
            <li> The rose petal scent makes me love Witch Hazel sooo much more!! I had tried other &amp;#34;unscented&amp;#34; ones before that unfortunately smelled terrible!! This not only smells nice, it is soooo good to my skin. The smell only lingers for 2-3 minutes. I use it about 2-3 times a day! I have seen my pores shrink and disappear right before my eyes! It is very mild yet sooo effective! I am already looking to purchase more!! I plan on keeping one at work for a 2 pm pick me up! I have noticed that I know have to wear less make up! My skin is much more even toned.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest beauty product i&#x27;ve purchased in years. I love the smell and it makes my skin feel clean and soft but not tight. I use it at least twice a day. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this as a cooling aftershave. The smell is a bit floral/feminine but it fades quickly and I personally enjoy it. I&#x27;ve found it helps minimize irritation, especially on my neck and has also eliminated my very mild and infrequent acne spots on my forehead. I don&#x27;t use cotton pads or anything. I just dump it in my hands and splash it on. I also use a quick squirt here and there around the bathroom to freshen the scent of the room.</li>
            <li> I love this toner and I have been using it for years.  The smell is lovely.</li>
            <li> Very good. Leaves skin extra soft.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell if this product worked or not, but it smelled nice and did clean my face well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light.  Closes pores while gently moisturizing.  Dries quickly.  Love, love, love.</li>
            <li> I was glad I found this on Amazon. It can get pretty hard to get it in stores where I&#x27;m from. It smells great and feels so nice after applying this to my skin. Definitely worth it. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well with Prevera.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing! It brightens up my face and makes it smell like roses.</li>
            <li> Like the water so far. Can&#x27;t speak yet of what results it will have because I have only been using it for a couple of days but it feels clean and does not smell like any crazy ingredients are in it. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I really like this natural toner. Unlike toners I have tried in the past that dry out my skin, this one leaves it clean and moisturized. I use it twice a day, in the morning and night, and one bottle lasted me months! I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, I just love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I have braided hair and bought this product to use on my scalp. It leaves a pleasant smell and keeps my scalp from itching. I recommend this product for anyone who wears a braided hairstyle.</li>
            <li> The toner still works fine. I like the lightness, and I feel refresh. Maybe in 3 months I&#x27;ll review it again.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and smells good.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great, but it doesn&#x27;t dry me out</li>
            <li> Great product and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Was waiting to see if this product did anything for my skin so far so good! I&#x27;ve used it two nights in a row &amp; it has controlled my oily skin &amp; given me a radiant appearance as if my skin was brighter &amp; more evened out. Love the rose scent! Very natural products!!</li>
            <li> I have super oily skin, and this is the best toner i can recommend to anyone with oily or combination skin.The hint of rose smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must have toner !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it to help make/dilute herbal blends</li>
            <li> I just love this Witch Hazel. It has a gentle smell of rose but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I use it 2x a day and my face love it!! Pores are close and my skin feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and nice-smelling.</li>
            <li> I love this. The smell is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t last forever. Makes my skin feel good and clean. Will buy again. I use with Dr. Woods Castile soap.</li>
            <li> Came quickly was packed so well there could be no leaking or damage to container.  Great toner and cheaper than all the fancy name brands.</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt and looked so smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and love the results. It is not burning or drying like the earlier witch hazel products. I will definitely continue using this product. I will be searching for other products available from this seller. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells great (refreshing light scent) and works even better (cleans skins, but doesn&#x27;t dry it out) &amp;#60;3 Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this product for so many reasons.  Great for face and body with no reactions, even on the most sensitive skin.  I also use it on my son&#x27;s back after removing his medication patch to help heal the skin quickly.  He is allergic to so much but we&#x27;ve never had trouble with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as a toner in the morning and evening for about a week and a half. I really like it. It does not dry out my skin at all. I did have an initial break out on my nose, but it went away fairly quickly with continued use.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It&#x27;s easy on your skin and feels great. I used it as a toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every toner I could find from drug store to department store and nothing has worked as well at clearing acne and restoring an even tone to my skin as this toner! Its gentle enough that it doesn&#x27;t irritate but still leaves my skin feeling moisturized and totally clean and free of buildup in my pores. Plus the smell is amazing! I use it once a day as well as whenever my skin is feeling a little oily or tight.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have combination skin and I tried this as a last resort to buying expensive products for my face. I am thrilled with the results! It took about 3 weeks for my skin to start clearing up, but now I nearly acne free. I&#x27;ve gone through the gauntlet of facial creams, washes, and pills-- including Acutane which left my face chronically dry in some spots and super oily in others. This toner dosen&#x27;t burn when I put it on and it&#x27;s lightly moisturizing, but not too heavy. I use it on my face in the morning and the evening, after washing and applied with a cotton pad. The rose oil fragrance is a nice touch too.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about it being drying and also about the smell, but neither has been an issue and I find I look forward to putting it on. It definitely softens the skin and leaves it feeling refreshed. And despite my doubts about the rose smell - there&#x27;s something uplifting about it! Arrived quickly and feels like great value.</li>
            <li> Just got this stuff in the mail and it smells AMAZING! Very soothing. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling fresh and soft! Wish I had a bigger bottle. I would re commend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I Love Rose Scent but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to literally throw this away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent .... was so STRONG...it gave me a headache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong!</li>
            <li> This toner made me break out for over a week after using it for only a couple of days. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have combination skin (sensitive and acne prone).</li>
            <li> i started using this toner and two days later multiple people commented on how awesome my skin looked. i don&#x27;t have horrible skin or acne but my face is definitely a combination of dry and oily patches. within 24 hours of the first use of the toner, everything seemed to even out. i&#x27;m pretty amazed at how well it actually works. the smell is a bit antiquated (reminds me of that \\&quot;tea rose\\&quot; perfume) but it dissipates quickly. looking forward to trying other products in the same line.</li>
            <li> I love witch hazel, and I love the fact that this has rose in it.  Rose is really, really good for skin, and the aloe helps with moisturizing.  It&#x27;s not cloying with fragrance, and it&#x27;s fresh, not heavy.  It leaves my skin soft, smooth, and fresh. I have sensitive, dry skin with a few outbreaks now and again, and since using this product my face isn&#x27;t as red and the outbreaks are few and far between. It also helps moisturize my skin without the nasty breakouts later, though when my skin is a little drier than normal, I use Cetaphil (normally around the eyes and forehead).</li>
            <li> The best skin freshener and make up remover I have ever used and the best price. I keep  one with cotton balls  in a drawer in my nitestand for those nights I am just too tired to take my makeup off. I plan to buy another one for my vanity in the bath room.  It&#x27;s just a great little product very lightly rose petal scented which doesn&#x27;t bother my allergies to fragrance. If they keep the price the same I will buy several and give some for gifts.</li>
            <li> I used to use toners from the Body Shop, and after a while I noticed that my skin dried up and become tougher, so I stopped using it. I use this toner just a couple of times and feels my skin softens and even more clear. It&#x27;s a beautiful toner, I will continue to use it and hopefully it will be this way forever!</li>
            <li> I had first tried this product via a friend of mine, and I just loved the way it smelled and made my skin feel! I have really weird skin, dry on my cheeks but oily on my forehead, and I have blackheads &amp; zits galore. I couldn&#x27;t find anything to take care of both of them, until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After showering, a splash of this is all I need and my skin feels tighter and refreshed and smells amazing. I keep it in the fridge for extra pore-closing power, and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It make my skin softer and smells great! Will recommend this to who would like to take care of their skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to use in her facial cleansing routine and WOW! She loves it, makes her skin glowy and clean, and plus it&#x27;s helped to clear up her acne. Couldn&#x27;t recommend high enough!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product :). It&#x27;s my cleanser, moisturizer and aftershave. I alternate this one with lavender one and love them both. Fragrance is so nice too!</li>
            <li> No fancy gimmicks with this one.  It is what is says it is which is a alcohol-free (good because non drying), rose petal witch hazel with aloe vera toner.  The ingredients are water, aloe juice, glycerin, rose fragrance, witch hazel, rose water, citric acid, grapefruit seed extract, and vitamin E. I LOVE that there no extra unnecessary chemicals which makes for something I can feel safe and good using.  The top spout is small enough to let out trickles, so you don&#x27;t waste toner by oversoaking.  So far i&#x27;ve used about a third (4 fl ounces) over 4 months, which is something i at least do once a day.  Excellent price as well. Def would recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. The smell is great and it leaves my skin so smooth and clean. I will definitely keep buying this toner.</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel on my face for years now and when I saw this one with the rose in it I was really excited.  While I have oily skin this will clear it up and last for a little while but I notice my skin going back to really oily more so than I did with the Dickinson&#x27;s original Witch Hazel.  The smell is great but I don&#x27;t think my skin likes this one.</li>
            <li> It  does what it claims and is soothing on mature skin.  I use it at night before a skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is good to use after you wash your skin. It will add moisture while toning and keeping gunk out. Smells great as well.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I have oily skin and lots of bumps on my forehead and it seems to be clearing them up. It is a bit pricey but I found it on vitacost for a much cheaper price so I will be purchasing it there from now on.  I love the smell and use it every morning and evening.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on my skin nightly after I showered and washed my face and I no longer use any moisturizer on my face at all.  This has the perfect amount in it (must be the aloe) to make my skin soft without having to use anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the moisturizers I was using, were making my face break out and were giving me painful cystic acne.  I have not had a single cystic zit since I quit using other products and only use this.  I still may get some small zits here and there, but nothing like I was getting and nothing I can&#x27;t cover with makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful and I will continue using this as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> it is useful .&lt;br /&gt;it help me good&lt;br /&gt;i like it ,&lt;br /&gt;it look not bad.&lt;br /&gt;~~~ ~ ~ ~</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells great and leaves your skin feeling cool and refreshed. It&#x27;s also great to know that it&#x27;s all natural and no alcohol. Other witch hazels smell terrible and kind of burn/sting the skin a bit. This stuff literally feels like rubbing rose pedals and water all over your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which for some might not be the preferred or manliest smell, but I love it. I ALWAYS follow up my shave routine by rubbing this over my neck and face to cool down my skin and close the pores while cleaning out any gunk and residue I might have missed.</li>
            <li> Love this product very much. My mother has since started using it and loves it also. Buy Buy Buy. No sting or dryness either. My skin is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This toner is awesome. It&#x27;s actually the first toner I&#x27;ve ever used, but it&#x27;s kept my skin soft, reduced the size of my pores, and kept my acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I began to use this witch hazel toner about a week ago. Already i see a huge dramatic change in my skin. my blackheads and dark circles have decreased faster than I would have ever expected! I am not a big believer on things working so quickly but this product proved me wrong! It simply does exactly what it says it will! I am completely in love with this toner and I will never get anything else. I like to apply it twice a day with my morning and night face cleansing routine. I sometimes just use the witch hazel to give me that fresh feel after running around for half the day. I never leave reviews for any amazon products I buy simply because I am a full time college students and I rarely have time to give up 5mins...but this product is worth it! I have tried other toners and they make my skin feel too dry...not this one!! stop reading this and buy it already!!! you wont regret it!!!!! :) By the way...i have pretty normal skin but it can get irritated by products easily and this witch hazel is loved by my skin! kudos!</li>
            <li> I started using Thayer unscented and loved it. I had rose water so I added it to it.  Well duh, I can just buy it with rose in it.  I don&#x27;t find the fragrance to be too strong at all but then I don&#x27;t have a real sensitive nose like some people do.  The fragrance is from rose water and fades shortly after it dries anyway.  Natural Witch Hazel, Aloe and Rose water all bring wonderful properties to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour size:  I defiantly have seen my pours get much smaller! Especially on my nose.  Big wow for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eczema:  I tend to get eczema on my face which really sucks. This takes it right away!! Thank you ,thank you.  For those of you that suffer with eczema my number one recommendation is to stop eating grain!!  That makes a HUGE difference. That is the only way I can get rid of it.  When I cheat my body can handle it once in a while but no on a regular base.  When I start eating grain it comes back.  And then Thank goodness for Witch Hazel it takes it away quickly.  I have used steroid creams which work, but this is actually faster and all natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrinkles:  Yes, it does help. I feel my skin is tighter and I a youthful glow back to my skin.  It really is amazing. I&#x27;m 58 and look 40.  What I eat makes  a difference there too but Witch Hazel is fantastic.  (food, stay away from sugar!! Ages you fast.)  I never bothered with an astringent. What for.  I have no idea what started me on it but I will never stop.&lt;br /&gt;Cleans:  I know it moisturizes. I am not sure how but it does. I still feel squeaky clean,  I put the witch hazel on t though out the day. I leave it on the bathroom counter next to cotton balls and whenever I am there I put some more on. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne:  I don&#x27;t and never have had a problem with acne but  Every once in a while one will sneak up, usually back to when I am not eating right.  It does clear it up quickly when I use the witch hazel.  I would say in  two days. For those who say it brings on acne my only guess to that is it might be clearing out your skin big time and...what are you eating??  Can&#x27;t blame it all on the witch hazel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff. I noticed there is lavender and many other choices.  A real keeper as far as I am concerned!!</li>
            <li> Smells really good and face feels refreshed.  Will purchase again in the future. - quoted from the wifey</li>
            <li> Such a nice and gentle toner. Makes my skin feel clean and soft and I love love love the rose smell so much. I use everyday out of the shower - lasts me about 2 months though with everyday use</li>
            <li> This is a great soothing toner. It is non-irritating and I love the smell, although it fades quickly. I can&#x27;t say that I use it every day, but I am sure to use it after a harsh glycolic treatment which I do a couple times a week. It really takes out all the redness</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel as a toner because it works. When I saw that there was a rose petal based one I thought it might smell pretty and work just as well. So far I like it and it works. The rose scent is strong and might cause a problem if you&#x27;re allergic to bees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I went outside to run errands with my son. I noticed something crawling on my hand (the hand I used to apply the toner) it was a wasp. I tried blowing it off, but it stayed on. Finally I brushed it off with my keys and ran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I went to the park with my son and I felt something crawling on my face. I swiped it off and saw that it was a bumblebee. It was a beautiful sunny day so maybe they were just out in full force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went home I was taking my son out of the car and I felt something crawling on my hand again. It was another bumblebee. I usually don&#x27;t attract bees. They avoid me and I them for the most part. I thought it was a little odd that I had these experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t stop me from using the toner, but I just wanted to warn others in case you&#x27;re allergic to bees.</li>
            <li> It feels nice on the skin, cleans very good but dries my skin out a little bit.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the feeling on my face. Absolutely love it!!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the price. This toner gives me a very refreshed look after application and I can actually see healthy skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought this because the reviews were so high and also because I thought the bottle was cute. But I&#x27;m very happy with this, more than I expected to be. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now and my skin feels really nice, soft and clear. It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin and there&#x27;s been no irritation. It&#x27;s much gentler than face products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and honestly does a much better job too.</li>
            <li> I havent used this product for long but I know rose water is good for skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product has rose water and aloe which makes it perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I gives a fresh feel for skin after cleansing, removes dirt too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is alcohol free and so best for skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  Some of the ingredients it contains are: undistiled witch hazel, aloe vera, and rose water.  I do have pure Lebanese rose water that I add to the bottle to give it a more robust scent.  The scent is mild, in my opinion--if you are familiar with rose absolute essential oil, it is definitely not that &amp;#34;breathtaking.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend adding Cortas rose water--it has no additives--and I highly reccommend this product, as well.</li>
            <li> Love that this does not contain alcohol! Smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out regular skin and smells nice. Haven&#x27;t noticed considerable pore shrinkage but I like that it makes my skin smell nice and feel soft. Does dry out and irritate areas where I have a problem with perioral dermatitis, so I avoid those areas.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product and quick delivery. Also, their persistence in wanting to know if I was happy with everything.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, feels nice on the skin, not drying. This is a gentle toner, not heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know really what to think about this product. Seems to break my skin out more. But maybe it&#x27;s pulling the stuff out?</li>
            <li> This delightful toner blend of is exactly what I needed and wanted.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, especially the smell of roses!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, im very pleased so far. I was a littel nervous because I have sensitive skin, this was gentle on my face. I will purchase this again</li>
            <li> I have used Witch Hazel for years as an astringent.  This is by far the best Witch Hazel product I have ever used.  It smells wonderful and feels great on my skin.  I have seen improvement in the look and texture of my skin.  Excellent at shrinking pores.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I have recommended it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> all I can say is I love this toner. I notice a difference in my skin after a week. I don&#x27;t understand how something so simple could make a huge difference.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it several times a day. One bottle lasts about 6 weeks. Love it!! Makes my skin feel so nice.</li>
            <li> Tried and true.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for months now. It is very gentle on face especially for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I wish the seller didn&#x27;t put a label over the front, though.  I peeled it and then the whole Thayer&#x27;s label got messed up.  Other than that, the product is great.  I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> The best toner there is, hands down. Thanks to this toner, in conjunction with some other great skin products, my skin has never looked better. Absolutely love this, and I will continue to buy it as long as it&#x27;s being made!</li>
            <li> Use this twice a day, every day, religiously. Smells and feels amazing. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> great as a base for homemade face masks</li>
            <li> I love this product! Not only is my skin clearer but it feels so much better than it did. Will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> superior product, not over-fragranced, nondrying, and my combo, sensitive skin looks and feels great. This is a perfect rosewater toner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how smooth my skin is afterwords.  I bought this after hearing how wonderful witch hazel is ffor the skin!!  my girls also love using this product!  Has such a nice pleasant smell!</li>
            <li> Tones without drying. Leaves my skin soft and clean. Love it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face soft and smooth. I will happily reorder from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Order arrives quickly and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> great for taking all the day dirt off your face... love the way it smells and feels</li>
            <li> Smooth like a baby&#x27;s bottom</li>
            <li> Love it!! The best there is!! excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin!  Enjoy mixing it with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> This is super good stuff.  Soothing when you need it to be.  No alcohol.  Pleasant smell.  I doubt any other toner could beat it.</li>
            <li> Great toner with natural ingredients, also helps cleanse and minimize pores.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It leaves your face feeling clean, soft, and fresh.  Smells wonderful also.  Delivery was super quick, I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good toner, absorbs fast and the rose flavor smells good once you get used to it. One thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the little stickiness from the glycerin in this product.</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel on my skin since many toners tend to be too harsh. This is mild and helps to keep my skin clean and clear. I also enjoy the smell of it.</li>
            <li> … and I already purchased backups. This is the only toner I can use twice a day. And unlike others, it actually improves my pores and skin texture. Others would make my skin redder and more irritated. Not this one. So happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived just as described.  I&#x27;ve switched to this tonic permanently as my toner because my skin is very sensitive and dry during winter months.  This works perfectly to help keep my skin healthy without burning or drying that other toners.  Highly recommend for sensitive to normal skin!</li>
            <li> I love using this as a toner for my face.  It leaves your face feeling clean and toned without that dry cracking feeling you sometimes get with other products.  It has a light rose smell.  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This has helped my skin look and feel softer and younger. It worked for me and I am pretty much sensitive to everything else.  I use it at least twice a day.</li>
            <li> Oh my God!! I love this stuff!  It smells beautiful, leaves my skin super soft and dries out pimples!  Why did I learn about this stuff sooner?!  It works beautifully!  And to add rose to it?!  Genius!</li>
            <li> Great product for sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. That is all I know for sure. My skin is sometimes dry and/or sometimes oily, so i never know what product to use on my face. My skin reacts badly to most toners. Thayers rose petal witch hazel has never made me break out in pimples or a rash.  I&#x27;m 26 and look like i&#x27;m 18-20. But it&#x27;s not just one product I use to get these results. It&#x27;s a combination of different things, including this product. I love this product and have bought it several times already. I will continue to buy as long as amazon sells it.</li>
            <li> Absolut yu love their stuff. Great ingredients, and it really works!</li>
            <li> Why spend a ton of money on some fancy toner when you can get the best for $9?  This stuff is amazing!  It really smoothes out my skin, gets rid of blemishes, nourishes my skin, and it smells lovely, not like most nasty alcohol-based toners.  This is a bargain (and the bottle is HUGE for the price too - 12 oz!) I work from home so I use it several times a day.  I have definitely seen a difference since using it.</li>
            <li> husband seems to like this product.</li>
            <li> Works great on cuts and saying out breakouts... Is use this as a toner with dr. Woods black soap face wash... Idk which one is helping making my face stay clear ...</li>
            <li> I was very unhappy with what I received. The cap was sealed with a plastic covering, however the bottle itself was not sealed. When I unscrewed the cap I could see the edge of the torn plastic where at one point there was a seal. I held it up to my nose and despite that this is an alcohol free toner, it smelled like rubbing alcohol. Almost no rose scent at all.  I am not sure what is actually in my bottle but I do not think it is what I ordered. It has clearly been tampered with. I am not comfortable using this and will be throwing it away. I will have to purchase this from a store instead of a 3rd party vendor, that was my mistake.</li>
            <li> This toner is great for aftershave or all around cleanliness.  Even if you already have an aftershave lotion, this helps to&lt;br /&gt;remove any more residue and bacteria in the skin. Do yourself a favor and get one to try out.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews for this since I read it was moisturizing and I was tired of applying greasy face cream. This definitely does the job. Sometimes my face wash or clay mask dries me out a bit and this fixes it immediately. Smells nice, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t irritate my super sensitive skin. Good buy for the price.</li>
            <li> Mild pleasant skin fresher-upper. And it seems gentle enough for the under-eye area. I Didn&#x27;t notice any therapeutic effects, however.</li>
            <li> As a child, I remember my mother talking about Witch Hazel products that she loved. Seeing this made me want a bottle. I love it and I even remembered the smell! So happy I found this and the provider of this product. (Maitri Mega Mall thru Amazon.) And the price was reasonable!</li>
            <li> I am allergic to the product. It was recommended by my friend so I did not realize that it was the cause of all my skin problems and kept using it for about a year,leading to serious consequences. My skin became really sensitive and I had acnes all over my face, which never happened before. And I still have serious acne problems even it has been one year since I stopped using it. It may work well for somebody but to me it is a horrible product.</li>
            <li> love this toner. it leaves my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> A wonderful natural product! I just received my fifth bottle of Thayer Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal, and I love it. It&#x27;s cleansing yet easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars because it&#x27;s my first time trying it and I&#x27;m not sure if I love it yet. However, this is definitely a good toner if you have sensitive skin because it doesn&#x27;t have any alcohol and it doesn&#x27;t sting.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this toner.  I am trying to switch to more organic products and this toner is 100% organic and made in the USA so I had to try it.  It leaves my skin soft and it smells wonderful.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. Very refreshing with a pleasant, if artificial, smell. I like being able to quickly refresh my face when I get home and then later do a real cleansing. This works great! Not too drying at all.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of witch hazel. It is part of my daily skin routine and it&#x27;s really helped make my skin look better and also hydrate my skin during this very hot summer.</li>
            <li> I am using it now and I like it. One of cheaper toner out there. I just wish the rose flagrance isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> Nice toner. Gentle, recommended. All natural</li>
            <li> Ahhh.. this is delicious; it makes my skin feel more fresh and clean. It&#x27;s definitely a part of my face routine. I even made a make up remover with this! : hot water, half a teaspoon of Thayer witch hazel, one tablespoon of coconut oil and a spoon of Dr Bronner&#x27;s mild baby soap. I put it in  a container with cotton rounds and they are ready to go!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me to use post-wax (bikini area) and i love it.  smells good (roses) but not old lady roses.  helps to reduce bumps and promotes healing to the tortured skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> i really recommend this product, it can be used as mist or toner. it is good for my skin, and i really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Love this toner, smells awesome and there is a lot in the bottle. Works for acne without drying your skin out, and alcohol free.</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly and was just what I was looking for. It works great as a toner after I remove my makeup. It gets every last trace off my face before bed.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day;  morning and evening. I am lost without it and always have a spare bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my cleanser (even for eye makeup--), it is my toner.  Have not used soap o my face for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin soft and clean.  And it contains no toxins!  Would and do recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural, no alcohol or chemical perfume in it.&lt;br /&gt;This one has lovely rose smell, not too strong but subtle just like when you put your nose in rose petals.&lt;br /&gt;I never felt stinging or annoyed by the smell. I have combination skin, and it works well to hydrate and cleans the oil and debris. Good for sensitive skin, too.&lt;br /&gt;Simple ingredients doesn&#x27;t mean you need more. It has everything you need to keep your skin soft and hydrated without harmful chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;This is a decent size of bottle, it will last for a long time. Money saving and makes your skin happy.</li>
            <li> I use this on my face in the morning and at night. There is a nice cool sensation on your skin, which is great for the Summer heat. It cleans my pores and I actually see the difference it makes on my skin. I have a combination of oily/dry skin. I don&#x27;t use any foundations or anything on my face except for Aloe Vera face day and night cream. Make sure you use warm water (not hot or it&#x27;ll dry your face) to wash your face in order to open up your pores and and wash all the dirt away. Then apply the toner, which will clean off any left over residue and close your pores before more dirt goes in.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: found this exact item for almost 3$ cheaper will go to GNC next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so I brought this product because after I wash my face with the black soap I felt I needed something that didn&#x27;t have alcohol in it to wipe my face with before using my moisturizer.  I love the scent but I am not sure of what it does exactly.  After washing my face it I see on my cotton swab that it cleans the leftover junk so if that&#x27;s what its supposed to do then I give it 5.</li>
            <li> ...and this stuff feels very nice. It&#x27;s refreshing but not in the least bit drying. It smells really good too. I&#x27;m a convert, I really like it. Good value, too.</li>
            <li> this is a great product and leaves your skin so soft and  moisturized.  i put it in a spray bottle and spray my face a few times a day just for moisture and it really works and does not disturb your makeup.  i was using wen mist $$$$ but this is just as good.</li>
            <li> This toner leaves my face feeling fresh, and not tight like many toners.  I love the subtle rose smell, and the generous size.  A little goes a long way, too, so it&#x27;s a great value.  Glad I got it, will probably stick with it, as it is the best toner I&#x27;ve used so far.  The only reason I did not give it five stars is because as yet, it hasn&#x27;t made my wrinkles go away, lol.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when I woke up one morning and decided it was time to start a skin care regiment but just didn&#x27;t want a bunch of extra harmful products clogging up my pores. I have oily combination skin and luckily am not really acne prone. After reading the reviews I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a week now in combination with some other products. On my first use it made my face tingle almost burning, and I was very red. I thought this was related to an exfoliating treatment I just did so I kept up with it and haven&#x27;t had any issues. When I put it on my face it usually tingles in the areas on my face that are usually very oily, the tingle ends pretty quickly and isn&#x27;t really uncomfortable more just unpleasant. the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering and doesn&#x27;t bother me but I could see how it could bother someone. My skin is less oily and a lot healthier looking</li>
            <li> I LOVE this toner. Sometimes, when my skin is extra oily, I don&#x27;t put on moisturizer. I just wash my face and wipe with this toner. It gives enough moisture (aloe, rose water) but keeps the oilies at bay. It&#x27;s all natural, smells amazing; I love this product.</li>
            <li> Smells good.  Good price. This does work as a nice toner for the face and neck.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this toner, although i think the frangrance they can tone down alittle, a bit too strong. But other than that, it&#x27;s great. I also use after shower, as a moisturizer, keeps my skin very moist and helps with dry skin ( use before lotion or oil).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for about 2 weeks. So far I love the smell &amp; it&#x27;s pretty gentle &amp; soothing on my acne-prone skin. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Toned my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> very good ,I love it .It has great work to make face clear and soft,So I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> best thing I ever used on my face.  I can see the fine lines starting to disappear!  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this!</li>
            <li> I love the refreshed feeling this product gives my face. I use it after an oil wash steam and it is a great combination. Will not hesitate to order again!</li>
            <li> FABULOUS FOR YOUR FACE</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed with this product. I have struggled with both dry and acne-prone skin since I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 24 now). I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of acne treatments and toners that tend to dry out my skin, while not really seeming to alleviate the acne. I continued to have regular breakouts 2-3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this product after hearing about it on youtube, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. Not only has this controlled my breakouts, but I can also tell that my skin is smoother and brighter looking! Since the product is alcohol free, it doesn&#x27;t have the drying effect of most toners, but it&#x27;s also effective at removing my makeup and keeping my acne at bay. I now only use this and Cetaphil cleanser, which really seems to contribute to the improvement in my complexion. I will admit that I&#x27;m not a fan of the rose/ \\&quot;granny perfume\\&quot; scent, but I&#x27;m eager to try more of the formulations that Thayer&#x27;s offers (aloe and lavender).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for anyone suffering from acne and/or uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> This product is familiar to me as my mother and grandmother and great-grandmother used it in the past. I recently became more informed on using essential oils and thus reintroduced Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel into my skin routine and I am so happy! My skin is so much more hydrated and clear in just a couple weeks of daily use. Thank you for making such a good and healthy product.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and keeps my wife&#x27;s skin soft.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. It does make your face feels very clean and refresh. I&#x27;ll for sure recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really works to even my tone. Love it, I will definitely be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;Four. More. Words. lol</li>
            <li> This product is great. Larger than I expected and very good quality. I can see the difference in my skin already...</li>
            <li> Nice smell but I expected more. Good product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great. I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner. It used to tighten my pores and give me a good fresh feeling. Also my skin looked great when i was using it. I tried this for a change and nothing great infact i broke out after using it. Not liking this product</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t sting at all, in fact it&#x27;s kinda hard to believe that it&#x27;s a toner, but I&amp;#34;m trying it for the first time and so far it hasn&#x27;t irrated my skin or increased my break outs.. which is a ++</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed by this product. It was too drying for my combo skin. I prefer aloe toners than the witch hazel.</li>
            <li> My favorite toner. I&#x27;ve been through bottles and bottles of this - it always leaves my skin feeling fresh and a slightly hydrated before I continue with the rest of my skincare routine. Sometimes I use it in the morning as a refresher.</li>
            <li> My clients just Love, Love, Love the smell and feel of this toner.  This is really good before a treatment on more sensitive clients.  I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction to any facial products until now. The smell was okay, and I have been using it for about 2.5 weeks.  I randomly get pimples.  However, I now have little patches that are dime sized on my face.  This is the onyl new thing introduced to my face, as nothing in my diet or anything else has changed.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s old or what.  I know Witch Hazel is fine, so it&#x27;s some other ingredient that doesn&#x27;t agree with me.  Not a product I&#x27;ll be using again.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love the very refreshing toner...it has the lightest cleanest smell. it is a slight slight rose smell but in a good way...The bottle came with the protective seal which made me feel good about the product being 100% pure and genuine.  I have also put some of this in a small spray bottle and but that in the fridge that I like to use as a little skin refresher during the day.  I will definitely buy this again.  It is a pretty big bottle and very much worth every penny.  If you are looking for a great feeling toner to use before moisturizer then you have found it right here with Thayers.</li>
            <li> Smells divine! I really love this product as well as the seller</li>
            <li> I LOVE this! It has really cleared up my face... And I have always had hard skin to manage. I use this 3x a day, and my face is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even had a friend come over who had a date at night, (because I am very into cosmetics and model) he trusted my judgement. I put this on his face, and it was TOTALLY clear by the evening!!</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this toner many times, I just love it. I wanted to try a different one and got the lavender one recently, but after that is finished I will go back to this one. The smell is amazing and the toner works great! Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Very soothing! There is a reason your Grandmother used it - it works. Helps with all kinds of issues from insect bites to tightening the skin, plus a host of others (check out this WebMD article: http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-227-witch%20hazel.aspx?activeingredientid&#x3D;227&amp;activeingredientname&#x3D;witch%20hazel). Highly recommended</li>
            <li> My face feels fresh and clean every time I apply!</li>
            <li> Received the next day.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days now, but it leaves my skin feeling refreshed and I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in the amount of whiteheads I get throughout the day.  I&#x27;ll definitely be keeping it in my day to day skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Best witch hazel ive found yet. Works great</li>
            <li> Extremely refreshing!</li>
            <li> Smells lovely.  Cleans the skin well.  Too pricey to continue to buy because I use it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> After reading tons of amazing reviews on this product I decided to go ahead and order it...and I am in love! It smells divine, makes my skin feel so soft, and I have noticed my skin is starting to look so much...fresher. I believe this will be one of those products I will use until the day I die. Who doesn&#x27;t love affordable, natural, skin care products?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is but my skin breaks out without this toner.  I started using it to be able to see if a new cleanser was getting all of my makeup and sunscreen off at night but it seems that the witch hazel and aloe are doing something right.  I&#x27;m not sure the rose does anything, but it smells nice and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, so I&#x27;ll take it.  It&#x27;s the only skin care product I have that smells nice (I&#x27;m anti-fragrance) so it&#x27;s a nice moment to cherish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put it in a pump-top bottle and use a couple pumps on a cotton ball to use the toner on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> A wonderful witch hazel with a subtle, true-rose scent, that dissipates within minutes (so men can use this without a worry of smelling &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34;).  Works beautifully on my skin as a toner (and in the armpits after shaving ;-).&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an alcohol-free witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, product as described</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product, was delivered before schedule date!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, been using it for years.  I have oily and combination skin, and it cleanses my skin wonderfully without overdrying, leaving it moisturized (has Aloe Vera) and not oily at all.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Wow love this.  Removes make up is gentle and just has a lovely scent.  It&#x27;s also a lot of product for the price.  I also have been using it in a spray bottle as a spritz to set my make up and after I wash my face for moisture before I put on my face oil.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son swears by this for his acne. His friends now buy it too.  Its much cheaper here than at Whole Foods and all the other health food stores I&#x27;ve compared pricing to.  I am now using it in my facial cleanser I make with essential oils.  I make my own because of very sensitive skin and my organic lifestyle. Works so well and definite improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is twice as much in the stores, best to buy it here. Witch Hazel is by far the best natural skin toner out there and I love the way the Rose Petal smells. Get a face steamer to pair with this and your pores will tighten up nicely.</li>
            <li> Thayers witch hazel has been a favorite staple in my facial routine for the last year compared to witch hazels you buy in store this surpasses them , alcohol free so no drying of your skin and the many scents it comes in is a plus makes my skin smell and feel great</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly and feels refreshing. I see a slight improvement to complexion.</li>
            <li> 32 yo female with combination, acne prone, melasma rich, pregnancy mask skin. I&#x27;ve been witch hazel as a toner. However I am Excited about all the added benefits to this formula. Rose petal water, witch hazel, aloe Vera juice, and vit e all in one product? I have only been using this for a week or so but no problems so far.  I look forward to putting this on everyday.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and feelings refreshed! I have acne and this definitely soothes it, plus the scent is a natural aloe and rose scent. Holy grail for sure!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, great product!</li>
            <li> This is my second attempt to leave a review. The first one was rejected so I will try to include the focus on Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera. The product, while it smelled amazing and felt great on the skin did not work for me. I ended up breaking out after three days of use which is not normal for me as an adult or even in my younger years. So why the 5 Stars? The Seller of the product I purchased, Oxkom, a family owned business that reaches out to their customer base to make sure expectations have been met. Outstanding customer service and I will absolutely purchase again through this business.</li>
            <li> This stuff sort of smells like my grandmother but as for its potency it works very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this twice now... I still have half a bottle left (it lasts a long time) but will absolutely be ordering again and again, and again. I&#x27;ve bought many toners/astringents over the years, many of which were on the high-end price wise, and I have never used one I like nearly as much as this one! It smells good and being alcohol-free is a huge plus. It does exactly what I want it to, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2-3 times a day. Just apply it with cotton balls - it&#x27;s quick and easy. I always use it after cleansing my face and before I apply my Arbonne serum and moisturizer in the mornings and at night before going to bed. It&#x27;s a great makeup remover, too. I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> My absolutely favorite toner!! It is non drying, all natural and it smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> very nice product. refreshing but don&#x27;t expect any magic out of it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to my daughter in law for getting me started with it. Very refreshingly&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> This was just as expected. Arrived as stated. This is wonderful stuff. I am so glad that I found it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. My pores shrunk instantly.</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff! It smells like roses and seems to do a great deep clean. I use it on my face, neck and in the little crevices of my ear to get everything squeaky clean. I will never go without owning this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought this toner about a month ago. I really love this stuff! It has helped keep my breakouts under control, and to keep the ph balance of my face in check. The rose smell is awesomeness too! Will continue to buy again!</li>
            <li> I really love the scent it has. And it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all. (I do have oily skin though and I also moisturize just so that&#x27;s clear.)</li>
            <li> Can fee the mild softing impact of the skin. Love it</li>
            <li> may be seeing a slight improvement in my skin tone but mostly I just like the rose smell. I use it to wipe off my face in the mornings and I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> Great toner, clears up my pimples in just a day or two and smells so refreshing. Not harsh at all, either.</li>
            <li> I like this toner a lot.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel is the absolute best to tone and soothe redness in the skin.</li>
            <li> Works wonders. It minimized pores, I thought it was a mole on my face, but it was actually an enlarged pore. I can barely see it now. The smell is great.</li>
            <li> Love the product, just used it for little over a week and find it very soothing. Great smell too!</li>
            <li> I love love love this stuff. Its wonderfully soothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this witch hazel.  I LOVE this stuff.  I use it in my daily toner mixed with Apple Cider Vinegar, tea tree oil, Lemon essential oil and some Tamanu oil.  Delivery was quick and the product arrived in excellent condition.</li>
            <li> I actually saw another reviewer who used this religiously before her wedding and she included her entire facial routine and I had to try it! I&#x27;ve been using this for almost 2 weeks. I love it soo much! I have even used it on my kids ant and mosquito bites, and it helped a lot. I love that it&#x27;s organic ingredients, no alcohol, and non-distilled witch hazel. It smells so. wonderful, I honestly can&#x27;t be happier with it. My skin has been a wreck since my pregnancies and I have a lot of tiny bumps, blackheads, hormonal flare-ups, and mostly scarring from squeezing which I really shouldn&#x27;t do but can&#x27;t help it. Since following this routine I find that my skin is obviously clearing up and it the best it&#x27;s been in years. Witch Hazel, Rose Petals &amp; Aloe is the perfect combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AM:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash my face with Alba Botanica: Natural Hawaiian Facial Cleanser Pineapple Enzyme&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera to dried face with a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3) Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Clear Difference Advanced Blemish Serum&lt;br /&gt;4) 2 Drops of Desert Essence Organic Jojoba Oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) If I wore makeup I use my regular Neutrogena Rapid Clear Oil-Eliminating Foaming Cleanser to get the mascara and heavy stuff off, and then use a little Shea Moisture African Black Bar Soap on my Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing Brush.&lt;br /&gt;2) Apply Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera to dried face with a cotton pad&lt;br /&gt;3) Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder Clear Difference Advanced Blemish Serum&lt;br /&gt;4) 2-3 Drops of Desert Essence Organic Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li> Soothing and smells nice. It&#x27;s a great toner.</li>
            <li> I love Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel. I use it every night to remove make up. It gives a nice glow and tightens pores. Update- since they changed the bottle this will be my last purchase. Packaging person at Thayer&#x27;s should be fired! Ugly short fat squatty ugly bottle.</li>
            <li> I love to apply this to my face after a nice shower and after a good shave with my double edge safety razor it finishes off my legs with a light scent and healing and replenishing property&#x27;s being put back into my skin!</li>
            <li> This toner smells nice, doesn&#x27;t burn, and leaves skin soft. Definitely saw an improvement in skin after a few day&#x27;s use. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice product! Makes your face feel so refreshed.</li>
            <li> Nice to put on my skin, but I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s benefiting my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Love this toner. I am now a repeating customer and would highly recommend it to others. :)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this twice and plan to purchase it again.  I have sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling soft, moisturized, and refreshed.  I use it every morning and before I go to bed.  It smells good too.  I have used toners in the past that felt to harsh on my skin, so I stopped using toners.  I&#x27;m glad I gave this one a try.</li>
            <li> Love this toner. I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated and this toner did not irritate my skin at all. I feel like it makes my complexion look more radiant and younger as well. I will DEFINITELY buy this again. Gentle and did not cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to incorporate this product into my daily routine. It&#x27;s really helped calm down large breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t make existing acne worse at all. It smells amazing, and isn&#x27;t overpowering to me or anyone I get close to. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that needs a toner in their routine!</li>
            <li> I started using this as toner on my face and love it! It doesn&#x27;t give that alcohol burn that I hate. I don&#x27;t notice any odors/fragrance, which is great because I generally prefer my beauty products not to have a scent. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I use as a toner after washing and my face feels amazing.  This will be my staple toner!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the fact that itnis alcohol-free..</li>
            <li> I will never use any other toner...this stuff is the best.</li>
            <li> Great scent and great toner! Keeps my face moist. Doesn&#x27;t necessarily treat acne, but I use it in conjunction with acne cream so it balances out. I&#x27;d rather use this (natural) over those acne toners that have alcohol and different chemicals.</li>
            <li> very hydrating without that sticky gunky sensation. smells of roses of course. great value</li>
            <li> The toner smells really good, and it&#x27;s very good value. Will def come back for more.</li>
            <li> Great product Perfect transaction</li>
            <li> I bought it with something else and used them together. My lips start to peal really bad. I think it&#x27;s caused by the other product because I have used this before two years ago. Not from Amazon tho.  Since I can&#x27;t return this, I&#x27;m going to give it another try when my skin calms down a little bit.</li>
            <li> Face feels soft after applying it, but the smell is that of a grandma style perfume. Haha</li>
            <li> It smelled pretty strong to me at first, but I got used to it and now it&#x27;s great! I&#x27;m not sure if it does anything, but combined with moisturizer, it keeps my face very hydrated with no dry patches.</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to get away from the Clean &amp; Clear Astringents. Not that I didn&#x27;t like them and they worked fine, but I wanted to go a more natural route and start being more conscious of the things I was putting on my skin. Skin absorbs these things after all, so it probably pays to be natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very gentle and has a subtle rose smell that I think is quite nice, when I look at my cotton ball at the end of the day I think it&#x27;s probably working as well as the chemical stuff, but also helps to minimize pores and it supposedly helps with aging, gotta start that process young!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not have any pimple fighting medicines in it, but that would defeat the purpose, and I think the witch hazel does essentially the same things just not so violently.</li>
            <li> I love Thayers Alcohol-free witch hazel products. However, you&#x27;ve really got to love the smell of rose perfume if you want to use this scent.  Way to strong a scent for me.  I use their cucumber in the a.m. and lavender in the p.m.  This one I tossed. Made my eyes water!</li>
            <li> Smells refreshing. Doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin even with regular usage</li>
            <li> I use three types of moisturizer at any given time, try a new shampoo every two weeks, and currently own at least 6 types of facial sunscreens. When it comes to cosmetics and skin care products, I love trying new things and very very rarely am content to use any product exclusively and consistently.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only toner I use. It is the only one I&#x27;ve used in at least half a year, and I do not have any plans to try any other toners.&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day: in the morning underneath my moisturizer and at night, after I cleanse my face. My skin is slightly on the dry end and gets dryer with certain, unfavorable ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This toner leaves my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed, and sated. It&#x27;s a weird feeling. I use oil-based moisturizers (i.e. with argan oil, sea buckthorn oil, calendula oil) so I was a little shocked that something so liquid could moisturize so well (Aloe Vera leaves me feeling dried out after 5 minutes). I also believe this has reduced the size of my pores slightly.&lt;br /&gt;I was inspired to purchase the Thayers witch hazel in peach after finishing half my existing rose bottle, but unfortunately the alcohol in it (rose is alcohol free) did not react so well with my face. I usually do not fragrances in skin care products, but I love the rose-y scent of this one.</li>
            <li> I Love it...I love the natural ingredients, and it smells heavenly.  I don&#x27;t know yet if the product does what it claims,,to soon to tell as I&#x27;ve only had it about a week.</li>
            <li> Omg only been using this for 2 days and I love it! I bought this toner at GNC about 2 days ago and use it after I wash my face in the morning and at night and I have very sensitive skin which toner usually burns but this stuff doesn&#x27;t burn and smells like fresh cut roses. I had acne scabs from popping my pimples and after using it 1 time before going to bed my scabs were healed and there was just a little redness from where they were. I have already noticed a difference in my skin after only 2 days. I&#x27;m so glad I found this toner!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product and the way it leaves my skin after application. I also used it for a diy mosquito repellant recipe and I love the smell in that too.</li>
            <li> I suppose &amp;#34;witch hazel&amp;#34; is &amp;#34;witch hazel&amp;#34;, but his one has a very pleasant aroma.  I love the way it gently removes residual traces of residue (soap, etc.) and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, easily irritated skin. My skin is very acne prone, I break to practically every product. I breakout so much to new things that I&#x27;m really in fear when I try new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed a new toner after making my own sea salt toner. The sea salt toner worked GREAT at diminishing my acne but after using it for too long, my face was turning red and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love rose water in general, my mom is from India and has grown up with so many natural products. She used to make rose water all the time. Anyways, I wanted witch hazel as well b/c I&#x27;ve read that it is good for skin ailments as well. I had used witch hazel along time ago on my skin and had a bad reaction (dried out and broke out) so I stayed away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw great reviews for this product so I tried it. At first, like any product my face turned dry/pinkish/red for the first 2 uses. Then my skin got adjusted to it and worked great. I think it has even helped my breaking out. Another tip, I dab the toner with cotton pad, I do not rub across my face. I noticed with any toner I have used, rubbing across my face and pimples only spread more bacteria and broke me out more. Dabbing helped get rid of acne and not spread it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product! I&#x27;m on my third bottle now! Love it more than everrr!</li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to like this product, every way I tried to use it, it just didn&#x27;t work out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to keep my facial routine as natural as possible, washing with raw honey and using alba botanica&#x27;s aloe&amp;green tea oil-free moisturizer, but I decided that I wanted to use a toner. My face is more of a normal-combination (normally, not to oily, but not too dry), but I had some bad break outs in the past that left some discolored scars/skin and I heard that witch hazel and rose water can help reverse those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came across this product in my search, and saw that they sold it at Whole Foods, I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;My face had started breaking out randomly, so when I began using the toner after washing and before moisturizing, and found even more break outs day after day.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give it a chance and thought maybe it was my skin \\&quot;purging\\&quot; or the \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; in it was causing the problem. I like the scent of roses and I didn&#x27;t think the smell was overpowering, but I read other reviews on other sites with people stating the same problem - the fragrance was breaking them out because their skin was/is sensitive to most fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;So, I went back to Whole Foods and bought the alcohol-free, unscented toner. I gave myself a few days of not using the Rose scented one to give my face a break, but when I started using the unscented one, the same thing happened, I got small breaks outs again, just not as severely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I decided to cut my losses and stopped using it on my face, but I had read that it could be used as an aftershave and, so I gave that a go instead of returning it.&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Didn&#x27;t work. My face cooled down and stopped breaking out, but I started getting a fair amount of weird pimples and breakouts and ingrown hairs on my legs which very very very rarely happens.&lt;br /&gt;I used both the rose and the unscented one as well as new razor blades, just in case it was my blade, and not the toner.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why it would cause this kind of reaction, especially since I use body lotions that have oils in them as well as aloe gel for my face after my moisturizer. My face isn&#x27;t severely sensitive either, so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it would have worked out, because it did work. Aside from the breakouts, old scars were fading, dark circles under my eyes looked lighter and less puffy, and I did like leaving the bathroom smelling of roses, but it would be a really strange catch-22 to use something that&#x27;s helping remove old scars but replacing them with new ones.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but I&#x27;ll continue my search for a good toner if I find I need it (i&#x27;ve recently changed to using derma e products), and just wear rose perfume, haha!</li>
            <li> At first this product was great. I enjoyed the scent and it toned my skin. After awhile the product clouded up and the smell has kind of a sour smell now. I will not buy this product again although I will keep the bottle and refill with another kind of witch hazel. The bottle was the main reason I was attracted to this product.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite toner. My skin loves it. Nice rose smell. Very refreshing but gentle. Non greasy, no alcohol. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Very very very strong scent. Couldn&#x27;t stand it and even my cat left the room when he caught a whiff.</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it twice a day after washing my face. My skin is smoother and the wrinkles softer (not as deep looking) and I find it to be a refreshing toner. I just ordered my second bottle of it!</li>
            <li> The product felt good on my skin. I just could not get past the scent. I found that I had to splash my face after applying to get rid of the smell. I bought the cucumber and it is great. I think it is all down to personal preference with scent.</li>
            <li> This has a lovely, light scent.  A great alternative to traditional witch hazel.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic when it comes to toner for skin care regimen. I used it only when it comes as a free gift or sample, but after I read couple reviews on youtube, and I checked on amazon, this toner is highly recommended by people, so I gave it a try. In my opinion this is the first toner worth to buy. I love the fact it doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol, I find the rose scent calms and soothes my skin right away after cleansing my face. I feel my skin is ready for my next step on my regimen. I would recommend this to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;Recently my coworker also bought this item after I recommended her, and she said she loves it. It doesn&#x27;t makes her skin dry.</li>
            <li> The rose scent is so great and it doesnt have any oil init so I really loved it will order it alter</li>
            <li> Amazing product and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> The product is definitely not what it&#x27;s hyped up to be. It smells really good but that&#x27;s about it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin and nor does it make my skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is my come-back product. Love the fragrant, not too powerful.  Delivery is fast. Thanks.</li>
            <li> no reason not to like</li>
            <li> I used this in the past and, while I loved the smell, wasn&#x27;t wowed by it. Recently, I decided to give it another shot, since now I use more makeup and did not want to dry my skin out with an alcohol-based toner. This toner doesn&#x27;t seem to do much in term so tightening pores but I find that it&#x27;s great as a refresher (the scent is really nice) and great to use at night after you wash your face to make sure you get all the makeup off. Often times after I use my face wash I still find remnants of makeup when I go over it with a cotton pad soaked in this toner.</li>
            <li> A soft smell of rose...not overpowering.</li>
            <li> A pretty, mild scent. I recommend this brand of Witch Hazel, that is.....Alcohol-Free! No sting, like some of the other&#x60;s. Well-worth the cost! I also recommend this seller~</li>
            <li> Great toner, didn&#x27;t dry me out. Love the smell. Winner!!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I love using all-natural remedies and this really does work great. Cleans your skin better than any other product out there and reduces pores without drying out your skin. It smells nice too.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for everyone, no matter what your age, to clean and protect your skin. Like most of these &amp;#34;Old Fashioned&amp;#34; remedies it also has a variety of different uses. Check it out on Google and you&#x27;ll see it has something for every problem that ails you.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Brand new and fast shipping</li>
            <li> soothing. aloe &amp; rose petal makes it gentler than witch hazel without. soothing; definite new medicine cabinet staple</li>
            <li> So great.  I can use this all over now.... before I had the Peach Witch Hazel, but it had alcohol in it which kept be from being able to use it all over.... now I can go around my eyes and have no irritation at all.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best toner ever! So glad I found this product! Will definetely purchase again when I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> I really like the light scent, and it does leave my face feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have to say I haven&#x27;t broke out with big pimples in awhile after using this product even under some moderately stressful situations. In addition, it has made my skin smoother and more refreshed. The size of my pores, however, look the same as ever. I still recommend this product though. The rose water scent smells funny, but you&#x27;ll get over it after using it for a week or so.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and I already notice a difference. It is very dry in Phoenix right now so my skin has been very dry as well. Using this product though has put moisture back into my skin so my face does not look so tired.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I am glad I tried it based off of others recommendations.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Made me breakout and was irritating to the skin. smelled good. will not recommend. Dark skinned male trying to treat for dark spots from ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this toner. If you are looking for something harsh, this is not for you. I usually mix this with lavender or tea tree oil and use as a toner at night and in the morning. It is calming and refreshing. Definitely a staple in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now, I am super happy with it! I have a slight case of rosacea on my cheeks and I have dark circles under my eyes, and since I have been using this my cheeks are not as red and the circles under my eyes are almost gone! This toner feels like satin going onto your skin! It&#x27;s like no other toner I&#x27;ve ever used before! I will say my pores are no smaller than before I started using this, but my skin looks and feels smoother than ever before! I will never use another toner as long as I live!! Hope this helps a skeptic like I was.</li>
            <li> I love this, my pores are shrinking, skin is smoother, and I love the rose  fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is the best witch hazel. Period.</li>
            <li> The cap was broken, tear punctured, product leaked...but i liked what&#x27;s left of the liquid inside.</li>
            <li> Really loved how it felt and worked on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is so happy now! :)</li>
            <li> Great Product! Will order more</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering this again. It&#x27;s wonderful. The scent is mild. It doesn&#x27;t burn my skin and it works!</li>
            <li> a must-have especially if you live somewhere with a lot of humidity, I live in Miami, FL so a good toner is a necessity.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will actually make me look 10 years younger after continuous usage, but I like the way the skin feels after applying the tonic. However, it doesn&#x27;t fit well for removing eye make-up, I have a tingling sensation and it doesn&#x27;t remove the mascara well.</li>
            <li> I use this for cleasing skin after wash and very good for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m feeling my skin is more clear and more smooth after using it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dogs&#x27; &#x27;hot spots,&#x27; and it works beautifully.  Like others here, I very much appreciate that it has no alcohol and that it is affordable, two unusual features of Witch Hazel.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews and I&#x27;m glad I did. At first my skin had some reaction to it, but then it was fine after several uses. My skin feels fresh and tight. I&#x27;m 31 years old and I stopped using my anti wrinkle creams months ago when I became pregnant. I wanted to use something more natural, and I think this helps my skin keep young. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet :)</li>
            <li> I used the full line of Thayer Witch toner w/ Aloe Vera. This rose pental scent is my favorite. I found so many use of it.</li>
            <li> I had about four things i was using in the morning to wash my face before I left for work. I threw all of that stuff away. All you need is this stuff and 2 cotton balls. Dab the cotton balls until they&#x27;re wet and rub gently on your face. Try to do it three times a day. I will always have a bottle of this stuff with me now.</li>
            <li> I have tried other witch hazel solutions in the past. I decided to take a chance since it has rose water in it which I really and no alcohol. I have been using this product fo 2 weeks and my face has seen some noticable improvements especially making pores smaller. Your face feels great. I&#x27;m 54 and have been trying for years to find a good toner.  I think I found it in this product. I ordered another one so I will never be without. One more thing it has a light scent of roses. I love using it!</li>
            <li> This Toner has worked miracles, this was purchased to replace the Proactiv toner I had been religiously using.  I want to say it&#x27;s even better than the Proactiv toner, I haven&#x27;t had one break out since using this product (3 months).  Doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry, nice pleasant light rose smell, awesomely priced, and works well with my sensitive skin.  A+++&#x27;s in my book.</li>
            <li> Very nice natural toner with good scent!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend putting it in a refrigerator, really refreshing :)&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on the skin and moisturizing.  I am 100% satisfied.  Also, a better deal here than the Whole Foods.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a natural, gentle toner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m often easily duped by \\&quot;beauty\\&quot; products. I often buy things only to be disappointed. So, although I had high hopes for Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel AF Toner, a small part of me was preparing for disappointment. But I was so happy to be proven wrong! This product is great. I have sensitive skin with some light acne marks, I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a week and a half and my skin loves it! It leaves my skin soft, and isn&#x27;t irritating at all. It even feels like it&#x27;s buffing out some of my discoloration. All in all, a great buy and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough :)</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and tight. has a nice little rose smell but not old lady overwhelming. Havent really seen a huge improvement with my skin but I think with a little more time....</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using Clinque&#x27;s Clarifying Lotion but it had been very drying to the skin. Seeing as I&#x27;m a sucker for organics I gave this a shot, and I&#x27;M IN LOVE. It is not drying to my skin and I love the rosewater scent. Leaves my skin feeling clean but not dehydrated.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling product.  I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel as a toner/cleanser for a while, but the kind I was using was full of alcohol and didn&#x27;t smell all that great.  Thayer&#x27;s is gentler and leaves my skin feeling soft.  The rose scent is quite nice, not heavy like it can get, but fades after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> perfect for all skin types</li>
            <li> The toner has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t burn skin. Works very very well. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. It makes my skin so clear, and really hydrates it, even without a moisturizer. I don&#x27;t do we&#x27;ll with moisturizers, since my skin is so sensitive, so this really helps out.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful. Though I cannot really tell if it&#x27;s working, ( i have this issue with other toners ), i use it everyday and I have maintained a nice complexion. Maybe it is because of this! Also, I use this to wash my makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Love the toner itself, BUT when it arrived, my package was wet and the bottle was leaking from the lid. There was plastic around the cap, but the cap had become unscrewed somehow and about 1.5 oz of the product had leaked out. Not a huge deal, but a bit frustrating.</li>
            <li> The smell is exactly what I wanted it to be. Subtle, feminine, and not overly astringent. I cannot believe I have not heard of or tried this product before! I just received it so I&#x27;m unable to comment on what the results will ultimately be- but just based on trying it a few times it seems to be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Nice smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It does not dry out my skin and it smells amazing! The sellers are great as well! Fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Feels so great on the skin, I can really see an improvement. I use this and the black soap, on a daily basis. My skin is really improving, I also use the Aztec Indian Clay mask, this combination is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if I was going to like this toner - mainly worried that I&#x27;d smell like a grandma - (what does a grandma really smell like? Hmmm...I&#x27;m being ageist here probably ;-)) but I really like the smell and it&#x27;s very nice on my skin, I have dry to medium skin and I could use the hydration and I&#x27;m one of those people who likes to feel squeaky clean but reaching for the rubbing alcohol as a toner...not such a good idea.  And I use regular witch hazel but I was looking for something extra soothing and this is really nice.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll reorder it but right now I&#x27;m using it and liking it ;-)</li>
            <li> helped acne but no that much</li>
            <li> I bought this with the intent to use on postpartum relief pads. Great use for that! However, on my face not so much... I found that my face became more oily using this. I do tend to have oiler skin. Probably won&#x27;t continue to use on my face. But there are other things to use it for, so I&#x27;ll get use out of it...</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this toner.  It is amazing!!!!!  Alcohol free, leaves my skin toned and refreshed.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s the simplest things that make a difference. With no harsh chemicals, this gentle and naturally fragrant alcohol-free toner seems to truly improve the condition of my skin. It appears softer, smoother and more even-toned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on revamping my face care routine and thought I would give this a try. I really love it. Its nice when you don&#x27;t want an astringent/toner that feels like it is burning your face off. The smell is pleasant and old-fashioned. Sometimes to give it a little more oomph I add a drop of tea tree oil on the cotton and it works great.</li>
            <li> Seriously, didn&#x27;t even get the usual PMS breakout. My skin&#x27;s not super bad, but I usually used to have one or two zits at a time, with the bigger breakout mentioned above. I&#x27;ve been using this toner (didn&#x27;t use toner before) once or twice a ready most days (I also started using pond&#x27;s evening soothe wipes nightly, which helped) for the past 11 days, and my skin is completely clear! Highly recommended. Also, pleasant event and refreshing feel.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;The rose smell very good! Not too strong!&lt;br /&gt;And it nice to use! Easy and quick.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> This toner gave me horrible tiny bumps and clogged all of my pores. I am amazed at all the positive reviews! The toner does not remove any dirt whatsoever and presumably opens up your pores and then clogs them with the help of rose oil. This doesn&#x27;t happen to everyone but if you have sensitive skin, it will eventually happen to you. My face has not been the same ever since Ive used it...the bumps are still there and I have perioral dermititis and it&#x27;s been about 4 months. STAY AWAY...you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Ingredients are not that harmful (I&#x27;ve checked its ingredients on a cosmetics database website, the level of its harm is very low. Though I won&#x27;t totally believe that website, but it makes some sense). I use my cotton ovals to do mask with it twice daily after cleansing, it feels so comfortable and gentle after applying it. I ran out of it within 20 days due to my large amount of usage every day. So I ordered the cucumber toner a few days ago (even less harmful than rose one by the database website). I highly recommend this toner. A great try!</li>
            <li> I am sold on witch hazel for reducing wrinkles but this one is great because there is no alcohol so it&#x27;s not drying. It smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> Smells nice but haven&#x27;t really noticed any kind if difference in my skin... I have acne-prone combination skin and for the dry spots on my face, it doesn&#x27;t quite moisturize them enough. Within 30 minutes they&#x27;re peely again. My skin doesn&#x27;t really feel any softer and doesn&#x27;t really glow either haha... Oh well, will probably just use this to make my face smell nice and use a 2nd moisturizer in the areas I need.</li>
            <li> My favorite toner from now on!</li>
            <li> I had never used a toner before, but my face has been so dry and no amount of moisturizer would help. I started using this in combination with blacks soap, and coconut oil and man my face has never been clearer or so soft. I love this stuff . It smells really nice but the scent does not linger. So this is a good buy!!!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> Makes my face very radiant and soft. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> This was my second order for this product.  I have sensitive skin on my face so was hesitant to use but my sister is an esthestitian &amp; uses a rose water product that costs A LOT more.  I decided to give this much more cost effective product a try.  I love it!!!  I wash my face every night so use this every morning to clean my skin prior to applying a serum &amp; sunscreen moisturizer.  My skin feels so fresh &amp; the smell is light, but beautiful.  I&#x27;ll continue to use as long as I can get it!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of rosewater in products and, although it&#x27;s a mild smell here, it&#x27;s still nice.  I have only started using this toner but I am a great believer in reading Amazon reviews and so many people raved about this product I had to try it and have high hopes for it to do all the things other reviewers say it does.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. Don&#x27;t skimp and buy your mother&#x27;s typical witch hazel which is diluted with alcohol. It can burn delicate areas and dehydrate the skin. This Rosepetal witch hazel not only is a lovely toner, but you can safely put it anywhere to quell inflammation. Anywhere! I have a bottle in my bathroom and one beside my bed. Smells gorgeous as well.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and cleanses skin very, very well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Smells amazing and leaves your face feeling uber fresh. Rosey, if you will ;-).&lt;br /&gt;Just purchased my second bottle... lasted me about a year!</li>
            <li> For years I mixed my own toner, until I found this. It is better than what I made, since the aloe makes it even more gentle. Smell is delicate and pleasant and it does an knock-out job removing last traces of makeup. Reasonably priced, too, and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> I do not use a toner in my daily skin regime but decided to give this product a try after accidently running across it and reading all the rave reviews. First of all I am over 50, fair, and have normal skin that is in pretty good condition. I tried this toner after cleansing my face in the evening and found that it removed more dirt/grime from my face but I expected that. What really suprised me was that it didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. My skin felt clean, firm and a bit dewey. Not sure what else it is supposed to do for you but I am going to continue and use it and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Awful. Caused me to break out horribly.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading so much about toners. After reading the reviews, I thought that I&#x27;d try this brand. I love the smell, I never noticed remaining dirt or makeup on the cotton ball. I gave it 4 stars for I found it to be a bit drying on my skin. I&#x27;m fighting dry skin as it is. I would recommend it to those who have more of a combination or oily skin type. I realize that Witch Hazel is an astringent, so it may also help those who have breakouts. I don&#x27;t have that problem, so can&#x27;t help you there. I&#x27;m not sure if buy again, for I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m really in need for a toner of this type. Thanks and much luck to you!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toner!  I purchased this back in April of this year.  Wanted something that was alcohol free and animal cruelty free ( no testing on animals).  This stuff is great!  It smells wonderful, removes the extra makeup washing or make-up wipes leave behind and it leaves my skin feeling wonderfully smooth!  This product has me hooked for life.  Highly recommend &amp;#34;Thayer - Witch Hazel Toner-Rose Petal Alcohol  Free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I like the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> This is the best all - around toner I&#x27;ve ever used. Smells fantastic and leaves a healthy glow to my skin. The product arrived in perfect condition and shipping was on time.</li>
            <li> Great as a face toner I love this product doesn&#x27;t hurt to give it  a try.</li>
            <li> This toner has become a staple in my skin care regime. I have actually started stockpiling it; and that&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never done with any other product. My skin tends to be on the dry side and this toner leaves my skin feeling moisturizer and refreshed.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit much, I was expecting it to be more subtle - but I&#x27;ve seen a noticeable reduction in my pore size. Which is all that really matters. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling really dry like other toners do.</li>
            <li> This does make my skin softer than it does clearer.  But, I do see results in how my skin appears, although minor.  I had a huge rash from an allergic reaction the other day, then put this stuff all over it and, the next morning, my skin was very clear in comparison to the night before.  I actually just use my fingers to rub it on instead of a cotton ball, which seems to work better for me.  The smell is nice, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now. Although I have a more intense beauty regiment because I suffer from hyperpigmentation, I use several several different products, I love this product. I use facial cloths and sometimes scrubs in the evening to remove my make up. After that I use this product and it removes a lot of left over make up which I cannot believe a scrub leaves behind. If for no other reason use this product to remove the residue left behind by cleansers or facial cloths. Plus it&#x27;s alcohol free which us older women need because we need the oil in our face to maintain youthful look.</li>
            <li> Loving this toner even more every time I use it..</li>
            <li> Use it every day.  It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I no longer use moisturizer! This is natural, has vitamin E, and moisturizes my skin enough to not have to use a lotion/cream type moisturizer. I have combination skin that&#x27;s dry around my chin and cheeks, and oily on my t-zone. This product has made my skin so soft, I no longe have dry patches. It hasn&#x27;t made my oily areas better, but it hasn&#x27;t made them worse either so that&#x27;s a plus! I don&#x27;t plan on going back to using creams on my face anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the smell. I noticed some reviewers on here mentioned they didn&#x27;t like it, and how it didn&#x27;t smell like roses. Well, to me it smells just like roses. Maybe they were comparing it to the perfumes that claim to smell like roses? Because this obviously does not smell like a perfume, this scent is more natural and pure. It doesn&#x27;t linger on your face though, so after a few minutes I can&#x27;t smell it on my face.</li>
            <li> I like the toner and the smell.  It is more expensive than some of the other comparable witch hazel toners.  After using the whole bottle, I switched to another brand that was half the price, but it really made my face feel tight and dry and didn&#x27;t smell as nice.  I think I am going to swich back and pay the extra money.</li>
            <li> i have mixed this with gycerin and rose water to make a wonderful setting spray..usally put it on a cotton ball over my eyes and all over.. great scent and not bland like normal hazel.. will def be ordering again since i cant find this anywhere!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of toner and I will continue to buy it.  Leaves my skin feeling smooth and over time, it has evened my skin tone.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Use this in conjunction with Raw African Black Soap.  Seems to be working but just a bit slow.  Will continue use.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin others commented on how great product was they didnt even need moisturizer.  Well if you have dry skin you do not want to use this it is VERY drying.  Had to stop using.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I bought reg witch hazel from Walmart and omg the smell makes me gag. This stuff is so much better! Smells so good and feels great on my face. Ill be ordering another bottle soon so I won&#x27;t run out since I use it so much.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this toner has been the best for it. Lovely scent, too.</li>
            <li> FINALLY  a toner that doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.  Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> Very good product no break outs helps heal my skin and it is an amazing moisturizer</li>
            <li> I grew up with a skin care freak and I learned ahead of time that toners are a great addition to and care routine and this toner... is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a week of using it the pores on my nose were getting smaller andI looked more bright and dewy. I love the smell it can be strong for some but it dissipates as soon as the product is dried. Well worth it and a giant bottle for the quality and price.</li>
            <li> Was good, but not I&#x27;m addicted to Dickerson&#x27;s watch hazel</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before and love the clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> Simple product great for sensitive skin. Tones and moisturizes without drying or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This product works so well. I love this product.It is amzong. It smelts like rose.</li>
            <li> Works great for my irritated dry skin. Great for refreshing spritz during the day.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I use it a couple times a day, I have an oily face, and I break out around the chin/mouth area. This has drastically reduced breakouts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying my toners from the local drugstore for years. I haven&#x27;t been able to find one that I was truly impressed with. I bought this about a week ago and I&#x27;m happy to say that I will be returning to buy more when the bottle is empty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about this toner:&lt;br /&gt;The smell. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming, it&#x27;s a nice, faint whiff of rose.&lt;br /&gt;The softening effect. It leaves a clean, soft, and refreshing after effect.&lt;br /&gt;No Alcohol. No alcohol means no drying, or harsh products on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera - helps soothe the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do that great at removing my eyeliner but I can always use makeup remover pads for that.</li>
            <li> I poured this witch hazel into a small, travel-size spray bottle to use it as a refreshing spray. Has a lovely, old-fashioned rosewater fragrance. Very cooling and soothing on sunburned skin, too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a toner in years, but I recently ran across a review of Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I quickly realized what I&#x27;d been missing. First off, the smell is amazing. So clean and pretty without being overwhelming. And it did a great job of getting all the makeup residue off from my skin even after using a makeup wipe. And it just makes my skin feel so fresh and clean. I especially like to use it right before bed. The scent relaxes me and helps me fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that made my skin feel clean, refreshed, and moisturized. And this is exactly what I got with this product. I try to limit the amount of chemicals that I expose myself to so I love knowing that this product has natural and organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> hands down, the best toner ever. will repurchase for a long time. smells amazing, leaves face clean refreshed. amazing natural ingredients. loooove it.</li>
            <li> use it everyday, love it</li>
            <li> VERY FRIENDLY USE, I THINK I have a dry skin, and this product helps looks nice, no peeling feel any more. And I also bought for my mom and sister, but have not asked them about the review. Should be ok, will update.</li>
            <li> you sent me a old product and it dose not smell like a rose at all.I will buy it from a different place the next time.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my skin feel! I will order more soon.</li>
            <li> Great toner and a fantastic smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this and the gentle cleansing.</li>
            <li> Ive been using for my acne!its a miracle worker its clearing up</li>
            <li> it is amazing product, me and my friends bought this&lt;br /&gt;really notice changes&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend it to all</li>
            <li> No use. But is look good.</li>
            <li> Thank you! So far loving this product. Smells great too</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and couldn&#x27;t use toner&#x27;s which contains alcohol as it dries up my skin resulting in dry patches on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve been using this toner for more than 2 weeks now and i must say that i&#x27;m totally in love with this product, i&#x27;ve used this in conjunction with skin laboratory&#x27;s 20% Salicylic acid peel and this toner has helped my skin heal quickly and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I use to have large pores but ever since I&#x27;ve used this with skin laboratory&#x27;s 20% Salicylic acid peel my pores have shrunk tremendously and i can feel my skin tighten and to think that I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 2 weeks, imagine what it can do to my skin in the long run... Thayer&#x27;s have got me hooked, lined and sinkered am never gonna be without this product ever again!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin looks much better since I&#x27;ve been using it. My pores are smaller too.  It&#x27;s not as harsh as some toners I&#x27;ve used in the past.I will keep using it!!</li>
            <li> It smells great and is very gentle and refreshing</li>
            <li> I cannot be more pleased by this product. It is great and it makes my skin firmer than it was before. I feel great as well. Will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, works great</li>
            <li> love this product and have used it for many years</li>
            <li> A great Product! {MCS} User Friendly!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My skin feels incredibly refreshed and clean. I can even see the dirt and makeup residue on the cotton pad that the witch hazel picks up. The scent is light and quite nice.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. This is probably about the third or fourth time I&#x27;ve ordered it. It lasts quite awhile. The scent is absolutely amazing, and it tightens and clears pores VERY well. I use this in conjunction with homemade honey and brown sugar scrub and palmer&#x27;s face moisturizer. I am very pleased with this product, and will continue to order this.</li>
            <li> I use it as a toner. It does not have any irritation to my face. I feel very comfortable after each use. Will continue to purchase the product. I wish I would have used it earlier.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly.  I love it. It&#x27;s gentle yet effective.</li>
            <li> I love this! It smells so good and leaves my skin very fresh!</li>
            <li> I love this product! Very gentle on the skin. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for a few days (as a toner) and already see fantastic results. I have blackheads, large pores, and light acne scars and my skin looks tighter and brighter. I can&#x27;t wait to see what a whole bottle will do!</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry area, so I stopped washing my face in the morning I only wipe my face with a skin lotion on a cotton.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice and cleans well. It moisturizes pretty well too.&lt;br /&gt;As the product advertises, it feels mild and good for those who have sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I just used my second bottle; I&#x27;ll probably keep using it until I find a better product.</li>
            <li> This toner is very delicate, smells like roses and does not dry your skin while removing dirt and makeup. I use it twice a day, before moisturizer in the morning and before night cream. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> hope they would come up with products like this. gentle but very effective. i am a fan! i will definitely refill!</li>
            <li> Organic, the best and the rose scent is very pleasant.  Good product to use in your skin care.  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> Use:&lt;br /&gt;For use as a daily facial toner, makeup remover, light moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Purified Water, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice (Certified Organic Filet of Aloe Vera), Glycerin (Vegetable), Fragrence (Natural Rose), Hamamelis Virgiana (THAYERS proprietary un-distilled Certified Organic Witch Hazel) Extract, Rose Centifolia (Rose) Flower Water, Citric Acid Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Seed Extract, Tocopheryl (Vitamin E) Acetate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal Experience:&lt;br /&gt;Let me start off by saying I LOVE using witch hazel as a facial toner/cleaner/astringent.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product from Natural Grocers because they didn&#x27;t have Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel (the brand I used to use).  I&#x27;ve heard good things about rose water for your skin so I decided to try it.  I&#x27;ve used this product 2-3x a day for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It works great as a light moisturizer.  I can wash my face with a 2% Salicylic Wash (pretty darn drying) and then apply this toner and I don&#x27;t have to apply lotion.&lt;br /&gt;It smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe and Rose water are supposed to be beneficial to skin.&lt;br /&gt;It cleans dirt off of my skin, it&#x27;s satisfying to see the dirty cotton ball and know that dirt is no longer on your face!&lt;br /&gt;On par with Humphrey&#x27;s Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural and I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;When I use this product in the morning or during the day it makes my face oily.  However, it is summer time so perhaps I will not experience this effect so much in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;I think if this product didn&#x27;t have glycerin in it, I wouldn&#x27;t be experiencing an excessive oil issue.&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin can also cause allergic reactions in some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product.  It is effective at removing dirt from the day.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping or hurting my current mild-moderate acne (but I believe it is mostly hormonal).  I wish it didn&#x27;t make my face oily, so when I run out of this bottle I&#x27;ll wait until winter to buy another, and look for a different witch hazel product that doesn&#x27;t contain glycerin.</li>
            <li> This product had a lot good reviews. I decided to give it  a try and I&#x27;m glad I did. My skin feels very good after applying this toner. It smells good too. I use it twice a day before applying moisturizer. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner on my face and absolutely love this!  The rose smell is wonderful and this leaves my skin feeling very soft.  I have also put some in a spray bottle with water and freshen my skin periodically throughout the day.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase.  I love the fact that this is alcohol free!!!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this product is balancing out my skintone. It leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> this toner is mild that will not makes you pricking. and this rose type really smells rose. it may too sweet scented for some users but i am ok with that</li>
            <li> I got my first wrinkles going on my forehead so I bought all the creams and stuff, including this.  After 4 days of the other stuff I decided to also throw in this toner and wow, I felt and saw a difference.  After applying it, you feel it as it&#x27;s drying and my wrinkles definitely looked not as imprinted on my skin.  So now I always apply this first after washing my face... then the other stuff.</li>
            <li> The product is good and feels very gentle on the skin. Delivery is fast too with good packaging.</li>
            <li> I had been having some issues with redness, and dry, flaking skin on my face for a bit. This was unusual for me as I&#x27;d never really had issues with my skin. I ordered this and began using it daily, and my skin has greatly improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sort of like the scent myself, but I will admit it is dead on for &amp;#34;old lady smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i ordered this from amazon because i have read so many good things about this toner. i was so excited when my package arrived but the toner was not clear like i expected it to be. i contacted thayer about it and told me i should return it for it may be harsh on my skin because there was a batch with extra witch hazel that did not pass their standards. i just wish they did not sell them if they did not pass the quality inspection or whatever. returning the item would cost me half the price i paid for so i guess i won&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this product every night and it has helped her teenage skin very much. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn my face, smells decent. Feels soft unlike any other toner I&#x27;ve used when I put it on. I would continue using this after experimenting with quite a few.</li>
            <li> I dont know if they changed the formula, this felt different from previous 2 bottles that I used.&lt;br /&gt;It burnt my skin!!! Also the smell was little bit different from previous ones.</li>
            <li> I only got this for the toner with rose scent. I like a real -scent , not fake perfumey scent. THIS IS PERFECT. I&#x27;m also a 22 year old single mother of many pets, and a little accident prone. I was badly burnt and this healed it almost over night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not oily or sticky. If you have oily skin like me, you wipe a cotton ball across your face and voila! it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is great! It gently cleanses your skin without drying it out. The scent it leaves behind is very light and attractive. Put some on a cotton ball and sweep it across your face. It leaves your skin looking great, too. It&#x27;s great for on the go! I use it to remove the makeup under my eyes when I wake up in the morning (lol). I&#x27;ve had this bottle for about 6 months, use it regularly, and still have some left. I love using natural products on my skin, and this has definitely become a \\&quot;staple\\&quot; for me!</li>
            <li> love it, i used a week and feel like my skin get better, maybe next time i will try the another thayers</li>
            <li> So good for your skin. love it</li>
            <li> Love the smell, and I can feel my skin is improving after 3~4weeks, will keep using it and see how it goes</li>
            <li> I use this to cleanse my face before bed. It smells nice and helps my acne be not quite as bad.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t irritate. Sometimes I use it as perfume.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it helps your face look more clean clear and younger looking. The product also showed a difference when my 56 year old mother used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28, and newly battling acne and the onset of fine lines. I bought this based on the reviews and I am so glad I did. I noticed an improvement after the first use. My acne started drying up. I use this morning and night after washing my face and use a light moisturizer after applying. I will repurchase and will be trying some of the other Thayer&#x27;s products in the future!</li>
            <li> I have finally found my perfect Toner- and this is coming from a self-described, product junkie. I love this toner. It&#x27;s alcohol free so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, but it contains witch hazel which helps with breakouts and tightening pores. And then there&#x27;s a lovely rose scent, that makes me happy every time I use it. Plus it&#x27;s paraben-free- which is something very important to me. One of these bottles lasts me at least 2-3 months, so the price is actually pretty reasonable. I definitely plan on purchasing this toner again and again. :)</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become dryer and more sensitive. I can&#x27;t use harsh soap and alcohol based toners anymore without my skin feeling parched. I was a little concerned about ordering this because regular witch hazel doesn&#x27;t smell good. This stuff is a bit different. It has a very light rose scent and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out when I use it. Plus, Thayers is completely cruelty free and has a strong statement on their website about being cruelty free. I use this as the second step in my morning and evening cleansing routine and stuff that my cleansing wipes and face washes miss, is caught by Thayers. Yet, it leaves my skin smooth and soft. I highly recommend this to those who want to use a toner, but don&#x27;t want their skin stripped dry. This is one of my new favorite things!</li>
            <li> I love the way this product feels on my skin! I refridgerate the bottle because I LOVEEEE the feeling of that cooling sensation on my face after I gave it a good cleaning with warm water. It takes off traces of dirt and makeup that my facewash left behind!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: IT SMELLS SOOOO LOVELY! ANNNND it doesnt dry out my skin!~</li>
            <li> ive been struggling with my acne for years and years and this stuff has helped more t han anything has in ages. it makes me so happy. And i&#x27;m glad it arrived on time with my other products.</li>
            <li> pleasant and tightens up my skin.</li>
            <li> Great price a Red Heads best friend</li>
            <li> Good quality. Received item fast. Would recommend...My wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Great combination for healthier skin! Moisturizes very well. Refrigerate so when you apply, there&#x27;s a refreshing &amp; cool sensation! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few days and I can already tell you that I love it. My pores feel so clean, but it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out at all! In fact, I usually have to moisturize my face A TON after washing it, but if I use this toner after I was my face, I don&#x27;t feel as dry! It&#x27;s awesome. I love the smell and I love that it&#x27;s organic. What a great find.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, refreshing witch hazel that has a lovely rose petal smell. I put it on in the mornings and at night. My skin is softer since I have been using it. But it just feels really nice on the skin, especially if I can remember to put it in the fridge on hot days. Feels wonderful after exercising to apply some of this when it has been cooled. The price is great, and the quality is exceptional. A wonderful skin soother.</li>
            <li> This smells so great! Smells like an actual rose or &#x27;cooking use&#x27; rose water not fake smelling at all.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use plain witch hazel ever again. We used to use a neutragena pore product but this smells and feels better.</li>
            <li> Acne suffer for over 15 yrs. This toner makes my skin soft without making it greasy, absorbs oil, and has dramatically improved the appearance of my skin. I am addicted!!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. And a little cheaper than Whole Foods :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love THAYERS toners, personally i like the lavender witch hazel better, however this one is also pretty good.  The scent on the lavender (in my opinion) is better.  I had pretty bad acne, those that are under the skin, pus, inflamed.  I visited dermatologists, used Proactiv and Proactiv+ for a couple of years and countless OTC products.  Some were somewhat effective, others none at all.  I added THAYERS to my daily face cleansing routine and my skin has been amazing.  I have a glow!!!! No more outbreaks.  I still have the acne scars, but I actually feel confident to leave home without make up, cover up.  I bought two more bottles.  This was a game changer for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as an alternative to treat an re occurring skin rash. It didn&#x27;t work that well on that. However it works wonders on mosquito bites! I use it to clean my face at night and it removes all of the oil but still allows your skin to feel moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li> Amazing result, i have been using this product since two weeks but meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen...my skin has never felt this good never......i usually associate it with st Ives produc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon for selling this product so cheap,that someone like me can own 1.</li>
            <li> I use this toner twice a day as part of my skin regimen.  Overall it smells lovely and makes my pores feel tighter.</li>
            <li> This is a great witch hazel toner that is completely alcohol free.  The aloe vera and rose petals are really soothing on the skin.  I have sensitive skin that has a tendency to be quite dry and most toners aggravate this issue this one does not.  I bought it multiple times and have never been disappointed.  It is sometimes hard to find in person so this is a great solution for that and it&#x27;s not more expensive if anything it&#x27;s less.</li>
            <li> It has a very lovely rose smell, and I like it~!! It works well on my combination skin and I use it to make paper mask.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on a whim and will always have this on hand. I use this as an everyday toner. It&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s just rose petal witch hazel. None of that miscellaneous chemical stuff that overloads my former Clinique toner.</li>
            <li> Pleasant and refreshing product with a soft rose scent, cleans my face and leaves it feeling fresh</li>
            <li> Good stuff! No alcohol! And by the way, the rose scent is NATURAL, not artificial, as some reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li> This item is one of a kind -- it&#x27;s the best skin toner that I have ever used.  It contains no harsh chemicals and leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.  I can definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> Best toner ever !  Worth ten times more than other expensive brands !</li>
            <li> My pores look so much smaller and this smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Really great as far as witch hazel goes but its still a little harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> I luv this stuff!  The aroma of the rose is soothing to the senses and the aloe vera soothing to the face.  The labeling is very pretty and has a vintage look.</li>
            <li> its calming for the skin, It helps with acne, scaring and redness on the face or scars.</li>
            <li> Just what it says, works great, and smells like roses!</li>
            <li> Works well.  My skin is dry.  This product doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.  It cleans anything left behind after cleansing.  I notice a cleaner feel overall to my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Exactly the same as what is found at Super Supplements or Vitamin Shoppe (et.al). Kept meaning to go to the store and this was a much more convenient way of meeting my facial needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those that haven&#x27;t used this product, it&#x27;s awesome. Don&#x27;t waste time with expensive toners... I mux in a little Orange essential oil into this so it&#x27;s a rose/vitamin C toner. I also half it with water so it&#x27;s not as strong. You can also use it on your legs after shaving and it decreases razor-burn! Fun fact I learned from an esthetician.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible, making me sick. I tried to get over the smell but could not even fall asleep. I will try the unscented version instead. If you don&#x27;t like strong rose fragrance you should stay away with this one&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After giving it a try I start to love it. The smell is not so intense in the day time when I move around from time to time and have to focus on work. It does leave the skin feel soft and refreshed. I also use it on my hands and even hair.</li>
            <li> First off, my product was shipped and delivered on time, and arrived completely in tact, sealed and everything. I&#x27;m very pleased!!&lt;br /&gt;I have never used this particular product, I am a repeat buyer of dickensons witch hazel, but this stuff has rose water which benefits the skin more than witch hazel alone. I love it, it has a nice scent and soothes my dry combination skin. I give this product and seller a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using witch hazel. This product, combined with my new moisturizer is PERFECT for my skin. I use it in the morning and in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is non irritating and leaves my skin soft and refreshed, just as promised. I have combination skin, which is oily/normal in summer and normal-oily/dry in winter. My skin is also sensitive even with products that are labeled natural and don&#x27;t contain synthetic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer wear foundation or face powders because my skin is flawless! I do not have over production of oil, my skin is not as dry in the cheek area, and my pores are minimized. The truest test however will happen in the summertime when my skin tends to be the most temperamental. I will update this review then.</li>
            <li> My favorite toner!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this witch hazel. The Rose Petal version smells amazing and is moisturizing and very hydrating. It is soothing and a great facial toner. I have tried many brands of witch hazel and this brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is the best toner for my very sensitive skin. I use it daily without any adverse effects. It leaves my face feeling clean and fresh without residue. I have also used it on my legs after shaving and epilating. It is very soothing and reduces irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week and absolutely love it! It&#x27;s gentle on my skin and leaves it very soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a great toner to use and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin.  I purchased it since it&#x27;s supposed to reduce facial hydrosis but it also has a lot of other benefits such as Aloe Vera and Vitamin E.  I would purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It&#x27;s gentle and smells great.  It removes dirt and grime very well and leaves my skin looking fresh.  Will be my go to toner from now on.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It has helped with my acne. I haven&#x27;t really seen any difference with my  hyperpigmentation but I know that will take some time. All of this time I&#x27;ve thought I was getting my face pretty clean, but when wiping my face with a cotton swab with this it does pull dirt off my face. This rose water is natural and doesn&#x27;t break my face out like.</li>
            <li> Use 2xs a day. Smells wonderful and great price</li>
            <li> Holy cow this stuff is amazing! Just buy it. The sent is lovely!</li>
            <li> It smells good.  It helps eczema on my face too</li>
            <li> This was my choice of more natural toner while I am pregnant. I got a lot of pregnancy acne and I couldn&#x27;t use my regular acne products. It is alcohol free, so it&#x27;s gentle on my skin and I notice that my skin is smother and less irritated (red). It is not a miraculous product but it get the job done. The only thing is the smell, it&#x27;s not bad and it fades away, but it has that old fashion smell that remind me of my grandma beauty routine when I am using it. Other than that, I recommend this toner.</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the scent; it&#x27;s not too overpowering. Helps my skin feel less oily throughout the day. I use it in to morning after cleansing and exfoliating and at night before night cream.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s smell isn&#x27;t as strong as the one I bought last time. But I still believe it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells wonderful and I have had significantly fewer breakouts since using it. My skin tone has also improved.</li>
            <li> amazing leave my skin soft ,whiting&lt;br /&gt;my skin is normal&lt;br /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> This was a reorder. I really like this product. It&#x27;s great to put on a cotton ball and go over my face after I wash it.  It&#x27;s amazing how much&lt;br /&gt;it removes and cleans. It smells good and adds moisturizer rather than drying my face out.</li>
            <li> not bad, really, a little bit too floral for me at the first sniff, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me now. Very Fresh feeling on your face.</li>
            <li> love the smell. Ive never used a toner but its a nice soothing feeling prior to after shave. Next time I may buy a more neutral or unscented version</li>
            <li> I use this everyday. It smells lovely, and is very refreshing. Highly Recommended.</li>
            <li> Great toner. The rose fragrance is perfect -- not overpowering.  Since this toner&#x27;s alcohol free, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> LOVE. I&#x27;ve been using it three times a day...morning splash, mid-day refresher, and bedtime must. Makes my face clean, fresh and extremely soft. Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It is awesome! My skin is very sensitive. I have tried many brands of toner. It is the best one.  I really want to recommend it to the person who with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> on time delivery and perfect packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Love the product and would recommend</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical about this at first, and the first time I used it wow I was amazed. It took off so much dirt and made my face feel so nice and fresh. The aloe is a nice touch and my face doesn&#x27;t feel dried out after use thanks to it. I can&#x27;t use it at night and in the morning though because if I do it burns a bit in the morning but I love this, and the rose smell is relaxing.</li>
            <li> it makes me not wake up with oily face.</li>
            <li> I received this within a few days of ordering and have been really enjoying the product. My skins feels fresh, clean and smooth after use, but not dried out. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 5 days though... I&#x27;ll comment back later if any problems come up!</li>
            <li> Great toner for a great price, no reason to buy the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and is gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about - average cleaning but without alcohol</li>
            <li> Great stuff, good transaction</li>
            <li> I have been using Thayers since late high school years. I noticed it was less irritating to my skin. In the past, I used the toners by Neutrogena. I really like how it helps to pick up any traces left behind from my cleanser, oil, make-up,etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The organic ingredients really help to keep my skin tight and smooth. It&#x27;s really good for oily skin. Now, some reviewers may have mixed reviews if they have oily skin, but I found that this actually helped my oily skin by further removing impurities and dirt from my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any skin regime, it is important especially for those with oily skin as such as myself to follow up with a moisturizer after using a toner. Some think that with this toner they are done. Yes, your skin will feel tight without oil for the first few minutes, but the moisturizer is really important. I think that using a moisturizer or some type of light-weight oil has helped this product do wonders for my skin. Whenever I used the Thayer&#x27;s toners on my skin, I receive plenty of compliments and I noticed the oil production is controlled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great moisturizer that works for me is the Neutrogena SPF 15 (oily skin), and I apply a very light coating of almond oil before that. I use to fear using oil right after I washed my face since my skin is very oily, but the almond oil absorbs very quickly and helps create a smooth base/foundation for my moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope these tips help!</li>
            <li> Love this, and have been using it for years. One bottle lasts a year and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this toner forever, then I switch to try something else and then go back to it.  It is mild and removes makeup your cleanser did not totally clean.  And the ingredients and the company is great.  I&#x27;m not trying anything else again.</li>
            <li> Perfect with mask sheet!</li>
            <li> Lovely smell, good quantity, works great.</li>
            <li> This toner has a lovely light scent and is very soothing on the skin. My skin feels so refreshed and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> Firstly, this toner smells wonderful. It is so relaxing just to smooth it over your face while smelling the lovely rose fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the fragrance this toner is gentle and effective. My skin can be... moody. It is sensitive in places and not so much in others. Sometimes it seems more sensitive than others. I never really know when it might have a mini fit, say, right by my nose. But this product allows me to additionally cleanse, refresh and soothe my skin without irritating any bit of inflamed skin I may have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Natural rose fragrance: This smells like heaven! Love, love, love! I swipe it on my face, neck, ears and decolletage.&lt;br /&gt;-Gentle formula: No alcohol + the addition of aloe makes this gentle, even for some folks&#x27; very sensitive skin. For me, I am even able to use it rather close to my eyes, and it does not burn, but instead feels quite nice. (please be cautious of your own limits and needs!) For comparison, there are a lot of eye creams I cannot near my eyes without burning, stinging and/or swelling.&lt;br /&gt;-Effective: Allows a further cleansing of the skin, leaving it refreshed and comfortable, as opposed to stripped and tight. I often see a bit of extra dirt or oil my cleansing missed, come off on the cotton pad. After using Thayers my skin really feels ready for the moisture step, even though it already feels nice by this point. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Not available everywhere, but thank goodness you can get it on amazon for a reasonable price! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About my skin (for your reference): I have very oily T-zone, sometimes sensitive, acne-prone, easily congested skin. I don&#x27;t get many wrinkles, but must always battle the downsides of youthful skin while trying not to be too harsh on my &amp;#34;not a spring chicken&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li> I like it. It&#x27;s  my  second  bottle  and  I&#x27;m happy  with  it .</li>
            <li> Love this, works great, and smells even better!</li>
            <li> I have problem skin and it has taken me many years to find this perfect toner. Most women like to use a toner to remove makeup just before washing their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to find one that does not leave your face feeling sticky or greasy, not clean enough or too dry. This gently scented toner is just right for my sensitive skin and I and expect to have it in my bathroom forever!</li>
            <li> My pores are getting smaller when I use this toner. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin, using this in the morning and at night has helped my skin to not be so oily. I no longer have to carry oil absorbing sheets with me daily. Definitely recommend if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Nice toner.  I used it at night and it does a good job at getting any makeup that I missed off.  It smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a great natural toner.  The benefits of witch-hazel are detailed in many books and websites.  This particular brand feels good going on, leaves my face feeling clean but not dry or tight.  The rose scent, I could do without.  For some reason, it feels a little above my years.  Also, I find that if you squeeze the closed bottle (why you would, I don&#x27;t know!) but the product leaks out around the edges of the closed cap.  Makes me wonder if it&#x27;s safe to toss in my bag when I travel...  I just poured some into a smaller, tighter container, so I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> Thayers Witch Hazel-Rose Petal alcohol-free toner can also be used to clean your makeup brushes.  It contains some of the essential ingredients found in a popular makeup artist brand of brush cleaner...witch hazel (a cleansing ingredient) and grapefruit seed extract (known for it&#x27;s antibacterial properties).  What it doesn&#x27;t have in common with the MA brand is alcohol, which is a very drying ingredient, both for the face and natural hair brushes.  Try it; I think you will agree that this is a great multi-tasker product!</li>
            <li> Made my skin super soft! Great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> MADAMS/SIRS: TODAY WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME I EVER USED a TONER OK! IT&#x27;S VERY NICE,it HAS a VERY MILD/PLEASANT/DELICATE FRAGRANCE THAT&#x27;S VERY NICE TO a MANS SKIN. ijcorona</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff.  Smells good and makes my face feel refreshed.  Use it twice a day.  Will definitely order more as I cannot find it in any store.</li>
            <li> This is a really great toner. It helps even out my skin and gives it a nice glowing look. It&#x27;s the French way to take care of skin!</li>
            <li> Great product, would totally recommend to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven, feels like magic.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, my neck would burn for hours after shaving. But now with Thayers, no more burn.</li>
            <li> Within days this cleared up my blemishes! I will recommend to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I have used witch hazel as a toner for quite some time..but the Rose petal smells soooo good..this is now my favorite witch hazel and will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I am always impressed with how much grime I seem to clean off my skin even after I&#x27;ve just washed my face. I am confident that it cleans out any residue left over at the end of the day before I go to bed, and at the same time, it&#x27;s gentle and soothing and never harsh or drying. This toner is also perfect for a quick refreshing throughout the day to remove excess oil and dirt without having to wash my whole face. And, it smells really good too. I&#x27;ve already reordered this a few times since I first tried it months ago and I will continue to do so. A bottle lasts a long time too so the price is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> This toner is wonderful.  It leaves my skin soft, refreshed and clean feeling.  My cheeks tend to get red and irritated, and I get none of that with this product.  The rose scent is heavenly.  I love that the product is natural and without alcohol.  I have noticed no drying out of my face, which I did with my previous Clinique products.  Goodbye beauty counter, Hello Thayers!  I wish I could give this 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I pour this in a spritz bottle to use as a spray toner after I cleanse my face. The fragrance is not too harsh. I have sensitive skin and this did not cause any irritation. Very good for maturing skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this toner for a while because of all the good reviews and decided to buy it a few months back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toner is very moisturizing for my face and doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all! I have oily, acne-prone skin and I haven&#x27;t broken out from using this yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t, however, find it super refreshing on my face. Probably because it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol like the other toners I&#x27;ve used in the past. Other than that, I have absolutely no problems (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped this to me fast and I very much appreciate that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily to hydrate and refresh my skin. Smells and feels so light. You skin just instantly drinks it up leaving your face healthy and glowing! Must have</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, and I notice no adverse effects on my face. I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much. I keep checking local stores to buy it, but have only ever seen it sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this toner..I have been using it for almost a week now. I just wash my face in the morning and night and apply this toner all over and my neck area. its amazing. and I love the rose scent..</li>
            <li> I went into a GNC yesterday and they have it on special  Buy one get one half price. Great dealC</li>
            <li> Acts as a good make up remover and toner.  Does a great job of removing the residue that facial soaps leavebehind. I know Thayer makes other variations of their witch hazel toners, and I&#x27;d definitely want to try their lemon or lavender to compare. I feel like my skin feels smoother and appears healthier overall.</li>
            <li> Having come from Pro Activ, I&#x27;ve found this to be superior as it doesn&#x27;t overly dry your skin out and makes it very soft.</li>
            <li> I have noticed such a difference in my sensitive skin since using this! I use after cleansing my face and I no longer have the dryness or redness I usually do after washing. I love the rose smell and can&#x27;t wait to continue using this for even better results!</li>
            <li> I use this as a toner, it&#x27;s great.  Nice smell and very nice on my skin.</li>
            <li> not sure what it does or if it has helped, but I always use right after the cleaning my face. feels refreshing</li>
            <li> Good with cotton balls or pads instead of something harsh like Seabreeze or Stridex.  Almost no odor.  No burn.</li>
            <li> This took some getting use to since all the witch hazel before had alcohol in it.  This is a toner not an astringent.  There is no burning, no drying my skin out.  It smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought one last year and use it until i ordered 2nd bottle. the formula changed. Noticed Vitamin E is no longer in the ingredients. And the flavor changed. I like the old formula better.</li>
            <li> My favorite; nothing else even comes close: delightful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love,Love it. I came across this product by accident. i read the reviews and decided to give it a try, well i&amp;#34;m in love! My skin is so soft and even. I can&#x27;t say enough about this magic in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Reason why I use this is because I have supper sensitive skin and I break out super easy. I use this because it smells wonderful and works great.  It helps my pores shrink and my face dose not dry out. I use it 3x a day or when ever I feel I need to freshen up. It can make my face a little tacky. I have to say this is the best. It helps when I have a break out I just put some on and they slowly go away. When my husband get razor burns I put some on his face and they go away. I LOVE LOVE LOVE Thayer. I get it from amazon only because I live in Alaska now and can&#x27;t find it in my town. Unlike when I lived in southern CA I found it in the local stores. The shipping on it was kind of slow but it could have been because last time I ordered it was Christmas time. All and all it is a great product and I think every one should use it.</li>
            <li> This toner is truly amazing! I honestly feel like you start to see the affects almost immediately, something that other (pricey) toners could not do. The price is very reasonable for the amount of product you receive. Definitely recommend this toner to anyone who is looking to add a reliable staple piece in their skin care routine.</li>
            <li> Great product- arrived promptly as well</li>
            <li> My Mom always told me the importance of a toner to keep the skin moisturized.  Living in LA my skin is dry dry dry because of environmental damage and climate.  I think it helps but to be honest I just keep using it because I love the way it smells and it is a witch hazel based toner versus and alcohol based one.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST toner I have ever used! It gently cleans my skin, and I never have even the tiniest blemish. Because it is made with rose petals and has no alcohol, it&#x27;s gentle enough to use on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It smells wonderful and that with the natural ingredients are what set it apart. I have been using it for a year or so and found that if I add hyaluronic acid to the formula it also helps my face retain moisture. This is a great product to carry in spray bottle and use through out the day when your face needs a little lift and the fragrance which, as others have said, does not linger, gives a nice boost also. And if you haven&#x27;t tried hyaluronic acid give it a try. It&#x27;s a little miracle all on its own.[[ASIN:B0090UJFYI Best-Selling Hyaluronic Acid Serum for Skin-- 100% Pure-Highest Quality, Anti-Aging Serum-- Intense Hydration + Moisture, Non-greasy, Paraben-free-Best Hyaluronic Acid for Your Face (Pro Formula) 2 oz.]]</li>
            <li> This is by far the best witch hazel I have ever used.  The smell is delicious.  A hint of rose aroma.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> It tones, cleans, and moisturizes. It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin,,, nough said! Def going to buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely am in love with this toner. It&#x27;s light, gentle, and it tones down the redness on my face, for sure. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for decades, its all I use to cleanse my face morning and evening, except for my clarisonic once a week.&lt;br /&gt;I was brought up to be gentle to my skin. the rest of me might be showing my age, but not my face. I have thayer&#x27;s to thank for that!</li>
            <li> Love it, will order again and again!</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t bear to pay the amount Clinique wants for its cleanser, which is very good. So I tried this and wow. It is just as good, leaving my face clean and my pores tighter. Lovely product for my somewhat sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner. Its light and refreshing, has a slight rose smell. My bottle lasted about a year and I can&#x27;t wait to repurchase!</li>
            <li> it is very good, it have a good smell,it is rose, i like it ,and it very suit my skin</li>
            <li> Will buy another one when I need it</li>
            <li> smells really good and seems to help my skin</li>
            <li> This product is so fresh ! It smells a little bit too much for me but otherwise I&#x27;m really happy with this product, works well on my skin. Thanks !&lt;br /&gt;Ben</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin... I&#x27;m talking about you can practically fry chicken with the amount of oil my face produces after one hour of washing it.  I&#x27;m constantly blotting with oil absorbing sheets (my life savers!!!!) and I have to do this throughout the day, especially when I&#x27;m out with friends and there is a possibility photos may be taken. Having such oily skin and living in Miami, where its humid 80% of the year, doesn&#x27;t help me AT ALL! I get hormonal cystic acne breakouts when I&#x27;m really stressed on top of my regular period break outs.  Super embarrassing!! I wanted to try a new, more natural beauty routine and after doing some research, I purchased this product along with Leven Rose Jojoba Oil, Organic 100% Pure Cold Pressed Unrefined Natural, Viva Labs Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, and Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay Deep Pore Cleansing.  I am so happy with my purchase! The day my products arrived I mixed the Deep pore cleansing mask with apple cider vinegar and applied to my face as a mask.  I plan on doing the mask once per week.  When I wake up and before bed, I wash my face with Aquaphor Baby Gentle Wash &amp; Tear Free Shampoo, Fragrance Free Mild Cleanser (I feel my face is just too oily to not wash with some form of soap), then I use the Thayers as a toner - focusing more on my problem areas and pimples.  After letting my face air dry, I take a very small amount (about 1/8 of a teaspoon) of the Coconut Oil and mix it with 1-2 drops of the Jojoba Oil and rub all over my face.  The oils do take a little while to absorb but once they do, my skin feels so soft and refreshed. I just started this routine 3 days ago and I am already seeing results. The pimples I had are already disappearing.  My skin tone is evening out. My face is SO much less oily and my pores are minimizing.  This morning I only had to put a small amount of BB cream and a very light amount of powder on my face (I am considering looking into home-making natural makeup as my next project). Iam loving the results so far!!  I definitely recommend this product be added to your beauty routine.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! It&#x27;s affordable and very effective at doing what it supposed to do (treat and calm skin acting as a facial toner).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the skin, yet cleans well and refreshes. I would highly recommend to anyone regardless of skin type!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin with dry patches around my cheeks, and an oily t-zone, and let me just say--this product makes my skin so soft and smooth. It&#x27;s been a while since a product has done that. Being alcohol free is also a plus, it doesn&#x27;t dry me out nor aggravate my acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why I&#x27;m giving it a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 is because of the scent--to me, it&#x27;s a bit grandma-ish, and strong. It took a while for the scent to dissipate. But my husband loves it--he INSISTS that it smells like a fresh bouquet of roses. I guess it just depends on your nose pallet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order again. Maybe I just might try the cucumber one.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found an affordable toner that works to balance my skin without over-drying or over-moisturizing it. I have used \\&quot;gentle/non-drying\\&quot; toners before while trying to avoid the alcohol ingredient that is so common to freshening astringents only to find that instead, the toners would leave behind an emollient or sticky residue that I ended up having to wash off. This product falls into that fortunate \\&quot;in between\\&quot; group. It is perfect for me at this time of year when my oily skin needs just a little bit of help keeping the dry skin away yet it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or exacerbate oil production. Fortunately I have no problem tolerating the witch hazel (I don&#x27;t notice it at all, really.) The size and price of the bottle make it very easy to afford. A whole bottle should last me 6 months at least. It is highly fragranced with a rose scent; but that&#x27;s no surprise as it states this openly on the label. If you can&#x27;t tolerate highly fragranced skincare products you might consider Thayer&#x27;s Unscented toner.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! I&#x27;m totally addicted. If you use toner you have got to try this brand! It&#x27;s alcohol free (so it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin), Paraben-free, Propylene Glycol-free and used un-distilled Witch Hazel. And most of these ingredients are Organic. It&#x27;s scent comes from natural rose water! Plus, all Thayers products are vegetarian and never tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This is a must for keeping your skin clean and fresh. Even after you wash. I have been using it for years but never the rose. I really like it and will use it from now on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked on this product! My skin broke-out with the most horrible cystic acne, I began to use a cream on my face to clear it, and it started drying out my skin a bit. Thankfully I had purchased this product around the same time and used it in my regular daily face wash routine and it made ALL the difference. I recommend using a cotton ball (consisting of the product) and going over your face lightly after your regular face wash/cleanser, or even if your skin is feeling oily, dry...this product softens, and makes you feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not noticed a difference with my skin but it sure is a nice product to use.  I put it on after a shower and the soft rose smell is a treat.  It makes me feel relaxed and happy for a few seconds before I go to work.</li>
            <li> great product, fast shipping...will do business again shortly! This toner makes my skin feel fantastic, very clean and refreshing... I love the vintage label and its organic!</li>
            <li> If you love the smell of fresh cut roses, this toner is for you! However, it also makes your face soft, and completely dirt and oil free. I use it every morning and night to remove all traces of makeup. I have very sensative skin and have had trouble in the past with toners. However, this one is very gentle. I would recommend it to anyone with sensative skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 and have combination/oily skin with only occasional breakouts. I&#x27;ve been trying to take better care of my skin lately, and decided to try a toner. I&#x27;d always heard that Witch Hazel was amazing for your skin, but I never liked the smell. This stuff smells amazing!! Just like roses, but the smell fades after a few minutes of having it on your face, so it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything. My face usually feels very dry after washing or taking a shower and I need to put lotion on immediately--but not with this. I swip it over my face on a cotton pad and my face feels clean and refreshed and super moisturized! No lotion needed! It&#x27;s amazing how much extra dirt it gets off my skin too, even after washing my face. I think I&#x27;ll continue using this for a long time because it makes my skin glow, feel clean, moisturizes/evens out my complexion and I&#x27;ve also heard it&#x27;s good for anti-aging!</li>
            <li> If you like to use natural products and enjoy the scent of roses (which is not overpowering), I think you will enjoy this as much as I do.  Witch hazel is a natural astringent and this product has the addition of rose petal water, aloe vera and vitamin E, and it is very nourishing and non-drying (in fact quite the opposite, softening!) to the skin.  It is also Certified Organic.  Don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this one, folks!  Thank you Amazon for having this available on Prime, too!</li>
            <li> I love the rose scent in this product.  Very subtle and soothing.  No burning because it is alcohol free and does not leave a sticky feeling residue behind, only smooth skin.  My face loves it, therefore I do too!!!</li>
            <li> I love this as a toner it leaves my skin feeling incredibly soft. I have oily break out prone skin that is sensative but this is so gentle I have used it on my youngest child&#x27;s milia. I oil cleanse my skin a few times a week and use this on a cotton ball afterwards to remove any last traces. If my skin feels oily during the day I will quickly wipe over my face with this and have instant oil slick relief.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My skin is finally clear and looks great. I&#x27;ll never be without it if I can help it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a facial toner for several years.  It works great and is very economical.</li>
            <li> I really like thus product.  It came wrapped really well.</li>
            <li> Just got it but it seems to be comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible bouts with adult onset acne.  I was going with the \\&quot;dry the pimples out\\&quot; technique to no avail.  Saw this on sale at Whole Foods, and had previously read about how rose petal water can be good for skin.  Also, the ingredients list was much less complex in comparison to similar products.  I thought the witch hazel would dry me out, but this stuff is so soothing.  My skin not only feels better but looks healthier.  It does not strip anything away and just makes my skin feel soft and more supple.  Although I love the smell of roses, this is very lightly scented and does not overwhelm, which is good. Really glad I found the price to be better here on Amazon so I can keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it makes your face feel smooth, vibrant and healthy! It helps to reduce aging and offers a detox of the your skin every time you use it. Its just an amazing product that every women should have!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for years, and wanted to find a less costly alternative. Since a main ingredient in the Proactive toner is witch hazel, I thought I&#x27;d try Thayer&#x27;s. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I prefer this inexpensive alternative to the Proactive toner. This product is alcohol free (important with my sensitive skin), gentle, non-drying, and is a pleasure to put on my skin. I immediately noticed my skin was softer and smoother after the first use.  I have been using it morning and night for weeks, and I love it. What shocked me most was that even after I washed my face thoroughly with a cleanser and wash cloth, I still removed dirt when I used the Thayer&#x27;s on a cotton pad.  My face is clear and my pores more refined, and I haven&#x27;t even been having the occasional blemish I used to get. I firmly think that is because the Thayer&#x27;s is removing oil and dirt from my skin that used to get left behind even after scrubbing. The light rose scent evaporates as soon as the toner dries, but it&#x27;s very pleasant while it lasts. I will absolutely never be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! This is not drying at all. I use it daily after washing my face.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I had never tried this before but am glad I did. It is alcohol free so it&#x27;s gentle on the skin. I like the rose scent, think I will try the cucumber next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Great so far, moisturizing if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> ill make this brief. this stuff works better than anything else I&#x27;ve used including my x-out and proactive. been using for 3 days and a noticeable difference already</li>
            <li> Excellent, excellent, excellent!! I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now, after being introduced to it by a friend. I&#x27;ve purchased it at retail locations for much higher prices. This is a great deal! Would highly recommend using this product if you&#x27;re looking for a toner that works great with acne/oily skin, and it smells wonderful too! I love the rose petal scent!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m a guy and I use it for a lot of things. It has no alcohol and has all natural ingredients. This one has aloe and rose petals added which makes this stuff very soothing. This is my favorite witch hazel and I&#x27;ve tried a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Examples of things I use it for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. After shaving I apply it and it greatly reduces razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply it in the morning and at night for cleaning and toning. It makes my skin look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It also helps to apply before you moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. I have the occasional problem with hemmorhoids. It&#x27;s been recommended for people who have hemmorhoids.&lt;br /&gt;I apply some of this on toilet paper and wipe. It&#x27;s better than buying the witch hazel infused wipes for three times as much.&lt;br /&gt; It helps to make it smell fresh down there and makes for easy cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a bottle of this stuff on the shelf. I recommend this for men and ladies.</li>
            <li> Love this product!Although some people may be put off by the rose like smell, it gives my face a fresh clean hydrated feeling when used as a toner.</li>
            <li> Already ordered it 3 times, it smells amazing, makes my face feel clean, refreshed, and rejuvenated, and I just love it! Can&#x27;t live without it now.</li>
            <li> The winter is so incredibly dry and I have sensitive skin but saw the reviews for this toner.  Amazing!!!  Really works!</li>
            <li> Like the way it smells and doesn&#x27;t fry out skin.</li>
            <li> I went back and forth between trying this product or a pure rose water. My intended use was as a toner, and since this has witch hazel I decided to try this one. I&#x27;ve been using an Olay toner that contains alcohol and wanted to try something without. This smells really great, mostly like rose with a hint of aloe. It feels so nice, very refreshing. I like it better than the other toner I&#x27;d been using...it feels moisturizing enough and I could swipe it on after work and not need to remoisturize until bedtime. Great so far.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;m  using it with essential oils and it&#x27;s perfect for all the blends I have made so far, will order again.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this witch hazel because it does not dry out your skin and it is so soothing. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle. it came so fast and I&#x27;m gonna use this for the rest of my life. when i wake up my skin is glowing.  totally worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love this!! My roommate has had this for a while and decided to purchase. Has helped reduced the oil on my nose</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT WAS BEYOND EXTREME AS FAR AS QUALITY IS COCERNED.  GREAT SERVICE.  VERY FAST.  NO NEED FOR EXTRA UNNECESSARY COMMUNICATION</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used witch hazel for years instead of more expensive toners as I find it as effective, if not more so. It&#x27;s the very best to use after cleansing my face without making my skin feel tight and dry. This witch hazel has NO alcohol in it and is delightfully fragranced with rose petals. I&#x27;ll be getting more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This brand is hard to find in the drugstores.  I love the mild rose fragrance!  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective!!</li>
            <li> Excellent and arrived in time thankful to you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about this product. It gets the job done, smells amazing and is a great alternative to cleansing in the morning, Or after a day of not wearing any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested this product by:&lt;br /&gt; first washing my face twice with my normal cleanser&lt;br /&gt; Grabbing a cotton ball with plain water and rubbing it all around my face. Nothing was on the cotton ball afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;Ivan grabbed another cotton ball and apply this product to it and rubbed all of my face same pressure as I did with the water. The cotton bowl came off Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It removed so many things that my expenses face cleanser did not. Are you a glam glow cleanser from Sophora that I paid $45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now here&#x27;s where my gripe is with this product, It cleanses my face amazingly in the such an easier step in the morning when I have already washed my face at night and use this product. But I keep on getting small pimples on my face. Nothing cystic but more than I would normally get, I am hoping this is just the products removing gunk from underneath the surface of my skin but I cannot be sure and I do not want to take any risks. This has vastly improve the texture of my husbands can however and I will continue to use for a few more weeks to see what it does. Will update review then hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still getting this product five stars for the smell how it cleans my face and how has help my husband. everyone reacts to products differently</li>
            <li> I love this light scented toner. I put it on a cotton pad and dab onto my entire face and neck every morning and evening. My skin feels so good afterwards.</li>
            <li> Refreshing. Smells lovely.</li>
            <li> The best part of this is that it&#x27;s alcohol-free so my face doesn&#x27;t feel dry once it&#x27;s dried off. Light, soothing and calming on the skin!</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin!</li>
            <li> Its a lovely toner for those who have sensitive/dry/normal skin. It has a nice scent to it and leaves your face feeling clean. I like to use this product over an astringent when my face is feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! This clears up my skin and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Will buy again! Best ever! No stinging and I even use it to treat rasor burn!</li>
            <li> BEST FACIAL TONER EVER. This Works wonders on my combination skin (normal, oily t-zone). Love the fact that has no alcohol in it so it&#x27;s quite gently on my skin. Also, you cannot beat the price!  I personally use it twice a day and sometimes when i&#x27;m feeling a bit oily between washes and this lasts me 4 months. I am currently using the Thayers Cucumber toner (just to change up a bit) and i like the results on my skin but not so much the smell. Maybe i&#x27;ll go back to this one when i finish my current bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells Great!!!  The rose scent stays with you even longer than cologne and has a much better natural smell.</li>
            <li> great quality and so gentle on my face! I love it so much I overused it and it dried out my face :( I went back to only useing it twice a day and my face is fine now. Will buy again! :)</li>
            <li> This is wonderful it makes my skin feel clean and fresh and it does not dry it. And i have less oily Tzone since i use it.</li>
            <li> Not what I thought, but that is probable my fault. I wanted pure witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Smell wonderful!  Love it!</li>
            <li> pleasant smell works great love it</li>
            <li> smells good, i have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate it. after i wash my face, i use a cotton ball and put it on, and it takes the make up off that the cleanser didn&#x27;t get.</li>
            <li> THAYERS Toner is the best! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it&#x27;s great. When I first bought this product here on Amazon around 2011, there was like no reviews AT ALL.. Now look at it 1k reviews and still going strong! I knew this product would take off! I&#x27;m proud of it. What can I say? It&#x27;s such a great all-natural toner. I actually switched from Burt&#x27;s Bees Garden Tomato to this and I&#x27;m really glad I did. Garden tomato wasn&#x27;t that bad though. Anyway, this toner been keeping my skin on my face pretty healthy in my experience.. I&#x27;m a rather really self-conscious person, so yeah.. can&#x27;t be helped lol :-). Also, I noticed and I like the fact they took out Vitamin E alpha toc--something ingredient recently I think around 2013-14, because I think it was synthetic version of it and wasn&#x27;t all that great. I&#x27;m glad they changed things for the better naturally. It&#x27;s literally 100% natural and they even use organic ingredients.. It also doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes, because it doesn&#x27;t contain any alcohol. Nothing but good things to say about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this toner is definitely one of the best toners out there, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this toner out, you probably won&#x27;t regret it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Rose Thayers!!</li>
            <li> This product is my first witch hazel and I&#x27;m so very glad that it is. I&#x27;ve heard witch hazel and toners can dry out your skin so I always stayed away in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, the smell is so light and refreshing. I always feel soft and clean aftering using this toner. I have the occasional break out but this has never made my skin feel irritated, dry, or oily. I haven&#x27;t had any luck in finding this specific toner in my local stores, but I trust amazon to deliver.</li>
            <li> I recently went through college finals, and my face broke out from stress and lack of sleep. I even picked at it a little bit with disinfected hands and tissues because I was frustrated I did not have time to go get a facial when school assignments and exams prevented it. For the most part I am careful and never try to squeeze any pimples on my cheeks because they definitely scar the most easily and also leave mini-welts after you squeeze them, but I might have overdone it this time and a few of the marks were there a week after I cleared them which was not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this toner at Whole Foods just because it was the most pleasant-sounding witch hazel product at Whole Foods, and I felt like splurging given my breakouts, and I was tired of using rubbing alcohol on my face throughout finals that has most likely been a bad decision for my skin and wanted something else. I was very surprised by how fast it really transformed the texture of my skin and helped my breakouts after it was very disgruntled from infection. I would say I noticed significant results within 18 hours of using it, and I maybe applied it four times in those 18 hours. The marks that I was also worried about disappeared within a few days and I am glad this might have saved me from a few small scars. I have used a lot of lavender products before and creamy rose products, but this seems to work way better on scars and skin tone in general due to the combined aloe/vitamin E/rose/ and even witch hazel. I will probably also will use a stronger rose-hip oil, non-creamy blend for scarring in the future since I have used this in addition to shea, cocoa, and conconut oil instead of the lavender oil-based products I have bought before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now instead of using the alcohol to disinfect my skin in addition to a tea-tree oil cleanser, I am glad I switched to this in addition to a 10 percent, glycolic acid natural cleanser from Be Natural Organics and a stay-on 10 percent, glycolic acidnatural night cream from Reviva. I will probably keep using tea tree cleanser occasionally or hopefully find a tea tree/glycolic acid product or even make a soap myself by adding tea tree oil to my glycolic cleanser because I do want to keep using the tree tree oil. So if you are like me and you like disinfecting your skin before you sleep in addition to using other body salves or creams, I think reviva would be a good night choice for disinfecting purposes in addition to taking a shower at night which also helps acne. A good exfoliator is also a good idea and my favorite is Acure&#x27;s Brightening Facial Scrub. My other advice would be to try Cocoa-Nut Creme by AAA Shea butter for moisturizing among other scarring/aging purposes. I also like peppermint, non-sticky hand sanitizer spray in general but that is only minimally related to keeping your face clear by keeping your hands clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a little annoyed with Amazon&#x27;s ingredient list of this product because it is completely different from the list off the bottle from Whole Foods that is the exact same product and off Thayer&#x27;s website. The product DOES NOT have methylparaben and polysorbate 20 based on the picture of this product you click before it takes you to its page with an older picture and apparently ingredient list, and it is now completely natural and just uses vitamin E as a preservative. This is the third time I have either bought or noticed an inaccurate product ingredient list and am disappointed with amazon for being so bad at updating ingredient lists for better or for worse, but in this case it would be updated to a better list. So be careful to read reviews about skin products when buying from amazon because it seems to be a pretty frequent mistake on their part. In my case the products were Ann Webb&#x27;s Coffee Cherry Eye and lip balm and also CoQ10 products by Avalon Organics.</li>
            <li> I added a picture of the ingredients list from my bottle.  The list of ingredients on Amazon&#x27;s product page is outdated.  Butylene Glycol and Methylparaben are no longer listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very acne-proned, sensitive skin and I use this product at night as a toner.  It&#x27;s very gentle.  It makes my skin feel softer and my pores look smaller (could be me).  Though I didn&#x27;t buy my bottle from Amazon, I would hate to think that someone with troubled skin like mine (made worse by outdoor exercise) will miss out on this product because of misinformation.</li>
            <li> Tried the 2 other versions (Cucumber and unscented) and both were great. Decided to give the Rose Petal a shot due to the high ratings and it did not work out for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one with the rose petal made my face really itchy. Developed a small reddish and scaly rash. Going to have to toss this in the trash. Went ahead and reordered the Cucumber version.</li>
            <li> Works great and has a wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> Many toners have harsh chemicals and alcohol in them. This one however smells amazing and has never once irritated my sensitive skin. I swear on this toner on my life!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this product.  It feels great on my skin and my kids are using it too.  I would highly recommend you give this a try!</li>
            <li> Make my skin feels refreshing and clean.  I have sensitive skin but this product does not bother me at all</li>
            <li> I use this after make up removal to tone and remove any remaining makeup.  It really does a great job of lifting dirt out of clogged pores, and it smells really good.  It is something I have purchased many times and will keep using.  It is just that good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rose Petal witch hazel as a base for my scent-free deodorant. I love this product!</li>
            <li> An excellent post-shave balm for men.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every morning after I shave. Im a guy that cares about his complexion and Im not getting any younger. Use this to control oil build up and keep the shine away. Doesnt sting and have not noticed any side effects. I also use this in my groin area to prevent ingrown hairs after shaving - IT WORKS - so if you fellas manscape, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell, my skin feels great!</li>
            <li> This is a great toner.  It is mild and gentle - no irritation. It also smells wonderful.  No reason to spend a lot of $$ on expensive toners - I love this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing and nourishing to my combination skin. Plus, the smell is great! Smells a little like Ponds Cold Cream Cleanser :)</li>
            <li> Love this Toner!!!  Best ever!!!  Also great service from seller.  I will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> This smell is not like fake rose smell which lots of stuff have.  With this price, I definitely get more.  My skin feels smooth and well moisturized after I put this.</li>
            <li> This is my first Witch Hazel product I have tried so I can;t compare this to any other brand, one thing that attracted me to get this is that it;s alcohol-free.. I have dry skin and this product helps brings back the moisture on my face, very good toner and great smell too, reminds me of some baby products. I also discovered that you can use this as setting spray, just buy a mist bottle at Walmart and you get yourself a DIY setting spray. Thanks Thayers!!!</li>
            <li> Frist, I have normal to dry skin tone. I&#x27;ve tried Kiehls cucumber and Jurlique rosewater toner before, but both of them can&#x27;t compare with this toner! This toner definitely made my skin softer and moisturized. The more important thing is that it reduce break outs! I gave it four stars is because the smell is kinda strong for me but I&#x27;ve read that any people love the smell. Overall,  with this price and the effect, I would totally recommend people to get it!</li>
            <li> Very good toner for your skin. This bottle will last awhile. It has a rose scent which is not the most pleasant but very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I feel my face becoming more soft and clean. Better than other toner. Thank you so much. Will order more in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really cleanses your skin well and there is no burn of alcohol. Also, I love the rose petal smell. Also great for sun burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toner for at least three years at this point. It smells great, but most importantly, it gives me the right level of moisture. I have skin that is acne-prone, but also gets dried out, and this toner seems to give my skin just enough moisture, without making it oily. Most all other moisturizers that I use make me break out. Not this. And I have read that rose water helps heal scars faster, so that&#x27;s good to help with any acne scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 24 and have had acne since I was 11. So, many years of experience, of trying different products, and I have found a regime that I&#x27;ve been using for around three or four years that keeps my acne to a minimum and gives very consistently good results: wash face twice a day with [[ASIN:B00C0TI114 Desert Essence - Thoroughly Clean Face Wash, 8.5 fl oz liquid]], and then spritz on this toner. I got a glass spritzing bottle separately, and pour this product in. If you spritz on too much, just wipe off excess with a clean towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the [[ASIN:B00028PFF0 THAYERS Witch Hazel Pads 60 PAD]] when I want to exfoliate or when I don&#x27;t have time or energy to wash my face with the Desert Essence...because with that it takes a full minute to wash off all the soap...so it takes me around three minutes of washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also highly recommend a combo of [[ASIN:B004OEBRDW bareMinerals Blemish Therapy]] and tea tree oil for spot treatment.</li>
            <li> I love Witch Hazel but have always hated the smell. Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel is a must for those of you who love the smell of freshly picked roses. I use it on my face as a toner, apply it to scrapes and bug bites and after shaving. I feel beautiful every time I use.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of witch hazel so i ordered this rose scent. I was a little worried that it would be an overpowering scent cause i get headaches very easily, but its not, it smells very light and rosey and goes away after a few minutes. So if your sensitive to smell i would actually recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The smell takes some getting used to as it really smells like roses but it&#x27;s the best toner I&#x27;ve ever used. Not to drying and when used after makeup removal it really gets down in your pores to get the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; out. Repurchased.</li>
            <li> Smells nice cleans well but it Burns little bit when I apply</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 56 years old and my skin has never looked better! I apply Thayers Rose Petal Witch Hazel am and pm. After cleansing my face I apply this with a cotton ball, then do my other lotions and potions. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and plan never to be without.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with this product.  It is gentle on my skin &amp; non-drying.</li>
            <li> We use Witch Hazel at work, and a few people had requested not to use products that contain alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Choosing the Thayers Natural Rose Petal and Unscented was a wonderful choice. The product is extremely&lt;br /&gt;gentle to the skin. I would recommend this product - and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> I love it! Soft rose smell. Cleans, while leaving the skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use it as a toner before I go to sleep with a cotton ball. I don&#x27;t spritz it on my face throughout the day, though, as some people suggested. I dont see a difference in my skin, but I like the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times.  It seems to help with my oiliness.  I have very oily and sensitive skin.  The rose petal smell is pleasant at first.  But after a while, I can still smell it lingering on my face and it bugs me.  I wish I got type w/out rose petal scent (-1 star due to scent, which I find unpleasant after a while). besides that I like it!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Does not cause drying of my sensitive skin in fact has healed redness I&#x27;ve experienced from other products - would recommend this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Best toner I&#x27;ve ever purchased!  I use with essential oils and my face is happy!</li>
            <li> This product has received rave reviews on YouTube so I decided to try it as an alternative to my other toners.  I received it only yesterday so this review is based on only using it twice.  So far so good.  I have naturally oily skin and after cleansing my face with a cream cleanser by purity I used a cotton ball to remove any traces of makeup and my skin didn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; or dry after use.  I used it again this morning before applying my makeup and my co-workers have been asking what am I doing differently because my skin is positively glowing.  If this is the results after only 1 day I can&#x27;t wait to see my results after 2 weeks.  Will write another review then.</li>
            <li> The wife overs it and I also use it mixed with a little regular witch hazel after shaving,,,,,&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Out of the long list of products I&#x27;ve tried over the years this is the only one that has remained a part of my skincare regimen since my teens. My skin has changed over the course of the years, from dry to oily (depending on seasons and life changes) but this Rose Petal Witch Hazel has always made my skin feel squeaky clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my face with a gentle cleanser and then apply the witch hazel with a cotton ball. I then allow it to dry completely. Some nights I use a night cream and other nights I just go to bed with nothing but the witch hazel on my face and neck. By morning my skin tone looks great and skin feels so smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another product that I love from the same line is the Medicated SuperHazel....it&#x27;s a saving grace for treating skin rashes/allergies or shaving/waxing bumps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why it got 4.7 star, I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the cucumber and this rose scent and Thayers is a high quality Witch Hazel product. I haven&#x27;t used moisturizer all summer just take a cotton ball in the morning and after cleaning my face at night with this stuff and it&#x27;s been heavenly. A bottle really lasts me a long time too so it&#x27;s well worth the $.</li>
            <li> I began cleaning my face with Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel and then came across this product. It has a smoother and softer feel to it than just straight Witch Hazel. I used it at night and my face has been clearer.</li>
            <li> This which hazel rose water aloe remedy is a super refreshing toner, also feels great on sunburns!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite toner, cheap, all natural, smells good and it is super gentle but really makes a difference in my face routine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long heard about Thayers witch hazel from friends and skincare gurus, and Amazon has really good reviews on this products as well, so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after a few days of using it, my face started to itch and rashes developed!&lt;br /&gt;I was completely shocked and confused. While I was using Thayers, I didn&#x27;t change my skincare or use any other new products on my face, so I thought maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well with my existing skincare products, and I decided to use Thayers on my neck without using anything else as a test for a few days. And lo and behold, rashes developed again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe my skin is more sensitive or something, but I absolutely hate the smell too. Man, is this stuff supposed to smell this bad? I guess I&#x27;ve never smelled any generic witch hazel so I can&#x27;t compare, but to me any skincare products should be fragrance-free or contains no strong fragrance(let alone smell bad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend testing this on your skin before applying it all over the face.</li>
            <li> Super refreshing. Feels great. I normally hate anything scented, but the fragrance is nice and light.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from bad skin for as long as I can remember. I get acne, dry skin and just overall not nice. This makes my skin feel so nice and soft, and helps with after I wash my face. The next morning I can really see a difference. Even after the first use.</li>
            <li> Love the product so far (been 3 weeks). Smell delightful and gives my (acne/blemish prone) skin a great sense of clean and radiance.</li>
            <li> Soothing and gentle, my skin doesn&#x27;t feel tight after using it either. I don&#x27;t mind the rose water scent, it&#x27;s a light fragrance and doesn&#x27;t last very long anyway.</li>
            <li> I like it its refreshing to the face and it cleans well. I love that its a 12Oz itll last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Like the title states, I totally luv this product. Because my skin is sensitive to what I put on it, it&#x27;s really difficult to try new products. I&#x27;m always looking up products and doing research on them and of course watching tons of videos of people who have good and bad experiences with them. I usually stick to those who have similar problems such as I do. This toner, from the research that I did, got a lot of positive reviews. Just to give u peeps an idea of my skin. I have dealt with breakouts since I was in the six grade I am now 30 yrs old. I don&#x27;t break out as I used to except for when my period is about to come. But anyways, when I do break out, now a break out consists of 4-6 pimples whereas it used to be my whole face. It has taken me lots of trials and errors to get me to understand my skin almost perfectly. To make this short, cause it seems I have gone off subject, I now implement this product into my regimen because it does not irritate my skin and it actually does what it&#x27;s meant to do. So buy this and try it cause it is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Witch Hazel for a little over a year now. Looking at my bottle one day recently I noticed that it had alcohol in it (never bothered my skin though) and decided to look for some without alcohol in it in an attempt to get an even more pure product. I stumbled across this in my search and LOVE that it has rose petal water in it! It is a very light, floral scent that is beautiful and fades away very quickly. My skin felt cleaner and slightly tighter within minutes of applying this - but not too tight. I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to discern long term effects, but I can only imagine good things. I get eczema on my face if I am out in the sun too long or get too stressed, and this does not bother my eczema in any way. It helps to soothe it in fact. Anything that will help stop the itch and burn of eczema on my face gets an A in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this even after washing my face with a name brand face wash, and it the cotton ball will STILL have impurities on it afterwards. I don&#x27;t know about this being an anti-aging product, but at 23 I figure it won&#x27;t hurt since you can never start too early! After I use this, I usually apply jojoba oil to really fight any blemishes and maintain smooth, clean skin. I haven&#x27;t had a bad breakout in the time that I&#x27;ve been using witch hazel in general, but I still get one or two every now and then. I figure those little guys will sneak in anyway so it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much. It doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as drying as my previous witch hazel that had alcohol in it and makes my skin feel so soft. Will definitely be buying again when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this to my friends and family and therefore I highly recommend to anyone currently using regular witch hazel. Why not spice it up a bit?? And especially so if you have yet to venture into the wonderful world that is using witch hazel regularly!</li>
            <li> I use this on my face, under arms and bikini it helps avoid razor bumps and wax irritation</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! My skin feels so clean and refreshed without over drying.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne ever since 5th grade. I&#x27;ve just graduated high school, and I still get pimples.  It has taken me years to figure out what is best for my skin, and for about a year I have been cleansing my skin with African black soap and then using a benzoyl peroxide acne treatment every morning and night, and still, I would have an average of 3-5 pimples every day, mostly small, but sometimes big. Not to mention super dry skin from the treatment.  And I have learned to deal with it because I have had over 50 on my face for 10 years, so 5 was much better than the alternative, 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then I decided to try this toner. I was going to try Burt&#x27;s Bees&#x27; rosewater toner, but decided not to because of the alcohol. I wanted to go natural, and amazon told me this was &amp;#34;everyone&#x27;s&amp;#34; number one pick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this toner after I wash my face with African black soap every morning and every night for a week now. I just apply it with a cotton ball and I can see the gross debris still left on my face even after washing. I then follow with jojoba oil for added moisture.  My face has never looked better. My skin literally glows. My pores are invisible. The oil is under control.  And I have NO pimples. None. I am so incredibly happy..I cried happy tears just the other day when I woke up and saw no bumps. I have never, ever had this clear of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a miracle product. I am also vegan, so the fact that this is natural and doesn&#x27;t test on animals is an added plus. I even have stopped using my benzoyl peroxide because it is just not necessary anymore. I truly believe that gentle and natural is the way to go for keeping your skin looking healthy and beautiful. Thank you Amazon, and thank you Thayers!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product to use before applying your make-up. It is AWESOME that it is completely natural and there is no alcohol so there&#x27;s no worry of damaging your skin. It has efficiently tightened my pores and gotten rid of excess oil. I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a product that would take away my greasy italian shine and this did the trick. just outstanding.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I had this in my shopping cart for about 6 months before buying, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I noticed a difference in my skin rather quickly. It looks clearer, brighter, and I believe even a bit firmer. It also feels very refreshing when applied. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Very good and lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this seemed to irritate it. I used it for about three weeks and didn&#x27;t notice any positive effects. It smells nice, though!</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel amazingly clean I put it on before bed and in the morning. I have extremely greasy skin so a good toner plays an important role in my break outs.</li>
            <li> Works and smells nice too -- perfect for after-shower cleanse</li>
            <li> This is a great toner. Does not dry out my face - it feels refreshing. I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> What a delicious and soothing balm! I have been applying it to face, arms, decollete and...husband! Can feel the quality...Immediate results...will buy again soon!</li>
            <li> I love this toner.  I smells great and really works at getting off my leftover makeup.This has no alcohol.</li>
            <li> Really nice product!! Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it&#x27;s Now a permanent part of my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I love this toner so so much. I use it after I take off my make up at night and before I put my make up on in the morning. I use a make up remover towelette then use a cotton pad to use this toner, and it removes any left over make up makes my skin feel really nice. This product is amazing, I have repurchased five or six times and will continue to repurchase. The only issue that I have (which really isn&#x27;t an issue) is that if you are traveling, I would suggest moving the product to a different container because it will leak.</li>
            <li> This toner is very gentle. I have sensitive skin but can use this daily without drying. Doesn&#x27;t clear my acne like I had hoped though.</li>
            <li> I put some of this stuff in a little spray bottle.  Wash my face, spritz some on and I don&#x27;t even need moisturizer.  I have naturally very dry skin, live in New England, and have forced hot air for heat - I&#x27;m telling you my skin was as dry as skin can be. Not anymore.  This stuff is the best!  Also, I&#x27;m a bit older and have little broken red blood vessels on my cheeks and since using this stuff those have minimized.  I look much better.  I put some in a bigger spray bottle to use on my body which is great, but I&#x27;m sailing through it pretty quickly, so I recommend keeping it in a smaller spritzer bottle, but this stuff works!</li>
            <li> Clears up my skin and gets rid of any excess oil or dirt. You can use it in between face washes or right after. Has a nice smell also.</li>
            <li> She ran out and had to make sure I ordered more with my next Amazon order.  I don&#x27;t use it but I know she can&#x27;t live without the stuff.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Will always purchase!</li>
            <li> I believe other people may have had a better experience than me but if you are sensitive to strong fragrances, you may not like this. Maybe when I am a bit older I will appreciate a product like this...just not now.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works great for my dry skin on my face. I apply in the morning after a shower with a cotton ball and my face does not get itchy or have dry flakes on my face all day. I will definitely buy another bottle when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Best natural alcohol free toner ever used! My must have skin care routine! Doesn&#x27;t burn your skin and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling tight after toning. I&#x27;m so glad I came across this product! This beats the foxbrim brand. Foxbrim brand made my skin feel dried out in so many ways! I have oily combo skin. Great for acne prone skin! (: Thank you Thayer&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I love this! It is witch hazel with rose water. It smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it 1-2 times a day and have bought multiple bottles.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cleaning my face, feels fresh and clean when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> The bottle leaks a bunch from the cap after using it. I made sure it was on tight and still it leaked.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling refreshed! Great customer service!</li>
            <li> This Witch Hazel Rosewater toner is awesome!  I absolutely love it!  Wish I found it years ago.  Great toner! I use it everywhere!</li>
            <li> My 24 year old daughter insisted I try this stuff.  I have different issues with my skin  than she does.  It use it even under my eyes on fine lines - it is that gentle!  I really became a believer after a couple of days use when I would wash  my face and it felt so smooth and silky.  It tightens and tones without drying.  So whether you are in your twenties or fifties -  give it a try!</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and smells nice just a hint of rose smell.Does not dry your skin and it does not cost much.</li>
            <li> I use this after every workout. It cleans my face and neck without leaving my skin dry. My skin feels so smooth and supple and the scent is very pleasing to me. I have been keeping it in a zip-lock in my gym bag, just in case the top comes loose, and I have had no spills. Even though I use this stuff every time I work out (about 8-10 times a week), I can tell that this is going to last me a long time! I highly recommend this product and will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I use this after shaving and during the day if my face is feeling gross. I think it does a good job of wiping off any dirt/grease and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or dry out my skin like more astringent facial cleansers and a little will go a long way. The smell is pretty flowery but it doesn&#x27;t linger and dissipates after a few minutes so it doesn&#x27;t clash with my cologne etc. Witch hazel is supposed to have all sorts of benefits for various inflammations (some more anecdotal than others), I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed improvement on that front, but it does a good job of cleaning and moisturizing and is waaaay cheaper than getting those individual face wipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if this review was helpful</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s such a treat for my face! It smells fantastic and tones without any dryness whatsoever. One bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Very mild and gentle but gets the job done!</li>
            <li> This gives me acmes after 1 week</li>
            <li> I use this as an aftershave and my girlfriend uses it as a moisturizer before bed. It&#x27;s got a wonderfully light scent and the witch hazel is very good for soothing one&#x27;s skin. I love it and will definitely get more if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> I had been eyeing this product for a while, and I&#x27;m glad I finally took the chance of spending $9. It&#x27;s worth it because it&#x27;ll last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, a bit strong but it fades away after it dries. This Winter weather is really harsh on my skin and this product has helped my skin to be more moisturized even with makeup on.</li>
            <li> Smells good and makes my skin moist. And it&#x27;s not very expensive compared to other products. I bought two and I love them,</li>
            <li> Like it! Not as drying as regular itch Hazel. Smells nice ,too!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a short stretch now and I can see that my pores have tightened up and my complexion is generally clearer. The formula is not drying at all. I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, use every evening as a toner to remove any trace of make up and oil that my soap left behind. Gentle enough for my sensitive skin. Will definitely purchase again. Smells good as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how one knows when a facial product is working. I&#x27;ve tried dozens over the past year and there was no miracle that took place so how do you know? As long as it doesn&#x27;t irritate or inflame my skin I&#x27;m calling it good...</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this toner due to all the high reviews. However, it doesn&#x27;t work for me. It caused me to break out. As soon as I stopped using it, the pimples started to clear. Lovely rose smell but it can be a bit overpowering if you don&#x27;t like scented skincare.</li>
            <li> Excellent, gentle toner.  Smells wonderful.  Light fresh rose smell, not overly perfume-y or old-lady-like.  Also great used in a little spray bottle as a refreshing face spritz or prep before applying moisturizer.  I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> My favorite witch hazel in the world. I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a teenager and I just adore it. It does the job of regular with hazel with a lovely, light rose scent and the aloe keeps my skin from drying out.</li>
            <li> What can I say witch hazel with the scent of roses.  Use for acne prone teenager.  She loves the smell which causes her to use as told.</li>
            <li> Family favorite; LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it is gentle and effective. I use to not use toner but I think it eally help my skin became clearer. Thank you, Amazon! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love that this is alcohol free. I use it in the evenings to clean my face. Put some on a cotton pad and it wipes away the daily grime and leaves my face feeling cool and refreshed. I am too lazy to wash my face so this is a quick way to get it done.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of my daughter who is a skin care specialist. I use this products it works well and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me this bottle after I told her I was on the hunt for a toner (had never used one before). I have to say: I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s a better toner out there. I love how natural the ingredients are and that there is no alcohol. It feels very refreshing and makes my skin a good base for lotion application. The scent is light, so it&#x27;s very bearable at all times of the day. I apply it all over my face with a cotton pad, let it seep and settle into my skin, and then I add my layer of lotion. I wake up, and my skin is smoother than ever.</li>
            <li> First off, it smells like heaven and my skin loves it. Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (you know that feeling after using a product where your face feels so dry that you need moisturizer in order to relieve the tightness?) NO problem with that here! I have combination skin and it is gentle, effective, and makes my skin glow! Also, the shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner. The scent is blissful and the efficacy is of very high quality. Please enjoy, I am very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel SO clean!  It also works as a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love the hint of Rose....and alcohol free means no dry skin. I use it as a toner for my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin smooth and refreshed, have not had a breakout so often with this product and it lasts very long</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. It tones my face and I love the scent of roses.</li>
            <li> I have been a big believer in witch hazel for many years, but I&#x27;ve never tried an alcohol-free version before. This feels amazing on your skin and isn&#x27;t drying at all! I love it and I use it on a daily basis after cleansing and after I use any mask treatments. My only warning is the rose petal scent is very strong, I don&#x27;t mind it, but my mom who is very sensitive to smells found it too strong.</li>
            <li> This was the very first product that I included into my new skincare routine and Thayers makes great Witchhazel products that I use on pretty much every part of my body. This stuff feels very refreshing on the skin and is not harsh at all, it gives no stinging unless I use a product like apple cider vinegar and calcium benzonite clay, then it gives a light stinging. Besides that, it definitely cleans my face and has significantly improved my complexion. I would recommend anyone to include this into their skincare routine since I use it for not only my face, but also areas of my body such as arms, legs, and neck making it a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, but I love a toner with a slight fragrance.  I&#x27;m allergic to lavender, which knocks out a lot of options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this works.  It makes my skin feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have witch hazel.  I tolerate witch hazel well, but I know some people have issues with it, so that&#x27;s something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was an excellent price and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect toner if you do not want to strip your skin and use a natural product (and who doesn&#x27;t?). It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling soft and balanced. I will keep ordering this product.</li>
            <li> This witch hazel works really well, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I use it after I wash my face, or if I&#x27;m in a rush in the morning I&#x27;ll wipe my face with it before applying makeup. It&#x27;s really refreshing!</li>
            <li> It is amazing. I have oily skin and this one doesnt make me to break out nor leave my skin oily. It shrinks the pores right away. It has nice rose scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and functionality.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but used for weeks and still have older age acne, pimples between my eyes and a couple other area.  I quit using it, I find toners annoying to apply anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten about halfway through my bottle, so I figure now&#x27;s as good a time as any to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used a toner before, but apparently there&#x27;s a bit of debate as to whether or not they&#x27;re even worth it.  The basic premise is that they can help clean out those last lingering bits of dirt and oil after cleansing your face (some people going so far as to argue that it \\&quot;restores the pH balance of your skin\\&quot; but I&#x27;m not so sure on that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After each cleansing, I dampen a cotton ball with this and pat/rub it on my face and neck.  Sometimes it&#x27;s a little tingly, but usually it&#x27;s very refreshing!  I&#x27;m a big fan of witch hazel, so I really like that this product is witch hazel based instead of alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any miraculous claims about this product working wonders on my skin, but I don&#x27;t really have any huge skin issues to begin with.  I don&#x27;t feel quite so oily, and I admit I like the cleansing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I did have a nasty batch of ingrown hairs on my legs--the really awful sort with red, painful bumps and whatnot.  On a whim I put a bit of this toner on, and while they weren&#x27;t GONE, they were drastically reduced the next morning.</li>
            <li> Great for cleansing, toning, and hydrating skin. I love this stuff, always have</li>
            <li> High quality witch hazel really does help tone and soften skin. A little bit goes a long way on a cotton-ball and the light rose scent is much more tolerable than some other more pungent brands.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and is an effective witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this for my face. I&#x27;ve been using it after I wash with a charcoal based bar of soap. And put a moisturizer with manuka honey on after. Leaves my face clean and refreshed without drying it out! I highly recommend for anyone struggling with acne!</li>
            <li> I bought this toner based on its high rating score. The first time I used it, it caused me a little breakout. I thought it&#x27;s my allergic reactions to new product. The second time I used it, still breakout and a little allergic rash on my cheek. After the rash almost gone in a week, I used it the third time. Large area of allergic rash......itchy, ugly looking, and dryout. It&#x27;s been over two weeks and still not get better. Not the right toner for me.</li>
            <li> I like to use a toner after washing my face but don&#x27;t want to pay the department store prices, and this is a product that works well for me and is priced reasonably. It refreshes your skin before moisturizing.  The fragrance is very faint but pleasant.</li>
            <li> Fast service delivery with quality packaging. Product goes on light with slight rose scent. No heavy residue.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best toner I have ever used. Perfect for morning use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still confused as to what a toner is actually used for, but I love this stuff.  My cotton pad is dirty every time I&#x27;m finished wiping my face so I know it&#x27;s cleaning. I bought this solely because of the reviews and I&#x27;m obsessed.  The smell is wonderful. Reminds me of my aunt&#x27;s rose garden growing up.</li>
            <li> This product  is very soothing and smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and I love it!</li>
            <li> Using Jojoba oil in combination with Thayers Alcohol-free Rose Petal Witch Hazel has changed my face dramatically. I have smaller pores now, no roughness or blemishes, and my skin is baby smooth. I adore this product.</li>
            <li> Gentle and cleanses without drying skin. I purchased it because of its natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is lovely stuff!  My transaction was a breeze, too.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> love it, fresh, alcohol free, works great for my skin</li>
            <li> Love it, very refreshing and clean feeling!</li>
            <li> I was looking for witch hazel because of the age-reversing capabilities it has. I like that the toner has a rose-aroma. It is not harsh on my face. It leaves my skin so soft. It&#x27;s exactly what I had hoped for. I have noticed a difference in facial blemishes and elasticity since I started using it. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it&#x27;s great and my skin keeps me clear. Also smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to give this another chance but it made my face seriously break out after two uses. Thankfully, it only lasted a day but it was a lot of red bumps. Very disconcerting. But maybe I used too much or something.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.&lt;br /&gt;The product is exactly as described. Great for cleaning the skin after wash.</li>
            <li> I love this as a gentle toner and for freshening up without stressing my skin. The rose fragrance is light enough to not be overpowering or lingering. I need to use it longer to see if it affects the appearance of my skin (pores, tone etc.). I do not have any issues with blemishes so I cannot speak to its effect on troubled or fussy skin. But for my normal to slightly dry ,54 year old, fair complexion its a nice mild, refreshing toner for everyday and a refreshing wipe on a hot, sweaty day.</li>
            <li> Best toner I have ever tried!  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  It has cleared my pores and toned down the oil production  It has a pleasant fragrance that dissipates as it dries. It was received promptly and in good condition.  I will definitely order it again and would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Beautifully scented and is that added step that helps keep my skin clean.  Very pleased with the product, would definetly purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I use it after I wash my face and it is still slightly damp. It is not drying and leaves my face feeling fresh and clean. It has a pleasant rose scent that dissipates after you put it on so you don&#x27;t have a continuous rose smell. Great product that does it job. Even though I didn&#x27;t need it, their customer service is great. Received an email offering any assistance if their was a problem.</li>
            <li> A great toner that truly doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin. It feels moisturizing, refreshening, and it softens the skin! It didn&#x27;t sting my face at all, even in the sensitive blemished areas with acne. The only down side is IF YOU ARE A BIT SENSITIVE TO SCENTS, BE WARY THAT IT MAY BE STRONG TO YOU. My mom is sensitive and she said she wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it because the rose scent is strong. I agree that it can be overwhelming a bit, but I like the toner so much I just stick through it.</li>
            <li> 2nd product review. Excellent, fast delivery,  Thank you.  left one on Aug. 4.</li>
            <li> Who knew alcohol free would make such a difference. The rose scent is just a little strong for me, but not overpowering at all. The absence of alcohol makes this a soothing toner. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes and softens my dry skin. Wonderful smell and nice cooling feeling along with it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I have oily acne prone skin and have searched everywhere for products like this! Recommend for anyone!</li>
            <li> I got it pretty fast. Yet the cap was broken. The seal was fine. I found a cap from my other bottle.</li>
            <li> very gentle and light. good to use individually in the summer time. it is the third bottle i bought. delivered fast. will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchase. I was attracted by those positive reviews of the product and bought it with a doubt. Anyway, I never regret with my bold action this time. The product is really good with so many things- nice price, fast delivery, and most important great result. I have very oily skin, so at the most time of my life I was suffering from bigger and very visible pore, blackhead, and acne etc.. Before, I had tried so many expensive toners, but most of them only leads me to a big disappointment and deep regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, at the first time I put this product on, I feel my face is so fresher than it ever before, no sticky, no oily but so soft and clean. One week later, my husband and I both noticed a change on my face- less acne, small pore size, and a even light up skin color. So &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34;, I would like to recommend people who have  suffering from skin problem to try it. I promise (based on my experience) you will no regrets with it at all.</li>
            <li> Hydrates my combination skin!</li>
            <li> Love it:) leaves skin clean feeling and not tight or irritated:)</li>
            <li> I love it!! I just reordered for the second time. I way introduced to this product by my boyfriend who for being a guy knows a lot about keeping acne at bay. Not only has this toner kept acne at bay but I feel that it cleanses my skin so well that my pores seem significantly minimized. I use it morning and evenings and whenever I remove my makeup during the day. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Not as impressed with this as I expected to be.  While having a lovely scent, it leaves a sticky residue on the skin.  So I do not recommend using it as a toner.  However, it is still witch hazel, and is still useful as a mild astringent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used this toner for about three weeks now, day and night after washing my face. It does seem to clean up left over residue and makeup that didn&#x27;t come off via washing but I haven&#x27;t noticed any superior skin effects yet. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I am buying my second bottle as I&#x27;ve found that this Witch Hazel Toner Rose Petal is quite a wonderful product.  It smells good and works well.  I have been using it for about a year now. This year has been quite tumultuous and I believe that this product has helped to maintain my youthful look.  The hundreds of positive reviews here are all accurate.</li>
            <li> Great product. When I was young, one of my uncles always followed his shaves with Witch Hazel. Definitely not Thayer&#x27;s, more likely some generic drug-store brand. Thayer&#x27;s Rose Petal takes that experience to a whole different level. Excellent!</li>
            <li> turned my skin brown and i have fair skin that is very sensitive. After 2 days of use it looked like a put a brown face tanner on.</li>
            <li> A great addition to your skincare routine. Smells great and feels so soothing on the face. I use it in the evenings after cleansing, or just during the day as a refresher.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes pores look smaller and dries out small pimples without drying out skin. It&#x27;s slightly tingles when applied. Also slightly moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well, good price.</li>
            <li> I love witch hazel, and this brand is no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s all sorts of stuff you can use this for, and the addition of the aloe vera makes it that much better.  I hadn&#x27;t tried this company before but I&#x27;ll be using them again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard good things about witch hazel and finally decided to try some. I love this brand!! It smells great, is very gentle on your skin but works wonders. My skin has never looked so good, I hardly have to wear any foundation any more! It is so much less harsh than the Clinique toner I was using before. I don&#x27;t even have to use a moisturizer afterwards!! LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li> Use for myself and my daughter helps with her baby acne and is gentle on her skin smells wonderful and feels great when applied it definitely does not dry out my skin or my daughters. This is a second time purchase and the original bottle lasted us a super long time with daily use.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t like it...It stings my skin a little. I guess it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel anything special or different with this product.&lt;br /&gt;It surely doesn&#x27;t feel bad, at all, it is a good/ decent product.&lt;br /&gt;I just do not feel it is different or better than other things I use, so, I am on the fence about purchasing it again.  I will keep looking for something that will Wow me~ :-)</li>
            <li> Nice smell and leaves the face feeling refreshed and clean :)</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I initially hated this product, but I stuck through it for a few more days to see if there was any change in my skin, because I couldn&#x27;t ignore all the positive reviews! And WOW. It is as good as people say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first two days I used it were pretty bad. I have extremely sensitive and oily skin, so even if I put water on a cotton ball and rub it on my face, it will irritate me ): so I didn&#x27;t blame the toner for any stinging. BUT, 20 or so minutes after applying this, my skin became SO over moisturized. I don&#x27;t want to say oily, but it was more like the toner was being squeezed back out of my pores after it had been absorbed, and my face was basically wet! It sounds weird, I know, but after looking into it I found out a lot of people also experienced this! This happened every time I used it, so on the second day I decided to only use it before bed so I could moisturize at night and not have such an oily face during the day. Two more days passed, and my oily skin started to get better and the few blemishes I had around my chin and forehead started to minimize, and a full week later I&#x27;m happy to say my skin has NEVER felt or looked this good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can feel that it&#x27;s noticeably smoother, and my skin tone is a lot more even, my pores are a lot smaller and my favorite bit is that all my little blemishes/pimples have completely gone away! Also, day by day my skin became more tolerant of the toner and instead of the slight stinging I felt in the beginning, it now feels nice and refreshing on my skin. I&#x27;ve also shared this with my sister who has very dry patchy skin and she&#x27;s also in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final advice is, sensitive skin, oily skin, dry skin, what have you, try it! You won&#x27;t be sorry. And if you&#x27;re not happy with it after the first or second use, keep at it for at least a week before passing judgement. I almost gave up on this product but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Great way to get your face really clean and my complexion seems a little smoother and brighter now!</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 star. It helps to clean my face after facial wash. I like the smell and it&#x27;s natural. it takes sometimes to finish the whole bottle and a lot less expensive. I don&#x27;t know if it really helps a lot but the fact that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face and it feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried this and you&#x27;re considering it, please do! This stuff smells great, soothes and moisturizes, and does a nice little pick-me-up for the face. I even rub this on my eczema from time to time, and it seems to soothe those inflammations, too!</li>
            <li> I got this product to use as a toner and it smells amazing! it dries fast and doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily. It is quite big and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Works well. So much better than any witch hazel I have gotten in the past. Not drying at all. Have started getting compliments on my skin again after using this.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Gets rid of whatever my face wash left behind. Pores are smaller and skin a lot clearer and brighter.</li>
            <li> Use it daily for multiple hygiene needs. lots of ideas on pinterest, half way though the bottle already</li>
            <li> Wonderful Smell, Works well if used sparingly for sensitive adult acne prone  skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use toner regularly, it doesn&#x27;t seem to help my face...unless in the heat of summer with getting sweat and oil off my face (working outside a lot) ... then it works like a godsend. I use it mainly for preventing blackhead prevention in my ears and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Love love love this and it smells divine. Not too powerful of a scent</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good but it left my face feeling sticky and looking shiny. It caused me to break out even more. Did not help me what-so-ever. I hope it helps someone else. Every skin type is different I suppose.</li>
            <li> Smells like roses. I traded my other toner (which was a No. 2 toner from a well known cosmetics brand because of the alcohol in it) for this one. I use it after each time I wash my face. It works to get all the left over makeup I missed. I feels nice and hasn&#x27;t irritated or caused breakouts on my skin. I recommend it to everyone looking for a nice toner than won&#x27;t strip your face.</li>
            <li> In love with this product!!  Smells lovely, very light on my skin.  Not drying at all!  Shipping was super fast. Very happy with the product, will order again!</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price. Try it! you wont regret it. I am pretty satisfied with this product, :</li>
            <li> Good items and customer service.</li>
            <li> I just got this product in the mail and was excited to use this before bed time.. And it was amazing! It&#x27;s a tiny squirt hole so you get lil product on the cotton pad unless you squeeze a lot. Anyways. The rose petal smell is kind of strong, but you get use to it. This toner made my skin sooo smooth and I didn&#x27;t even need to apply a night cream! It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, at all. I was going to go out and buy the Ponds caring classic (5 stars review) but after using this toner, I don&#x27;t think I need it anymore. It&#x27;s great and worth the price and wait!</li>
            <li> Use it every day and love the smell.  very light and makes skin feel good after use. Would buy again</li>
            <li> I love this rose toner for its gentle formula and subtle rose scent. I was purchasing this off of Amazon until I saw cheaper price at Whole Foods. I like how this is a large bottle and lasts for a good amount of time for me. I use cotton sheets with this and just smooth it over my face after cleanse. It&#x27;s gentle enough for sensitive skin, and the rose scent calms me down. I actually tried the lavender/cucumber one, but switched back to the rose one because it works better for me personally.</li>
            <li> Just trying it for the first time, so far good. Love how it softens my skin</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients make this product the best</li>
            <li> My face has been clearer since I started using the product, so it&#x27;s doing something. Plus my face smells nice too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product! I lightly moisten a cotton ball with the witch hazel and apply it to my face every morning and night after I wash my face. My skin is clearer, softer, and brighter from using this toner. I have really sensitive skin and the witch hazel is so gentle and I LOVE the smell of it. All around good skin care product.</li>
            <li> Smells fabulous! Works great..I use daily.</li>
            <li> The product is ok. The problem is it was delivered in a plastic bag inside a box, which would have been fine except the lid was broken &amp; lost some of the product inside plastic bag. the lid will not shut so I am sure it will evaporate. I am not happy!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. I don&#x27;t get that clean feeling I normally do with other toners. My skin does not feel tight, in fact, it feels moisturized but in almost an oily way. I don&#x27;t mind overpaying for a good product but this was a waste, for me anyways.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to give this product 3 stars. After just a few days of using it I a big rash broke out on my face. I wanted to be sure that it was caused my the Witch Hazel so I stopped using it until they went away. Then, I started using it again and right away the big red rash came back. I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, so I suppose it&#x27;s more my fault then the products. That&#x27;s why I left it at 3 - for a neutral review.</li>
            <li> Arrived sealed nicely, which I really appreciate. Can&#x27;t wait to use it more and see what effect it has on my skin</li>
            <li> I love this as a toner! The rose water fragrance is delicate and refreshing. I cannot decide if I like the Thayers Witch Hazel in the cucumber or rose water better, so I decided to buy both! I use the cucumber in the morning because it is light and refreshing, and I use the rose water at night because I find it delicate and almost comforting. I much prefer this as a toner than more expensive brands I have tried. I&#x27;ll be buying in bulk from now on!</li>
            <li> Wonderful  fragrance and is not irritating at all. Witch Hazel is hard to find in retail. Ordering it is the best way to go.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It make my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li> I really liked the way this witch hazel toner performed, but I had to stop using it because the scent was so strong that it woke me up in the middle of the night. I used the toner before bed, and the scent seemed strong when I put it on, but I assumed the scent would fade as time went by. Around 3am I woke up thinking \\&quot;what is that rose smell?\\&quot;, and then I remembered that I had used this toner. I had to get up and wash my face before I could fall back asleep again. I like rose scents, and scented products in general do not bother me, but this was just too strong. I&#x27;m going to see if they make an unscented version because I did like the toner, despite the smell.</li>
            <li> smells good and works good.</li>
            <li> just bought this a few days ago noticed my skin feeling smoother after one use lets hope it keeps improving my skin</li>
            <li> Fair enough with its price and its quality. Good with normal skin tone, not sure if it works for oil skin.</li>
            <li> I love it! Great for cleansing and giving visibly smaller pores!</li>
            <li> I love it! It leaves my skin feeling soft without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I love this witch hazel toner. My skin feels much smoother and softer after use. I use it after washing my face, and then apply moisturizer once dry. Great product for great cost!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I feel like it really cleans my face and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Perfect ph balance, I only gave it four stars because I love the CUCUMBER SCENTED HAZEL more</li>
            <li> This is a staple for all women!! Love it.</li>
            <li> I was worried a bit that it wouldn&#x27;t but it did and the product is great it works really well.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years and it was just as expected.  Fast and quality delivery!</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, nice consistency. Not too sticky.  It&#x27;s a  nice addition to my apothecary.</li>
            <li> I have always been very hesitant to apply toner after cleansing, due to my extremely dry patch around my mouth/chin area. But, this toner was very softening and moisturizing EVEN in that problem area. I am very thankful for this product! Will be repurchasing</li>
            <li> It really tightens my pores. The smell isn&#x27;t too strong which I like. My skin feels soft afterward.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the Vitamin C Serum as a recommended pair.  I&#x27;ve been using these as new morning beauty routine for about a month.  My skin looks and feels amazing.  I&#x27;m keeping these on my re-order list.</li>
            <li> I have been using tis for years and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works great for my face</li>
            <li> This is a WONDERFUL natural toner! I&#x27;ve been using this product now for nearly 3 months, and I fully attribute my clearer complexion to it. I&#x27;d been having issues with some undesired pigmentation, and wanted to nip that in the bud pronto! I saw this product recommended on someone&#x27;s IG page, and ordered it promptly. I love using this with cotton balls, AFTER I&#x27;ve washed my face, or anytime during the day my skin feels dirty, oily, itchy, etc. This is the final clean up of the deeply ground dirt and impurities, that even my facial cleanser doesn&#x27;t remove. I use it every time I wash my face, which is 1-2 times a day (depending on whether or not I&#x27;ve applied foundation that day). I absolutely love it, and highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Rose Water products in the past - all great, until I tried this. This toner IS THE BEST toner I&#x27;ve ever used! I don&#x27;t use cotton balls to apply it. I use it as a splash after every wash. I even use it in my homemade Henna condition. I have always had small pores so I can&#x27;t give my opinion on if this helps shrink them or not. But, I can say it helps keep my skin moist and soft. Another Ph.D. product!</li>
            <li> I was wavering on whether or not to give this product 3 or 4 stars. Most of the claims that they make about this product are true and I&#x27;ve noticed that my face is brighter and looks healthier and smoother and I have less acne! This is the first time I&#x27;ve used this toner in particular. I usually use the body shops Petri toner. I tried this on a whim to try something new and I&#x27;m glad that I did. The reason why I can only give it 4 stars is because it does not give me the oil control that the body shops tea tree toner did, but considering all the other benefits I get from the stoner it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to buy it again once it runs out, go back to my old product, or go with another product the Amazon search has helped me find. I do have a feeling that this will last me a long time. With any toner I would suggest buying cotton pads instead of cotton balls and just squeezing some onto the cotton pad and then wiping all over face neck and chest if needed.</li>
            <li> Calms redness and irritation, without harsh alcohols or fragrance. That said, this does smell wonderful and rosy, due to the rose water in it. This stuff is great, it will remove any trace of makeup you may have missed and it feels wonderful on the skin. Nice and cooling!</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff here folks!  The smell is so sweet...reminds me of my grandmother.  It has a nice Rose scent to it.  I tend to get poison ivy a lot on my legs from mowing and this is very soothing and calming when applied to those areas.  I keep this in the fridge too because it just tends to feel better when cool :)  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Amazing results, great scent. I love that is natural!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This is the best skin toner I have ever used and it&#x27;s MUCH less expensive than the department store brands.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Thank u!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I use this daily now (:</li>
            <li> I bought this as an alternative to Dickinson&#x27;s Witch Hazel toner that I saw at the store (has a yellow label, I think) upon reading the excellent reviews on here. To say the least, I&#x27;m blown away - this is a product of great quality. I&#x27;ve used it less than a week and my skin is already re-acquiring the glow I had lost since gaining quite a few pounds/ being under stress recently. The smell is divine - but then, Ive always loved the smell of fresh roses. It does not linger on the skin - so don&#x27;t worry about that. The effect upon using is instant - there is a tingling sensation and the skin feels fresher, cleaner right away. I also bought a little spray bottle on here - and have filled that too with this. A nice mist once or twice a day is most refreshing. Im thinking of buying more bottles and keeping one at the office/ gym bag. Highly recommend this!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this and loving it after several weeks, I just picked up a bottle of Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel from the store. While I cannot comment yet on how effective it is for the skin - the smell is just awful compared to this. Its a herb-y, watery smell. I know myself, I like a nice fragrance to things I use (albeit a natural fragrance, nothing artificial or super strong). I stand behind my initial recommendation - go with Thayer&#x27;s Rose-Petal!</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing, cleansing toner. I use it after washing my face, both morning and night. I love the soft feel of it against my skin, and the smell is very pleasant as well. My skin tone is starting to lose some of its redness after I ditched my toner with perfume and alcohol in it &amp; switched to this. I think I will be using this for years to come. I love this product based on the soothing feel of it alone. I have to keep using it (only been about 2 weeks now) to see if my overall redness goes away completely.</li>
            <li> I have really red skin and this mellows it out perfectly and leaves my skin soft. I don&#x27;t know about oil control, but I&#x27;m not red when I use it.</li>
            <li> spells great and very moisturizing</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my face very soft! The bottle is a good size and I think it will last a while. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I  have purchased this product.  I love it and I will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Great! Doesn&#x27;t leave residues! Have a great smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, leaves the skin between dry and moisture! Btw I have asian skin</li>
            <li> It is affordable and the quality is great!&lt;br /&gt;I have a sensitive skin that is prone to small breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;Ever since I used this toner, my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is lovely and it feels very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase from Amazon but I would like to share my experience with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended by people around me, I gave it a try. Since it&#x27;s an all natursl product I was not as careful as I should have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied all over on my face, and next moment my face was on fire. I quickly washed my face with cold water but I ended up with red rashes all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took over 2 months to clear the rashes, and even after my skin was healed the blemishes and tiny blotches still remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because it&#x27;s a natural product doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s safe. Please do the patch test before applying to your whole body.</li>
            <li> Its got  a nice aroma and just like roses smell. It makes your face feel good.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure that it actually does any cleansing perse but it has a nice fresh clean and very delicate water like appearance and feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY REFRESHING!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product only about 2 weeks ago and really like it so far. I had a Thayers: Witch Hazel and I noticed that it was 14% alcohol and recently I have been trying to purchase more natural facial products. I searched for witch hazel toners with no alcohol and I decided on this one. I have been using it 1-2 times daily after cleansing and it is doing a great job picking up things my cleanser leaves behind! The product is a great value (you get so much for so little!) and I am sure it will last for months and months. It has a nice natural rose scent as well. Witch Hazel is supposed to be a great acne remedy and I think the rose is suppose to help sooth the skin. So far, so good! I have seen a reduction in my acne and I do believe continued use of this will clear up my skin. A wonderful, natural product to use. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very soothing witch hazel for my very sensitive skin. Rose petal fragrance is lovely</li>
            <li> It smells really good and is a good toner unfortunately it dried my skin out a little too much so I won&#x27;t be using it anymore, at least not every day.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, natural, toner with a great rose scent! I absolutely love it, and use it 2 times per day now. My skin is glowing!!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> i put this on everyday i feel the clean it smells more like a powder smell not to roseyit helps with my break outs and the shine i get with a greasy face</li>
            <li> This is just ok. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your face. Does have a scent of grandma. It does give you a glow all day. It doesn&#x27;t cure your acne. It might be for you or it might not. You never know till you try it.</li>
            <li> I AM RELIGIOUS to this product and have ordered it for about 3 years. I began using after I suffered from cystic acne. This product helped soothe my irritated, problematic skin. I feel like it also helps my face feel completely cleansed after I wash my face, to prep for my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I had previously purchased another type of Rose water, but decided to give this a try. I use witch hazel, but had never tried it with the rose petal. I am very happy with it.  I put it into my spray bottle and spritz it on my face in the mornings, it makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a toner for years.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t feel dry at all. Love it.</li>
            <li> my favorite toner since i cant stand anything with alcohol</li>
            <li> I have been using a different toner for at least 20 years.  There was a slight floral scent to it when I started using it which slowly started to be eliminated from the product.  I saw this while I was browsing on Amazon and thought I would try it. It is wonderful.  It has a subtle rose scent, is alcohol-free and makes the skin feel and look wonderful. I will be ordering the 3 pack when I order again.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It cleans the skin leaving it feeling refreshed.  Has a nice light hint of rose fragrance.  I have added it to my night cleansing routine and also in the morning before applying make up.</li>
            <li> Honestly, i have very dry sensitive acne prone skin. Which hazel and rose water have always been there for meduring breakouts!! Anything else is too strong and just irritates my son and causes more breakouts. I&#x27;ve loved thayers FOREVER.-! Never disappointed and highly recommended!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is, by far the best product for finicky, combo skin. It&#x27;s non drying, non irritating, has a lovely light scent of Rose, and it&#x27;s refreshing on your skin. I like to store mines in the refrigerator, and use a small bottle to mix 2 parts of this with one part (maybe even less, sine tea tree oil is potent) Tea Tree oil for a toner. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t exactly know if this product helped my skin because I use so many different things right now, but I feel like it makes it feel fresher and smoother somehow.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful stuff.  It smells like roses used to smell before they were hybrid into the plastic-like things they are now.  It&#x27;s soothing to skin and feels good when you rub it on.</li>
            <li> this is the best toner that I have used, it clams the skin and is perfect to use after masks, cleanser, etc.  Also if you have ever used dickinson&#x27;s or other generic witch hazel brands from target/walmart, etc. you will appreciate how good this smells in comparison to the other stuff.  Man... dickinsons original witch hazel smells so damn bad.  I am amazed that Thayers can create a product that works but dosent smell bad.</li>
            <li> my skin feels clean and fresh with this toner without any irritation.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase a $30+ toner, from a euro brand called Yonka, it worked nicely, but it was pricey! I found this thinking it wasn&#x27;t going to work as well, but wanted to try it bc i heard good things about witch hazel. It works great!!!! it smells great and feels natural. I love this stuff. Look no further, the price is a total steal. I have combo/oily skin and this works wonders..!! no drying out, no alcohol/astringent, just plain good ol&#x27; ingredients!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this toner. I tried it because a toner I had been using was discontinued by the manufacturer. Thayer&#x27;s does the job just as well as my previous toner and is several dollars cheaper! I would recommend it to anyone who has combination skin.</li>
            <li> Works well. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This toner was an impulse buy. For what is paid for the item it is good. I have very sensitive skin so this was not the best choice for me, but my mother loved it. My favorite part about the product was the beautiful Rose smell.</li>
            <li> I heard about this on Youtube, and wanted to try it. It arrived quickly and perfectly packaged. And happy to say, I LOVE the scent; that &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; real rose smell; so nice! Its my NEW FAVORITE.</li>
            <li> No burning, no feeling, not sure if its working.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing lotion, leaving my skin feeling silky and refreshed.  My face feels super clean after using, and the fragrance is subtle, yet lovely.  I would highly recommend this product as a superior toner for the skin.</li>
            <li> I love rose water and i hope this turns out to be a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this toner! Smells lovely, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing great for toning , leaves your face feeling and smelling very clean</li>
            <li> Love this toner!! The smell is nice but not too strong, leaves my face feeling fresh. One of my favorite natural toners I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this toner! It is alcohol free, the rose petal not only smells good,  it leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft, not tight.  Great value for an effective skin product.  Highly recommend! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Ive been using lancome and saw this and read the reviewa..I enjoy the sent and I like that theres no Alcohol in it..I am acne prone but havent had any issues yet like I read on a review..will continue to use this vs my $25 lancome.</li>
            <li> I was using Apple Cider Vinegar to reduce my acne scars and help get rid of my cystic acne,  but once I bought this toner, my face not only brightened, but so far, no extra cystic acne!  It&#x27;s kept it at bay since I bought this toner 2 weeks ago!  We&#x27;ll see if it stays that way, but I am completely in love with Thayer&#x27;s right now. No more smelling vinegar on my face!  Yay!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell - delicate rose petals w/o being too overbearing.  Plus, this feels so cool &amp; refreshing on the skin!  The only toner I will use</li>
            <li> I have been using this toner for quite a while now and love it.  The smell is divine (like roses) and it really does a nice job of removing all traces of oil, soap, make-up, etc. without drying out your skin because there&#x27;s no alcohol in it.  I&#x27;m going to stick with Thayers!!!!  I like that it contains natural products like witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, gentle, and so refreshing!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.  Makes my skin feel very clean.  I use it in the morning and evening.  Will also use it as a mist spray on my face and body.  It just makes my skin look nice.  Even gave a bottle to the girl who does my facials and she loves it and is starting to use it in her office :-)</li>
            <li> Feels so nice on my face .. Gets it clean without drying it out and has a pleasant smell ..</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t usually leave feedback that isn&#x27;t strictly related to how the product works BUT....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this shipped to my office. When it arrived it was in a tall narrow plastic zip lock bag and had leaked a little inside. I didn&#x27;t think much of it other than a mild irritation that the paper portion of the label was wet and ruined. I wiped it away leaving the bottle looking the worse for it and sticky with label glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the bottle back in the bag and opened the rosehip oil I had purchased and put some onto the backs of my hands to see how it felt. Later my hands felt mildly hot and tingling. I assumed it was the oil I&#x27;d never used before and it was just a mild sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home later I removed the rose and witch Hazel toner from the plastic baggie and went to open it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to twist the cap off to remove the outer safety seal instead of picking at it to tear it first. If it&#x27;s a good seal it&#x27;ll break but this one came off whole with the cap. I tore it the rest of the way off the cap. I then looked at the inner seal to see if the edge had lifted a little to cause the minor leakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I saw a small puncture in the center of the seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided it looked suspicious and there was no way I was going to use it. I left it &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34;  from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned my face, used the new rosehip oil and and went to bed awhile after that and read for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It occurred to me there was no hot stinging sensation from the oil at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now thinking it was not the oil that first caused it on my hands but contact with the toner that had leaked into the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use witch hazel all the time and have never had anymore of a reaction to it than plain water and have no allergy to roses either having at times in my life from when I was a child crushed the leaves and spread them on my hands and arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as for how the product itself works I can&#x27;t say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to leave this under product packaging reviews but the &amp;#34;fill in the appropriate box&amp;#34; style doesn&#x27;t allow for this particular problem</li>
            <li> My expectations were exceeded with this product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this toner! Tried and true and refreshing! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great for shaving! I dip my razor in this while I shave. Nothing else - and I get ZERO razor marks the or bumps anywhere. I used to get miserable bumps in my bikini area, but not anymore with this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I originally got this to get rid of my freckles, but it did so much more. My scars on my face disappeared and my filipino skin lightened. My face was SO SOFT. I ended up adding it to my elbows and knees. I even noticed the calluses on my fingers (I play ukulele 24/7) smoothed out. I&#x27;m now even adding it to my feet and in ONE USE the heel of my foot softened dramatically. Even my grandma started using it and she looked SO MUCH YOUNGER. This is a must have for anyone!! Its barely been a month and I&#x27;m already buying another bottle since I&#x27;ve used it so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side is the smell. Yes, it smells like roses, but roses kinda smell like old ladies to me. If you don&#x27;t have that problem then this is a must have&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: when I got this the bottle was pink and had a lady on it, now it&#x27;s smaller and has some sort of burley man? Either way I feels like the same formula. I ran out and was hesitant to buy this since it looked different, but I think they just updated their packaging. My eczema was acting up again on my face now that it&#x27;s winter time, so this is a must. You get use to the smell btw, so it&#x27;s not too over powering.</li>
            <li> Definate decrease in blemishes.</li>
            <li> this is an extremely fine with hazel preparation that I find to be very soothing and moisturizing to my skin. The rose petal addition is lovely as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this in a glass spray bottle atomizer and I spray it directly onto my skin. It can be a bit sticky feeling if you spray it over skin already saturated with moisturizer, however I like this for saturating my skin with moisture before bed. Keeps my skin dewey moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously found some distilled witch hazel products to be a bit harsh or drying to my skin.  But I think because this product is not distilled, and therefore retains all the skin feeding ingredients of the witch hazel, plus the addition of the rose and aloe, it makes for a genuinely nurturing formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noted other reviews where people were put off by the scent of this product. To this I would say that it is first and foremost witch hazel that has rose assed to it. With hazel has a strong distinct scent of its own, and if you&#x27;re not familiar with that, don&#x27;t expect this to smell like straight rose water. It is not. It&#x27;s a rose scented witch hazel and the scent of the witch hazel is definitely the predominant scent here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a lovely product. I feel it&#x27;s very soothing and beneficial for keeping my skin moist; which for me is a definite challenge. I surely will purchase this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s very affordable given the quality of the product as well; especially as compared to the more harsh distilled drug store varieties which lack the benefits of this formulation. It&#x27;s quite concentrated and one bottle goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Thanks for making this lovely smelling witch hazel without alcohol. It makes all the difference. I will keep this in my cabinet always.</li>
            <li> I love this so much. I think my search for toner is over. It cleans the skin, but leaves it so soft, smooth and toned. Love the scent, love the price. It&#x27;s so gentle yet effective. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> the product is great and original</li>
            <li> Skin care has been a struggle for me for years. I&#x27;ve used everything from birth control pills to prescription-strength topical cream that totally dried my face out (and launched me into severe break outs as soon as I stopped using it) to homemade masks that felt nice but didn&#x27;t do much against my acne. Last year, after trying a combination of Estroblock pills + black soap (loved by all internet women struggling with skin problems it seems), I had the WORST break-outs of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate, I decided to cut out the expensive Estroblock pills and stop using face wash.I had read that for some skin types, soaps of ANY kind will create a never ending cycle of dried out skin followed by break outs (due to more oil being produced to make up for the dry skin). I figured I didn&#x27;t have anything to lose--my skin looked horrendous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped the pills and replaced face wash with a morning &amp; night splash of a combined solution made up of this product + a drop of tea tree oil. Once a week I also cut off a piece of my aloe vera plant and mix the aloe with cinnamon and Manuka honey to exfoliate my face with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, my skin is the clearest it has ever been and my skincare regiment is the cheapest/easiest it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;ve learned through my own trials and tribulations that what works for one (or even many) definitely doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;ll work for me, so I warn you not to assume this product will work wonders for you. But if face wash and topical creams aren&#x27;t working, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in the past and love. I went a while without it but recently purchased it through Amazon again. Boy did my skin miss it. Right away I opened it and used it with a cottonball after a hot day. The cottonball showed the residue of my sweat and my skin was left feeling clean, lightly moisturized and dewy. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Seller!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was nice enough to start with, but it caused massive breakouts which only cleared up when I went back to using my homemade witch hazel toner mix.  I am 39 and generally only have breakouts with stress or PMS, which was not the case here.</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this twice already and got my mom, sister, and other family members hooked! I apply it with a cotton pad after I cleanse my face daily and nightly and it has such a pleasant, light scent. It leaves my skin feeling refreshed and soft and has helped remove any excess dirt on the surface of my skin. This is a part of my daily routine and I love how natural and gentle it is.</li>
            <li> Looooooove this! Preps my skin for serums and moisturizer perfectly!</li>
            <li> Very big bottle, delivered quickly and exactly as it appears. Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> friend turned me on to this. I love the way it makes my skin look &amp; feel. Very hydrating and soothing. Didn&#x27;t realize it also works as a cleanser as well as toner. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product works great on my combination skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dried out after use. It works great at removing the deep down dirt and oil. The smell is nice and my skin feels great. Would recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> This toner smells fantastic. It is moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out. I haven&#x27;t seen any miracle results like some other people have, but it&#x27;s still a great product.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin feel very clean and seems to make pore smaller.&lt;br /&gt;will be buy another one since i like how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is recommended by my friend. I really like it!</li>
            <li> This product leaves my fave feeling clean and refreshed. I use it in the morning before applying my makeup and at night after I remove my makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether skin really benefits from using witch hazel, but I love this product because it feels and smells so refreshing and good.</li>
            <li> They have amazing natural products, I&#x27;m constantly using it! My favorite would have to be Rose Petal Witch Hazel. Other nice ones consist of  Cucumber Witch Hazel,  Lavender Witch Hazel, and Peaches Witch Hazel!They smell really nice and keep your skin youthful and radiant. I use this after I wash my face and before moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Sometimes, I just leave my face with this alone - it keeps it from becoming too dry or too oily. Combo skin can he a handful sometimes, and this works great for it! Mine was been super-soft lately, it works nice as a refresher - it does minimize pores too! It doesn&#x27;t have any harsh chemicals and they&#x27;re natural remedies. This won&#x27;t break you out, I can guarantee it.</li>
            <li> It does not dry the skin out and helps your skin to feel refreshed and hydrated. The smell is very light, not overpowering, and does not linger. I use this in the morning after I get out of the shower and before I put my face moisturizer with spf on and once before bed after removing my makeup and then I apply another thick moisturizer. My skin is too dry in the winter to use the toner without a moisturizer, but in the summer I might be able to use only the toner in the morning. I have been using the toner for a few weeks and can&#x27;t say I have noticed a visible improvement in my skin, but I am hoping with long-term use the benefits will be visible.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple weeks ago and have been using it diligently everyday whenever my face is in need of a proper refresh. The scent isn&#x27;t too strong and will ease off quickly with passing time. It doesn&#x27;t leave the face awfully dry and works well alongside my Eucerin moisturizer. I&#x27;ll likely buy another bottle soon enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 bottles of this product already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2 times a day. When I wake up in the morning after applying it at night, my skin looks clear with tighter pores. It clears up any pimples or blemishes and keeps your faces nicely moisturized. My skin has not seen break outs in a long time!</li>
            <li> Smells so nice and works great as a skin toner.</li>
            <li> This is a really large container of toner that seems like it is going to last a really long time! My skin is soft (I wish I had this on hand all winter long) and my pores are tons smaller ! I noticed a difference after 2 uses. Great stuff</li>
            <li> Love this product. Received it within a few days!</li>
            <li> Nice product, and love the smell of roses!  I use it daily before makeup, and after cleansing my skin.  Good price also.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Paired with a good skin regimen this toner is wonderful! My skin tone is more even, my pores are tighter and it smells so pretty!</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great on my face since I have suddenly become very sensitive to products.  My skin has cleared up and feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know yet if this product is actually helping my skin in any way but after I have thoroughly washed my face and rinsed off with cold water I put some of this on with a cotton ball and let it dry before putting on primer (if it&#x27;s morning and I&#x27;m going to wear makeup) or before putting on my night cream.  What I like best about it is its scent though, I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s actually making any difference in the overall quality of my skin.</li>
            <li> I know witch hazel is good for your skin, but really hate the smell.  This smells like roses and leaves my skin feeling soft instead of dry like most astringents.</li>
            <li> This is a very effective toner, and I love the fact of the all natural ingredients. The smell is very light but pleasant. I have very oily skin, and it works well tightening my pores. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful rose scent, and my skin stays clearer when I use it.</li>
            <li> It is perfect one, I very recommend you to use it.</li>
            <li> Love how fresh my skin feels after using this product! I also love the slight rose scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and my skin felt smooth and refreshed after using it.  It came exactly when it said it would and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Gentle after washing toner. I&#x27;ve used this for more than a dozen years, daily without fail. It&#x27;s inexpensive, reliable - and I have gorgeous skin, thank you very much.</li>
            <li> One bottle of this lasted me a &#x27;very&#x27; long time and has improved my skin without making it oily or drying it out.</li>
            <li> This product is truly wonderful! The smell is amazing, it doesn&#x27;t dry the skin out and it makes my skin feel refreshed.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The lite rose fragrance is wonderful and it leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed with its gentle astringent action.  I would certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Overpowering rose smell...like grandma was in the room.</li>
            <li> Great product and delivery was seamless</li>
            <li> It smells so nice and works so nice. I don;t feel irritated at all when using it, considering that I have a very sensitive skin. It&#x27;s been doing a good job clearing my face off pimples, blemishes and whiteheads for the past 7 months. I think I found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> My esthetician recommended I use a witch hazel toner so I decided to try this product. It works great! I have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I use it once in the morning and once at night. It&#x27;s very gentle and feels refreshing on your skin. The bottle has lasted me for about 3 months now but I&#x27;ll probably have to be ordering again soon! Well worth the price ~$10</li>
            <li> Upper lid was broken and the plastic seal was punctured.&lt;br /&gt;Package was leaking !!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS NO ALCOHOL THAYER ROSE PETAL WITCH HAZEL FOR SOMETIME, NOW. IT IS VERY GENTLE AND I USE IT TO REMOVE MY MAKE-UP. I CAN USE IT TO REMOVE EYE MAKE-UP, TOO. IT DOES NOT BURN OR STING AND IS VERY GENTLE ON YOUR SKIN. IT&#x27;S A GOOD PRODUCT TO HAVE AROUND.</li>
            <li> Just purchased at whole foods in Lexington Kentucky as I am a Flight attendant with eczema, severly sensitive dry skin and allergies. It was much pricier at around $14.00 there. Will order from here next time if I see improvements. I like the light rose smell and the bottle should last me a year easily. It did not dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> This toner is very soft and smooth on my skin. I see my skin clearing up already and its only been a few days! I highly recommend this product after trying many other toners which weren&#x27;t as good as this one!</li>
            <li> I love the product for toning my face.  It&#x27;s gentle, effective and smells so good.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.  The packaging was excellent and I&#x27;d definitely order again.  Thank you for the great product and service.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it smells good and makes my face fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, makes your skin feel fresh &amp; clean, and smells great (comes in unscented and lavender-scented as well, but the rose is my favorite). I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least a couple years now &amp; hope they never stop making it!</li>
            <li> Lovely sensation, works great  on my skin</li>
            <li> Good product. Helps to keep skin cleaned and moisturized.  I use it as a toner after cleansing face with soap. Or when I see a pimple coming in, I soak a cotton ball and use a band-aide to keep it on the pimple for a few hours and it helps to clear it up faster.</li>
            <li> I have used this a couple of times and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> This product smells good and is gentle on my skin.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love cleaning my face with rose petal witch hazel, it has helped to clear it up and smells good.</li>
            <li> Very nice and highly recommended. Works great and has a subtle rose scent.</li>
            <li> I apply this on my face before bed after I shower, and in the morning before I apply makeup. It makes my face feel fresh. I use a cotton ball to apply, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much, so it will last me for a good long time. Very reasonable price. I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the natural and alcohol-free aspects of this product. However, I have better results with the cucumber alcohol-free one. It makes my skin glow....this one i have to find a moisturizer to use with it.  If it helps, I have dry and oily skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great. Loved it!</li>
            <li> very pleased and order came quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this because I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of my other brand of unscented witch hazel. I also figured that it&#x27;d be better for my skin since it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol. Unfortunately, this stuff burns my face. The smell was way too much for me too. I could smell it for some time after I applied it. I know many people love this stuff but after trying it a few times my face just burned way too much after using it.</li>
            <li> Great witch hazel, but I should have opted for one without the rose scent.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I am 15 with combination skin and a bad history with acne and this helped clear up some of my blemishes. When I use a cotton ball to apply this product, I can see makeup on it that my face wash couldn&#x27;t get off in the shower. It doesn&#x27;t leave you dry, it actually moisturizes my skin and makes it glow! Now I can&#x27;t go without it, my skin just looks so much better when it is part of my routine!</li>
            <li> After all the glowing reviews I decided to purchase this and I am glad I did. It makes my face feel smooth and refreshed, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Use it to make my own deodorant  and it is more than I expected.  Love the smell as well as well as the properties it provides for the base</li>
            <li> Just ordered a second bottle. I love this stuff. It is great for oily skin and has helped keep the acne away. The seller is great. Product arrived just as described and fast!</li>
            <li> I use Thayers Witch Hazel as part of my daily skin care regimen. First I clean with Thayers, then I use Skingenixx Exfoliating Cleasner [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]], and finally I use Skingenixx Super Hydrating Moisturizer [[ASIN:B00VSCKY1E Skingenixx Hyaluronic Acid Facial Moisturizer.]]. I have been doing this routine twice daily, and my skin looks fresh and clean, no clogged pores or blackheads, and my skin looks firmer and tighter. Give this combo a try, you won’t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is my Holy Grail toner. It smooths out your skin, prevents breakouts, minimizes pores and makes your face smell like a bed of roses (without being too heavily scented!) You really can&#x27;t ask for more! I always have this in my house. It is very well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and is so gentle. I use this and often skip moisturizer, since I have oily skin. I love that this product is completely alcohol free and that the smell actually comes from rose petals. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping! Thank you! A+</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the rose petal fragrance is wonderful.  I use it after cleansing at night and it leaves my skin feeling and smelling nice.  It keeps it moist and clear.  Rally like this.</li>
            <li> God gift to my face! This makes my skin look so bright and feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I absoultley love this product! it smells great and leaves your skin feeling refreshed and fragrant. I also love that t is all natural and alcohol free so I know exactly what I am putting on my body.</li>
            <li> Have left review several times before. Since it is that good, will try once more.  This witch hazel is phenomenal inasmuch as it has a lovely scent in addition to,its efficacy.  Couldn&#x27;t be more plasee.  You will love it&lt;br /&gt;,</li>
            <li> Nothing special with this toner, but I like the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;and the smelt. I don&#x27;t see significant changes in my skin yet&lt;br /&gt;will give it some more time.</li>
            <li> This is what I use as a toner.  Works well and I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product already. I&#x27;ve been using it only 3 days and can already tell a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, so I try to use products that have natural ingredients. I love Fresh product line, and used to love the Rose water toner. The price was hurting my wallet though. Now I use Thayers Rose petal toner, and it&#x27;s a fraction of the cost. I bought a mist spray bottle from Daiso, and filled it with Rose Petal toner, and it was the same as Fresh Rose water. Yay!!</li>
            <li> I started to use it from last week, but is good😊</li>
            <li> Great product.  I love this toner make my skin feel so soft.  I will be purchasing again when run out.</li>
            <li> Just as described and fast shipping!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Love it very refreshing toner when chilled!</li>
            <li> Great product with a good scent. I originally bought it as an astringent for my face, but I ended up getting a severe sunburn around the same time and this product actually helped a lot with my sun burn. It was cooling, which may have been because of the aloe Vera in it, and it was also healing. As a face astringent, it doesn&#x27;t work quite as well as I would have liked, but I give it four stars for helping with my sun burn.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell very much, but my wife loves it. It works great and she couldn&#x27;t be happier. If my wife is happy, then I&#x27;m happy and give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love it, I feel my skin is tighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this as my toner for YEARS.  I&#x27;ve introduced my sister and close friends to it.  They all love it.  This is a staple in my daily regimen and a MUST-HAVE for any girl that cares about her skin.  It&#x27;s also very affordable and smells even better.  This is great before you put a mask on,  or before you do any sort of skin care regimen.  On another note, Amazon has the most competitive price.  You can get this from Whole Foods, but it&#x27;s a priced just a smidge more.</li>
            <li> I gave this one star because after applying it a glossy film was left on top. I think it&#x27;s due to the glycerin. Also, this attracted a lot of dirt on my face. Dickenson&#x27;s worked way better for me. If you have dry skin this is a good option for you.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Doesn&#x27;t strip your natural oils but leaves you skin clean. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Part of my daily routine, I use it on my face morning and night and it does an amazing job at keeping my face clear.</li>
            <li> This smells great and seems gentle enough to use on my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m not a big fan of using toner but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t leave without this . I use after face wash and it calms and hydrated my skin.</li>
            <li> Refreshing change from regular witchazel. Light rose sent. Will buy it again. Pricier than plain stuff. Now I know what to look for.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toner. I have pretty dry, sensitive skin (not helped by Colorado&#x27;s year-round low humidity), so I&#x27;ve always been a bit gun-shy of toners, because they&#x27;re usually full of alcohol and other stuff that dries my skin out. But THIS beautiful product - not only does it do a great job of cleaning my makeup off - with or without washing my face first - but it&#x27;s so gentle that I don&#x27;t *have* to moisturize. But it tightens my skin in a good way, smells great, and dries up any little spots or blemishes. AND it&#x27;s not tested on animals!! I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> buy it again and again</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin so it usually reacts poorly when I try new products out... But my face has never freaked out quite like it did when I used this. I thought this would be okay but it was one of the worst products I&#x27;ve ever put on my face. It made my entire face itch, burn and turn bright red. Good luck to those who also have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using tis for years and I really like it. I use it with the skingenixx anti aging toner [[ASIN:B00VS7WQ8I Skingenixx Anti-Aging Facial Toner with Vitamin C, Glycolic Acid and Aloe Vera]] and I am having great results</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for at least five years and it really has kept my skin in tip top shape. It smells so good and really does moisturize and lock in the hydrating power of your moisturizer. Just something to freshen the skin and add to your beauty arsenal as a must have staple. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t exactly a miracle product for me, but it&#x27;s a great alternative and healthy product compared to toners and cleansers that contain alcohol. It moisturizers my face and cleans it so well! I actually like the smell since it&#x27;s subtle. But I understand why some people don&#x27;t like it. If it was strong, I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it either since roses tend to remind one of old ladies. I&#x27;ll probably buy it again after it&#x27;s gone, but if something else comes along, I may switch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use to improve the texture of my face and have had no success. That is, until I came across Thayer&#x27;s Rose-petal Witch Hazel.&lt;br /&gt;I immediately noticed the great smell. It doesn&#x27;t stink like other products I have used in the past. And I love that it&#x27;s natural so there&#x27;s no sense of chemicals on your face.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive and this product has not irritated it one bit. The aloe vera has actually helped reduce redness and my face feels softer. I am so happy I found this company and this product. I definitely recommend it to anyone, especially if you have blemish/redness issues like I do.</li>
            <li> Arrived faster than expected. Doesn&#x27;t burn. Smells amazing. It&#x27;s awesome. Get it.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. Good price, nice smell....too soon to say much else</li>
            <li> Just received it a few days ago, but I&#x27;m really loving it. Gentle and smells amazing. More importantly, it didn&#x27;t make me break out, which a lot of things do.</li>
            <li> very useful！ The smell is also pretty good！</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this past few weeks, but so far, it is meeting all my expectations. I use this twice a day- morning and night. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. Since there is no alcohol, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin or make my skin feel tight. I will definitely order another bottle after one I am using is gone. The price here is  a lot cheaper than buying it from a local store. I am pretty satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing, I wish I knew about it years ago!  It is gentle and my skin looks better and feels healthier than it ever has.  Love.</li>
            <li> Very fresh feeling after use.  I don&#x27;t like toner with Alcohol.  This product is Alcohol-free, so my skin won&#x27;t feel dry.  Good product!</li>
            <li> Moved from sunny California to short summers in Ohio... My skin definitely took a beating to this weird weather. I use jojoba oil on my face before bed to hydrate and I am trying out this updated version of Thayers rose petal which I like 100% from when I tried it for the first time. I thought at first it did not do much for my skin but I can see and feel the results now for some reason. My skin is so much softer and it shrank my pores. My number one reason why I do love this toner is because it does not dry my skin out!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! My mom has been preaching the benefits of Witch Hazel for years, but I just started using this regularly in the past few weeks. Already my skin is clearer, smoother, and has a more even tone. I&#x27;ve been trying for years to combat shiny skin (my T-zone gets shiny FAST) and this really does the trick!</li>
            <li> Amazing toner. All you need for a perfectly fresh complexion. Follow with moisturizer and your face will glow. LOVE</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective. As a busy mom I don&#x27;t have time to wash my face. I use this instead. I feel clean but not overly dry. I don&#x27;t wear mameup though so can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
            <li> I love this toner. It smells so pretty when you put it on :) and works great</li>
            <li> I am absolutely stunned about how well this works! Who knew?!! I would have thought it would be drying when it fact it makes my skin feel soft and is very soothing. I&#x27;ve also noticed it seems to have toned down the red marks. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My wife said it was perfect</li>
            <li> Very nice and smells great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Gentle and all natural!</li>
            <li> Mild, fragrant and no stinging alcohol.  Been using this product for quite some time.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed that the pores on my nose were smaller.  Not irritating to my skin, is great for taking off makeup, and has a very soft, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> as described and I like it.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job of toning the skin.  I wish I would remember to use it more often.  The smell is divine!</li>
            <li> Love this. Simple ingredients, gentle on skin and works well. The proof is on the cotton ball</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast service. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. After using it my pores felt tight.</li>
            <li> Very nice!  Smells like roses and really softens and refreshes my skin.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful, cooling to my problematic skin.  Use it directly after showering.  Going to try and find a small spray bottle to keep some on hand during the day when I need to be refreshed &amp; to keep makeup looking good.</li>
            <li> Light fragrance, gentle enough for my sensitive skin.  Love spritzing during the day.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive baby skin, and almost everything burns.  I can&#x27;t use chemical sunscreen, any kind of alcohol, I can&#x27;t handle benzoyl peroxide... I&#x27;m a total sissy crybaby.  This is so delightfully tender on my baby skin, and i love it so much.  It smells amazing and is a lovely toner without burning or stinging.  My sister in law tipped me off to this product and now I&#x27;m hooked.  I&#x27;ve always been suspicious of toner until now.</li>
            <li> Really nice solution to problem skin.</li>
            <li> use it every day on sensitive skin and no bad smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I don&#x27;t have an issue with acne, only getting hormonal outbreaks every so often. However, since moving to the Pacific Northwest, my skin has been dry and flaky, unresponsive to my normal regimen. I added this after looking into natural remedies (my usual dr bronner&#x27;s peppermint and coconut oil weren&#x27;t working anymore). I used this in combination and woke up the next morning with baby soft skin that lasted through the day. This toner is a lifesaver and has brought my skin back to its normal glow.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and when I put it on my face I feel so refreshed! LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This stuff has such a wonderful smell to it.  Seems to be very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first toner ever. I quite like the product. It gets the left over makeup out after cleansing. Leaves the skin moisturized. The smell is also pleasent.&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin, so it feels a tiny bit shiny after using this toner. But wiping once with a towel just makes it fine.</li>
            <li> Love witch hazel for my toner. I have super sensitive skin and it works great. Better than the other expensive store brands for me:))</li>
            <li> I thought this product would help prevent or heal up my acne prone skin. I rarely get break outs, however after a week of using this product, my skin broke out horribly, even in places it doesn&#x27;t usually get acne/pimples in. Completely wasted my money...I guess for acne prone skin, do not buy. Maybe it is helpful for people who have skin that is not prone to acne already. It does moisturize. However in my case my skin got oily(even though it is never oily) and all my pores became horribly clogged.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice and has a great scent. The packaging is very pleasing too. This toner did not work well with my skin type and made me break out on countless uses as it is a bit oily. But don&#x27;t let that dissuade you....everyone&#x27;s skin type is different it just did not work well for me!</li>
            <li> Great for problem skin! Leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth.</li>
            <li> The smell is good. And it is quite cheap considering the bottle shape. Skin feels smooth and comfortable after using it.</li>
            <li> I love it on my face. The smell is not stronf</li>
            <li> Makes my skin burn a little bit. I wish there wasn&#x27;t fragrance in there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as good as i expect.  5 stars</li>
            <li> amazing product great price can be used as a toner or setting spray smells great doesn&#x27;t over dry or get irritated makes my skin look healthy will be buying more as long as they make it only issue my top was cracked when it arrived but no product leaked and I just poured some in a bottle of my own and put Suran wrap over the original to keep fresh</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this is a great toner/cleanser to use. I just moisten a cotton ball with this product, and use it on my face and neck. It contains no alcohol, so it&#x27;s not drying. I love the light rose scent.</li>
            <li> I love it. Smell so good and it works well</li>
            <li> I love it, and smell  delicious</li>
            <li> I am glad I found this product. It&#x27;s very refreshing and cleanses my face really well and it doesn&#x27;t dry up the skin. I used to have so many pimples in my forehead but they are gone now. I use it in the morning or night before going to bed. It also smells great... like roses!</li>
            <li> Excellent 5-star transaction.  Exactly as described.  Super fast shipping.  Great price.</li>
            <li> I have tough skin, it&#x27;s not sensitive and usually won&#x27;t breakout so easily. I bought this last summer and really wanted to love it after seeing so many people raving about it on instagram...It just didn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel refreshed or clean...Instead I always feel like I rubbed some sticky, disgusting thing on my face and need to wash it off. It leaves this weird oily, sticky residue coating on my face that I can&#x27;t describe. It made me breakout a little too. I see here in the reviews that it did that to some other people as well. It smells nice though and doesn&#x27;t have any unnatural, weird ingredients...Also doesn&#x27;t sting or burn...But if you&#x27;re looking to make your face feel refreshed and clean, skip this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fabulous. I use it as my daily face toner, it reduces blotchiness and brightness my eyes. It also works great for my babies diaper rash. Very soothing. User friendly packaging.&lt;br /&gt;Great seller, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Very nice product - leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> great product, light leaves skin feeling refreshed and it smells good</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my face soft and smelling like roses !!!</li>
            <li> I have had blackheads on my nose for years and nothing keeps them away.  I ordered this product and am SO happy to report that literally within 2 days of using it, my nose is blackhead clear.  It&#x27;s pretty incredible.  I would recommend this to any friend.  I will order and reorder and reorder again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I will definitely be ordering another bottle when I&#x27;m finished with this one.</li>
            <li> Great as a facial toner and smells sooo good!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this!  I use it for a toner.  It is so mild and my skin looks and feels so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 years old and up until recently struggled with hormonal cystic acne. This is the best toner I have ever used. It soothes the skin and helps get off the last bits of makeup. I very seldom break out now. I think Thayer&#x27;s witch hazel has a lot to do with that. I wish I&#x27;d discovered this sooner. When I run out, I want to try other variations made by the same company. Bonus is that it&#x27;s all-natural!</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing soothing toner. Not harsh at all, very soothing. Love the smell too....roses. It was shipped and received quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at following that whole regime of buying lots of different facial products so this product is just perfect for me. It&#x27;s a good toner for my skin. I normally apply it after washing my face and before I moisturise. I think it&#x27;s great because it freshens my skins. I also love it because it smells nice and is suitable for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Good. Smells nice, to.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is very refreshing!</li>
            <li> This smells so light and fresh! After cleansing, apply the witch hazel with a cotton pad, you&#x27;ll see the dirt you missed. It&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I bought this toner after someone had mentioned I try using witch hazel on my 12 year old&#x27;s horrible bout of acne. I also then got to researching the benefits of using toners for anyone. I tried this toner because of such great reviews and I am glad I did! I love the scent to begin with... LOVE it coming from someone who is very sensitive to odors (I get headaches easily). I use this toner after I wash my face, and before I moisturize. I love the way the product gives the illusion of smaller pores... I am not so sure it &amp;#34;shrinks&amp;#34; them.  I remember using astringents as a teen and them leaving my skin sticky, shiny, red and smelly! This product leaves my face smoothe, soft and smelling great.  I definitely will be bringing a bottle with me to work come summer for a quick freshen up! I have only tried this product for my daughter&#x27;s acne last night, but the fact that she allowed me to apply it to her face AGAIN the following night is promising! I have found some MESSY products online that she simply does not wish to be bothered with, especially the ones that give her a dry &amp;#34;stiff&amp;#34; face. I found her washing off a clearasil pad she had applied because she couldn&#x27;t tolerate the dry after effect. This product is natural and FEELS natural!</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my face and before I apply my moisturizer. It&#x27;s wonderful. Does not dry out my skin and keeps it healthy.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this toner, it&#x27;s all natural and the price is good. I also read so many good reviews that I was confident about my purchase. I was first very disappointed by the smell. It smells like roses, kind of, but like an old grandma&#x27;s flagrance. Fortunately the smell doesn&#x27;t last, but I quickly realized that the toner made my skin very oily, even if I don&#x27;t have oily skin and I started to breakout after a week. Not great... I&#x27;ll look for something else.</li>
            <li> I adore this.  A light, pleasant scent that reminds me of my grandmother.  It does a lovely job of cleansing my skin, leaving it soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve actually gotten compliments on my complexion since using it, which is odd but fine by me.  :-)</li>
            <li> Great product! Really keeps my skin soft and moisturize. I&#x27;d totally buy it again!</li>
            <li> This product did everything it said it would do. It toned my skin, minimizing pores and tightening the skin. My skin is dry and sensitive and it neither dried out my skin nor irritated it. It cleanses lightly as well and will remove makeup. I have also used on legs and other areas to cool irritation and prevent ingrown hairs and it works well for that. I love the light rose smell (and my husband does too) and the product lasted my a long time. I love that all the ingredients are simple, there are not fillers or crazy sounding chemicals. The shipping was also prompt and reliable. I highly recommend this product to anyone who tries it. I even have my husband hooked (though on a non-rose scented one)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple of facial toners but my skin would dry up.  With this toner, because there is no alcohol included to dry up the skin and it has aloe vera, it makes my skin glow and feel refreshed.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I have seen the difference on my skin and so have others.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Very light and refreshing. No harsh stinging or dryness.</li>
            <li> good product! feels good on my skin</li>
            <li> This is nothing but diluted  rose water. It will have no effect on your skin whatsoever.</li>
            <li> i feel as if anything my skin has gotten much worse. Im still using it because it was kind of pricey. especially compared to Dickensons which has always worked. I guess back to Dickensons it is.</li>
            <li> Has worked better than any other toner in the past.</li>
            <li> Been using Thayers for YEARS.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy any other toner for my face.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, gentle on the skin and a really pleasant smell. I make a concoction of this, water, and fresh squeezed lemon juice and put it on my face every morning. It helps tighten up pores and the lemon juice helps fade unwanted sun spots. I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of this toner is beautiful and refreshing. What I like most about it is how soothing it is to the skin. It makes my skin feel dewy fresh and comfortable. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this toner. It&#x27;s got natural ingredients, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about what some paraben or crazy methysulphate type ingredient will do to your health. I can&#x27;t imagine a better toner than this, and I&#x27;ve used the high-priced department store toners. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> Pleasant buying experience. Makes my face feels refreshed and very soft.</li>
            <li> Light rose scent, alcohol- free, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> fast and arrived as expected</li>
            <li> i have four bottles... one upstairs and one downstairs, one in car and one at work. i love this stuff. cleans and refreshes and no string. more hydreated skin too!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look and feel great  I love the rose smell.  Does not smell at all like regular witch hazel, which I find horrible.  I have combination skin and this leaves it fresh and doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and what I have learned over the years is that the more alcohol-based products/drying products you use, the more likely your face will create MORE OIL.  So don&#x27;t do it and use this stuff!  It is non-drying and smells great.  Refreshes after cleansing but will allow other products you might use do their trick, e.g. anti-aging, skin lightening creams, alpha hydroxy, etc.  I am a great fan on this product.</li>
            <li> It has the rose flavor and makes me feel good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other toners like Origins and Clinique and it always breaks me out. This one surprisingly feels very nice on the skin and I have not had a reaction to it. I like the subtle smell of roses and the way my skin feels after putting this on. Will continue purchasing this!</li>
            <li> This product contains METHYLPARABEN.  This ingredient is harmful: Methylparaben is in the paraben family of preservatives used by the food, pharmaceutical, and personal care product industries. Parabens mimic estrogen and can act as potential hormone (endocrine) system disruptors.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff!! My skin looks brighter and the smell of Roses is AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> its a great product, its smell very good. I,d like to say it is really great,and i like it very much.</li>
