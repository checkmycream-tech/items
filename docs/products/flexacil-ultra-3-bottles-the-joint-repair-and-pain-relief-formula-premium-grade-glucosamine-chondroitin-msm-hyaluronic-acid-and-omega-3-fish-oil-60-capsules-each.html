            <li>Both of my knees are bone-on-bone and total knee replacement was recommended as the solution to finally end pain and allow for a more active lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>Two days ago I was able to walk one mile with very little discomfort in my left knee.  </li>
            <li>The only concern I had this time is that the powder inside the capsules is beige instead of white like the first shipment of these I received.</li>
            <li>It is not a cure-all, but it has helped me regain a more active lifestyle with a lot less pain.  </li>

            <li> Good product and does the expected work.  I just noticed the original capsules color was white and the new ones are light brown. I hope the new ones are better because the old ones were excellent. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I feel so much better when I take these.  I can tell almost immediately when I run out.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It really helps relieve joint pains. The price is perfect. This shipping is immediate with prime.</li>
            <li> Sure helped my knees.</li>
            <li> My wrists have been acting up for a while now and I think it’s the start of carpal tunnel. I have been using a wrist brace, but even when wearing it I still feel painful sensations in my wrist. My mom uses this flexacil product for her legs and back and she said she thought it would be able to help with my wrist pain as well. I am using a bottle that she gave me and so far I am not noticing the sensations anymore. I have only been using it for a week so I don’t want to give it all 5 stars just yet. After some more time I’ll add onto this review with more results.</li>
            <li> I have had arthritis in my spine for the longest time. At first the pain of it was bearable, but each month it seemed to be getting a little worse than the previous month. I had gone to the doctor about it and he recommended me some medications. I started taking them, but unfortunately I got really bad side effects from them. I was looking at some other joint pain relievers and flexacil appealed to me the most. I just started them about a month ago and my results have been fantastic. Normally every time I would bend down I’d get a terrible pain in my spinal column, but now I don’t feel the pain anymore. There is still some stiffness when I bend, but I hope that over some more time that will begin to improve too. I’m happy with this product and hope to continue to feel pain free.</li>
            <li> I must say that I read the reviews on this product and can confirm that it has given me much relief.  I still occasionally have to take a tylenol for my knee pain, but without the Flexacil Ultra, I was in terrible pain on a daily basis.  Walking was torture for me.  You have to let it get into your system for a few days to a week, but I can go for walks, and go up and down stairs with very little pain.</li>
            <li> excellent product,.it really helps a lot, I tried everything nothing worked, but this worked,. it took about 3 weeks of taking it, then I really saw results, it does what it says it does, builds a cussion on knee joint ,.im well pleased, finally a product that don&#x27;t lie to you just to get your money,  thank you amazon for the fast service,.

            <li> I have been trying many different products over the years to get relief and this product delivers.  within a week m y knees were feeling better than they have in a long time.</li>
            <li> I began taking Flexacil Ultra May 2014.  I took 3 capsules per day for a month and thereafter 2 capsules per day. During the first two months my arthritis symptoms were somewhat alleviated.  Today -- into my fourth month -- my arthritis symptoms have been miraculously alleviated.  Both of my knees are bone-on-bone and total knee replacement was recommended as the solution to finally end pain and allow for a more active lifestyle.  Two days ago I was able to walk one mile with very little discomfort in my left knee.  I realize that the warmer summer days are helping, and so I question how the damp winter cold will affect my knees.  I believe this supplement works.  It is not a cure-all, but it has helped me regain a more active lifestyle with a lot less pain.  I say to skeptics --- try it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. The only concern I had this time is that the powder inside the capsules is beige instead of white like the first shipment of these I received. But the stuff works great and has kept me away from the doctor and surgery. White or beige - this stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> I finished 3 bottles of this supplement and did not get any relief from my knee pain.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell if this is working as I&#x27;ve stopped my martial arts excercises as my knees were killing me afterwards. My knees are feeling much better, Flexacill or just not tearing up my knees....not sure yet as it has been almost 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> good product.  I feel the difference when taking a series of flexacil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! After only one week, I am able to walk without limping!</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and react differently to medications.  That said...  I am still VERY impressed with the results I am having with the use of Flexacil Ultra.  I have used Instaflex, and Osteo Bi-Flex in the past but will be staying with Flexacil Ultra because it works for me.  Give it a try and you may be greatly changed.</li>
            <li> Flexacil is very effective. My knee was hurting so badly that I limped while walking and my knee hurt so much when I&#x27;m getting up from bed. After two weeks I noticed a big improvement. Now,  after close to a month, my limping is gone, I can walk faster and  I can bend my knee more. Thanks to Flexacil!</li>
            <li> Compared to higher priced products it is the best value I have found for it&#x27;s relief of my knee sorness and pain.</li>
            <li> I love this medication.  It helps to relieve my joint pain.  Only thing I have found that works this well.</li>
            <li> My mother has a lot of pain and mobility problems and Flexacil Ultra helps her with both. She tried it for a couple of months and didn&#x27;t think it was helping her but when she stopped taking it she saw the difference it has made and wanted more asap.</li>
            <li> After four months this product did nothing for knee discomfort.</li>
