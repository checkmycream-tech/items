            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Most stores where I had bought</li>
            <li>This product would work better in tandem with the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love Wella shampoo.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo--but no one carried it in this area.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So glad Amazon had it.</li>

            <li>I love the smell and</li>
            <li>Great seller and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was looking for shampoo to make my hair feel strong when I run my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>When I use Nioxin, my hair feels strong in between my fingers.</li>
            <li>B0016FWWGS Wella Color Preserve Volumizing Shampoo, Fine Hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had fine hair since birth and am always looking for help with this.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not for fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t improve volume.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Wella Color Preserve Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair for about four years</li>
            <li>and it is light</li>
            <li>I enjoy Wella products</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smelling fabulous.  </li>
            <li>The product always arrives in excellent condition and usually before the promised delivery date.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo , I dont have to use much and my hair feels clean , I also like Wella Mouse</li>
            <li>Surprisingly I could not find it in local stores</li>
            <li>If you have oily hair this might be ok, but for normal or color treated hair...</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for my fine hair that is highlighted and colored a light golden red.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this product, used in tandem with the spray conditioner to give a lot of volume to my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo was worth a shot at trying.</li>
            <li>So ordering it by Amazon was the right thing to do.  </li>
            <li>Bought 4 bottles right away.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, clean and ready to style.</li>
            <li>It was fuller at first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, Thanks</li>
            <li>You come out of the shower with very tangled hair and spray on the conditioner and it smooths out.  </li>
            <li>I really like this color preserve volumizing product by Wella.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at preserving color, but it&#x27;s not great for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Since the total was &amp;#62; $40.00 would have like to have qualified for FREE delivery.</li>
            <li>I bought it and the delivery was so fast.  </li>
            <li>I have found others that clean it but pull my red out</li>
            <li>Red is a hard color to keep but this shampoo works better than most in that regard.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;d have to schlepp it back by the suitcase full from Germany.</li>
            <li>i have tried many color preserving shampoos - this is the only that actually PRESERVES my color while CLEANING my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also ordered this before via Amazon.com as I could not find it when I moved to a new state.</li>
            <li>and it is not harsh.</li>
            <li>and I like it too much to change to something else that won&#x27;t do the same job.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty expensive compared with Redken for fine hair which really works.</li>
            <li>When I used the conditioner it really held my color much longer than any other conditioner.</li>
            <li>Amazon is the only way I can find this product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Being a natural redhead, it will be almost impossible to duplicate my hair color with dye so this leaves me with enough color and my fine hair doesn&#x27;t look quite so fine.</li>
            <li>hard for me to say if its better than other volumizing shampoos</li>
    </ol>

When I used this with volumizing mouse and thickening spray and blew my hair with a round brush, I get body that lasts for day.  [[ASIN:B0016FWWGS Wella Color Preserve Volumizing Shampoo, Fine Hair 12 fl oz (335 ml)]]</li>
            <li> I luved the scent upon using it. Smelled like an expensive salon only shampoo. I saw results immediately in my hair. It was fuller at first. Both scent &amp; results wore off over time though. I wash my hair every day or every other day. This size shampoo lasted me 3 months. I was looking for shampoo to make my hair feel strong when I run my fingers through it. When I use Nioxin, my hair feels strong in between my fingers. I&#x27;ve had fine hair since birth and am always looking for help with this. This shampoo was worth a shot at trying.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before. It is not new to me. I ordered it because I like it. Surprisingly I could not find it in local stores so I tried google and am thankful you had it.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. I use it intermittently because I try others and keep coming back to this one. Great product.</li>
            <li> I really like this color preserve volumizing product by Wella.  I have very fine hair and it is light and it is not harsh.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this shampoo as I have very fine hair. I love it. It leaves my hair shiny, clean and ready to style. I&#x27;ve also ordered this before via Amazon.com as I could not find it when I moved to a new state. The product always arrives in excellent condition and usually before the promised delivery date.</li>
            <li> Works great on fine hair.  Hope they keep making it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, Thanks</li>
            <li> Its hard to find a shampoo without artificial colors which tend to dull hair.  This shampoo is perfect.  No frizz, just manageable hair.</li>
            <li> OK product. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo , I dont have to use much and my hair feels clean , I also like Wella Mouse , I did not find it at amazon</li>
            <li> I enjoy Wella products but unfortunately I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this one again. It&#x27;s great at preserving color, but it&#x27;s not great for all hair types. I have oily scalp issues and this shampoo only made it worse.</li>
            <li> Very pleased w/delivery time &amp; product.  Since the total was &amp;#62; $40.00 would have like to have qualified for FREE delivery.</li>
            <li> i have tried many color preserving shampoos - this is the only that actually PRESERVES my color while CLEANING my hair. I have found others that clean it but pull my red out and i have found others that preserve the color but i dont feel like my hair/head is clean!&lt;br /&gt;I need a shampoo that creates BUBBLES, preserves my EXPENSIVE dyed red hair and CLEANS it too! This does it all... and i have tried DOZENS. i always come back to Wellas Color Preserve. I dont know about the Volumizing aspect of it... hard for me to say if its better than other volumizing shampoos -because inthe end i buy it for its ability to save my color!</li>
            <li> Amazon is the only way I can find this product at a decent price. Otherwise I&#x27;d have to schlepp it back by the suitcase full from Germany. Nothing beats the body it gives to highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  I love it.  It leaves your hair smelling fabulous.  I bought it and the delivery was so fast.  Great seller and would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t seem like a good quality product when I looked at the solution inside, then I used it and it dried up my hair and tangled it real bad. If you have oily hair this might be ok, but for normal or color treated hair...no way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not for fine hair, it doesn&#x27;t improve volume.  practically, it doesn&#x27;t work as advertised. it&#x27;s pretty expensive compared with Redken for fine hair which really works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wella Color Preserve Volumizing Shampoo for Fine Hair for about four years and I know it to be a very good product. Being a natural redhead, it will be almost impossible to duplicate my hair color with dye so this leaves me with enough color and my fine hair doesn&#x27;t look quite so fine. Most stores where I had bought it are not carrying it anymore (don&#x27;t know why) and I like it too much to change to something else that won&#x27;t do the same job. Plus, it is one of the very few shampoos to preserve color for natural haircolor and not dyed hair color.</li>
            <li> Thought I was ordering the color preserve CONDITIONer, but instead got the shampoo.  This product would work better in tandem with the conditioner.  When I used the conditioner it really held my color much longer than any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love Wella shampoo. I have never tried the volumizing in the product!!!!  Awesome price and great place to buy it, thank-you!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo--but no one carried it in this area.  So ordering it by Amazon was the right thing to do.  In fact, I would like to order it again.</li>
            <li> Love it. Could not find this in my hometown. So glad Amazon had it. Bought 4 bottles right away.</li>
            <li> I like the volume, it gives my hair and it keeps my hair color longer. I wish I good buy it in the stores.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Gives me more volume than anything else I have tried.  I have very fine hair and this works great!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for my fine hair that is highlighted and colored a light golden red.  Red is a hard color to keep but this shampoo works better than most in that regard.  I love the smell and how it adds body to my hair without any gunky feel.  I use the matching conditioner too - in very small amounts.</li>
