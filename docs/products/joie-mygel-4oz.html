    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>Best thing out there.  </li>
            <li>Has great hold, no build up, and I like the smell!  </li>
            <li>Great hold, don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li>This product works great.  </li>
            <li>As for the product being sticky or greasy, as was my first impression, it can be, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s best to melt and dilute the product, 1 part gel to 2 parts water (it will be liquid at room temp.), and then it&#x27;s almost perfect!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>What is good, however, is that this product did not leave buildup nor flakes, and that is what mattered most to me.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the gel holds well and smells \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but the problem I had is that it made our hair flakey and itchy.</li>
            <li>This gel is the best I&#x27;ve tried for my locs so far.  </li>
            <li>It has a great hold and prevents dryness, but it can make my scalp a bit itchy for the first couple of days, no idea why.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is not like a gel at all, but more of a pomade.  </li>
            <li>Love this gel.  </li>
            <li>I love this on my locs.</li>
            <li>I love my gel</li>
            <li>Have been using this on my locs for more than 5 years</li>
            <li>It was my first time trying this product and it gives me a good hold that I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>Gel is good but it tends to leave white flakes</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s healthy with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you are familiar with strong-hold gels, such as ecostyler, I must say this hold is nowhere near as good as that.  </li>
            <li>When you first use it, you might find yourself applying more than is necessary because it is feels like nothing is on your fingers/comb.  </li>
            <li>Gel works pretty well on my edges, I have 4C hair</li>
            <li>What is in it that is strong enough to take nail polish off?</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>thanks so much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Gorila Snot by Moco for real hold</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick, and it does a pretty good job of keeping it in place</li>
            <li>so i need a little more hold than this can provide</li>
            <li>But if overall it really works.</li>
            <li>This gel smells great and it holds my locs in place until my next wash and re twist,I would recommend this for locs and lose natural hair because it won&#x27;t make your hair hard or stiff like a lot of other gels and its a all natural product</li>

            <li> Will contine buying it as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> This product helped my 4c hair lay down flat for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d use it for styles where i dont need my edgs slicked down all day.</li>
            <li> After a few days gets a little itchy and flaky but keeps edges on point.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will order again bc of the amount vs the price and the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> lightweight&lt;br /&gt;CONS: not the strongest hold, expensive tiny jar</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Gel worked well. Just wish it was bigger</li>
            <li> Great hold, don&#x27;t care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughters edges. And it&#x27;s healthy with natural ingredients. Must have for taming those edges and the &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like the hold of the product.  Not sure if I will order again bc of the amount vs the price and the shipping cost.</li>
            <li> Gel is good but it tends to leave white flakes</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  my friend recommended it to me and so it&#x27;s living up to its expectation.  thanks so much</li>
            <li> This gel smells great and it holds my locs in place until my next wash and re twist,I would recommend this for locs and lose natural hair because it won&#x27;t make your hair hard or stiff like a lot of other gels and its a all natural product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sticky feeling of it. Will only use on edges</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I use it to maintain my locs. It works wonders on my hair. I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best I&#x27;ve tried for my locs so far.  It has a great hold and prevents dryness, but it can make my scalp a bit itchy for the first couple of days, no idea why.  Rosemary/Lavender/Tea tree EO spritzes seem to help.  As for the product being sticky or greasy, as was my first impression, it can be, but I&#x27;ve discovered that it&#x27;s best to melt and dilute the product, 1 part gel to 2 parts water (it will be liquid at room temp.), and then it&#x27;s almost perfect!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  My hair is very thick, and it does a pretty good job of keeping it in place (I use it to re-twist my locs/dreads).  If you are familiar with strong-hold gels, such as ecostyler, I must say this hold is nowhere near as good as that.  If you are looking to keep all your hairs laying flat, this is not the stuff for you.  I don&#x27;t mind flyaways.  What is good, however, is that this product did not leave buildup nor flakes, and that is what mattered most to me.  The consistency is not like a gel at all, but more of a pomade.  When you first use it, you might find yourself applying more than is necessary because it is feels like nothing is on your fingers/comb.  So,&lt;br /&gt;PROS: no flakes, no buildup, lightweight&lt;br /&gt;CONS: not the strongest hold, expensive tiny jar</li>
            <li> Love this gel.  I use it on mine and my daughter&#x27;s locs.  Best thing out there.  Can was my retwists without it unravelling.  Will contine buying it as long as it&#x27;s being sold.</li>
            <li> This product helped my 4c hair lay down flat for a couple hours. The only issue I have with it is that it is quite costly.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I stopped using it after they added an ingredient that I like to stay away from in products.  But if overall it really works.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Has great hold, no build up, and I like the smell!  I will be ordering this again!</li>
            <li> I love this on my locs. It was my first time trying this product and it gives me a good hold that I have been looking for. This will be my staple product for my locs.</li>
            <li> I liked that the gel holds well and smells \\&quot;ok\\&quot; but the problem I had is that it made our hair flakey and itchy.</li>
            <li> Gel works pretty well on my edges, I have 4C hair so i need a little more hold than this can provide but I&#x27;d use it for styles where i dont need my edgs slicked down all day. I&#x27;ve used the Gorila Snot by Moco for real hold</li>
            <li> I love my gel but I just don&#x27;t like that it takes off my nail polish. What is in it that is strong enough to take nail polish off?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight. After a few days gets a little itchy and flaky but keeps edges on point.</li>
            <li> Have been using this on my locs for more than 5 years and I love it!</li>
            <li> Greasy, made me get a head ache</li>
