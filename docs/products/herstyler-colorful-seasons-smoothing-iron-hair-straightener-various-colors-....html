            <li>I am so happy with my choice.  </li>
            <li>It has great heat, but it says the iron is 1.5 in....</li>
            <li>the results were great</li>
            <li>This was a great buy</li>
            <li>I have always had a chi, but I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase.</li>

            <li>works just great.</li>
            <li>and got here in great timing..</li>
            <li>Mine straightens great, but I&#x27;ve had the product for over a month</li>
            <li>not to happy that its not making great curls...</li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great product.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>I love Herstyler Products!!</li>
            <li>There good they seem as if they can break easily!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Great product for a  good price.</li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever used and the price was cheap!</li>
            <li>Straightens better than any tool I&#x27;ve use before very good price!!!</li>
            <li>I have had it for more than a month, and it has been great!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise I love this tool, and its the best that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li>The price was awesome but the product is even better.</li>
            <li>Really good, I love it!!</li>
            <li>The temperature control is perfect, it heats quick, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!</li>
            <li>I have started using my new product, and I&#x27;m in LOVE!!! :D</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li>Yet I have run out of time to brag about how good this Herstyler works.</li>
            <li>now to get good results soon.</li>
            <li>In reality, I don&#x27;t know if it was a good product.  </li>
            <li>it is really a good product i like it</li>
            <li>I loved my straightener, lasted me 2</li>
            <li>about 5 yeas ago i loved it</li>
            <li>it straightens and curls really good .</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so smooth and makes perfect curls too!!!</li>
            <li>Good for the price though, would recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought one before at a kiosk loved the way the lady did my hair paid 300 for the 3 piece set it scrapped out on me</li>
            <li>this is a good iron.</li>
            <li>I LOVED it..</li>
            <li>but this is a good straightener.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t know if this can make really good curls.</li>
            <li>It has a dial to select the heat temp you want and the on/off switch is in a good place</li>
            <li>so I need a good product that is going to have even heat every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I already had a hair straightener that worked as good as this one that I purchased for $15 at the drug store.</li>
            <li>and she loved it</li>
            <li>Started out good.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>So, I bought this product for my granddaughter who loved it.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never ever looked so good.</li>
            <li>The price looked good</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one.</li>
            <li>works great, looks great, and for a great price - thanks!</li>
            <li>Leaves a great silky shiny and stays sleek most days.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener, I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li>im very satisfied</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this hair straightener.</li>
            <li>We all love it, why change if you are happy?</li>
            <li>I love the color, too!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the curling with this, but I&#x27;m sure that works well too!</li>
            <li>OMG this is the ONE I love it!</li>
            <li>Works just as well or better than the straightener I purchased for over $130!</li>
            <li>I seriously love this Straightener!</li>
            <li>But this hair straighter works like magic!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>I love the way this Herstyler iron makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>But this ceramic hair straightener curls my hair BETTER than my curling iron!</li>
            <li>Plus the price was outstanding!  </li>
            <li>You will be glad that you did!</li>
            <li>Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li>Love this Straightener!</li>
            <li>My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more!</li>
            <li>If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity!</li>
            <li>This will be the best investment you will ever own, so dont feel uneasy about how good it is, or if its real..</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with it!</li>
            <li>I love the Herstyler!</li>

            <li>After having this product for awhile now, I can honestly say I would not buy from here again.</li>
            <li>Adjustable knob to control heat settings, ceramic plates, and nice cord length.</li>
            <li>love the adjustable temp LOVED THE PRICE and color</li>
            <li>i works and heats up nice.</li>
            <li>However, cs was nice and agreed to refund my order pronto. .</li>
            <li>now its on warm</li>
            <li>I used this one at my sister&#x27;s home and liked it.  </li>
            <li>use this every day, also does some nice curls too with the rounded edge..</li>

            <li>so I own about 3 of them...one for travel and a spare.....</li>
            <li>It also creates nice wavy curls.</li>
            <li>and it came in it&#x27;s own case.</li>

            <li>Satisfied with process and the product itself.</li>
            <li>..i love it</li>
            <li>Even with spraying each strand of hair before curling, my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl more than about 3 hours.</li>
            <li>but it gives 6x more energy.</li>
            <li>Leaving your hair 6x more softer and shine while eliminating frizziness.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this specific product almost every day for years and it still works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>but here i found it at a really good price that is worth it</li>
            <li>and i made sure to to register it for warranty just in case</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t covered by the herstyler warranty but for that price, I could buy 6 more.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner make it even better.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener and everything that I have tried from the HerStyoer brand....shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, etc...</li>
            <li>i love this flatiron</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better then my cortex straightener.</li>
            <li>I had a chi, and this one is 100 times better.</li>
            <li>Love it better than chi..</li>
            <li>had it for 4 months and love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my teenage daughter!</li>

            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>Yes, it straightened my hair, but it would create a build up of static electricity that my Chi straightener does not create.</li>
            <li>We got it and we love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this tool for two years and my hair is healthy and shiny...</li>

            <li>I really love herstyler straighteners but refuse to pay what they ask in the mall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll never use it.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li>and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li>im in love with it</li>
            <li>Thank you for such an awesome price and product!</li>

            <li>I was able to straighten all my hair very quickly and its nice that it comes in a fun color too!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a pretty good hair straightener</li>
            <li>the flatiron was exactly what I wanted price was good</li>
            <li>After i found this one i was so excited and thought it might be too good to be true.</li>
            <li>many good qualities and sounds like a good flat iron</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find it at this price!</li>
            <li>My mom liked this product so much, she couldn&#x27;t share with my sister and had to get her own.</li>
            <li>I just wasn&#x27;t happy with how that one didn&#x27;t straighten completely and thought I was getting a better one.  </li>
            <li>then i thought i was and was in a cute closed box came with all the papers i needed and it works great on my hair!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot, and I dont think putting the dial up to the full heat is a good idea (450)</li>
            <li>Awsome straightner its one of the best it leaves my hair soft and very straight</li>
            <li>but they where way to much money, this is the same one, great performance, and great price.</li>
            <li>: Comes in a cute satin bag, thats cushioned inside with fleece, and the Herstyler genuine box.</li>
            <li>It heats fast, I like how it has a heat control and it straightens my hair so good.</li>
            <li>A good product is one you don&#x27;t have to think about much.</li>
            <li>This may be good for fine, silky, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I say this straightener is the best from other straightenrs I&#x27;ve bought and used👏.</li>
            <li>This iron on full heat puts a curl that STAYS!</li>
            <li>does the job perfectly easy to use</li>
            <li>It works great :) and this one is only $20!!.</li>
            <li>but it is something that can be handled easily and  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light weight &amp; easy to work with!</li>
            <li>But with Herstyler, my beautiful curls last until I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much I am using it now at home in the States!  </li>
            <li>The best hands down cant wait to get them</li>

            <li>I bought my first one at a mall for $80.</li>

            <li>I had this same straighter before, but the first time I paid way more for it.</li>

            <li>if  you&#x27;re wondering if I was to use  it every day each year how much electricity will that be right?</li>
            <li>I love the Herstyler flat irons</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is phenomenal, I&#x27;ve been able to straighten and bring volume to my hair using this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron....</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My daughter and I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love my Her Styler flat iron and curling wand.</li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>its lasted me 3 years and counting and is still incredible, when I ordered this I thought I would be getting pretty much the same quality but for much less; this was not the case.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love herstyler flat irons!</li>
            <li>i really like your product very much ...</li>
            <li>And my hair looks nice for so long, and I live in FL.</li>
            <li>I bought my new flat iron super excited to use it, but as soon as I got it, plugged it in, waited for it to heat up, it NEVER did!</li>
            <li>I have high hopes for this flat iron to continue strong!</li>
            <li>It get&#x27;s hot fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up in under a minute which really helps during the morning chaos, when there are three kids getting ready for school!</li>
            <li>My first one, I paid almost 10X as much.</li>
            <li>heats up fast and stays hot to strighten or curl hair.</li>
            <li>So you have extra good looking results in no time even if your one of those people that have thick hair, the Herstyler is able to straighten all kinds of hair.</li>
            <li>The Black Super Styler did not, but it is ok.</li>
            <li>I usually use this size flat iron to curl my hair, and I must honestly say it serves its purpose!!</li>
            <li>I love this styler if only I could learn how to work it to make the curls but other than that I love this styler.</li>
            <li>It came super early.</li>
            <li>so when I saw it online for about a third of that, it was an easy choice.  </li>
            <li>This straightener is really good, but definitely not the same quality as a high end straightener.</li>
            <li>smart bf found this on Amazon for me under $20.</li>
            <li>I bought one at the mall a few years ago and paid $150 for it, much better price!</li>
            <li>Heats up super fast, flattens hair in one to two strokes, leaves my hair soft with no frizz.</li>
            <li>It is made to be easy to use with no long wires, huge flat irons, or weighing a ton.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My other straightener goes to 450 and this one doesnt feel nearly as hot as my better one.</li>
            <li>, packaging was terrific and it heats up fine.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need to turn it up very high.</li>
            <li>it made my fine limp hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Purchased my first Herstyler at the mall at a ridiculously high price and this works just as well.  </li>
            <li>They came very early too!!</li>
            <li>I just got this flat iron less than a hour ago from the mail i was happy it got here fast and everything.</li>
            <li>I love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unforgiving in that, once it&#x27;s straight, it&#x27;s staying straight.</li>
            <li>so i should have assumed as much.</li>
            <li>I am biracial and it takes foreevvver to do my hair, this makes it twice as fast.</li>
            <li>I bought a real Herstyler at the mall for $120 and it lasted over a year.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast and the product is packaged well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li>and I straightened my hair fast</li>
            <li>but with the Herstyler I am ready and about to go in 10 minuets!&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this thing.</li>
            <li>so much .fast shipping ..</li>
            <li>$ now i really want another one for my mom</li>
            <li>you will really help me coz</li>
            <li>works really well</li>
            <li>The girl at the kiosk wanted me to pay $200, I thought that was too much.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Works as much as a $100 plus supply</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair, but I wanted to try curling my hair with a straightener.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in a straightener, since this technique might not work for me.</li>
            <li>Yes curling with a straight iron.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone especially my natural sisters.</li>
            <li>I really like Herstyler products.</li>
            <li>Admiittedly, I probably would have never paid that much and would have probably went home and checked online before spending so much  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>so it straightens it fast and contains the poof for a while but doesn&#x27;t handle frizz</li>
            <li>I love the pink Herstyler.  </li>
            <li>The shipping time was fast.</li>
            <li>So when i turned it on it did heat up fast</li>
            <li>The lady demonstrated it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it worked really well, using the straightener to either straighten the hair or to curl it by pulling it through the hair at an angle.  </li>
            <li>the shipment was fast</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a lifespan.</li>
            <li>: pulls my hair, but I dont care, I&#x27;m just more careful, and it does&#x27;nt matter because my hair looks fab.</li>
            <li>Now my hair looks naturally straight.</li>
            <li>So much for being a valued repeat customer.</li>
            <li>This is a real HerStyler Iron.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and straightens hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li>I would really recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed and im really broke to even afford one for 25 dollars ;(</li>
            <li>This iron makes my hair smooth as silk, my hair has body and it does not damage the hair, it actually repairs it!</li>
            <li>Daughter absolutely loves this straightener and she says that it has cut 20 minutes off her hair straightening time.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak much for the straightening part of it, since I don&#x27;t need that feature</li>
            <li>Got it yesterday and my hair is usually very frizzy and curly.</li>
            <li>and I really didn&#x27;t need another straightener</li>
            <li>Cute pink color with dial heat control, on/off switch, and 3-1/2&amp;#34; heating pads.</li>
            <li>With this one I can run it through my hair a few times and it stays nice and straight all day.</li>
            <li>also shipping was a plus, i took the free 5-8 savings free shipping and my package came in less than 3 days!</li>
            <li>I think the key is also to try and round brush your hair straight before you flat iron, which in my experience works the best.  </li>
            <li>I had originally purchased one at my local mall for $100.00 but this one is way cheaper</li>
            <li>I love this in pink!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is OK.  </li>
            <li>I loved my old flat iron and this one is just as good at less than half the price I paid before!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended to every one that has really curly hair..</li>
            <li>if your looking for a great flat iron then look no more...</li>
            <li>Hairstyler flat irons get very hot and there good for thick hair</li>
            <li>Lanee was so excited the receive this this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>For the price, it can break down in a year and be okay</li>
            <li>; Herstyler straightner was brand new in the box!</li>
            <li>I would definitely consider buying this again in the future and highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li>With many different colors you can imagine including hot pink.</li>
            <li>But after a few uses, it stopped getting hot enough, and then it looses its heat as you straighten, so you have to keep turning it off and on just to keep it warm.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this straightener.  </li>
            <li>My hair takes high heat to straighten and this one does the job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by my daughter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it was a little better than this particular model; however this model gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and I paid over 300 for a chi that was a piece of junk compared to this lovely little straightener.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer is a little misleading there, but I love this iron.</li>
            <li>But i got over as long as it works right!</li>
            <li>Its stick straight, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li>It normally takes hours to press then curl my hair</li>
            <li>it is normally $200.</li>
            <li>Am able to return it but have wasted shipping because &amp;#34;it wasn&#x27;t Amazon error&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>just be aware that it takes a while to cool down from 460 degrees</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why because from other reviews I can see it works fine...</li>
            <li>Cracked open the box and plugged it right in.</li>
            <li>I have super long, super naturally straight, super thick hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is shiney and smooth and I don&#x27;t burn myself as often with this iron as with other irons.</li>
            <li>I bought this product with idea in mind that it was new.</li>
            <li>Wish this product was new though.</li>
            <li>i have bought a new one 2 years in a row</li>
            <li>and I wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>I was so upset to spend all that $$ and have to get a new one so soon.</li>
            <li>My curls are much bouncier and last much longer.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a standard one inch flat iron, this one is fine...</li>
            <li>I was really surprised!</li>
            <li>She had had one just like it for years and had gotten to where it just did not get hot enough anymore.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same item.  </li>
            <li>This usually runs for $80 or more.</li>
            <li>it was the exact same one but didn&#x27;t have to pay a lot for it.!!</li>
            <li>Buy here not at the mall, same exact HerStyler that works miracles.</li>
            <li>so I found the same exact one on here.</li>
            <li>my old one!</li>
            <li>and it still is hot enough to in one swipe</li>
            <li>Nearly 75% off!  </li>
            <li>This is my first time buying a non-professional brand for my personal use</li>
            <li>I bought this product through Amazon for my girlfriend exactly 1 month ago and it stopped working last week.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter bought the exact same one for $100.00</li>
            <li>so we got one same exact one</li>
            <li>Then one month later it just quit getting hot.  </li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s super hot (460) and major difference from my last flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I have the pink one, and its a really cute vibrant pink.</li>
            <li>thing I wonder is how this company - Herstyler - is related to PYT (Pretty Young Thing).</li>
            <li>I bought my wife the first one back in 2009 and worked really well for a couple of years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I had this exact flat iron twice over...</li>
            <li>For less then thirty dollars I love it while it last</li>
            <li>I recommened this product real heavy duty and very pretty!!</li>
            <li>I was specifically looking for a larger plate to flat iron quickly.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most flat irons that take forever to heat up, it takes the Herstyler only 25 seconds or less to be ready to use.</li>
            <li>I surprised her with this one about a month ago</li>
            <li>Had no trouble whatsoever when placing order or receiving it.</li>
            <li>As far as curling goes, it takes some getting used to (and a lot of youtube tutorials) to figure it out.</li>
            <li>So the price was the least important to introducing this product to you!  </li>
            <li>so straight this is my third her styler</li>
            <li>thanks for feeding me back ...</li>
            <li>Very nice....love the swivel cord, the color, the pouch and the various heat settings.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li>As a professional hair stylist I would recommend this to everyone....  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone who also wants to try this curling technique.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>but I am a sucker for a cute guy.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>And I actually end up with straight results.</li>
            <li>It will not straighten the hair completely, even though I have it turned up to the highest setting, and we can&#x27;t get it to curl like she did in the mall at all.  </li>
            <li>I am use to spending a lot of money buying professional brands because I have a license.  </li>
            <li>So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li>My 14 year old daughter researched straighteners online and selected this one.  </li>
            <li>This was a lot cheaper that buying in directly from Herstlyer saved me over $50.00</li>
            <li>This product was worth every penny spent.  </li>
            <li>The one I purchased is as good as the one I purchased for my daughter at a mall....which was expecting expensive.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to do anything with my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>and then some how the frizz calms down and is pretty and straight.</li>
            <li>Be aware that this flat iron gets really hot and be careful when using a hair serum since the resulting steam can burn your skin.</li>
            <li>works great and love the results, just not thrilled i got the wrong color when this ad clearly says its for the pink one</li>
            <li>I totally believe this Herstyler is the exact item I tried at the mall and paid only $28!</li>
            <li>I ordered this flat iron because i lost my same exact one at the airport, but the thing that got me was the price , wow , i bought the same exact flat iron from the mall , which these people are ripp offs, and they chaged me almost 100 everytime after taxes.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair that takes forever to curl.  </li>
            <li>No regrets so far</li>
            <li>but I ordered it hot pink and received</li>
            <li>While this flat iron works just fine (I have one that is just like it), it does pull the hair a little and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;good\\&quot; as it does when I use my Chi.  </li>
            <li>i highly suggest whoevers looking for a flat iron to buy one from here!</li>
            <li>It straightens my wavy and somewhat frizzy hair like no other straightener I have tried.</li>
            <li>It only takes me 5 minutes to flat iron my very curly hair.</li>
            <li>so I finally decided to buy this because I don&#x27;t care so much for the 1\\&quot; flat iron I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought flat iron &amp; hair serum together after seeing products at the local shopping mall &amp; refusing to pay that much.</li>
            <li>I went on line over the holidays to purchase a new flat iron.</li>
            <li>With my old iron, it would take me twice as long and the results would not be nearly as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have natural kinky curly hair that is near the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li>but its really stands out in my bathroom, which is entirely pink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve previously owned this exact straightener in purple</li>
            <li>I bought this after I dropped my old Bellezza flat iron on the ground.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my old flat iron, I can&#x27;t lock this one shut when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li>Qualities that you won&#x27;t be able to find in any other plain flat iron.</li>
            <li>When I saw this on line, I was like WOW I can get a 2nd one for back up.</li>
            <li>but then it would be ther same as buying the higher price professional iron which would last a few years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the same as the 2 that i previously bought just waaaaayyyyy cheaper..</li>
            <li>Not very big, but does pull &amp; break hair if not careful.</li>
            <li>I measured and it is only barely 1\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and when I first got the iron, it had a few marks which makes me believe it may have been tampered with or used which causes that plastic-y smell.</li>
            <li>it really was magic on my hair, and for $20 + shipping, on here, you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li>My hope is that it last just as long as the professional ones.</li>
            <li>If you have super curl hair or thick hair</li>
            <li>I bought my first Herstyler flat iron from one of those little booths at the mall.</li>

            <li> Defiantly a great investment.</li>
            <li> Everything was great about it, I&#x27;ve used herstyler for years...except that it was the wring color...</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my choice.  </li>
            <li> It has great heat, but it says the iron is 1.5 in....</li>
            <li> the results were great</li>
            <li> This was a great buy</li>
            <li> I have always had a chi, but I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My Herstyler iron works great, but not in one stroke like the PYT one I got a demonstration with at the mall.</li>
            <li> great product.</li>

            <li> works just great.</li>
            <li> and got here in great timing..</li>
            <li> Mine straightens great, but I&#x27;ve had the product for over a month</li>
            <li> not to happy that its not making great curls...</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I love Herstyler Products!!</li>
            <li> There good they seem as if they can break easily!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product for a  good price.</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used and the price was cheap!</li>
            <li> Straightens better than any tool I&#x27;ve use before very good price!!!</li>
            <li> I have had it for more than a month, and it has been great!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise I love this tool, and its the best that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.</li>
            <li> The price was awesome but the product is even better.</li>
            <li> Really good, I love it!!</li>
            <li> The temperature control is perfect, it heats quick, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair!</li>
            <li> I have started using my new product, and I&#x27;m in LOVE!!! :D</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Yet I have run out of time to brag about how good this Herstyler works.</li>
            <li> now to get good results soon.</li>
            <li> In reality, I don&#x27;t know if it was a good product.  </li>
            <li> it is really a good product i like it</li>
            <li> I loved my straightener, lasted me 2</li>
            <li> about 5 yeas ago i loved it</li>
            <li> it straightens and curls really good .</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so smooth and makes perfect curls too!!!</li>
            <li> Good for the price though, would recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought one before at a kiosk loved the way the lady did my hair paid 300 for the 3 piece set it scrapped out on me</li>
            <li> this is a good iron.</li>
            <li> I LOVED it..</li>
            <li> but this is a good straightener.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know if this can make really good curls.</li>
            <li> It has a dial to select the heat temp you want and the on/off switch is in a good place</li>
            <li> so I need a good product that is going to have even heat every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I already had a hair straightener that worked as good as this one that I purchased for $15 at the drug store.</li>
            <li> and she loved it</li>
            <li> Started out good.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> So, I bought this product for my granddaughter who loved it.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never ever looked so good.</li>
            <li> The price looked good</li>
            <li> and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one.</li>
            <li> works great, looks great, and for a great price - thanks!</li>
            <li> Leaves a great silky shiny and stays sleek most days.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener, I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> im very satisfied</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair straightener.</li>
            <li> We all love it, why change if you are happy?</li>
            <li> I love the color, too!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the curling with this, but I&#x27;m sure that works well too!</li>
            <li> OMG this is the ONE I love it!</li>
            <li> Works just as well or better than the straightener I purchased for over $130!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this Straightener!</li>
            <li> But this hair straighter works like magic!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> I love the way this Herstyler iron makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> But this ceramic hair straightener curls my hair BETTER than my curling iron!</li>
            <li> Plus the price was outstanding!  </li>
            <li> You will be glad that you did!</li>
            <li> Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> Love this Straightener!</li>
            <li> My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more!</li>
            <li> If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity!</li>
            <li> This will be the best investment you will ever own, so dont feel uneasy about how good it is, or if its real..</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with it!</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler!</li>

            <li> it&#x27;s nice , I like it.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot and it doesn&#x27;t straighten good at all!</li>
            <li> After having this product for awhile now, I can honestly say I would not buy from here again.</li>
            <li> Adjustable knob to control heat settings, ceramic plates, and nice cord length.</li>
            <li> love the adjustable temp LOVED THE PRICE and color</li>
            <li> i works and heats up nice.</li>
            <li> However, cs was nice and agreed to refund my order pronto. .</li>
            <li> now its on warm</li>
            <li> I used this one at my sister&#x27;s home and liked it.  </li>
            <li> use this every day, also does some nice curls too with the rounded edge..</li>
            <li> Fast and Great Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> so I own about 3 of them...one for travel and a spare.....</li>
            <li> It also creates nice wavy curls.</li>
            <li> and it came in it&#x27;s own case.</li>
            <li> I own a Chi now</li>
            <li> Loved this product when I received it because it appeared to be in new condition and worked beautifully.</li>

            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * love the bag it comes with</li>
            <li> Some reviews said its better than a chi.</li>
            <li> My sister has one and borrowed it from her and fell in love.</li>
            <li> but I got it and the products for 40:)</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks.</li>

            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so silky i love it.</li>
            <li> Satisfied with process and the product itself.</li>
            <li> ..i love it</li>
            <li> Even with spraying each strand of hair before curling, my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl more than about 3 hours.</li>
            <li> but it gives 6x more energy.</li>
            <li> Leaving your hair 6x more softer and shine while eliminating frizziness.</li>
            <li> Saving the best for last, but the Herstyler is durable and lasts for more than one year and</li>
            <li> I love this straightener</li>
            <li> i love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific product almost every day for years and it still works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> but here i found it at a really good price that is worth it</li>
            <li> and i made sure to to register it for warranty just in case</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t covered by the herstyler warranty but for that price, I could buy 6 more.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner make it even better.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener and everything that I have tried from the HerStyoer brand....shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, etc...</li>
            <li> i love this flatiron</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better then my cortex straightener.</li>
            <li> I had a chi, and this one is 100 times better.</li>
            <li> Love it better than chi..</li>
            <li> had it for 4 months and love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teenage daughter!</li>
            <li> Why better than my chi...</li>
            <li> Loved this straightener so much I purchased one more after I received my own for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Yes, it straightened my hair, but it would create a build up of static electricity that my Chi straightener does not create.</li>
            <li> We got it and we love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this tool for two years and my hair is healthy and shiny...</li>
            <li> I am buying more as Christmas gifts for friends.</li>
            <li> I love the iron</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this iron.</li>
            <li> Love this price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and I love it.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t think this is the authentic Herstyler</li>
            <li> Love my herstyler.</li>
            <li> but it costs no doubt more than thirty with the way it works.</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> Im highly satisfied</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> It works great and fast.</li>
            <li> Broke in record time and was never my favorite when it was working.</li>
            <li> I really love herstyler straighteners but refuse to pay what they ask in the mall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll never use it.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> the most my wife used hers was 2x a week</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up</li>
            <li> and she said it does a way better job</li>
            <li> im in love with it</li>
            <li> Thank you for such an awesome price and product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally in love..</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the HerStyler</li>
            <li> I have noticed if I had damage before using it, my hair will gradually become better with each use.</li>
            <li> i love how you can control the heat settings with the knob and that the cord swivels.</li>
            <li> I was so satisfied with the herstyler</li>
            <li> I love my straightener.</li>
            <li> Just like the ones in the mall that cost you a lot more money.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler.</li>
            <li> but if you want curls that last, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but it still works better than this one.</li>
            <li> My daughter love</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly (within seconds) and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works awesome, which is a surprise considering how cheap it is!</li>
            <li> Unlike most flat irons the Herstyler is known to leave the best results in no time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much love it!!</li>
            <li> i do many styles with this awesome flat iron and you cant be the price!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is incredible!</li>
            <li> Have you ever found yourself unsatisfied with your flat iron, or running out of time making your hair flawless?</li>
            <li> A must have, This is the best flat iron that I ever tried, I saw them at the mall</li>
            <li> This flat iron is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought.  </li>
            <li> and it curls your hair perfectly even though it is a flat iron.</li>
            <li> By the way, I paid way more for mine, but it was well worth it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever!</li>
            <li> and she loved it too Very Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> And it was super cute also!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great and it&#x27;s my new best friend.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten all my hair very quickly and its nice that it comes in a fun color too!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a pretty good hair straightener</li>
            <li> the flatiron was exactly what I wanted price was good</li>
            <li> After i found this one i was so excited and thought it might be too good to be true.</li>
            <li> many good qualities and sounds like a good flat iron</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find it at this price!</li>
            <li> My mom liked this product so much, she couldn&#x27;t share with my sister and had to get her own.</li>
            <li> I just wasn&#x27;t happy with how that one didn&#x27;t straighten completely and thought I was getting a better one.  </li>
            <li> then i thought i was and was in a cute closed box came with all the papers i needed and it works great on my hair!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot, and I dont think putting the dial up to the full heat is a good idea (450)</li>
            <li> Awsome straightner its one of the best it leaves my hair soft and very straight</li>
            <li> but they where way to much money, this is the same one, great performance, and great price.</li>
            <li> : Comes in a cute satin bag, thats cushioned inside with fleece, and the Herstyler genuine box.</li>
            <li> It heats fast, I like how it has a heat control and it straightens my hair so good.</li>
            <li> A good product is one you don&#x27;t have to think about much.</li>
            <li> This may be good for fine, silky, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I say this straightener is the best from other straightenrs I&#x27;ve bought and used👏.</li>
            <li> This iron on full heat puts a curl that STAYS!</li>
            <li> does the job perfectly easy to use</li>
            <li> It works great :) and this one is only $20!!.</li>
            <li> but it is something that can be handled easily and  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light weight &amp; easy to work with!</li>
            <li> But with Herstyler, my beautiful curls last until I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much I am using it now at home in the States!  </li>
            <li> The best hands down cant wait to get them</li>
            <li> Lol They get hot quick and they make your hair super straight with a shine!!!</li>
            <li> the herstyler I purchased at the mall in CA worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It still works fine</li>
            <li> it works perfectly fine</li>
            <li> and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers!</li>
            <li> My little cousin loved this--thanks!!</li>
            <li> the plates were roughish and did not glide smooth over hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic straightener.</li>
            <li> and  proud to present the \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot;</li>
            <li> What are you waiting for go on Amazon and find the product so you can shine off that smooth hair that has been waiting to show</li>
            <li> I could not believe that they were in great condition and had the things that were supposed come with them, especially for these prices.</li>
            <li> I have an issue with the light on it that says if it&#x27;s on or off it went out on the one from the kiosk and on here</li>
            <li> Great price and same results as the over priced one I bought years ago.</li>
            <li> Not only did this seller have great price but the product was delivered before the estimated time.</li>
            <li> The price was great, it was shipped out promptly, the only thing is</li>
            <li> He did throw in some free shampoo though.</li>
            <li> Worked great in the beginning but two months later it quit heating.</li>

            <li> it is such a great straightener</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do such a great job of straightening hair.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> which was free compared to her price.</li>
            <li> worth the $25 (not any more than $35).  </li>
            <li> As mentioned earlier that the Herstyler contains many good qualities.  </li>

            <li> a lime green one lol</li>
            <li> It worked great for a few months, and then the cord shorted out.</li>
            <li> Works amazing and didn&#x27;t even have to pay all that much , definitely a must buy!</li>
            <li> and i was happy so about a few mins into straightening my hair</li>
            <li> it says it makes here hair feel smooth and silky and really straight without alot of effort</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this one in a pinch for $20 it was worth a try.</li>

            <li> This straightener is worth the money.</li>

            <li> Worth it.  </li>
            <li> it was definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used.</li>
            <li> Oh - I was charged for shipping even though I bought $125 worth of items</li>
            <li> It honestly is worth the $200, but if you can order it through Amazon for $24-it is a steal.  </li>

            <li> Ok so my chi finally bit the dust</li>

            <li> i broke my first one when i dropped it on the floor</li>
            <li> And pulls hair and the ceramic turned brown when it got hot.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through many different brands and</li>
            <li> but sometimes it doesnt get as hot.</li>
            <li> Also, if you even think you may want to curl it, DON&#x27;T straighten it first.</li>
            <li> Fast service!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> and it broke within the first 3 months</li>
            <li> Bought one in mall first.</li>
            <li> and my hair stays silky straight for days!</li>
            <li> One of the better hair straighters for African hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No, it&#x27;s not a fake.</li>
            <li> I bought my first one at a mall for $80.</li>
            <li> my first one lasted about 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I had this same straighter before, but the first time I paid way more for it.</li>
            <li> It seems like its only 1 inch at the most.</li>
            <li> The only Straightener that works wonders on my hair leaving it smooth, soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li> Recieved it and it doesn&#x27;t get hot</li>
            <li> For the price it works really well!</li>
            <li> its all that, its real!</li>
            <li> This straightener works great on my hair, I like that it has different temps and the pink color is fun too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the first time i dropped it and broke the plates</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even take me 20 minutes to get it straight plus no damage to my hair!</li>
            <li> One of my cousins have this exact straightener</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased 2 more for upcoming gifts.</li>
            <li> comes sealed in a pretty box)</li>
            <li> This heats high and quick.  </li>
            <li> In such short words I have explained and can&#x27;t stop saying how this flat iron is the best friend to every girl&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> if  you&#x27;re wondering if I was to use  it every day each year how much electricity will that be right?</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler flat irons</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is phenomenal, I&#x27;ve been able to straighten and bring volume to my hair using this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron....</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love my Her Styler flat iron and curling wand.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> its lasted me 3 years and counting and is still incredible, when I ordered this I thought I would be getting pretty much the same quality but for much less; this was not the case.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love herstyler flat irons!</li>
            <li> i really like your product very much ...</li>
            <li> And my hair looks nice for so long, and I live in FL.</li>
            <li> I bought my new flat iron super excited to use it, but as soon as I got it, plugged it in, waited for it to heat up, it NEVER did!</li>
            <li> I have high hopes for this flat iron to continue strong!</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s hot fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up in under a minute which really helps during the morning chaos, when there are three kids getting ready for school!</li>
            <li> My first one, I paid almost 10X as much.</li>
            <li> heats up fast and stays hot to strighten or curl hair.</li>
            <li> So you have extra good looking results in no time even if your one of those people that have thick hair, the Herstyler is able to straighten all kinds of hair.</li>
            <li> The Black Super Styler did not, but it is ok.</li>
            <li> I usually use this size flat iron to curl my hair, and I must honestly say it serves its purpose!!</li>
            <li> I love this styler if only I could learn how to work it to make the curls but other than that I love this styler.</li>
            <li> It came super early.</li>
            <li> so when I saw it online for about a third of that, it was an easy choice.  </li>
            <li> This straightener is really good, but definitely not the same quality as a high end straightener.</li>
            <li> smart bf found this on Amazon for me under $20.</li>
            <li> I bought one at the mall a few years ago and paid $150 for it, much better price!</li>
            <li> Heats up super fast, flattens hair in one to two strokes, leaves my hair soft with no frizz.</li>
            <li> It is made to be easy to use with no long wires, huge flat irons, or weighing a ton.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My other straightener goes to 450 and this one doesnt feel nearly as hot as my better one.</li>
            <li> , packaging was terrific and it heats up fine.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need to turn it up very high.</li>
            <li> it made my fine limp hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Purchased my first Herstyler at the mall at a ridiculously high price and this works just as well.  </li>
            <li> They came very early too!!</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron less than a hour ago from the mail i was happy it got here fast and everything.</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very unforgiving in that, once it&#x27;s straight, it&#x27;s staying straight.</li>
            <li> so i should have assumed as much.</li>
            <li> I am biracial and it takes foreevvver to do my hair, this makes it twice as fast.</li>
            <li> I bought a real Herstyler at the mall for $120 and it lasted over a year.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast and the product is packaged well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast.</li>
            <li> and I straightened my hair fast</li>
            <li> but with the Herstyler I am ready and about to go in 10 minuets!&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this thing.</li>
            <li> so much .fast shipping ..</li>
            <li> $ now i really want another one for my mom</li>
            <li> you will really help me coz</li>
            <li> works really well</li>
            <li> The girl at the kiosk wanted me to pay $200, I thought that was too much.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Works as much as a $100 plus supply</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but I wanted to try curling my hair with a straightener.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in a straightener, since this technique might not work for me.</li>
            <li> Yes curling with a straight iron.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to everyone especially my natural sisters.</li>
            <li> I really like Herstyler products.</li>
            <li> Admiittedly, I probably would have never paid that much and would have probably went home and checked online before spending so much  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> so it straightens it fast and contains the poof for a while but doesn&#x27;t handle frizz</li>
            <li> I love the pink Herstyler.  </li>
            <li> The shipping time was fast.</li>
            <li> So when i turned it on it did heat up fast</li>
            <li> The lady demonstrated it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it worked really well, using the straightener to either straighten the hair or to curl it by pulling it through the hair at an angle.  </li>
            <li> the shipment was fast</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a lifespan.</li>
            <li> : pulls my hair, but I dont care, I&#x27;m just more careful, and it does&#x27;nt matter because my hair looks fab.</li>
            <li> Now my hair looks naturally straight.</li>
            <li> So much for being a valued repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This is a real HerStyler Iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens hair without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I would really recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed and im really broke to even afford one for 25 dollars ;(</li>
            <li> This iron makes my hair smooth as silk, my hair has body and it does not damage the hair, it actually repairs it!</li>
            <li> Daughter absolutely loves this straightener and she says that it has cut 20 minutes off her hair straightening time.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak much for the straightening part of it, since I don&#x27;t need that feature</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday and my hair is usually very frizzy and curly.</li>
            <li> and I really didn&#x27;t need another straightener</li>
            <li> Cute pink color with dial heat control, on/off switch, and 3-1/2&amp;#34; heating pads.</li>
            <li> With this one I can run it through my hair a few times and it stays nice and straight all day.</li>
            <li> also shipping was a plus, i took the free 5-8 savings free shipping and my package came in less than 3 days!</li>
            <li> I think the key is also to try and round brush your hair straight before you flat iron, which in my experience works the best.  </li>
            <li> I had originally purchased one at my local mall for $100.00 but this one is way cheaper</li>
            <li> I love this in pink!</li>
            <li> Other than that it is OK.  </li>
            <li> I loved my old flat iron and this one is just as good at less than half the price I paid before!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended to every one that has really curly hair..</li>
            <li> if your looking for a great flat iron then look no more...</li>
            <li> Hairstyler flat irons get very hot and there good for thick hair</li>
            <li> Lanee was so excited the receive this this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> For the price, it can break down in a year and be okay</li>
            <li> ; Herstyler straightner was brand new in the box!</li>
            <li> I would definitely consider buying this again in the future and highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> With many different colors you can imagine including hot pink.</li>
            <li> But after a few uses, it stopped getting hot enough, and then it looses its heat as you straighten, so you have to keep turning it off and on just to keep it warm.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this one.  </li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this straightener.  </li>
            <li> My hair takes high heat to straighten and this one does the job.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by my daughter.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it was a little better than this particular model; however this model gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and I paid over 300 for a chi that was a piece of junk compared to this lovely little straightener.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer is a little misleading there, but I love this iron.</li>
            <li> But i got over as long as it works right!</li>
            <li> Its stick straight, shiny, and soft.</li>
            <li> It normally takes hours to press then curl my hair</li>
            <li> it is normally $200.</li>
            <li> Am able to return it but have wasted shipping because &amp;#34;it wasn&#x27;t Amazon error&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> just be aware that it takes a while to cool down from 460 degrees</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why because from other reviews I can see it works fine...</li>
            <li> Cracked open the box and plugged it right in.</li>
            <li> I have super long, super naturally straight, super thick hair.</li>
            <li> Hair is shiney and smooth and I don&#x27;t burn myself as often with this iron as with other irons.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with idea in mind that it was new.</li>
            <li> Wish this product was new though.</li>
            <li> i have bought a new one 2 years in a row</li>
            <li> and I wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> I was so upset to spend all that $$ and have to get a new one so soon.</li>
            <li> My curls are much bouncier and last much longer.</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for a standard one inch flat iron, this one is fine...</li>
            <li> I was really surprised!</li>
            <li> She had had one just like it for years and had gotten to where it just did not get hot enough anymore.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same item.  </li>
            <li> This usually runs for $80 or more.</li>
            <li> it was the exact same one but didn&#x27;t have to pay a lot for it.!!</li>
            <li> Buy here not at the mall, same exact HerStyler that works miracles.</li>
            <li> so I found the same exact one on here.</li>
            <li> my old one!</li>
            <li> and it still is hot enough to in one swipe</li>
            <li> Nearly 75% off!  </li>
            <li> This is my first time buying a non-professional brand for my personal use</li>
            <li> I bought this product through Amazon for my girlfriend exactly 1 month ago and it stopped working last week.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter bought the exact same one for $100.00</li>
            <li> so we got one same exact one</li>
            <li> Then one month later it just quit getting hot.  </li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s super hot (460) and major difference from my last flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have the pink one, and its a really cute vibrant pink.</li>
            <li> thing I wonder is how this company - Herstyler - is related to PYT (Pretty Young Thing).</li>
            <li> I bought my wife the first one back in 2009 and worked really well for a couple of years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I had this exact flat iron twice over...</li>
            <li> For less then thirty dollars I love it while it last</li>
            <li> I recommened this product real heavy duty and very pretty!!</li>
            <li> I was specifically looking for a larger plate to flat iron quickly.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most flat irons that take forever to heat up, it takes the Herstyler only 25 seconds or less to be ready to use.</li>
            <li> I surprised her with this one about a month ago</li>
            <li> Had no trouble whatsoever when placing order or receiving it.</li>
            <li> As far as curling goes, it takes some getting used to (and a lot of youtube tutorials) to figure it out.</li>
            <li> So the price was the least important to introducing this product to you!  </li>
            <li> so straight this is my third her styler</li>
            <li> thanks for feeding me back ...</li>
            <li> Very nice....love the swivel cord, the color, the pouch and the various heat settings.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s natural hair.</li>
            <li> As a professional hair stylist I would recommend this to everyone....  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone who also wants to try this curling technique.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> but I am a sucker for a cute guy.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> And I actually end up with straight results.</li>
            <li> It will not straighten the hair completely, even though I have it turned up to the highest setting, and we can&#x27;t get it to curl like she did in the mall at all.  </li>
            <li> I am use to spending a lot of money buying professional brands because I have a license.  </li>
            <li> So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly.</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter researched straighteners online and selected this one.  </li>
            <li> This was a lot cheaper that buying in directly from Herstlyer saved me over $50.00</li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny spent.  </li>
            <li> The one I purchased is as good as the one I purchased for my daughter at a mall....which was expecting expensive.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to do anything with my thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> and then some how the frizz calms down and is pretty and straight.</li>
            <li> Be aware that this flat iron gets really hot and be careful when using a hair serum since the resulting steam can burn your skin.</li>
            <li> works great and love the results, just not thrilled i got the wrong color when this ad clearly says its for the pink one</li>
            <li> I totally believe this Herstyler is the exact item I tried at the mall and paid only $28!</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron because i lost my same exact one at the airport, but the thing that got me was the price , wow , i bought the same exact flat iron from the mall , which these people are ripp offs, and they chaged me almost 100 everytime after taxes.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair that takes forever to curl.  </li>
            <li> No regrets so far</li>
            <li> but I ordered it hot pink and received</li>
            <li> While this flat iron works just fine (I have one that is just like it), it does pull the hair a little and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;good\\&quot; as it does when I use my Chi.  </li>
            <li> i highly suggest whoevers looking for a flat iron to buy one from here!</li>
            <li> It straightens my wavy and somewhat frizzy hair like no other straightener I have tried.</li>
            <li> It only takes me 5 minutes to flat iron my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> so I finally decided to buy this because I don&#x27;t care so much for the 1\\&quot; flat iron I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought flat iron &amp; hair serum together after seeing products at the local shopping mall &amp; refusing to pay that much.</li>
            <li> I went on line over the holidays to purchase a new flat iron.</li>
            <li> With my old iron, it would take me twice as long and the results would not be nearly as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have natural kinky curly hair that is near the middle of my back.  </li>
            <li> but its really stands out in my bathroom, which is entirely pink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned this exact straightener in purple</li>
            <li> I bought this after I dropped my old Bellezza flat iron on the ground.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my old flat iron, I can&#x27;t lock this one shut when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li> Qualities that you won&#x27;t be able to find in any other plain flat iron.</li>
            <li> When I saw this on line, I was like WOW I can get a 2nd one for back up.</li>
            <li> but then it would be ther same as buying the higher price professional iron which would last a few years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly the same as the 2 that i previously bought just waaaaayyyyy cheaper..</li>
            <li> Not very big, but does pull &amp; break hair if not careful.</li>
            <li> I measured and it is only barely 1\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and when I first got the iron, it had a few marks which makes me believe it may have been tampered with or used which causes that plastic-y smell.</li>
            <li> it really was magic on my hair, and for $20 + shipping, on here, you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> My hope is that it last just as long as the professional ones.</li>
            <li> If you have super curl hair or thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought my first Herstyler flat iron from one of those little booths at the mall.</li>
            <li> i have thick, coarse hair, and it makes my hair really soft and straight.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that only 3 months after I purchased it the flat iron got a short in it.</li>
            <li> I had to roll mine up like a vacuum cleaner cord and clip it with a hair clip.</li>
            <li> This is very different than the Herstyler flat iron from the actual distributor.</li>
            <li> but I would like to say that buying this flat iron from Amazon is not the same as purchasing from the actual manufacturer; therefore, there is no way to confirm that this is actually a \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot; flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I never realized there was such a difference in the quality of flat irons.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results that I was hoping for I have seen these flat irons at various malls and even had the girl test them out on my hair and</li>
            <li> And the beauty of this flat iron is that it actually cleans your hair while it straightens!</li>
            <li> &quot; There is a reason why the price was not mentioned earlier and it is because this flat iron is just $22!</li>
            <li> Using a little electricity will be least of you&#x27;re problems that you will be so amazed that you will want to use it a lot to show it off to your friends, because the flat iron can be easily taken to places such as school or dances or when you feel like you might need it.</li>
            <li> One, for example is this flat iron leaves your hair not 3x like any regular flat iron</li>
            <li> I bought an older version of this straightener a few years ago and my sister broke it.</li>
            <li> This seller (Cosmetic 4 Less) is very professional and customer oriented.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this flat iron to my friends!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I wanted a flat iron that I could use to curl my hair as well as straighten it.</li>
            <li> I use them to both curl my hair and flat iron my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these flat irons as gifts because I already had one in purple since 2008.</li>
            <li> Also gives LONG lasting curls....</li>
            <li> Wish I would have had one like this 8 flat irons ago....</li>
            <li> so I ordered the flat irons online.</li>
            <li> well long story short</li>
            <li> I have no need to press &amp; flat iron ever and its so shiny and bouncy.</li>
            <li> She curled my hair with the flat iron</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought this flat iron at the mall for about $200.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loved this flat iron and was terribly disappointed when it quit working.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for my extra tight curls (I have natural ethnic hair).</li>
            <li> Yet it was more frustrating that the curls wouldn&#x27;t last past one or two hours even with hair product.  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, because I didn&#x27;t think this was going to be the right choice for me.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll have to go over your hair a couple times and it leaves your a little frizzy until you&#x27;re completely done</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and thick and I would have to use a flat iron to straight my hair.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the cord is like 3 feet long and gets in the way a lot when you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I looked at several and choose the Herstyler in pink.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and pack it in a suitcase weekly.</li>
            <li> wavy long frizzy</li>
            <li> The only advice I have is to be careful with the heat setting.</li>
            <li> They last a very long time compared to other flat irons.</li>
            <li> The plates are very fragile, almost broken if you will, the plates are stained from previous use on someone&#x27;s else&#x27;s hair, but I will say it heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I tell every single client that uses flat irons to buy this one!!!</li>
            <li> Other countries are oftentimes not held to American safety standards.</li>
            <li> And I dont look like my hair is dry, fried, and frizzy..</li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this as a $20 flat iron, but I would have been really disappointed if I paid much more for it.</li>
            <li> african american hair,that I usually press &amp; flat iron.</li>
            <li> It takes about half an hour to do my whole head, and that may seem long, but my hair is long, and really, really thick.</li>
            <li> I still have it, but I dropped it on a hard floor and chipped the plates, the chipped plates would tug on my hair so it was time to get a new one.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product over all other flat irons!</li>
            <li> so I can only turn mine up about half way</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I owned a HerStyler flatiron previously</li>
            <li> I found this one for less that $30.00 same brand and all.</li>
            <li> This straightener is the same one as the vendor that is set up in the mall and the price is so much less.  </li>
            <li> I do like that this one is a bit bigger, I like that it has a heat control which my previous herstyler straighteners did not.</li>
            <li> It was super expensive there</li>
            <li> Well you won&#x27;t have to worry because the creators of the Herstyler created this flat iron it to use less electricity than other flat irons.</li>
            <li> Ok so I was sceptical to buy this after seeing some bad reviews</li>
            <li> so i ordered the pink one</li>
            <li> One of the ceramic plates came very loose.</li>
            <li> Not a real herstyler.</li>
            <li> I have a FHI straightener that i bought for roughly $250 and</li>
            <li> my sister likes it, and its pink, her fav color.</li>
            <li> Be careful because it burned my countertop.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all</li>
            <li> Ordered a pink one.....</li>
            <li> The the packing slip even said pink.</li>
            <li> but this time decided I wanted to try the pink 1 1/2in straightener instead.</li>
            <li> Be careful of where electrical appliances are manufactured.</li>
            <li> but I bought this pink one for my sister and she loves it.</li>
            <li> i got it in pink</li>
            <li> but i dont have the time to waste shipping it back to get pink.</li>
            <li> I bought a Herstyler 1.5\\&quot; flat iron in the mall a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these in different colors in the past year and both have chipped/broken pieces off of the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> I use it once every other week</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually a $200 straightener, for only $20.</li>
            <li> Other tools would damage my hair and the ends would break off.</li>
            <li> Im extremely unsatisfied with thus.product and Amazons</li>
            <li> i bought it a 2nd time and was too lazy to unplug it correctly</li>
            <li> surprise they were closed down.</li>
            <li> Something so small compared to other flat irons, but you know what they say sometimes small things can cause or do something bigger than what you have imagined.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller in hopes they would just exchange for a new one, but was informed that they do not stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> I was annoyed later to see the flat irons in the mall were not Herstyler like the gel she gave me but PYT.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and would take me an hour to straighten my hair daily</li>
            <li> but I ordered the PINK one and received the green one.</li>
            <li> I specifically order a pink one and they sent me a green one.</li>
            <li> the heat was going down and</li>
            <li> Long time user of the her styler flat iron, I have thick, usually unmanageable hair</li>
            <li> Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke!</li>
            <li> I see negative reviews about this flat iron</li>
            <li> and once I straighten it out with other irons it frizzes within a few hours.</li>
            <li> bought one at the mall for $150 and couldn&#x27;t believe i found this one for less than $50 i had to buy it for my mother-in-law</li>
            <li> We have known people who have bought this product at the mall, i bought this for less than half of what they paid.</li>
            <li> It arrive in less than three days.</li>
            <li> i will get a black one</li>
            <li> Decided to get the same one again because the old one is dirty.</li>
            <li> The Herstyler cuts that process in half</li>
            <li> but the price was $100 less.</li>
            <li> Even with the $5.95 shipping fee, it is still less than it would be in the mall.  </li>
            <li> I typically get the zebra printed one</li>
            <li> when I received my flat iron it looked as if it had been sitting on a shelf forever, the inside was dusty and the plates on the iron were a loose.</li>
            <li> and I have long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have long thick curly/frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It does feel a little odd in my hand</li>
            <li> As fas as performance, I do not have one single complaint.  </li>
            <li> A little bit of hair spray here and there, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a month</li>
            <li> (i had it set to close to 400f) after that little by little</li>
            <li> Took a little training on my part~</li>
            <li> Replaces an identical one purchased a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I have bought several herstyler products from herstyler online the official site which can get pricey, but these are poor quality and do not work well.</li>
            <li> i dont like green</li>
            <li> when i opend it i had marks looking like it was used and was missing bag.</li>
            <li> I have very curly thick hair which can be difficult and time consuming to straighten.</li>
            <li> and after having it for less then 6 months its stopped working!</li>
            <li> I have tight thick ethnic hair and beats getting a relaxer any day.</li>
            <li> It can get hot enough to tame the worst hair,it can also curl.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait to be unsatisfied with the results you get now with the plain, untrendy, and useless flat iron and get the \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but really i want it badly ...</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink and got Purple not happy about that</li>
            <li> Well they wouldn&#x27;t exchange because Small Bill wasn&#x27;t an authorized seller so the company, nor Small Bill would exchanged this for me.</li>
            <li> like I have in the past.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It usually takes 20 min to straighten my hair..</li>
            <li> usually these are over 10 bucks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> She was shocked at how much I only spent..</li>
            <li> but when I received mine the dial to turn the heat up or down was broken</li>
            <li> My hair is really hard to straighten with any type of iron or blow dryer if I do it alone.  </li>
            <li> it was put through, nothing to hard</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in myself for allowing myself to be sucked in to a high pressure sales pitch.  </li>
            <li> I stupidly purchased this at the mall at one of those temporary kiosks where you can&#x27;t return the item, for WAY too much money (about 3 times what you can buy it for here).  </li>
            <li> but I was not quite crazy enough to pay $100-200 just for a straightener!</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing wet2straights are the worst for your hair which is so incredibly true.  </li>
            <li> nothing was broken or missing!</li>
            <li> I live in wisconsin and the humidity some days are just stupid.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that when you iron your hair and you wash it your hair ends up staying like burnt hair.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a straightener to tame my thick crazy hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and it gets frustrating</li>
            <li> Not happy about that</li>
            <li> Works like the expensive $200 ones from the mall, if not better!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve damaged my hair so badly in the past.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this Straightener to girls with very very thick hair!</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong</li>
            <li> The dial for temperature was also difficult to turn.</li>
            <li> Seller sent wrong color</li>
            <li> but they r so expensive at the mall</li>
            <li> The company expects me to pay an extra $12.00 for shipping and handling, but that&#x27;s crap!</li>
            <li> Disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> my mom is in a bad need to it ...</li>
            <li> but it kinda smells bad when using it</li>
            <li> The bad thing is the plates broke and theirs a crack in it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed since I don&#x27;t know where to get one separately.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that it is not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Shame on amazon for allowing suppliers who provide poor products!!!</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> Biggest  Piece of crap..</li>
            <li> and I hate the experience.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, I bragged to my friend about my find, and she told me she bought the Herstyler curling iron at the mall from those annoying sales people for 200.00.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This company is CRAP!</li>

            <li> does the job perfectly easy to use</li>
            <li> Ok so my chi finally bit the dust so I decided to try this one in a pinch for $20 it was worth a try. I was really surprised! It does probably a better job than my chi. It gets super hot really fast just be aware that it takes a while to cool down from 460 degrees</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  She had had one just like it for years and had gotten to where it just did not get hot enough anymore.  I surprised her with this one about a month ago and she said it is working great.  Best I could tell ya, I have personally never used one. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of these in different colors in the past year and both have chipped/broken pieces off of the ceramic plates. Not very big, but does pull &amp; break hair if not careful. Otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and looks pretty.</li>
            <li> i broke my first one when i dropped it on the floor so i ordered the pink one &#x3D;) i love it, it heats up fast, works really well, and its cute. i have thick, coarse hair, and it makes my hair really soft and straight. no tugging either. plus it curls hair well.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I dropped my old Bellezza flat iron on the ground.  I loved my old flat iron and this one is just as good at less than half the price I paid before!  I love the color, too!  I would definitely consider buying this again in the future and highly recommend it. :)</li>
            <li> This straightener is worth the money. Heats up in no time and only takes me about 30 minutes to straighten my hair and I have long, thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> The best straighter i have owned! bought one at the mall for $150 and couldn&#x27;t believe i found this one for less than $50 i had to buy it for my mother-in-law and she loved it too Very Fast Shipping</li>
            <li> Love it!  Replaces an identical one purchased a few years ago. Great product!  Great price!</li>
            <li> My little cousin loved this--thanks!!</li>
            <li> One of the ceramic plates came very loose. And pulls hair and the ceramic turned brown when it got hot.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* gets hot super fast&lt;br /&gt;* makes hair very straight in what stroke&lt;br /&gt;* fast and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;* love the bag it comes with so when I unplug it I can put it away w/o waiting for it to cool off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wish was that I could figure out how to use it to make curls.  I&#x27;ve tried and it gets frustrating but that&#x27;s probably b/c I&#x27;m not doing it right or something.</li>
            <li> exactly as advertised</li>
            <li> Great iron. Hair is shiney and smooth and I don&#x27;t burn myself as often with this iron as with other irons.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it. It has different temperature settings and a nice box for storage.</li>
            <li> Hate it. Went from a Chi to this. Some reviews said its better than a chi. I disagree. It was only $20 so i should have assumed as much.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron! My sister has one and borrowed it from her and fell in love. I have tight thick ethnic hair and beats getting a relaxer any day.</li>
            <li> My niece Loved it!  Great product for a  good price.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny it&#x27;s nice , I like it. &amp; a women tried to get me to buy it for 100 dollars but I got it and the products for 40:)</li>
            <li> I too got ripped off at the mall. This is the exact same item.  It works great :) and this one is only $20!!. The warranty I was told that came with it from the mall was B.S.</li>
            <li> Great product, the quality is awesome. I love the product, very high quality look, use and results. Love the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li> Best flatiron I&#x27;ve ever owned in life.  Get&#x27;s super hot (460) and major difference from my last flat iron.  Don&#x27;t get ripped at the mall ($175+). Great product! and heard it lasts for years.  Add some argon oil to your order, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is incredible! I use it once every other week and I have not had any breakage/split ends...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it but my wife says it works great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> the herstyler I purchased at the mall in CA worked fine.  the one I purchased on amazon was different.  the plates were roughish and did not glide smooth over hair.  I sent it back to you.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my step daughter, works great</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic straightener. Works like the expensive $200 ones from the mall, if not better! I am biracial and it takes foreevvver to do my hair, this makes it twice as fast. I haven&#x27;t quite mastered the curling with this, but I&#x27;m sure that works well too!</li>
            <li> It doesnt get hot at all! It stopped working after a month. You get what you paid for. I bought a real Herstyler at the mall for $120 and it lasted over a year. When I saw this on line, I was like WOW I can get a 2nd one for back up. What a joke.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail and I am SO happy with it! I&#x27;ve been through many different brands and OMG this is the ONE I love it!</li>
            <li> I really love this straightener so much so that I had my mom purchase one for a Christmas gift for my sister in law. She borrow mine and loved it! I purchased it from the same seller  because I had such a great experience with her over the summer.</li>
            <li> Great product! Arrived in time and amazing price. This usually runs for $80 or more. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Not a real herstyler. Does not get very hot and it doesn&#x27;t straighten good at all! I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works awesome, which is a surprise considering how cheap it is! I love it.. Works just as well or better than the straightener I purchased for over $130! Shipping is fast and the product is packaged well. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler flat irons but when I received mine the dial to turn the heat up or down was broken so I can only turn mine up about half way and that&#x27;s it.  It takes longer than it should to straighten my hair since I can&#x27;t turn the heat up to where I need it to be.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is very cute and works well. It makes my hair so silky i love it. It is very easy to get to the roots and you only have to go over it one time too. I saw this flatiron in the mall and was sold, but it was like 200 dollars ohhh no so got on amazon saw this seller and ordered as soon as possible. it was the exact same one but didn&#x27;t have to pay a lot for it.!! I am a proud buyer!!!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly what I was looking for and very affordable!!</li>
            <li> Satisfied with process and the product itself.Had no trouble whatsoever when placing order or receiving it.I wanna purchase another one!</li>
            <li> I seriously love this Straightener! It is the best I have ever used and the price was cheap! My hair is very long and thick and I would have to use a flat iron to straight my hair. But this hair straighter works like magic! I have the pink one, and its a really cute vibrant pink. I recommend this Straightener to girls with very very thick hair!</li>
            <li> Awsome straightner its one of the best it leaves my hair soft and very straight..i love it but sometimes it doesnt get as hot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I wanted a flat iron that I could use to curl my hair as well as straighten it. A lot of reviewers say that this one is like the ones you see at the mall, and on the back of the Herstyler box, it does say MSRP $200. Well, this flat iron is &amp;#34;ok.&amp;#34; It does a great job straightening, and goes up to like 460 degrees. It has a simple on/off switch and a temperature dial. As far as curling goes, it takes some getting used to (and a lot of youtube tutorials) to figure it out. Even with spraying each strand of hair before curling, my hair didn&#x27;t hold the curl more than about 3 hours. Then again, that could just be my hair. Also, if you even think you may want to curl it, DON&#x27;T straighten it first. It&#x27;s very unforgiving in that, once it&#x27;s straight, it&#x27;s staying straight. Unlike my old flat iron, I can&#x27;t lock this one shut when I&#x27;m not using it. Additionally, the cord is like 3 feet long and gets in the way a lot when you&#x27;re using it. I had to roll mine up like a vacuum cleaner cord and clip it with a hair clip. I definitely would recommend this as a $20 flat iron, but I would have been really disappointed if I paid much more for it.</li>
            <li> My item arrived within 3 business days! Fast service! The product I purchased; Herstyler straightner was brand new in the box! Thank you cosmetics4less!</li>
            <li> HerStyler flatiron are the best and the price on this one is unbelievable! Shipping was really fast. No complaints at all. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I owned a HerStyler flatiron previously and it was a little better than this particular model; however this model gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Excellent straightener. I have a lot of hair and I straightened my hair fast</li>
            <li> Have you ever found yourself unsatisfied with your flat iron, or running out of time making your hair flawless?,  Well I have the perfect solution for you  and  proud to present the \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot;, colorful seasons 1.5. Something so small compared to other flat irons, but you know what they say sometimes small things can cause or do something bigger than what you have imagined. Well this is the case with this flat iron the Herstyler , does not only have good qualities and satisfying  but it is something that can be handled easily and  if your someone that likes to trend well luckily this product is now on style. With many different colors you can imagine including hot pink. There are so many amazing things that this product has that you just have to read on and find out more.&lt;br /&gt;  As mentioned earlier that the Herstyler contains many good qualities.  Qualities that you won&#x27;t be able to find in any other plain flat iron. One, for example is this flat iron leaves your hair not 3x like any regular flat iron but it gives 6x more energy. Leaving your hair 6x more softer and shine while eliminating frizziness. With ceramic iron plates on both sides allows your hair to not just be perfect but have good results in no time. Unlike most flat irons the Herstyler is known to leave the best results in no time. Unlike most flat irons that take forever to heat up, it takes the Herstyler only 25 seconds or less to be ready to use. So you have extra good looking results in no time even if your one of those people that have thick hair, the Herstyler is able to straighten all kinds of hair. My hair is thick and would take me an hour to straighten my hair daily but with the Herstyler I am ready and about to go in 10 minuets!&lt;br /&gt;  Saving the best for last, but the Herstyler is durable and lasts for more than one year and if  you&#x27;re wondering if I was to use  it every day each year how much electricity will that be right? Well you won&#x27;t have to worry because the creators of the Herstyler created this flat iron it to use less electricity than other flat irons. Using a little electricity will be least of you&#x27;re problems that you will be so amazed that you will want to use it a lot to show it off to your friends, because the flat iron can be easily taken to places such as school or dances or when you feel like you might need it. It is made to be easy to use with no long wires, huge flat irons, or weighing a ton.&lt;br /&gt;  Yet I have run out of time to brag about how good this Herstyler works. In such short words I have explained and can&#x27;t stop saying how this flat iron is the best friend to every girl&#x27;s hair I mean it leaves it smooth and shiny, saves electricity, transportable, trendy, and quick to heat up.  If you&#x27;re thinking though, \\&quot;so many good qualities and sounds like a good flat iron, it must be expensive.\\&quot; There is a reason why the price was not mentioned earlier and it is because this flat iron is just $22! So the price was the least important to introducing this product to you!  Don&#x27;t think twice and before it goes off stock be one of the customers to get your hands on one. Don&#x27;t wait to be unsatisfied with the results you get now with the plain, untrendy, and useless flat iron and get the \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot; now to get good results soon. What are you waiting for go on Amazon and find the product so you can shine off that smooth hair that has been waiting to show</li>
            <li> I give this item 5 stars. I ordered this product for my daughters birthday. she absolutley loves it.My dayghter styles her haif with the iron in the morning stays all day. We have known people who have bought this product at the mall, i bought this for less than half of what they paid. Very, very saisfied. It arrive in less than three days. Am going to get one for my youngest daugter also.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Would highly recommend this one.  Don&#x27;t know how I lived without it!  I call it my magic wand!!!!</li>
            <li> This thing gets my hair so straight this is my third her styler and I paid over 300 for a chi that was a piece of junk compared to this lovely little straightener. I absolutely adore this thing.</li>
            <li> I bought an older version of this straightener a few years ago and my sister broke it. I was so happy to see this online at such a low price! It came super early. I love this straightener i wouldnt use anything else.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair.  My hair is really hard to straighten with any type of iron or blow dryer if I do it alone.  This iron is the only iron that has worked for my hair. Ive had it for over a year and I love it!!!! Worth it.  The only bad thing is that when you iron your hair and you wash it your hair ends up staying like burnt hair.  It leaves my hair super straight and I could make the cutest curls in my hair with this !! I would recommend !!</li>
            <li> I bought a herstyler at the mall with &amp;#34;lifetime warrenty&amp;#34; and once it broke i tried taking it back they said they couldn&#x27;t replace it i wasnt about to spend another 50+ on another straightener then i found this on on Amazon for TWENTY DOLLARS i loved it!! This straightener is A M A Z I N G</li>
            <li> There good they seem as if they can break easily!!! Hairstyler flat irons get very hot and there good for thick hair I would buy again!!! ;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product with idea in mind that it was new. Well, it&#x27;s not. The plates are very fragile, almost broken if you will, the plates are stained from previous use on someone&#x27;s else&#x27;s hair, but I will say it heats up quickly. Wish this product was new though.</li>
            <li> In reality, I don&#x27;t know if it was a good product.  It looked like it might have been a return and so I wasn&#x27;t going to take a chance.  I never used this one.  But I did purchase another reason be off of amazon and have been very happy with it.  The one I purchased is as good as the one I purchased for my daughter at a mall....which was expecting expensive.</li>
            <li> After having this product for awhile now, I can honestly say I would not buy from here again. I have bought several herstyler products from herstyler online the official site which can get pricey, but these are poor quality and do not work well. Nothing but a paper weight..</li>
            <li> Great product! Absolutely loved it!! And it was super cute also!</li>
            <li> I see negative reviews about this flat iron but I would like to say that buying this flat iron from Amazon is not the same as purchasing from the actual manufacturer; therefore, there is no way to confirm that this is actually a \\&quot;Herstyler\\&quot; flat iron.  This is very different than the Herstyler flat iron from the actual distributor.</li>
            <li> Hi to the seller ... i really like your product very much ... this is the second time to buy product from you .... it is really a good product i like it so much .fast shipping .. but i have a question to the seller when i purchased this product it was for 39.99 $ and the total with shipping was like 44.99 $ now i really want another one for my mom and i canot afford this price but really i want it badly ... so thier is any way to help be to get it with the price which i got with before .... you will really help me coz my mom is in a bad need to it ...and i canot afford it ... thanks for feeding me back ... this is my e-mail     laura.finearts@hotmail.com    i appreciate your help</li>
            <li> i love it.  works really well</li>
            <li> I have been using Herstyler irons for about 5 years. I use them to both curl my hair and flat iron my hair. They last a very long time compared to other flat irons.</li>
            <li> bought this a year ago at the mall and they tried selling it to me for $200! Got them to sell it to me for $100 but broke within 6 months... I do not recommend buying this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this specific product almost every day for years and it still works wonderfully! Adjustable knob to control heat settings, ceramic plates, and nice cord length.</li>
            <li> Very nice....love the swivel cord, the color, the pouch and the various heat settings.</li>
            <li> I loved my straightener, lasted me 2+ years before it broke.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from the mall for $99 so when I saw it online for about a third of that, it was an easy choice.  Both of the products are still working and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I love the way this Herstyler iron makes my hair feel! I purchased these flat irons as gifts because I already had one in purple since 2008. By the way, I paid way more for mine, but it was well worth it!! I could not believe that they were in great condition and had the things that were supposed come with them, especially for these prices. The Black Super Styler did not, but it is ok. It is still a great deal. They came very early too!! I will probably order me one of these just for the heck of it and as gifts for relatives!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is really good.It can get hot enough to tame the worst hair,it can also curl.I bought on at a mall for 100.00 at a mall,so this a great price,it also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair that takes forever to curl.  Yet it was more frustrating that the curls wouldn&#x27;t last past one or two hours even with hair product.  But with Herstyler, my beautiful curls last until I wash my hair.  Love it!!!  Product Update ~ 01/26/12  This seller (Cosmetic 4 Less) is very professional and customer oriented.  I&#x27;m very pleased with both product and service!  Would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these at the mall about 5 yeas ago i loved it it straightens and curls really good . It was super expensive there and it broke within the first 3 months but here i found it at a really good price that is worth it and i made sure to to register it for warranty just in case</li>
            <li> O totally love my new flat iron and highly recommended:) great cuality and the best thing you can chose the color</li>
            <li> So far it is working very good.</li>
            <li> Love it. It does not fry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  I had originally purchased one at my local mall for $100.00 but this one is way cheaper and it is the exact thing!  It leaves my hair so smooth and makes perfect curls too!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is phenomenal, I&#x27;ve been able to straighten and bring volume to my hair using this flat iron. A little bit of hair spray here and there, but it was definitely worth the purchase. Buy here not at the mall, same exact HerStyler that works miracles.</li>
            <li> Never burns hair and it great black women&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I received my herstyler within 2-3 days. It works great!! I&#x27;ve had no problems. It isn&#x27;t covered by the herstyler warranty but for that price, I could buy 6 more.</li>
            <li> I really love my new Herstyler. It arrived quickly. It does take a while getting used to it especially if you use it to make waves instead of straightening. I do wish it came with an instruction booklet though.</li>
            <li> I have a FHI straightener that i bought for roughly $250 and its lasted me 3 years and counting and is still incredible, when I ordered this I thought I would be getting pretty much the same quality but for much less; this was not the case. This straightener is really good, but definitely not the same quality as a high end straightener. If you&#x27;re looking for a good inexpensive straightener than this is fine but you&#x27;ll have to go over your hair a couple times and it leaves your a little frizzy until you&#x27;re completely done and then some how the frizz calms down and is pretty and straight. I dont at all believe it goes up to 460 degrees. At all. My other straightener goes to 450 and this one doesnt feel nearly as hot as my better one. Good for the price though, would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update--&lt;br /&gt;I had this product for 3 weeks and used it maybe four or five times and it just stopped out of the blue. It also NEVER got to 460 degrees which is just the biggest rip off. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.</li>
            <li> I bought one before at a kiosk loved the way the lady did my hair paid 300 for the 3 piece set it scrapped out on me so I found the same exact one on here. For less then thirty dollars I love it while it last I have an issue with the light on it that says if it&#x27;s on or off it went out on the one from the kiosk and on here but it&#x27;s a pretty good hair straightener other wise I have long thick curly/frizzy hair I recommend it though it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Bought this at the mall just yesterday. Got this the shampoo and conditioner for $99. NEVER did it occur to me to check on amazon. I love this straightener and would recommend it to anyone. The shampoo and conditioner make it even better. My hair is so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> They work stupendously!!!!! Ready to order another one just because!! Lol They get hot quick and they make your hair super straight with a shine!!! Loveeeew them!!!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It gets SUPER hot when set on hottest setting. I have really thick hair and it straightens it with one swoop.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive product! It does the job right!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener and everything that I have tried from the HerStyoer brand....shampoo, conditioner, hair mask, etc...I have just recently order the 3-in-1 curling wand....haven&#x27;t received it, yet....but, I should be getting it this week....I hope I love it just as much!</li>
            <li> I use it on my 11 year old daughter&#x27;s natural hair. Straitens like silk. Awesome product!&lt;br /&gt;Best with Herstyle Argan Oil for sheen and to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> i love this flatiron i have bought a new one 2 years in a row and it&#x27;s not cause they have stopped work just cuz i chang e the color of my bathroom ever year this year i will get a black one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 weeks now and it&#x27;s better then my cortex straightener. Definitely faster then my old one! I recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Do not get me wrong this is a good iron. My only two complaints are that when it heats up it smells like heated up plastic and when I first got the iron, it had a few marks which makes me believe it may have been tampered with or used which causes that plastic-y smell. Other than that it straightens my hair pretty good.</li>
            <li> my sister likes it, and its pink, her fav color. I havent tried it myself but she uses it all the time and has no complaints so.</li>
            <li> A must have, This is the best flat iron that I ever tried, I saw them at the mall but they where way to much money, this is the same one, great performance, and great price.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron....I was at a mall, and at one of those kiosk&#x27;s, they &amp;#34;sampled&amp;#34; this on my hair...I LOVED it..it made my fine limp hair silky smooth. Also gives LONG lasting curls....I use it with the serum. Works GREAT. The girl at the kiosk wanted me to pay $200, I thought that was too much. I looked it up here on Amazon and got it for $22.00.. It has a temp. control so you don&#x27;t need to turn it up very high. It get&#x27;s hot fast. I would HIGHLY recommend it. I had a chi, and this one is 100 times better. My hair just glides right through it..</li>
            <li> Love it better than chi..had it for 4 months and love it. My daughter uses it daily. ***** grear quality</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teenage daughter! Heats up in under a minute which really helps during the morning chaos, when there are three kids getting ready for school!</li>
            <li> love the adjustable temp LOVED THE PRICE and color and it works amazing!!!!! every girls must have for great hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron ever! It&#x27;s my 4th one and I love it! My first one, I paid almost 10X as much. It is a great value!</li>
            <li> when I received my flat iron it looked as if it had been sitting on a shelf forever, the inside was dusty and the plates on the iron were a loose. I usually use this size flat iron to curl my hair, and I must honestly say it serves its purpose!! My hair looked fantastic , the long swivling cord comes in handy. Just becareful with the temperature settings, you dont want to fry your hair off :D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely great&lt;br /&gt;Works as much as a $100 plus supply</li>
            <li> Great flat iron I bought one 6 years ago for 300.00 and it&#x27;s still working great.. so I got this one for my daughter. She loves it and so does her friends.  Why better than my chi...</li>
            <li> Bought for a trip to Europe. Worked great with adapter. I liked it so much I am using it now at home in the States!  Nice flat iron!</li>
            <li> Loved this straightener so much I purchased one more after I received my own for my daughter.</li>
            <li> This straightener can get very hot. I only turn up the heat about a 1/3 of the way up the dial and it still is hot enough to in one swipe straighten my hair. I was able to straighten all my hair very quickly and its nice that it comes in a fun color too!</li>
            <li> As a professional hair stylist I would recommend this to everyone....  I tell every single client that uses flat irons to buy this one!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love the color and my hair has never been more flat!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair, but I wanted to try curling my hair with a straightener. I didn&#x27;t want to invest too much in a straightener, since this technique might not work for me. But this ceramic hair straightener curls my hair BETTER than my curling iron! My curls are much bouncier and last much longer. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who also wants to try this curling technique.</li>
            <li> Love it. Bought one in mall first. Paid to uch but worked great. It broke, bought amortization on line. Love it. I have naturally curly hair. It is Awesome</li>
            <li> This flat iron is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve found.  It&#x27;s especially good for curling your hair! Yes curling with a straight iron. Google it!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and i saved a lot of money. We are all happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> The best one I ever had. And my hair looks nice for so long, and I live in FL. Great product. 👍</li>
            <li> I never realized there was such a difference in the quality of flat irons.  This heats high and quick.  Wish I would have had one like this 8 flat irons ago....</li>
            <li> Usually a $200 straightener, for only $20. I received the straightener the NEXT day after I ordered it! I was so happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this flatiron!!! I recommend it to everyone especially my natural sisters. ❤❤❤</li>
            <li> I love this product!! Bought a her styler straightener for my mom and I to try and we lived it!! So I bought this gift set and it is great !! The gift set comes with a glove for the wand and it is by far the best curling wand I used on my hair!!! Her styler makes your hair shiny, smooth, and soft!! :) everyone needs to have one of these!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend and she loves it</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery, and it straightens my hair awesome. BUT, there was a tiny chip in the ceramic plat when i got it.</li>
            <li> it had some wear downs on the plates but it wasn&#x27;t a bother. i works and heats up nice. i don&#x27;t need oils or any hair products because it already calms my hairs from being frizzy.</li>
            <li> Long time user of the her styler flat iron, I have thick, usually unmanageable hair but this is a good straightener. Leaves a great silky shiny and stays sleek most days. I live in wisconsin and the humidity some days are just stupid. Great price and same results as the over priced one I bought years ago. Although it did last me years.</li>
            <li> I have this item...paid full price in the mall and I love it so I bought this one for a friend and she loves it!!!</li>
            <li> Works great, I use mine all the time. I say this straightener is the best from other straightenrs I&#x27;ve bought and used👏.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hairstyle on  Oct 22 and by Dec 27th it quit working. My daughter loved this flat iron and was terribly disappointed when it quit working.</li>
            <li> My mom liked this product so much, she couldn&#x27;t share with my sister and had to get her own.</li>
            <li> I had this product before and I wanted a new one. originally purchased my first one for $100.00. Not only did this seller have great price but the product was delivered before the estimated time. VERY HAPPY!</li>
            <li> Biggest  Piece of crap.. It wouldn&#x27;t even straighten my wave hair and pulls out the hair. If you have super curl hair or thick hair it will not do the job.</li>
            <li> I figured I would chance purchasing this for 1/8 of the price they are charging at the mall! Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Be careful because it burned my countertop.</li>
            <li> I love Herstyler Products!! The price was great, it was shipped out promptly, the only thing is I ordered the pink and it came purple.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink and got Purple not happy about that but it works great</li>
            <li> I had to give this away because it was not working for my hair. Yes, it straightened my hair, but it would create a build up of static electricity that my Chi straightener does not create. The dial for temperature was also difficult to turn.</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve had so far.gives me a salon finish  look every time m.</li>
            <li> The best hands down cant wait to get them</li>
            <li> Had this same straightener but different color for 2 years now and still works perfect! Decided to get the same one again because the old one is dirty. I would recommend this straightener to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron.  It works great and is so light compared to my other one.  I will be getting another for back up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a little over a month and it works perfectly. Love the color and received the package pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Its a great Flat Iron.  It heats up quickly, glides across your hair no matter what the thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Straightens hair quickly.</li>
            <li> ALl we requested was the bag that was supposed to come with the hairstyler.  THis buyer did not care to fufill the request.</li>
            <li> I went on line over the holidays to purchase a new flat iron.I looked at several and choose the Herstyler in pink.  We got it and we love it.This was the easiest thing I have ever done. It was fast getting to us and all worked out fine.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener, I&#x27;m so happy I purchased it. I like the fact that I can curl or straighten my hair with it. The last one I had, I couldn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> I only had it a month before it quit working.  I will attempt to return it, but don&#x27;t have my ordering information anymore.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected at all it doesn&#x27;t get very hot and it does not straighten my hair. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Amazon in great.. It stopped working.. I will look for another..</li>
            <li> I have super long, super naturally straight, super thick hair. Almost nothing will curl it, and if it does, it never stays. This iron on full heat puts a curl that STAYS! Even after sleeping on it! Without hairspray! I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> It heats fast, I like how it has a heat control and it straightens my hair so good.</li>
            <li> This product was worth every penny spent.  It&#x27;s temperature control is by far the best feature of this product.  Works great for any hair styling need!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I have natural kinky curly hair that is near the middle of my back.  It normally takes hours to press then curl my hair and I hate the experience.  The Herstyler cuts that process in half and my hair stays silky straight for days! Plus the price was outstanding!  Nearly 75% off!  I would suggest using a protective serum while using this product. In the meantime order this iron!  You will be glad that you did!</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of money!!! Received mine yesterday and it would not even turn on!! Tried all the outlets in my house and still nothing. Save yourself time and aggravation. - Get the Chi! However, cs was nice and agreed to refund my order pronto. . Hopefully that will happen sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> I have very curly thick hair which can be difficult and time consuming to straighten. This has not damaged my hair,gets hot enough to flatten my hair without waves being left in-also great for curling with-get  this never had a problem with it and again I ordered this 3 years ago!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves it.  It works just the same as the one at the mall but the price was $100 less.</li>
            <li> I assumed I would also receive the protective pouch as seen in the photo but I did not.  I was disappointed since I don&#x27;t know where to get one separately.</li>
            <li> One of the better hair straighters for African hair.&lt;br /&gt;I almost got ripped off at a kiosk at the mall, they were trying to sell this to me for $200!!&lt;br /&gt;My smart bf found this on Amazon for me under $20. No, it&#x27;s not a fake. Buy this, you will be happy that you did.</li>
            <li> I really like Herstyler products. I bought my first one at a mall for $80. I still have it, but I dropped it on a hard floor and chipped the plates, the chipped plates would tug on my hair so it was time to get a new one. You can&#x27;t beat this price point! I&#x27;ve used this tool for two years and my hair is healthy and shiny...it has never been longer! Other tools would damage my hair and the ends would break off. I am buying more as Christmas gifts for friends. I love this in pink!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron but I ordered the PINK one and received the green one. i dont like green but i dont have the time to waste shipping it back to get pink. works great and love the results, just not thrilled i got the wrong color when this ad clearly says its for the pink one</li>
            <li> Exactly what you get in the mall for a quarter of the price!  This is my second purchase my first one lasted about 3 years.  I put it through a lot of wear and tear. I have long hair and pack it in a suitcase weekly.</li>
            <li> I love the iron but I ordered it hot pink and received a lime green one lol</li>
            <li> Ordered a pink one.....&lt;br /&gt;got a purple one. Not happy about that</li>
            <li> I use it as needed and it does the job! heats up fast and stays hot to strighten or curl hair.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Herstyler flat iron from one of those little booths at the mall. I paid $125.00 for it.  Admiittedly, I probably would have never paid that much and would have probably went home and checked online before spending so much  but I am a sucker for a cute guy. He did throw in some free shampoo though. :) It worked great for a few months, and then the cord shorted out. I was so upset to spend all that $$ and have to get a new one so soon. I went back to the booth at the mall and surprise, surprise they were closed down. I found this one for less that $30.00 same brand and all. No wonder they were out of business. All that said, it is a great iron. I have very curly hair and once I straighten it out with other irons it frizzes within a few hours. With this one I can run it through my hair a few times and it stays nice and straight all day. Love this iron.Love this price.</li>
            <li> This straightener is the same one as the vendor that is set up in the mall and the price is so much less.  I have had it about a week now and it works great.  It gets super hot and gets my hair straighter than the Chi.  I would highly recommend this straightener.  Even with the $5.95 shipping fee, it is still less than it would be in the mall.  I think the key is also to try and round brush your hair straight before you flat iron, which in my experience works the best.  It only takes me 5 minutes to flat iron my very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item and I love it. Only thing is that only 3 months after I purchased it the flat iron got a short in it. I contacted the seller and he told me to contact HerStyler. Well they wouldn&#x27;t exchange because Small Bill wasn&#x27;t an authorized seller so the company, nor Small Bill would exchanged this for me. I won&#x27;t be purchasing again from this seller</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great straightner! I have really thick hair so it straightens it fast and contains the poof for a while but doesn&#x27;t handle frizz like I had hopes.</li>
            <li> I had this same straighter before, but the first time I paid way more for it. I was so excited to find it at this price! Defiantly a great investment.</li>
            <li> Seller sent wrong color and i don&#x27;t think this is the authentic Herstyler</li>
            <li> Everything was great about it, I&#x27;ve used herstyler for years...except that it was the wring color...I specifically order a pink one and they sent me a green one. The the packing slip even said pink. It still works fine and I will continue to use it but its really stands out in my bathroom, which is entirely pink</li>
            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;  i have been planing on buying this straightener but i don&#x27;t know if this can make really good curls. i own a really old straightener which makes awsome curls. i want to upgrade.</li>
            <li> It works great but it kinda smells bad when using it</li>
            <li> Great straightener at a great price! Works amazing and didn&#x27;t even have to pay all that much , definitely a must buy!</li>
            <li> Perfect item!!! Thanks so much love it!! Shipped fast and trustworthy product!!! Will do business again!!! Straightens better than any tool I&#x27;ve use before very good price!!!</li>
            <li> I love the pink Herstyler.  It was debating whether to get this one or a pink CHI to replace the five-year old one that had finally given out on me.  I am so happy with my choice.  The one thing that I can say I don&#x27;t like is the width-- it is a bit wider than the flat-irons I am used to using, so it has taken time and practice to get used to this one.  As fas as performance, I do not have one single complaint.  It has a dial to select the heat temp you want and the on/off switch is in a good place so you do not turn it off by mistake while using it.  Of course I&#x27;m also very pleased with the PINK color (very true to the photo).  Adorbs! Get it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> I like this iron... It has great heat, but it says the iron is 1.5 in.... It seems like its only 1 inch at the most. The manufacturer is a little misleading there, but I love this iron. It does wonders for my extra tight curls (I have natural ethnic hair). People think I have a relaxer in my hair!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 12 year old daughter.  She loves it! Great product!  Heats quickly and she loved the color!</li>
            <li> Purchased this thinking it was just like my prior hair straightener. Worked great in the beginning but two months later it quit heating.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the results that I was hoping for I have seen these flat irons at various malls and even had the girl test them out on my hair and the results were great so I ordered the flat irons online. I&#x27;m not sure if they are exactly the same ones that are sold at the mall but they just didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought.  My daughter loves it. This was a great buy and I will definatey consider buying again.</li>
            <li> Love my herstyler. The only Straightener that works wonders on my hair leaving it smooth, soft and healthy looking</li>
            <li> I love my new flat iron! I have had it for more than a month, and it has been great! The temperature control is perfect, it heats quick, and it doesn&#x27;t burn my hair! I was a little skeptical at first, because I didn&#x27;t think this was going to be the right choice for me. I have always had a chi, but I am so happy with this purchase. This was a great price! The shipping time was fast. I am very happy with my purchase. I have high hopes for this flat iron to continue strong!</li>
            <li> This straightener works great at first, then after about a month it starts loosing heat. I have wavy,frizzy hair so I need a good product that is going to have even heat every time I use it. This may be good for fine, silky, straight hair. Definitely NOT for curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to do anything with my thick, wavy hair. Now I can! I am so happy with this purchase. It takes about half an hour to do my whole head, and that may seem long, but my hair is long, and really, really thick. And I actually end up with straight results. With my old iron, it would take me twice as long and the results would not be nearly as nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wonder is how this company - Herstyler - is related to PYT (Pretty Young Thing). A girl at the mall gave me a demonstration and I was impressed. By the time I got home I had forgotten the name, so I looked up the name of the website on the sample of hair gel she gave me, which was Herstyler. I wanted to buy it online because I didn&#x27;t want to and could not afford to spend $125. I was annoyed later to see the flat irons in the mall were not Herstyler like the gel she gave me but PYT. My Herstyler iron works great, but not in one stroke like the PYT one I got a demonstration with at the mall. Are these companies related? The irons look alike. Are the online ones just cheaper?</li>
            <li> Lanee was so excited the receive this this flat iron.  It works so well.  Heats up fast, smooth hair instantly, perfect size, gorgeous color, great product.</li>
            <li> Love this Straightener! At the mall got it for fifty dollars thinking that was cheap.. but it costs no doubt more than thirty with the way it works. Love it :)</li>
            <li> The straightener works great! Im highly satisfied, packaging was terrific and it heats up fine. I had bought one for myself and then purchased another one for my cousin. I highly recommend this product and seller! :)</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Great deal!</li>
            <li> I just got this flat iron less than a hour ago from the mail i was happy it got here fast and everything. S o when i opend it i had marks looking like it was used and was missing bag. But i got over as long as it works right! So when i turned it on it did heat up fast and i was happy so about a few mins into straightening my hair i felt a burn on my leg and when i looked i piece of the iron was burning me (i had it set to close to 400f) after that little by little the heat was going down and now its on warm i can leave my hand on it thats how low the heat is. So i dont wanna pay$12 to ship it back out even when its not my falt and i even got hurt using it. I also have a pic that i will upload and  my sister was recording this when it all happened.</li>
            <li> I ordered this straightener after running into some girls at the local mall selling them for $150. After i found this one i was so excited and thought it might be too good to be true. i recieved the product in its original box brand new. and only after two days after i ordered it. it is such a great straightener and ive never seen my hair straighter! great product.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and I&#x27;ve always wanted his straightener but they r so expensive at the mall so I&#x27;m glad I found this one. It works great and fast. No regrets so far</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  I ordered 4!  Great price and product.  Shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and creates curls on even my straight hair!  Took a little training on my part~ but once I got the hang of it~ wella! CURLS!</li>
            <li> It does the job and that&#x27;s about it. Broke in record time and was never my favorite when it was working.</li>
            <li> Gets hot quickly. Works great if you know how to use it!</li>
            <li> Rips my hair out.  Disappointing purchase. I&#x27;ll spend the extra money and get a quality iron next time.</li>
            <li> I really love herstyler straighteners but refuse to pay what they ask in the mall. The same ones on amazon for a fraction of the price. I typically get the zebra printed one but this time decided I wanted to try the pink 1 1/2in straightener instead. I do like that this one is a bit bigger, I like that it has a heat control which my previous herstyler straighteners did not. It does feel a little odd in my hand but I assume I will get used to it.</li>
            <li> Really good, I love it!!</li>
            <li> I stupidly purchased this at the mall at one of those temporary kiosks where you can&#x27;t return the item, for WAY too much money (about 3 times what you can buy it for here).  The lady demonstrated it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it worked really well, using the straightener to either straighten the hair or to curl it by pulling it through the hair at an angle.  We got it home and it does NOT work like the one she was using in the mall.  It will not straighten the hair completely, even though I have it turned up to the highest setting, and we can&#x27;t get it to curl like she did in the mall at all.  I am extremely disappointed in myself for allowing myself to be sucked in to a high pressure sales pitch.  I would return it if I could.  I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll never use it.  I already had a hair straightener that worked as good as this one that I purchased for $15 at the drug store. I just wasn&#x27;t happy with how that one didn&#x27;t straighten completely and thought I was getting a better one.  I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am use to spending a lot of money buying professional brands because I have a license.  I used this one at my sister&#x27;s home and liked it.  I bought it because it has specific temperature settings in degrees like the ones I am accustomed to.  This is my first time buying a non-professional brand for my personal use and I love it.  For the price, it can break down in a year and be okay but then it would be ther same as buying the higher price professional iron which would last a few years.  My hope is that it last just as long as the professional ones.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after using it 1-2 times a week!!!! This is my 3rd in 6 years and never had a problem prior!! Will have to find a better brand, as this is not eligible for a refund and/or exchange!!! Shame on amazon for allowing suppliers who provide poor products!!!</li>
            <li> READ TIL THE END! I got 2 of these her styler products and paid EXTRA! For the lifetime warranty. I got One for my wife and one for my sister. They worked good for the little bit of use it was put through, nothing to hard the most my wife used hers was 2x a week and that&#x27;s the top she had not touched it up to 3-4 months at a time it was rarely used. Same with my sister. My sisters herstyler cracked and won&#x27;t heat up any more! my wife&#x27;s just quit heating up. So I talked to the kiosk, and called the company directly. They told me they will not back the warrnity I purchased! And they told my wife we would have to pay $100 upgrade fee. If I did that it would be $200 to replace the products that I purchased lifetime warrnities with to avoid future headache and so the product would be covered! This company is CRAP! Why else would someone buy a warrnity other then have your product covered when it broke! I would strongly suggest if you want a straightnier or anything else for that matter DO NOT BUY from Herstyler. And when I talked to the company on the phone they bull$#^++% me and told me that there are only 3 people running a company that is producing hundreds of thousands of products. They also told me it is NOT a corporation, that it was a family owned business. The company does not stick to their word. And everyone involved is trained to Lie. I will never do business with or refer anyone to this company ever again like I have in the past. I&#x27;ve made this money 1000s of dollars and this is the way they repay their loyal customers! If you purchase one of these products be prepared to spend more money on repair or replacement even WITH a warrnity! I would refer you to the CHI AIR I got my wife one and she loved it and she said it does a way better job then the Herstyler ever thought to.</li>
            <li> returned it....box says 1.5 but it was 1 inch inside n plates were bout to fall out</li>
            <li> Recieved it and it doesn&#x27;t get hot I would like a refund</li>
            <li> I got to use this once before my daughter took it over but I was impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Started out good. But the texture on the straightner hurts your hands! and after having it for less then 6 months its stopped working!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned this exact straightener in purple it broke and I replaced it for about 60 bucks cheaper this time. Works just like the one I bought in the mall.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love this flat iron.  It works great, straightens on first try.  I do recommend using the Her Styler Serum for shiny look and heat protection.</li>
            <li> For the price it works really well! I would recommend</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do such a great job of straightening hair. I would not recommend it. I also purchased one for my daughter and the plug burned her outlet. Be careful of where electrical appliances are manufactured. Other countries are oftentimes not held to American safety standards.</li>
            <li> works well. had bought another at the mall. saved a lot on amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this product through Amazon for my girlfriend exactly 1 month ago and it stopped working last week. It won&#x27;t heat up at all anymore. I&#x27;ve sent both Amazon and the manufacture an email but haven&#x27;t heard back yet. Im extremely unsatisfied with thus.product and Amazons lack if accountability to fix or replace it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it im in love with it the color thou  &lt;3 it works perfectly fine it heats up pretty fast if you looking for something good this is what you need also  the shipment was fast i got i after 2 days i ordered it &amp; i didnt pay extra moneyy  !!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flat iron.  My granddaughter bought the exact same one for $100.00 and I got mine for under $25.00!!  It works awesome. Thank you for such an awesome price and product!</li>
            <li> I bought a Herstyler 1.5\\&quot; flat iron in the mall a few years ago.  One of my daughters liked it so much she took it so I finally decided to buy this because I don&#x27;t care so much for the 1\\&quot; flat iron I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited at how quickly it came.  Oh - I was charged for shipping even though I bought $125 worth of items and this said it was free Super Saver shipping if I bought over $50 worth of items.  I opened it up and it looked the same width as what I already have.  I measured and it is only barely 1\\&quot; wide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box states 1.5\\&quot; so I don&#x27;t know who made the error. I didn&#x27;t bother plugging it in or doing anything but taking pictures of it with a ruler in case I have any issues with the return that is going back tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping they would send me the actual item I had ordered, but the only option was to return for a refund. I&#x27;ll update this on how the refund/return process goes. This is my first AMAZON return, after many satisfactory purchases.</li>
            <li> I love my Her Styler flat iron and curling wand. So, I bought this product for my granddaughter who loved it.  However, it simply stopped working after 10 months.  Doesn&#x27;t seem like much of a lifespan.</li>
            <li> Ok so I was sceptical to buy this after seeing some bad reviews but i figured hey its only $25. It took what seemed forever to get shipped but when I got it I used it right away. I had already straightened my hair for the day so I wasnt planning to see amazing curls. well long story short It surprised me to see how easily it curled my hair. And the best part no frizz!!! I recommened this product real heavy duty and very pretty!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is great and it&#x27;s my new best friend. It heats up very quickly (within seconds) and it&#x27;s very easy to use. This doesn&#x27;t burn my hair and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks. It leaves my hair silky and smooth. Be aware that this flat iron gets really hot and be careful when using a hair serum since the resulting steam can burn your skin. Overall, this is a wonderful product and you can purchase this at a very low price here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought flat iron &amp; hair serum together after seeing products at the local shopping mall &amp; refusing to pay that much. I have virgin(13 yrs) african american hair,that I usually press &amp; flat iron. After using the HerStyler I have no need to press &amp; flat iron ever and its so shiny and bouncy. So amazing!! Where have u been all my life??</li>
            <li> This will be the best investment you will ever own, so dont feel uneasy about how good it is, or if its real..its all that, its real! Super fast shipping..Cracked open the box and plugged it right in. It heated up in no time, and I went to town on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Comes in a cute satin bag, thats cushioned inside with fleece, and the Herstyler genuine box. Heats up super fast, flattens hair in one to two strokes, leaves my hair soft with no frizz. I have wavy long frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: pulls my hair, but I dont care, I&#x27;m just more careful, and it does&#x27;nt matter because my hair looks fab. The only advice I have is to be careful with the heat setting. It gets very hot, and I dont think putting the dial up to the full heat is a good idea (450) It can work just as good on a low setting. Or else you will fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I love this tool, and its the best that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life. My hair has never ever looked so good. Its stick straight, shiny, and soft. I did my hair in no time..It usually takes 20 min to straighten my hair..Now it only takes about five minutes..And I dont look like my hair is dry, fried, and frizzy..I am so over looking like I tried to straighten my hair. Now my hair looks naturally straight. I&#x27;m totally in love..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I bragged to my friend about my find, and she told me she bought the Herstyler curling iron at the mall from those annoying sales people for 200.00. She was shocked at how much I only spent..which was free compared to her price. Telling all of my co- workers, classmates, and family..I&#x27;m even planning on buying some for my sister-inlaws..</li>
            <li> I bought my wife the first one back in 2009 and worked really well for a couple of years of daily use.  After it went south, I bought her another.  This one, however, worked properly for three months then began working intermittently. I contacted the seller in hopes they would just exchange for a new one, but was informed that they do not stand behind their products.  So much for being a valued repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This is a real HerStyler Iron. I love it!</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a/c hair and this flat iron straightened my hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and straightens hair without damaging it. Great price</li>
            <li> My wife loves it the delivery was quick and easy to get</li>
            <li> the flatiron was exactly what I wanted price was good and it works fine. but...the picture shows a storage bag that was not mentioned and as not included.  so why was it in the picture?  that is why it did not get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This straightener works great on my hair, I like that it has different temps and the pink color is fun too.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day, also does some nice curls too with the rounded edge..</li>
            <li> I love it.. I love it.. Highly recommended to every one that has really curly hair.. It work great.. this is the second one i get for my girls and I&#x27;m plannning on getting a third one.</li>
            <li> This was the best straighter ever. I would really recommend this to everyone. The bad thing is the plates broke and theirs a crack in it. I was very dissapointed and im really broke to even afford one for 25 dollars ;(</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron on the market! I recommend this product over all other flat irons!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It is the best that I have owned. The price was awesome but the product is even better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good flat iron, but the best part is that I really have plugged it in and used it both in Europe and in America and the wiring didn&#x27;t short out! This is a must have for any traveler!!!</li>
            <li> Fast and Great Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Ordered for my bestie and she loves it!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair straightener i have ever used. My hair takes high heat to straighten and this one does the job.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love herstyler flat irons!</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with the HerStyler and I have told ALL of my friend about them! I keep several on hand so I own about 3 of them...one for travel and a spare..... This iron makes my hair smooth as silk, my hair has body and it does not damage the hair, it actually repairs it! I have noticed if I had damage before using it, my hair will gradually become better with each use. It tames frizz , it&#x27;s just wonderful! I will always use the HerStyler..</li>
            <li> I have a purple one for myself but I bought this pink one for my sister and she loves it. i love how you can control the heat settings with the knob and that the cord swivels. and it curls your hair perfectly even though it is a flat iron. i do many styles with this awesome flat iron and you cant be the price!</li>
            <li> My 14 year old daughter researched straighteners online and selected this one.  The price looked good so I purchased it for her.  The product arrived in a timely manner and looked to be a quality piece.  Daughter absolutely loves this straightener and she says that it has cut 20 minutes off her hair straightening time.  Highly recommended by my daughter.</li>
            <li> I had this exact flat iron twice over...the first time i dropped it and broke the plates..i bought it a 2nd time and was too lazy to unplug it correctly so i pulled on the cord and short circuit the wires and it wouldn&#x27;t turn back on...both times i paid between $150-$200..so when i saw it on amazon for $18.50 I knew I had to have it. I received it in the mail today and i just finished using it...I LOVE IT!!! It&#x27;s exactly the same as the 2 that i previously bought just waaaaayyyyy cheaper..not only does it straighten but it curls your hair too...if your looking for a great flat iron then look no more...herstyler is the way to go..</li>
            <li> I bought my new flat iron super excited to use it, but as soon as I got it, plugged it in, waited for it to heat up, it NEVER did! The company expects me to pay an extra $12.00 for shipping and handling, but that&#x27;s crap! I will never ever buy again!</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been trying to find a straightener to tame my thick crazy hair. I was so satisfied with the herstyler my hair not only looks healthy but straight and feels amazing!</li>
            <li> love love love this flat iron. i got it in pink its super cute.price was great,works perfectly and shipped fast. im very satisfied</li>
            <li> I have owned similar hair tools that cost me over $200 and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one. This straightens hair without frying it and you can adjust the heat to the temp that suits you. It also creates nice wavy curls. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with it! Doesn&#x27;t even take me 20 minutes to get it straight plus no damage to my hair!</li>
            <li> I love my straightener. Just like the ones in the mall that cost you a lot more money.</li>
            <li> I love this. It heats up quickly and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I cannot write a lot about this because it is a simple product that performs its function. A good product is one you don&#x27;t have to think about much.</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler. It leaves my hair silky.&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, I bought the hot pink.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this flat iron to my friends!!!</li>
            <li> While this flat iron works just fine (I have one that is just like it), it does pull the hair a little and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;good\\&quot; as it does when I use my Chi.  It&#x27;s not bad for the price.  HOWEVER... the plates are ONLY 1\\&quot; - NOT 1.5\\&quot; as described.  I was specifically looking for a larger plate to flat iron quickly.  I ordered two of these irons. The box says 1.5\\&quot; but it is NOT.  So if you are looking for a standard one inch flat iron, this one is fine... worth the $25 (not any more than $35).  But beware that you are getting a 1\\&quot; iron!</li>
            <li> My straightner came sooner then i thought i was and was in a cute closed box came with all the papers i needed and it works great on my hair! it is by far the best straightner ive bought yet!</li>
            <li> works just great. and got here in great timing..thank you</li>
            <li> I was approached in the mall by someone selling these.  She curled my hair with the flat iron and I was amazed.  I have very straight, fine hair.  I almost bought one for $200.  Luckily, I always check amazon before making any purchase.  I left the booth and ordered the Herstyler for $24.  Yes!!!  I use it a couple times a week.  The curls stay until you wash them out!  It&#x27;s amazing.  I can&#x27;t speak much for the straightening part of it, since I don&#x27;t need that feature but if you want curls that last, this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace mine that broke.  Purchased my first Herstyler at the mall at a ridiculously high price and this works just as well.  Same product much better price!</li>
            <li> Got it yesterday and my hair is usually very frizzy and curly. It only took about 5 minutes to straighten all my hair and only went over it once! I bought one at the mall a few years ago and paid $150 for it, much better price! Thank u!</li>
            <li> Never  Been Happier with a purchase!  I paid $24.99 for a straightener that has a retail price of $200.  This is the best straightening product I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve been hearing wet2straights are the worst for your hair which is so incredibly true.  They&#x27;ve damaged my hair so badly in the past.  I have started using my new product, and I&#x27;m in LOVE!!! :D</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> I got it as a gift for my aunt! She loves it. It&#x27;s super light weight &amp; easy to work with! I did adjust the temperature because if you turn it up it will burn your hair I put it about 450ish!</li>
            <li> usually these are over 10 bucks</li>
            <li> I ordered this item because it was 1.5&amp;#34;  but it was only  1&amp;#34;.  Other than that it is OK.  Just disappointed that it is not what I ordered.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is really great. It straightens well n I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Herstyler! It straightens my wavy and somewhat frizzy hair like no other straightener I have tried. And the beauty of this flat iron is that it actually cleans your hair while it straightens!</li>
            <li> got delivered very fast! nothing was broken or missing! been using it since I got it!</li>
            <li> So I am a fan of Herstyler Products! My cousins both have a Herstyler straightener but I was not quite crazy enough to pay $100-200 just for a straightener! Theirs work great! I was in love! So I checked out Amazon to see if they sold any! I was happy when I saw they did! So I chose to order this one. One of my cousins have this exact straightener and she uses it to curl her hair ALL the time its wonderful! Mine straightens great, but I&#x27;ve had the product for over a month and I am very upset with the way it DOESN&#x27;T curl my hair the way I know this product can!! I don&#x27;t know why because from other reviews I can see it works fine...not to happy that its not making great curls...</li>
            <li> i bought this at the mall on \\&quot;special\\&quot; for $100 it is normally $200. I jumped on it because this thing really was magic, my hair has never been softer silkier or shinier ever. it really was magic on my hair, and for $20 + shipping, on here, you really can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> I thought I was getting a great product. But after a few uses, it stopped getting hot enough, and then it looses its heat as you straighten, so you have to keep turning it off and on just to keep it warm. It was suppose to be a replacement for the no name straightener I bought 7 years ago that striped but it still works better than this one. Every one said to buy Revlon, I guess that&#x27;s the next one I am getting.</li>
            <li> We got this for a friend that has one and it chipped so we got one same exact one and it came in it&#x27;s own case. She then gave me the chipped on and it still works. This was a lot cheaper that buying in directly from Herstlyer saved me over $50.00</li>
            <li> My daughter love it says it makes here hair feel smooth and silky and really straight without alot of effort</li>
            <li> I ordered this flat iron because i lost my same exact one at the airport, but the thing that got me was the price , wow , i bought the same exact flat iron from the mall , which these people are ripp offs, and they chaged me almost 100 everytime after taxes.Thank god i took the time to go to amazon.com and find me the same exact iron that i love for a cheaper price! WINNING!!! also shipping was a plus, i took the free 5-8 savings free shipping and my package came in less than 3 days! i highly suggest whoevers looking for a flat iron to buy one from here! mines was brand new!!! i love it!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this hair straightener. After sitting through a demonstration at the mall I asked the price and the salesgirl told me $200. By the time I walked away the price was 2 for $150! I own a Chi now and I really didn&#x27;t need another straightener but I had been seeing a lot of activity at this booth around the holidays and wanted to see what all the hype was about.I had planned all along to check for it on Amazon but I wanted to make sure I knew the exact product. I totally believe this Herstyler is the exact item I tried at the mall and paid only $28! I have recently purchased 2 more for upcoming gifts.</li>
            <li> Years ago I bought this flat iron at the mall for about $200.  Since then, I have replaced mine, bought one for my mom, and one for my daughter. It honestly is worth the $200, but if you can order it through Amazon for $24-it is a steal.  We all love it, why change if you are happy? I would buy it a gain in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Cute pink color with dial heat control, on/off switch, and 3-1/2&amp;#34; heating pads. Mine didn&#x27;t come with the instructions (comes sealed in a pretty box) but it&#x27;s simple to figure out.</li>
            <li> works great, looks great, and for a great price - thanks!</li>
            <li> Loved this product when I received it because it appeared to be in new condition and worked beautifully. Then one month later it just quit getting hot.  Am able to return it but have wasted shipping because &amp;#34;it wasn&#x27;t Amazon error&amp;#34;.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I love this styler if only I could learn how to work it to make the curls but other than that I love this styler.</li>
