            <li> Looks satin in the picture but it is actually plastic vinyl like a shower curtain, not at all what you expect from the picture</li>
            <li> For the stylish ladies</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it... sorry..</li>
            <li> cute cape and covers every penny</li>
            <li> My friend needed something to cover a dressing at the clavicle so she could shower without getting it wet.  With the velcro closure, this was perfect for arthritic hands!  Feels great to be able to wash hair in shower again!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> cheap material, returned</li>
            <li> Ok but I was expecting different material</li>
            <li> it gets the job done but is short on the shoulders</li>
            <li> Just as pictured. Only con is that it is stiffer than expected. Vivid colors add a lot to the cape.</li>

            <li> In love- wish I had gotten this sooner</li>
            <li> She is attending hair school and someone stole some of her supplies.  I loved the design and the price was great so I purchased this for her with the matching apron.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> I gave to granddaughter who just completed beauty school.</li>
            <li> My daughter in cosmetology school loves these capes.  I also got her the matching apron to wear when she works outside of school.  She wanted something different from her classmates and this fit the bill perfectly!</li>
