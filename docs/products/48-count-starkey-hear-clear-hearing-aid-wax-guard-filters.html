            <li>For a reasonable cost, I have peace of mind, knowing that I always have a good supply of them.  </li>
            <li>I strongly endorse this item for use with your Starkey Hearing Aids.  </li>
            <li>They work perfectly and appear to be the exact same item as the ones the doctor&#x27;s office dispenses.</li>
            <li>These wax guards work perfect for the sharkey hearing aids, and the price was half what we paid at the doctors.</li>
            <li>Device was fine.</li>
            <li>I did ask the question of fit on the Amazon website and received a number of answers that they were indeed a replacement.</li>
            <li>They didnot fit my aides as they said they would</li>
            <li>This pack is much more economical, since I sometimes change the guards twice a week.</li>
            <li>The person I bought my hearing aids from gives these to me for free, but I have to make an appt.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in quick order and was just what I needed and fit my hearing aids well.</li>
            <li>These will last a good while.</li>
            <li>This place has saved me a tremendous amount of money.</li>
            <li>My husband was thrilled that I could get these online for a reasonable price and with prompt delivery - so much better than relying on a trip to the hearing aid specialist to get the same thing at a much higher cost!  </li>
            <li>Super product, super good price, I won&#x27;t use any other product than Starkey&#x27;s hearing aid wax guards.</li>
            <li>I could get free wax guards from the company where I bought hearing aids, but it&#x27;s a hassle to keep going back for more.  </li>
            <li>These wax guards are the same size as the ones they provide and are equally effective.  </li>
            <li>Not much you can say I&#x27;m very pleased</li>
            <li>They arrived on time and were exactly what he needs and the price is right compared to the cost of what he was paying for a pack of 8.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li>But when it gets here it&#x27;ll be exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I will be back :)</li>
            <li>I was getting these free from my audiologist but only 8 sticks at a time, 2 containers of 4 each.</li>
            <li>Only one person answered no they wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>I purchased a smaller package previously, just to be sure they&#x27;d fit my hearing aids.</li>
            <li>These wax guards are ten times better than the old ones, which didn&#x27;t always pull the old wax guard out of the hearing aid</li>
            <li>When I do run low, I plan to order more in the same amount.</li>
            <li>The main reason that I purchased these was to save money.</li>
            <li>These wax guards are the same filters I have bought locally for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d have to use a straight pin to dig out the old one.</li>
            <li>And the price is MUCH BETTER than what I&#x27;ve had to pay for smaller packages of the same item at local hearing aid centers.</li>
            <li>With a slight twist these pull out the old wax guard easily, every time.</li>
            <li>The price is right &amp; last as long as other higher brand prices.</li>

            <li> I like the round canister because it&#x27;s compact enough to fit in my night stand drawer, while still being easier to find than a flat little box or plastic bag.</li>

            <li> Second round I have bought for my mom&#x27;s hearing aid.</li>
            <li> so decided to buy the 48 pack to save a little time.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.</li>
            <li> I use quite a few of these because of the wax in my ears.</li>
            <li> The wax filters do not fit my GNResound hearing aids.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I change the tips at least once a month.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the commute</li>
            <li> The shipping/service fee was way too expensive.</li>

            <li> Have yet to receive product.  But when it gets here it&#x27;ll be exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I could get free wax guards from the company where I bought hearing aids, but it&#x27;s a hassle to keep going back for more.  Once they said they were temporarily out of them and I was advised to call them in a week or so.  These wax guards are the same size as the ones they provide and are equally effective.  For a reasonable cost, I have peace of mind, knowing that I always have a good supply of them.  48 in one shipment will last quite a while!  When I do run low, I plan to order more in the same amount.</li>
            <li> Super product, super good price, I won&#x27;t use any other product than Starkey&#x27;s hearing aid wax guards. I will recommend them.</li>
            <li> Im happy I found this site for all my hearing needs. I only have one ear and I wear an aide in it. This place has saved me a tremendous amount of money. I will be back :)</li>
            <li> The main reason that I purchased these was to save money. The person I bought my hearing aids from gives these to me for free, but I have to make an appt. and drive to the office. It costs me my time, inconvience, and $10 every time I drive to the office.  They give wax guards to me in very limited supply. I use quite a few of these because of the wax in my ears. They are also made for my hearing aids.</li>
            <li> My husband was thrilled that I could get these online for a reasonable price and with prompt delivery - so much better than relying on a trip to the hearing aid specialist to get the same thing at a much higher cost!

I strongly endorse this item for use with your Starkey Hearing Aids.  They&#x27;re the perfect accompaniment to a wonderful hearing appliance.  Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I cannot beleive the change in my hearing aids.  I change the tips at least once a month. t&lt;br /&gt;The price is a good value also.</li>
            <li> Second round I have bought for my mom&#x27;s hearing aid. So happy to find them in bulk.</li>
            <li> These wax guards are the same filters I have bought locally for a lot more money. They work well and do the job for which they were designed.</li>

            <li> great value for $5.  I have purchased smaller packs of 8 or so for twice the price.  These will last a good while.</li>
