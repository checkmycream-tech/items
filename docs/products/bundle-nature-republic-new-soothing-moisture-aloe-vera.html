            <li>It was a very great deal!</li>
            <li>Packaging was not the best.</li>
            <li>Very good after pool or after sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be an ideal mask after a routine med-spa visit (e.g. chemical peel / micro-needle / dermapen / IPL skin brightening treatment).</li>
            <li>It is perfectly hydrating which is good for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not as excellent as i expecting it to be.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>stuff is great for any skin type.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing !</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this aloe gel!</li>
            <li>Same as I bought  from a beauty store, but cheaper, very happy  to find this deal.</li>
            <li>One of them had a cracked top out of the three.</li>
            <li>(paper mask will make more product absorb into the skin)&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I also have a combination skin, but my face looks more even toned.  </li>
            <li>Lovely ingredients smell very clean and light without fragrance&lt;</li>
            <li>and I think I am set for a good six years now haha</li>
            <li>Great product thank you and super fast shipping</li>
            <li>We need more accessibility to great Asian Cosmetic products here stateside!</li>
            <li>I still use my normal routine skin care products and my skin is hardly flawless, but I definitely see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly love using this newly found product.</li>
            <li>For itchy skin resulting from dry heat of central air/central hear this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money to get the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>The product is gel-like and non-sticky for everyday use-I love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right.</li>
            <li>Moistures and recovers very gently.</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast!</li>
            <li>Mine came in a day early !!!!</li>
            <li>I generally buy amazon prime and try to avoid buying from out of the country, but this particular vendor had better pricing (even with the shipping cost) and I didn&#x27;t need it in a hurry this time.  </li>
            <li>At first I tried a single jar and then I fell in love</li>
            <li>Moisturizes amazingly, fast absorbing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this with a paper mask and noticed that my face was very soft and felt refreshed and calm</li>
            <li>so I bought a whole pack.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Because it is watery, it is thin and therefore, one good sized drop (about the size of a 10 won coin or a...nickel..</li>
            <li>new start  </li>
            <li>Been using almost daily, very soothing and not sticky at all!</li>
            <li>When you first open the container, you can smell the freshness of the product!!</li>
            <li>By far the cheapest way to buy these if you don&#x27;t live near a nature repulic store !</li>
            <li>My skin is VERY oily and prone to chin blemishes and generally will break out if I&#x27;m not extremely diligent.  </li>
            <li>but it does go away and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and definitely will recommend Nature Republic to my friends and co-workers!</li>
            <li>I also use it during the summer after a day at the beach to help cool down my skin.</li>
            <li>Since then, my skin appears to be less dry and retains moisture better.  </li>
            <li>far as buying it online, I&#x27;ve compared prices between different vendors.  </li>
            <li>The Aloe mask are ok, but one of the boxes was already broken ........</li>
            <li>Works very well as advertised, slightly pricey.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean (like aloe, duh) and a very little bit goes a long way.  </li>

            <li> At first I tried a single jar and then I fell in love so I bought a whole pack. It came pretty fast! And nothing was damaged! Definitely worth the money to get the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> It is from  Nature Republic  USA new start  business  , there&#x27;s  a note state  . Same as I bought  from a beauty store, but cheaper, very happy  to find this deal. I use it when I do massage .</li>
            <li> Works very well as advertised, slightly pricey.</li>
            <li> For itchy skin resulting from dry heat of central air/central hear this is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> It was a very great deal! AND it helped my dry skin so well! Love it! But I don&#x27;t think I can finish all three of them in one year... I will keep using it to see the effect that it creates.</li>
            <li> Great product thank you and super fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right. One of them had a cracked top out of the three. Packaging was not the best. Though it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this with a paper mask and noticed that my face was very soft and felt refreshed and calm afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I like about this:&lt;br /&gt;* Dries matte without any sticky or oily residue&lt;br /&gt;* Plumps face/lips if you leave it on as a mask for 15 minutes or overnight (paper mask will make more product absorb into the skin)&lt;br /&gt;* Paraben-free&lt;br /&gt;* Lovely ingredients smell very clean and light without fragrance&lt;br /&gt;* Doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers mentioned that their skin was less oily from using this, yet I&#x27;ve not noticed any difference.  My skin is VERY oily and prone to chin blemishes and generally will break out if I&#x27;m not extremely diligent.  That said this did not cause any breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be an ideal mask after a routine med-spa visit (e.g. chemical peel / micro-needle / dermapen / IPL skin brightening treatment).</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product a lot.  He use this for face and body.&lt;br /&gt;You may not need any other cream if you have this.</li>
            <li> I like it, is good for the summer and my skin.......I use this for long time and every day.  I really like it</li>
            <li> Very good after pool or after sun. Moistures and recovers very gently.</li>
            <li> As always, I love this stuff. I have been using one container for almost two years (it that gives you a hint of how long it lasts,) and it still is not empty. I ordered this three-piece set and I think I am set for a good six years now haha&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is great for any skin type. It is watery and therefore not oily. It is perfectly hydrating which is good for all skin types. It smells fresh and clean (like aloe, duh) and a very little bit goes a long way.  Because it is watery, it is thin and therefore, one good sized drop (about the size of a 10 won coin or a...nickel..quarter?) goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes amazingly, fast absorbing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing ! By far the cheapest way to buy these if you don&#x27;t live near a nature repulic store ! Mine came in a day early !!!! All of the jars were unharmed !</li>
            <li> I waited coupon weeks to get the package. The mask that selleer gave as a gift was dried already. The Aloe mask are ok, but one of the boxes was already broken ........what a tragedy.</li>
            <li> Truly love using this newly found product. My sister initially found it at a local event and I&#x27;ve been using it daily since then.  When I ran out, I was disappointed that the local stores didn&#x27;t carry it, but then I saw it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I (as well as my husband) use this product morning and evening, immediately after wash/shower.  Since then, my skin appears to be less dry and retains moisture better.  Even my facial gal stopped nagging me on my skin being dehydrated.  I also have a combination skin, but my face looks more even toned.  I still use my normal routine skin care products and my skin is hardly flawless, but I definitely see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as buying it online, I&#x27;ve compared prices between different vendors.  I generally buy amazon prime and try to avoid buying from out of the country, but this particular vendor had better pricing (even with the shipping cost) and I didn&#x27;t need it in a hurry this time.  I recently ordered 3 sets (9 total).  Although the estimated delivery was approx. 3-7 weeks, I actually received the products within 1 week.  All I want to say is &amp;#34;Thank you, Thank you!&amp;#34;  I plan to keep a couple and pass out the rest to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> I love this aloe gel! I use it whenever I need a lot of moisture for my skin, i.e. after a mud mask or anything that strips my skin of oils. I also use it during the summer after a day at the beach to help cool down my skin. It does leave a sticky feeling for a few minutes after application but it does go away and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Been using almost daily, very soothing and not sticky at all!</li>
            <li> good product and service</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not as excellent as i expecting it to be.</li>
            <li> Received product as described. When you first open the container, you can smell the freshness of the product!! The product is gel-like and non-sticky for everyday use-I love it!! Fast shipping and definitely will recommend Nature Republic to my friends and co-workers! We need more accessibility to great Asian Cosmetic products here stateside!</li>
