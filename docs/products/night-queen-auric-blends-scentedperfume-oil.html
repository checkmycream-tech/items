            <li>Very, Very Happy with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>awesome product, ordered it three times already.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a 5 because the price, and the amount of time received was awesome.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>My partner says it smells really good,</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this perfume before, and I&#x27;ve always liked the fragrance, plus I get compliments on it</li>
            <li>For those who like a rose scent, this is perfect, and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite sweet and floral, so if you like that sort of thing this would be a good choice.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this stuff....</li>
            <li>I love the smell of Night Queen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s your favorite smell of night queen perfume oil.  </li>
            <li>Hope to get more of them</li>
            <li>My favorite .</li>
            <li>I come across many people who ask me what I&#x27;m wearing and they love the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>My favorite scent from Auric Blends.  </li>
            <li>People notice it when I am close, but it is not at all overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not what I was hoping for, which was more of a musk smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell was not overpowering, so I still enjoyed, and used.</li>
            <li>and you get an amazing smelling, totally unique perfume oil that lasts all day??</li>
            <li>This is a lovely scent and was shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>This one smells very sweet, like flowers and a sweet ball of cotton candy, while you&#x27;re being hugged by a maternal figure (if that had a scent!)</li>
            <li>This perfume blend is exotic and sexy, but definitely a bit more powerful/heady than I (a light or non-perfume wearer most days) am used to.  </li>
            <li>When I first put it on I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>It is very feminine without be sweet or very strong.</li>
            <li>True night queen perfume oil.  </li>
            <li>I love wearing it on date nights, but I recommend starting out light and adding a bit more as needed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, feminine and unique.</li>
            <li>Thank you for shipping so quickly.</li>
            <li>the bottles got a bit smaller but the same wonderful smell!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite scent, but still amazing and long lasting!</li>
            <li>There is a surprising amount of applications in that little bottle and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts for a long time, and, since it&#x27;s an oil, the fragrance changes a bit during the day, becoming a more mature version of itself.</li>
            <li>It is an oil- rolls on pretty generously.</li>
            <li>When I first smelled Night Queen</li>
            <li>and I love to wear it daily.</li>
            <li>but after a few minutes I loved how I smelled.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day, much longer than an alcohol based perfume.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for your prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Will have to try other scents from this company, and see if I find the scent I love.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it as long as it is available.  </li>
            <li>For the past year my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; has been Egyptian Goddess, another popular scent from this company.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very drawn to it, however I wore it for the first time today and it started to smell a lot different, and really grew on me!</li>
            <li>This particular fragrance is a bit too \\&quot;rosy\\&quot; for me.</li>
            <li>The Auric Blends brand is made from high quality oils, and don&#x27;t change their scent as you wear them or fade.</li>
            <li>It is high quality perfume oil at a price you can experiment with until you find what you like.</li>
            <li>New signature scent for a while.</li>
            <li>Night queen is clear.</li>
            <li>I ordered Night Queen fragrance and received something marked Night Queen</li>
            <li>Even though perfume is a very personal item, and you can&#x27;t tell what a scent is like without smelling it, I would recommend the Auric Blends line as well as Night Queen in particular.</li>
            <li>For me it is easy to carry in a purse or even a pocket and a little goes a long way.</li>

            <li> I have used it for years and am sorely disappointed.</li>

            <li> Oh yes. Love it. New signature scent for a while. This along with Egyptian Goddess.</li>
            <li> I ordered Night Queen fragrance and received something marked Night Queen but it is not.  I have used it for years and am sorely disappointed.</li>
            <li> I get compliments from friends and strangers every time I wear this perfume.  It&#x27;s fresh, feminine and unique. It can be very subtle, depending on how much is applied. The scent lasts all day, much longer than an alcohol based perfume. There is a surprising amount of applications in that little bottle and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> True night queen perfume oil.  Scent lasts all day! This is a lovely scent and was shipped quickly! thanks</li>
            <li> I had been searching for Night Queeen for years after finding it in a gift shop once. It is an oil- rolls on pretty generously. A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Auric Blends for years now. This particular scent has been in my rotation with a Victoria&#x27;s Secret scent for the past fifteen years. For me it is easy to carry in a purse or even a pocket and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have to say this is my second Auric Blends scent purchase and I am now addicted. For only $7 and you get an amazing smelling, totally unique perfume oil that lasts all day?? Where can you go wrong?! This one smells very sweet, like flowers and a sweet ball of cotton candy, while you&#x27;re being hugged by a maternal figure (if that had a scent!) Not my favorite scent, but still amazing and long lasting! Xxx</li>
            <li> awesome product, ordered it three times already.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve not been disappointed with Auric Blends! For the past year my &amp;#34;signature scent&amp;#34; has been Egyptian Goddess, another popular scent from this company. After reading a few reviews, I decided to order Night Queen along with my refill of Egyptian Goddess. When I first smelled Night Queen I wasn&#x27;t very drawn to it, however I wore it for the first time today and it started to smell a lot different, and really grew on me! My partner says it smells really good, lol. I&#x27;ll definitely be switching between Egyptian Goddess and Night Queen now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this perfume before, and I&#x27;ve always liked the fragrance, plus I get compliments on it....I will continue to use it as long as it is available.  Thanks so much for your prompt delivery.  Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> love this stuff....the bottles got a bit smaller but the same wonderful smell!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Night Queen. It&#x27;s not too overpowering. When I first put it on I wasn&#x27;t sure but after a few minutes I loved how I smelled. Got lots of compliments. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s your favorite smell of night queen perfume oil.  Hope to get more of them&lt;br /&gt;Thank you. Diana</li>
            <li> Smells bad. This is not night queen. Night queen is clear. Some people make it yellow and it will still smell like jasmine. Not this one. Never again.</li>
            <li> My favorite . I come across many people who ask me what I&#x27;m wearing and they love the fragrance.  I hope you never run out of it .</li>
            <li> This perfume blend is exotic and sexy, but definitely a bit more powerful/heady than I (a light or non-perfume wearer most days) am used to.  I love wearing it on date nights, but I recommend starting out light and adding a bit more as needed. My husband really likes the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.  It is very feminine without be sweet or very strong. It is a floral scent.

            <li> I gave this product a 5 because the price, and the amount of time received was awesome. The smell is not what I was hoping for, which was more of a musk smell.  For those who like a rose scent, this is perfect, and I highly recommend! It had the same name as a different one I had, so I thought they were the same, my fault. The smell was not overpowering, so I still enjoyed, and used. Will have to try other scents from this company, and see if I find the scent I love.</li>
