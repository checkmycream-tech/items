            <li>Always appreciate great customer service!  </li>
            <li>Great buy on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>Got the shade I wanted plus at a great price.</li>
            <li>Although it provides great coverage</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand why this foundation was so great.</li>
            <li>- this matches great.</li>
            <li>good price, good item, good deal!</li>
            <li>So glad I found this  &amp;#34; by gone&amp;#34; Revlon amazing foundation!!</li>
            <li>I received it in perfect form and quickly!  </li>
            <li>love the m.u.  great service and price.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation!</li>
            <li>hope they&#x27;ll put some info about the products like indicate who can wear this kind of foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this because I can adjust the color</li>
            <li>i love this product and hope to use it for many years to come.</li>
            <li>and I love that it doesn&#x27;t wear off of feel oily.</li>
            <li>The most better in this foundation are the possibilities that can get and the variations of the graduation colors.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the choices I get with just one product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Would like to have more of the product in the container though.</li>
            <li>It great for my skin, but only on the darkest level.</li>
            <li>It could be because I am not an makeup expert (definitely true), but as an average consumer, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed.</li>
            <li>I love this foundation, it is very light and smooth and doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Wonderful service as usual.</li>
            <li>I like the concept behind this foundation--you are able to mix and match to blend the colors together to create a foundation perfect for your complexion.  </li>
            <li>So I wish I know where I could get a full bottle of the the section I use.</li>
            <li>So, if your skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive, then buy it, because the coverage is good, it runs through really well</li>
            <li>Definitely the way to get this product...which I love!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why they are not continuing with the product other than maybe they would make more money making people buy more than one color.</li>
            <li>This one can be adjusted to get just the right color</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The hot pink Skin79 BB cream is much better and the moisturizing properties in this supposed gold bottle did nothing.</li>
            <li>This product is very usable, good for any ocasion, and the consistence is a little thin, but the coverage is good.</li>
            <li>and it has SPF, which saves time when you are getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li>I did find it useful to be able to blend different shades for different parts of my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Really worked well for me, shame its discontinued</li>
            <li>It was a good consistency - not to thick</li>
            <li>and I felt like I would never run out due to the fact that there were so many areas to pump from.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended....</li>
            <li>To me, it seemed that all of the foundation colors were pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>When I could no longer find it in the stores, but online, I order a number of them so that I can have it for a few more years.  </li>
            <li>The idea behind this foundation is REALLY good, because there&#x27;s no way you won&#x27;t match somehow...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and this foundation made my face break out...</li>
            <li>I bought this foundation as my first one, because I wanted to buy one that would actually match my skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased the light and it is very dark and orange colored.  </li>
            <li>i have used this for a long time and the stores no longer handle it,so i have found that ordering it a very convient</li>
            <li>I love this foundation because I can use it year round and not have to worry about color changes due to tanning.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It seems everytime I find a foundation that works I cant find it anymore. I love this because I can adjust the color</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation as my first one, because I wanted to buy one that would actually match my skin. The idea behind this foundation is REALLY good, because there&#x27;s no way you won&#x27;t match somehow... you just need to have the basic idea of the tone of your skin. I just had one problem with it... I have very sensitive skin and this foundation made my face break out...So I didn&#x27;t use it a lot of times, and now I switched it for another one. So, if your skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive, then buy it, because the coverage is good, it runs through really well and it has SPF, which saves time when you are getting ready to go out.</li>
            <li> at this price not even my husband can complain about the product. i love this product and hope to use it for many years to come. good price, good item, good deal! i use the subscribe and save with this to ensure i have it on hand!</li>
            <li> Great buy on Amazon.com. Got the shade I wanted plus at a great price. Wonderful service as usual. Highly Recommended....wonderful product. So glad I found this  &amp;#34; by gone&amp;#34; Revlon amazing foundation!!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation, it is very light and smooth and doesn&#x27;t bother my very sensitive skin! I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore which is a bummer but at least I can buy it from amazon. It arrived on time and in tact. I would buy this make up again and I would order from this seller.</li>
            <li> I purchased the light and it is very dark and orange colored.  Dissapointed in this product.  Will not reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a foundation with the right color and one that doesn&#x27;t get oily by the end of the day. This one can be adjusted to get just the right color and I love that it doesn&#x27;t wear off of feel oily. Sad that it&#x27;s has been discontinued.</li>

            <li> Not really satisfied with the foundation. It turns pink on my face :( hope they&#x27;ll put some info about the products like indicate who can wear this kind of foundation. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I can adjust the color according to the color of my skin is at the time. Especially in the summer when my skin becomes darker.</li>
            <li> The hot pink Skin79 BB cream is much better and the moisturizing properties in this supposed gold bottle did nothing. The bb cream dries to look too ashy. Not a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> i have used this for a long time and the stores no longer handle it,so i have found that ordering it a very convient</li>
            <li> I love the choices I get with just one product.I would tell my friends if they asked.I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation! It&#x27;s too bad the stores don&#x27;t carry it anymore.</li>

            <li> Generally, I usually have similar experiences with a product as other reviewers do but in this case, I have an entirely different opinion. I didn&#x27;t understand why this foundation was so great. To me, it seemed that all of the foundation colors were pretty much the same. I could wear the lightest one or I could wear the darkest one and no one besides me would even know the difference. It could be because I am not an makeup expert (definitely true), but as an average consumer, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed. But, overall, I am giving this product three stars, because I still felt like the foundation worked well for me. It was a good consistency - not to thick and I felt like I would never run out due to the fact that there were so many areas to pump from. But, next time I want to buy foundation, I think I will try something else, unless this is on sale!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It was hard to find a foundation to match my skin tone  - this matches great. Would like to have more of the product in the container though.</li>
            <li> Really worked well for me, shame its discontinued</li>
            <li> I love this foundation because I can use it year round and not have to worry about color changes due to tanning. I just turn the knob to adjust the color. When I could no longer find it in the stores, but online, I order a number of them so that I can have it for a few more years.  Don&#x27;t know why they are not continuing with the product other than maybe they would make more money making people buy more than one color.</li>
