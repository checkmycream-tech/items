            <li>/&gt;The bottle design and the packaging is very high-end and attractive in the style set.</li>
            <li>I received a Free sample for an evaluation; the research is from the internet, my testing results, statements, and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>Be sure to add a moisturizer after.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t tell for sure just yet, but I feel like my skin tone and skin texture have improved a bit ever since I started using this serum, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>: I received a bottle free of charge in exchange for an honest review of how this worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The consistency is very unique.</li>
            <li>* Using this on clean skin after I use a facial sponge is the best way to get the most benefit&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a scent to this serum, but it is light and feminine and I actually love the girly scent of this.</li>

            <li>The next thing that I noticed is that it completely absorbed into my face but it kept it feeling wonderful all day.  </li>
            <li>* Easy application with dropper that is provided&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I wish that I could have waited the full 90 days for more visible results, before posting this review.  </li>
            <li>I am over 40 and notice this helps plump up my face, get rid of dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been struggling with fine lines and sun damage.</li>
            <li>The product has a mild flower smell and it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get a good layer of coverage.</li>
            <li>It supplies three times as much moisture as Hyaluronic acid, continuously hydrating skin and effectively smoothing fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you start to smooth the serum into your skin it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately but it does absorb without sitting on the surface of your skin.  </li>

            <li>renewed.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>/&gt;For $20 and free shipping at the time of this review</li>
            <li>Having Snail extract kind of scared me a bit and honestly seems gross, but I still wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the product itself, it came packaged nicely in a glass bottle with a dropper top.</li>
            <li>The process is harmless and the snails live a happy life, safe from their natural predators.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the smell, it really smells good.  </li>
            <li>These lab snails live under optimum care so that they will continue to provide their beneficial substance, useful for our skin-care health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even those laugh lines around my mouth have softened!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the glow and the less noticeable fine lines all in just the first 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It takes a small drop to achieve the greatest effects of this product.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, the serum feels just a tiny bit slimy, but it&#x27;s not a nasty kind of slimy</li>
            <li>Most Vitamin C serums I have used so far was more runny than this one.</li>
            <li>Skin felt nicer, looked clean and refreshed.</li>

            <li>Most Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used so far was more runny than this one.</li>
            <li>It makes all the difference in the world in serums because my 56 year old, reformed sun worshiper, skin is feeling fantastic!!</li>
            <li>I did notice some reduction in the look of fine lines around my brow, eyes and laugh lines, they were not as prevalent&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no idea how I get targeted to try out so many &#x27;women of a certain age&#x27; products, but I keep trying them out, and this one is a gem.  </li>
            <li>The magic really happens over-night.</li>
            <li>love the idea that cell turn over is quicker thanks in part to the snail extract.</li>
            <li>: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>* Pores seem to be minimized with this in combo with a good cleaning prior to use&lt;br /</li>
            <li>This Snail extract is a super ingredient which accelerates cell turnover, preventing and repairing wrinkles while improving the elasticity of the skin.</li>
            <li>Scientists collect the mucin from lab-bred snails and process it into a powdery substance, and this ingredient has tremendous benefits when added to skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had never heard of using snail extract for skin care, but it has great benefits such as preventing and repairing wrinkles while improving the elasticity of the skin, as well as providing three times as much moisture as Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>* Comes in a cobalt blue container to block out light from the product, looks nice</li>
            <li>, it is a good buy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added Acetyl Hexapeptide -3 to one of my new favorite ingredients.</li>
            <li>Once it is absorbed you can&#x27;t even tell that you have applied it because your skin just feels incredibly smooth, even after the first application.</li>
            <li>Most of us are now aware of the latest skin-care trend, facial vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>serum itself is 100% clear, with a very light fresh scent which goes away seconds after I apply it.</li>
            <li>This works great as everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I follow with a moisturizing cream and this keeps my skin very moist and smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I follow up with a moisturizer cream and this keeps my skin very moist and smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Nice enough serum..</li>
            <li>serum came in a beautiful dark blue bottle with a convenient dropper applicator top.</li>
            <li>This serum feels nice to the skin, definitely moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil film on the surface like a lot of serums do.</li>
            <li>dries.&lt;br /&gt;The blue eye-dropper bottle even looks nice on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I have tried several Vitamin C serums over the years and either they were too oily or they did not smell nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E; all which are main ingredients in this serum.</li>
            <li>and I can tell the difference in small wrinkles- pleasant smell and goes into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared to other serums especially the department store brands, so I&#x27;m impressed all the way around.</li>
            <li>I apply it in the morning, after cleansing my skin with a konjac sponge for better absorption, the konjac sponge clean away anything that may block your pores and makes your face ready for you facial serums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vitamin B5 hydrates skin by penetrating into the lower skin layers and is absorbed into skin cells, keeping moisture below the surface and on the surface, which provides the skin with a soft and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>The study concluded that dryness and roughness resolved in all patients after 90 days, along with a significant reduction in fine lines, deep wrinkles, and an increase in elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Even after the first use, I could tell my skin felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First tried it alone and then with makeup.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I use this product before bed and first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>Next to the Alina Vitamin C Serum + Moisturizer, this is one of my two favorite serums ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The serum gets absorbed fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>Skin doesn&#x27;t feel as fragile and seems to have more elasticity and suppleness after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li>Very smoothly, it glides across your skin and it&#x27;s light, not sticky or heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>As an anti-inflammatory, it is effective in relieving the itchiness and discomfort of eczema and a number of skin conditions including superficial cuts and acne due to the properties that control the spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li>In conclusion, for anyone who is serious about his or her skin health and appearance, Perfjohn Vitamin C serum is a great addition to add to any skin care routine.</li>
            <li>The extract has a positive effect on acne scarring, acne prevention, dryness and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>The extract has a positive effect on acne scarring, acne prevention, dryness and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>It comes in a cobalt blue glass container with a dropper that makes it easy to use and dispense.  </li>
            <li>Also, there is little to no aroma, which is nice when you don&#x27;t want clashing fragrances.</li>
            <li>so you can just put it straight on your finger tips and apply it anywhere you want without dripping it.  </li>
            <li>I spend so much money on items just hoping they work.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Yes, really.</li>
            <li>Left me with a nice light glow and after a few days I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>It really does work wonders and has made my skin feel refreshed and</li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes this serum really stand out from the crowd, is the fact that it&#x27;s made with snail extract.</li>
            <li>and I actually really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, daily application of topical products containing snail secretion significantly reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, daily application of topical products containing snail secretion significantly reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs fast and does not leave my skin feeling sticky as many other vitamin c serum can.</li>
            <li>Just a drop or two is necessary, it spreads easily like silk and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I will be continuing the use of this product well into my older age.  </li>
            <li>- I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It feels very moisturizing and does not cause any redness, even when applied to the sensitive under-eye areas.</li>
            <li>It feels very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness, even when applied on the sensitive under-eye areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important to understand that these snails are NOT hurt in this process; beauty manufacturers do not harm the snail during the extraction process: they simply collect the mucin left from live snails.</li>
            <li>On my freshly washed face I added a few drops and spread the serum in a circular motion until it&#x27;s completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and allergies</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>It goes on light, and I do have to be careful not to use more than a few drops because this serum really goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li>This serum comes in a very decorative dark blue bottle and has a dropper for easy dispersing.  </li>
            <li>Different vitamin c serums have added a variety of components, vitamin E, Ferulic acid, hyaluronic acid, and/or a multitude of diverse herbal and plant extracts, to meet the needs of various skin care requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfjohn has added a different natural product from most of the others; they have included snail extract in their vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>Normally I steer away from the department store beauty products because of their heavy scents, and this product does have a light scent, but it goes away almost immediately so it didn&#x27;t affect my sinuses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vitamin C penetrates through the surface to nourish lower skin cells, which results in healthier skin as the new skin cells reach the surface; this ensures a younger and vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li>If you want to find a product with anti-aging and anti-wrinkle properties that is made out of great ingredients, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, isn&#x27;t sticky and wasn&#x27;t testes on animals, I definitely think this one is worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With summer fast approaching, I need all the Vitamin C I can get..</li>
            <li>It has a soft lightweight texture that feels silky to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After cleansing and my toner application, I gently massage the vitamin c snail extract into my facial and neck skin.</li>
            <li>I only need 5-6 drops to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a mom of two and even though I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product causing my face to breakout or leaving it oily.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple weeks of use (and I&#x27;m 48 years old, and have lost 50+ pounds), I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe some reduction in scent, as these days there are a lot of people who can be sensitive with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x60;ve read most of the reviews and took a chance, I have a very sensitive skin &amp; pro breakout &amp; have a lot of dark spots due to acne scars.</li>
            <li>and it really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It has a slightly thicker consistency than most other Vitamin C serums, and either two or three drops provides enough coverage for both face and neck.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Snail secretion filtrate contains natural acids and elastin that improves appearance and protects skin from future damage.</li>
            <li>Snail secretion filtrate contains natural acids and elastin that improves appearance and protects skin from future damage.</li>
            <li>* Softens the sensitive facial skin well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scientific examination of snail extract has identified certain active ingredients within the mucin, including:&lt;br /&gt;â€” Hyaluronic acid&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Realistically, the human body secretes oils to moisturize the skin, so essentially snail extract is a natural product provided by Mother Nature packed with skin care benefits.</li>
            <li>I love the application and while it feely slick and slippery on the skin it does absorb after a few seconds.</li>
            <li>I get a full face massage every morning and have begun to notice those subtle differences in the lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>It is clear, a little thick and feels sticky out of the bottle, but goes on your face smoothly with no sticky or greasy residue.</li>

            <li> This comes in a beautiful darks blue glass which is a beautiful design.</li>
            <li> It is a very light kind of smell, not like some overpowering perfume scent, but it does linger on my skin for quite some time after application</li>

            <li> I even want to purchase 2 more bottles just to make sure I have a stock.</li>
            <li> but I am hopeful : )</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a silky feeling, smooth and cooling to the touch kind of slimy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The bottle design and the packaging is very high-end and attractive in the style set.</li>
            <li> I received a Free sample for an evaluation; the research is from the internet, my testing results, statements, and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> Be sure to add a moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> And this product is great and works really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I really love how they make my skin feel.  </li>
            <li> This serum is just as lovely.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The bottle design and the packaging is very high-end-ish and attractive.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning, after cleansing my skin with a konjac sponge for better absorption.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell for sure just yet, but I feel like my skin tone and skin texture have improved a bit ever since I started using this serum, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> : I received a bottle free of charge in exchange for an honest review of how this worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The consistency is very unique.</li>
            <li> * Using this on clean skin after I use a facial sponge is the best way to get the most benefit&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is a scent to this serum, but it is light and feminine and I actually love the girly scent of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a complimentary sample of the product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> received a Free sample for an evaluation; the research is from the internet, my testing results, statements, and opinions are my own., and this ingredient has tremendous benefits when added to skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs easily</li>
            <li> There is a dropper for easy dispensing.</li>
            <li> The next thing that I noticed is that it completely absorbed into my face but it kept it feeling wonderful all day.  </li>
            <li> * Easy application with dropper that is provided&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wish that I could have waited the full 90 days for more visible results, before posting this review.  </li>
            <li> I am over 40 and notice this helps plump up my face, get rid of dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling with fine lines and sun damage.</li>
            <li> The product has a mild flower smell and it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get a good layer of coverage.</li>
            <li> It supplies three times as much moisture as Hyaluronic acid, continuously hydrating skin and effectively smoothing fine lines.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you start to smooth the serum into your skin it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately but it does absorb without sitting on the surface of your skin.  </li>

            <li> I am very grateful to have been offered this serum for an honest and unbiased opinion.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some great results and I can come back and share my results in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> renewed.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> /&gt;For $20 and free shipping at the time of this review</li>
            <li> Having Snail extract kind of scared me a bit and honestly seems gross, but I still wanted to try it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the product itself, it came packaged nicely in a glass bottle with a dropper top.</li>
            <li> The process is harmless and the snails live a happy life, safe from their natural predators.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the smell, it really smells good.  </li>
            <li> These lab snails live under optimum care so that they will continue to provide their beneficial substance, useful for our skin-care health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even those laugh lines around my mouth have softened!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the glow and the less noticeable fine lines all in just the first 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It takes a small drop to achieve the greatest effects of this product.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, the serum feels just a tiny bit slimy, but it&#x27;s not a nasty kind of slimy</li>
            <li> Most Vitamin C serums I have used so far was more runny than this one.</li>
            <li> Skin felt nicer, looked clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, the serum feels just a tiny bit slimy, but it&#x27;s not a nasty kind of slimy</li>
            <li> Most Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used so far was more runny than this one.</li>
            <li> It makes all the difference in the world in serums because my 56 year old, reformed sun worshiper, skin is feeling fantastic!!</li>
            <li> I did notice some reduction in the look of fine lines around my brow, eyes and laugh lines, they were not as prevalent&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I get targeted to try out so many &#x27;women of a certain age&#x27; products, but I keep trying them out, and this one is a gem.  </li>
            <li> The magic really happens over-night.</li>
            <li> love the idea that cell turn over is quicker thanks in part to the snail extract.</li>
            <li> : I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> * Pores seem to be minimized with this in combo with a good cleaning prior to use&lt;br /</li>
            <li> This Snail extract is a super ingredient which accelerates cell turnover, preventing and repairing wrinkles while improving the elasticity of the skin.</li>
            <li> Scientists collect the mucin from lab-bred snails and process it into a powdery substance, and this ingredient has tremendous benefits when added to skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had never heard of using snail extract for skin care, but it has great benefits such as preventing and repairing wrinkles while improving the elasticity of the skin, as well as providing three times as much moisture as Hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> * Comes in a cobalt blue container to block out light from the product, looks nice</li>
            <li> , it is a good buy and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added Acetyl Hexapeptide -3 to one of my new favorite ingredients.</li>
            <li> Once it is absorbed you can&#x27;t even tell that you have applied it because your skin just feels incredibly smooth, even after the first application.</li>
            <li> Most of us are now aware of the latest skin-care trend, facial vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> serum itself is 100% clear, with a very light fresh scent which goes away seconds after I apply it.</li>
            <li> This works great as everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I follow with a moisturizing cream and this keeps my skin very moist and smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I follow up with a moisturizer cream and this keeps my skin very moist and smooth throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Nice enough serum..</li>
            <li> serum came in a beautiful dark blue bottle with a convenient dropper applicator top.</li>
            <li> This serum feels nice to the skin, definitely moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil film on the surface like a lot of serums do.</li>
            <li> dries.&lt;br /&gt;The blue eye-dropper bottle even looks nice on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Vitamin C serums over the years and either they were too oily or they did not smell nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E; all which are main ingredients in this serum.</li>
            <li> and I can tell the difference in small wrinkles- pleasant smell and goes into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to other serums especially the department store brands, so I&#x27;m impressed all the way around.</li>
            <li> I apply it in the morning, after cleansing my skin with a konjac sponge for better absorption, the konjac sponge clean away anything that may block your pores and makes your face ready for you facial serums.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vitamin B5 hydrates skin by penetrating into the lower skin layers and is absorbed into skin cells, keeping moisture below the surface and on the surface, which provides the skin with a soft and smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> The study concluded that dryness and roughness resolved in all patients after 90 days, along with a significant reduction in fine lines, deep wrinkles, and an increase in elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Even after the first use, I could tell my skin felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First tried it alone and then with makeup.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I use this product before bed and first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> Next to the Alina Vitamin C Serum + Moisturizer, this is one of my two favorite serums ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The serum gets absorbed fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Skin doesn&#x27;t feel as fragile and seems to have more elasticity and suppleness after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> Very smoothly, it glides across your skin and it&#x27;s light, not sticky or heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> As an anti-inflammatory, it is effective in relieving the itchiness and discomfort of eczema and a number of skin conditions including superficial cuts and acne due to the properties that control the spread of bacteria.</li>
            <li> In conclusion, for anyone who is serious about his or her skin health and appearance, Perfjohn Vitamin C serum is a great addition to add to any skin care routine.</li>
            <li> The extract has a positive effect on acne scarring, acne prevention, dryness and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> The extract has a positive effect on acne scarring, acne prevention, dryness and hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> It comes in a cobalt blue glass container with a dropper that makes it easy to use and dispense.  </li>
            <li> Also, there is little to no aroma, which is nice when you don&#x27;t want clashing fragrances.</li>
            <li> so you can just put it straight on your finger tips and apply it anywhere you want without dripping it.  </li>
            <li> I spend so much money on items just hoping they work.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> Yes, really.</li>
            <li> Left me with a nice light glow and after a few days I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> It really does work wonders and has made my skin feel refreshed and</li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes this serum really stand out from the crowd, is the fact that it&#x27;s made with snail extract.</li>
            <li> and I actually really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, daily application of topical products containing snail secretion significantly reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, daily application of topical products containing snail secretion significantly reduces fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs fast and does not leave my skin feeling sticky as many other vitamin c serum can.</li>
            <li> Just a drop or two is necessary, it spreads easily like silk and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I will be continuing the use of this product well into my older age.  </li>
            <li> - I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> It feels very moisturizing and does not cause any redness, even when applied to the sensitive under-eye areas.</li>
            <li> It feels very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness, even when applied on the sensitive under-eye areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is important to understand that these snails are NOT hurt in this process; beauty manufacturers do not harm the snail during the extraction process: they simply collect the mucin left from live snails.</li>
            <li> On my freshly washed face I added a few drops and spread the serum in a circular motion until it&#x27;s completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and allergies</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> It goes on light, and I do have to be careful not to use more than a few drops because this serum really goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> This serum comes in a very decorative dark blue bottle and has a dropper for easy dispersing.  </li>
            <li> Different vitamin c serums have added a variety of components, vitamin E, Ferulic acid, hyaluronic acid, and/or a multitude of diverse herbal and plant extracts, to meet the needs of various skin care requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfjohn has added a different natural product from most of the others; they have included snail extract in their vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> Normally I steer away from the department store beauty products because of their heavy scents, and this product does have a light scent, but it goes away almost immediately so it didn&#x27;t affect my sinuses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Vitamin C penetrates through the surface to nourish lower skin cells, which results in healthier skin as the new skin cells reach the surface; this ensures a younger and vibrant complexion.</li>
            <li> If you want to find a product with anti-aging and anti-wrinkle properties that is made out of great ingredients, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, isn&#x27;t sticky and wasn&#x27;t testes on animals, I definitely think this one is worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With summer fast approaching, I need all the Vitamin C I can get..</li>
            <li> It has a soft lightweight texture that feels silky to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After cleansing and my toner application, I gently massage the vitamin c snail extract into my facial and neck skin.</li>
            <li> I only need 5-6 drops to cover my whole face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of two and even though I&#x27;m young</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product causing my face to breakout or leaving it oily.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple weeks of use (and I&#x27;m 48 years old, and have lost 50+ pounds), I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe some reduction in scent, as these days there are a lot of people who can be sensitive with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve read most of the reviews and took a chance, I have a very sensitive skin &amp; pro breakout &amp; have a lot of dark spots due to acne scars.</li>
            <li> and it really goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It has a slightly thicker consistency than most other Vitamin C serums, and either two or three drops provides enough coverage for both face and neck.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Snail secretion filtrate contains natural acids and elastin that improves appearance and protects skin from future damage.</li>

            <li> * Softens the sensitive facial skin well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scientific examination of snail extract has identified certain active ingredients within the mucin, including:&lt;br /&gt;â€” Hyaluronic acid&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Realistically, the human body secretes oils to moisturize the skin, so essentially snail extract is a natural product provided by Mother Nature packed with skin care benefits.</li>
            <li> I love the application and while it feely slick and slippery on the skin it does absorb after a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I get a full face massage every morning and have begun to notice those subtle differences in the lines around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> It is clear, a little thick and feels sticky out of the bottle, but goes on your face smoothly with no sticky or greasy residue.</li>
            <li> It contains other natural products, including collagen, yeast extract, chrysanthemum extract, honeysuckle extract, Aloe Vera, and Hamamelis Virginiana</li>
            <li> It contains other natural products, including collagen, yeast extract, chrysanthemum extract, honeysuckle extract, Aloe Vera, and Hamamelis Virginiana</li>
            <li> Alone or with makeup, it works well and doesn&#x27;t mess with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> However, in all honesty, since I am in my sixties a longer period is necessary, than younger women who have less depth in their facial</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x60;t even take this long to see a difference.</li>
            <li> I do find it rather strange that Vitamin C is NOT one of the serum&#x27;s listed ingredients..</li>
            <li> All have nourishing natural properties, to enhance skin cell activity, natural acids to improve appearance, and protection from future damage, to slow down the aging skin process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> /&gt;Acetyl Hexapeptide -3 helps to reduce the depth of facial expression lines and wrinkles due to muscle contractions, around the mouth, eyes and forehead, and it helps to boost collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is so very different from all the other Vitamin C Serums I have used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> The Perfjohn Vitamin C Serum with Snail extract is an excellent product.  It comes in a cobalt blue glass container with a dropper that makes it easy to use and dispense.  I actually expected the Serum to have a citrus smell and was surprised when it.  It does have a pleasant aroma and reminds me of Clinique Happy fragrance, if you&#x27;ve ever smelled that before, Its quite nice. The serum is also totally clear and has a thick texture that is almost goo like. It sits well on the finger tips and makes it great for gently blending into your problem areas.  It&#x27;s not liquid like so you can just put it straight on your finger tips and apply it anywhere you want without dripping it.  When you start to smooth the serum into your skin it doesn&#x27;t absorb immediately but it does absorb without sitting on the surface of your skin.  Once it is absorbed you can&#x27;t even tell that you have applied it because your skin just feels incredibly smooth, even after the first application. It you like beauty treatments and the latest in awesome products then this is a must try.  I was provided this product as a free sample for testing and reviewing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum since I have started using it.  I was using a vitamin C oil but find this serum to work much better for me. It is clear, a little thick and feels sticky out of the bottle, but goes on your face smoothly with no sticky or greasy residue. Absorbs easily and I use a moisturizer after it dries.  I am over 40 and notice this helps plump up my face, get rid of dryness and fine lines.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works like it says. I spend so much money on items just hoping they work. Well it has finally paid off. I&#x60;ve been using for a week now but it didn&#x60;t even take this long to see a difference. Even those laugh lines around my mouth have softened! I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice enough serum.. I LOVE products with Vitamin C. With summer fast approaching, I need all the Vitamin C I can get.. Vitamin C does wonders for sun damage, and I&#x27;m prone to skin poisoning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum came in a beautiful dark blue bottle with a convenient dropper applicator top. The packaging is very lovely. I really think this would make an attractive gift.. Upon further inspection, I came to realize that the serum contains actual snail extract! I admit that was a bit alarming for me. I have never heard of a Vitamin C Serum that contains actual snail extract, until now..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use products that contain animal by-products.. That is just a personal choice of mine, so I passed this serum on to my boyfriend. He said it absorbs very quickly after cleansing his skin, and it leaves his skin feeling pleasantly hydrated. The serum hasn&#x27;t caused him any irritation as a result of use. I do find it rather strange that Vitamin C is NOT one of the serum&#x27;s listed ingredients.. Fascinating. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> I&#x60;ve read most of the reviews and took a chance, I have a very sensitive skin &amp; pro breakout &amp; have a lot of dark spots due to acne scars. One of my concerns, aging skin around my eyes. after 2-3 days of use followed by my moisturizer unbelievable! around my eyes, the line that&#x60;s been bothering me for quite a while is lessening &amp; the dark spots on my cheeks wow! start to lighten! I will never go without this ever! I even want to purchase 2 more bottles just to make sure I have a stock. I love it! thank you this product is a miracle in a bottle! my friends saw me &amp; said you look blooming! that&#x60;s only 2-3 days of use. imagine a month or a year wow! this product is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> This works great as everyday moisturizer. Doesnâ€™t make your face greasy throughout the day - the perfect degree of hydration! Even after the first use, I could tell my skin felt softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little amount goes a long way, this 1oz bottle will probably last 3-4 months (using 2x a day).</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this in the mail to try.  I was a bit skeptical that I would notice any changes.  I have some darker skin spots on my face, particularly above my upper lip that are quite bothersome to me in appearance.  I believe they have lightened up a bit with the use of this vitamin sirum. I will continue to use the product to see if it will disappear completely.&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is my face feels sticky after use.  Like dried glue on it.  Using this before bed helps that feeling not be irritating</li>
            <li> I like it.  It makes my face very smooth looking and hydrated.  I have very sensitive skin and allergies but this has not caused any bad reactions : )  Not sure about anti-wrinkle as I&#x27;ve only used it a few days but I am hopeful : )</li>
            <li> This serum feels nice to the skin, definitely moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t leave an oil film on the surface like a lot of serums do. Also, there is little to no aroma, which is nice when you don&#x27;t want clashing fragrances. Would definitely give this to a friend as a gift. The order was problem-free, and I had no issue with delivery or the package. A great product to have alongside your lotions and creams.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help - and feels slimy</li>
            <li> Perfjohn Snail Extract Vitamin C Serum. This Snail extract is a super ingredient which accelerates cell turnover, preventing and repairing wrinkles while improving the elasticity of the skin. It supplies three times as much moisture as Hyaluronic acid, continuously hydrating skin and effectively smoothing fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; OK so I was a bit skeptical about this serum, I mean it is made with snail extract. Admittedly, the serum feels just a tiny bit slimy, but it&#x27;s not a nasty kind of slimy, it&#x27;s more of a silky feeling, smooth and cooling to the touch kind of slimy. Most Vitamin C serums I have used so far was more runny than this one. They were also usually yellow-tinted and this one is clear, and they were rather unpleasant smelling. But the  Perfjohn serum smells a bit flowery. It is a very light kind of smell, not like some overpowering perfume scent, but it does linger on my skin for quite some time after application and I  do actually like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: After washing your face with warm water, apply the serum to your face and massage until fully absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design and the packaging is very high-end and attractive in the style set. This product feels and looks luxurious, I can definitely feel that my skin is softer after one week of using the serum. I apply it in the morning, after cleansing my skin with a konjac sponge for better absorption, the konjac sponge clean away anything that may block your pores and makes your face ready for you facial serums. The serum absorbs fast and does not leave my skin feeling sticky as many other vitamin c serum can. It feels very moisturizing and does not cause any redness, even when applied to the sensitive under-eye areas. I follow with a moisturizing cream and this keeps my skin very moist and smooth throughout the day. The moisturizer locks all the serum into the skin so it is doing the job it is set to do and that is to penetrate the skin and restore the skin from a cellular level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion.br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received this product at a savings price or it is supplied to me for the purposes of a product review.

            <li> I have to admit I was very curious about this serum! Snail extract? Really? Yes, really. This serum goes on smoothly. Very smoothly, it glides across your skin and it&#x27;s light, not sticky or heavy on the skin. On my freshly washed face I added a few drops and spread the serum in a circular motion until it&#x27;s completely absorbed. The serum does absorb quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I personally have not had any stinging, irritation or redness. The magic really happens over-night. I wake up with a glow to my skin. My face feels tighter but not mask tight just firmer. My skin is also smooth and brighter too!&lt;br /&gt;I love the idea that cell turn over is quicker thanks in part to the snail extract. I&#x27;m also a huge fan of Hyaluronic acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E; all which are main ingredients in this serum. I&#x27;ve added Acetyl Hexapeptide -3 to one of my new favorite ingredients. It makes all the difference in the world in serums because my 56 year old, reformed sun worshiper, skin is feeling fantastic!! I&#x27;m impressed with the glow and the less noticeable fine lines all in just the first 5 days!&lt;br /&gt;This serum itself is 100% clear, with a very light fresh scent which goes away seconds after I apply it. There is no greasy feeling while you apply or after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;The blue eye-dropper bottle even looks nice on my bathroom counter. I use my serum everyday; twice a day. A small amount goes a long way; I  believe this bottle will last me 8 or 9 weeks. I&#x27;m thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received complimentary or free products for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Most of us are now aware of the latest skin-care trend, facial vitamin C serum.  This scientifically proven serum helps to protect skin from environmental free radicals, the cause for accelerating aging skin. Vitamin C penetrates through the surface to nourish lower skin cells, which results in healthier skin as the new skin cells reach the surface; this ensures a younger and vibrant complexion. Different vitamin c serums have added a variety of components, vitamin E, Ferulic acid, hyaluronic acid, and/or a multitude of diverse herbal and plant extracts, to meet the needs of various skin care requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfjohn has added a different natural product from most of the others; they have included snail extract in their vitamin c serum. It has a soft lightweight texture that feels silky to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C Serum with Snail Extract comes in a glass bottle with eye drop applicator.  It has a slightly thicker consistency than most other Vitamin C serums, and either two or three drops provides enough coverage for both face and neck.  After cleansing and my toner application, I gently massage the vitamin c snail extract into my facial and neck skin. Just a drop or two is necessary, it spreads easily like silk and leaves my skin very soft. It does have a slightly thicker consistency than other vitamin c serums, but it does absorb well, and does not interfere with the rest of my other following facial serums. I am using this twice daily, mornings and evenings, and after 7 weeks, I think there is a slight reduction in the lines around my eyes and I wish that I could have waited the full 90 days for more visible results, before posting this review.  However, in all honesty, since I am in my sixties a longer period is necessary, than younger women who have less depth in their facial lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfjohn Snail Extract Vitamin C serum contains the following excellent ingredients, which provides the best health for skin care needs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E, which is an antioxidant to help prevent ultraviolet light damage, cell membrane damage, reduces water loss from skin and strengthens the skin&#x27;s barrier function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin B5 hydrates skin by penetrating into the lower skin layers and is absorbed into skin cells, keeping moisture below the surface and on the surface, which provides the skin with a soft and smooth appearance. It helps skin to maintain optimal health, and promotes healing of tissues. As an anti-inflammatory, it is effective in relieving the itchiness and discomfort of eczema and a number of skin conditions including superficial cuts and acne due to the properties that control the spread of bacteria. This results in healthier skin cells and skin tissue resulting in a big difference in the overall appearance of skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acetyl Hexapeptide -3 helps to reduce the depth of facial expression lines and wrinkles due to muscle contractions, around the mouth, eyes and forehead, and it helps to boost collagen production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below I have added my research on all the advantages and benefits that snail extract delivers for skin health and care:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to understand that these snails are NOT hurt in this process; beauty manufacturers do not harm the snail during the extraction process: they simply collect the mucin left from live snails. The process is harmless and the snails live a happy life, safe from their natural predators. These lab snails live under optimum care so that they will continue to provide their beneficial substance, useful for our skin-care health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientific examination of snail extract has identified certain active ingredients within the mucin, including:&lt;br /&gt;â€” Hyaluronic acid&lt;br /&gt;â€” Glycoprotein&lt;br /&gt;â€” Enzymes&lt;br /&gt;â€” Antimicrobial and copper peptides&lt;br /&gt;â€” Proteoglycans&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realistically, the human body secretes oils to moisturize the skin, so essentially snail extract is a natural product provided by Mother Nature packed with skin care benefits. Scientists collect the mucin from lab-bred snails and process it into a powdery substance, and this ingredient has tremendous benefits when added to skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snail secretion filtrate contains natural acids and elastin that improves appearance and protects skin from future damage. The extract has a positive effect on acne scarring, acne prevention, dryness and hyperpigmentation. According to a 2013 study published in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, daily application of topical products containing snail secretion significantly reduces fine lines and wrinkles. The study concluded that dryness and roughness resolved in all patients after 90 days, along with a significant reduction in fine lines, deep wrinkles, and an increase in elasticity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, for anyone who is serious about his or her skin health and appearance, Perfjohn Vitamin C serum is a great addition to add to any skin care routine. It contains other natural products, including collagen, yeast extract, chrysanthemum extract, honeysuckle extract, Aloe Vera, and Hamamelis Virginiana (witch hazel â€“ an astringent to reduce acne and soothe irritated skin).  All have nourishing natural properties, to enhance skin cell activity, natural acids to improve appearance, and protection from future damage, to slow down the aging skin process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Free sample for an evaluation; the research is from the internet, my testing results, statements, and opinions are my own., and this ingredient has tremendous benefits when added to skin care products.

            <li> Only had this product for a week and I can tell the difference in small wrinkles- pleasant smell and goes into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is so very different from all the other Vitamin C Serums I have used. Having Snail extract kind of scared me a bit and honestly seems gross, but I still wanted to try it out. This comes in a beautiful darks blue glass which is a beautiful design. There is a dropper for easy dispensing. The consistency is very unique. It is clear, thick and actually a bit gooey or slimy. It glides on and slippery on the skin upon application. There is a scent to this serum, but it is light and feminine and I actually love the girly scent of this. It does not last and fades a way.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a couple of weeks 1 to 2 times a day. I love the application and while it feely slick and slippery on the skin it does absorb after a few seconds. Be sure to add a moisturizer after. I have noticed a brightness and smoothness to my skin lately and I am thinking it has to be this. I am very satisfied with the results. I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts, opinions or experiences.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other Vitamin C Serum. And this product is great and works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it twice a day. First tried it alone and then with makeup. Alone or with makeup, it works well and doesn&#x27;t mess with my sensitive skin. Left me with a nice light glow and after a few days I noticed a difference. Skin felt nicer, looked clean and refreshed. A truly great product that is worth the try!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible. I use it daily. I only need 5-6 drops to cover my whole face. (With a toner) . It has stopped my breakouts, and all the lines on my face are gone after a week! I&#x60;ll be buying this stuff forever!</li>
            <li> Well lets start with a little goes a long way!  This serum comes in a very decorative dark blue bottle and has a dropper for easy dispersing.  It takes a small drop to achieve the greatest effects of this product.  I get a full face massage every morning and have begun to notice those subtle differences in the lines around my eyes and mouth. This serum has a very light and soothing scent to me.  I am very grateful to have been offered this serum for an honest and unbiased opinion.  I will be continuing the use of this product well into my older age.  Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how I get targeted to try out so many &#x27;women of a certain age&#x27; products, but I keep trying them out, and this one is a gem.  I always read the ingredients before I say yes, because I want as few chemicals on my skin.  Perfjohn Anti Aging Snail Extract is full of good things, though I have no idea what snail extract is all about, but the serum is not sticky so I&#x27;m not worried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been a fan of Vitamin C products for a while now and I really love how they make my skin feel.  This serum is just as lovely.  It goes on light, and I do have to be careful not to use more than a few drops because this serum really goes a long ways.  Normally I steer away from the department store beauty products because of their heavy scents, and this product does have a light scent, but it goes away almost immediately so it didn&#x27;t affect my sinuses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m only in my first week of use, but it does moisturize well, goes on beautifully, and keeps my skin feeling perfect all day(I tend towards dry skin). The price is reasonable compared to other serums especially the department store brands, so I&#x27;m impressed all the way around. While I was given a bottle to try out, I would have no problem buying it myself.</li>
            <li> This cream is great - I have received compliments all over the place since I&#x60;ve been using it - It plumps out my skin removing so many wrinkles :D - I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from the seller and I am a happy camper.  I have tried several Vitamin C serums over the years and either they were too oily or they did not smell nice.  I am very happy with this brand and it really goes a long way.  The first thing I noticed was the smell, it really smells good.  The next thing that I noticed is that it completely absorbed into my face but it kept it feeling wonderful all day.  Of course, these types of products are not for everyone but if you are looking for one that will preform and make you happy then this is the one that I would recommend you try.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mom of two and even though I&#x27;m young (I&#x27;m only 30) I&#x27;ve been struggling with fine lines and sun damage. I heard vitamin C serums work great for both those issues so I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this. I use this product before bed and first thing in the morning. I also use a derma roller once a week and follow up with this serum after. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days so I can&#x27;t comment on how effective it is just yet, but I will update my review once I&#x27;ve had a chance to use it longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product itself, it came packaged nicely in a glass bottle with a dropper top. The product has a mild flower smell and it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get a good layer of coverage. This serum rubs in nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling sticky afterwards. So far I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product causing my face to breakout or leaving it oily. I have naturally oily skin so I&#x27;m always careful about what products I use on my face. Hopefully I&#x27;ll see some great results and I can come back and share my results in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> The Perfjohn Snail Extract Anti Aging Vitamin c serum is a great product.  I have tried lots of vitamin c products, and have found good things about each of them, but this is my favorite.  It comes very nicely and securely packaged, so you need not worry about the bottle breaking in shipment.  It is in a very attractive blue bottle, this would make a great gift as it is very attractive.  And it works wonders.  I had never heard of using snail extract for skin care, but it has great benefits such as preventing and repairing wrinkles while improving the elasticity of the skin, as well as providing three times as much moisture as Hyaluronic acid.  And I feel good knowing that it does not hurt the snails in any way when they get the extract. It really does work wonders and has made my skin feel refreshed and renewed.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> Next to the Alina Vitamin C Serum + Moisturizer, this is one of my two favorite serums ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this serum really stand out from the crowd, is the fact that it&#x27;s made with snail extract. Admittedly, the serum feels just a tiny bit slimy, but it&#x27;s not a nasty kind of slimy, it&#x27;s more of a silky feeling, smooth and cooling to the touch kind of slimy. Most Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve used so far was more runny than this one. They were also usually yellow-tinted (this one is clear) and rather unpleasant smelling. Perfjohn serum smells a bit flowery. It&#x27;s a very light kind of smell, not some overpowering perfume, but it does linger on my skin for quite some time after application and I actually really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle design and the packaging is very high-end-ish and attractive. The product feels and looks luxurious, and I can definitely feel that my skin is softer after one week of using this. I apply it in the morning, after cleansing my skin with a konjac sponge for better absorption. The serum gets absorbed fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky. It feels very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness, even when applied on the sensitive under-eye areas. I follow up with a moisturizer cream and this keeps my skin very moist and smooth throughout the day. I can&#x27;t tell for sure just yet, but I feel like my skin tone and skin texture have improved a bit ever since I started using this serum, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this serum a lot. If you want to find a product with anti-aging and anti-wrinkle properties that is made out of great ingredients, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, isn&#x27;t sticky and wasn&#x27;t testes on animals, I definitely think this one is worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received a complimentary sample of the product in exchange for my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Upfront: I received a bottle free of charge in exchange for an honest review of how this worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple weeks of use (and I&#x27;m 48 years old, and have lost 50+ pounds), I can report the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The serum soaks in well, and does NOT leave an oily residue&lt;br /&gt;* Softens the sensitive facial skin well&lt;br /&gt;* Comes in a cobalt blue container to block out light from the product, looks nice&lt;br /&gt;* Easy application with dropper that is provided&lt;br /&gt;* Use a VERY small amount, and still quite effective&lt;br /&gt;* Floral scent is pleasant, but does stick around for a bit after application to skin.  Lasts about an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;* Using this on clean skin after I use a facial sponge is the best way to get the most benefit&lt;br /&gt;* I did notice some reduction in the look of fine lines around my brow, eyes and laugh lines, they were not as prevalent&lt;br /&gt;* Pores seem to be minimized with this in combo with a good cleaning prior to use&lt;br /&gt;* Skin doesn&#x27;t feel as fragile and seems to have more elasticity and suppleness after 2 weeks of use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I would recommend to the manufacturer?  Maybe some reduction in scent, as these days there are a lot of people who can be sensitive with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $20 and free shipping at the time of this review, it is a good buy and lasts a long time.</li>
