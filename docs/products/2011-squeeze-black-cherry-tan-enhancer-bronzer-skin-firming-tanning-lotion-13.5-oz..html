            <li>Products I&#x27;ve used are listed below and this one is pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>not a bad thing i just couldn&#x27;t stop using it!</li>

            <li>I love this product because its smells good and it leaves my skin soft and I also get a golden bronzy tan.</li>
            <li>I know next time to not wear anything to get rid of my new tan line, LOL!!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty grand.</li>
            <li>, I wore a tub top in my first session and now have a tan line</li>
            <li>Me by Designer Skin (3 1/2* Smells really good, like vanilla ish, but it takes a long time to make me tan.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li>This is not a fake review!</li>
            <li>my skin doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed afterward, I didn&#x27;t have to shower right away.</li>
            <li>I tan super easily anyway, but have found that this lotion seems to help me and also definitely keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 4 years now, so this isn&#x27;t my first rodeo.</li>
            <li>made me way too hot, made my butt itch alot</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on nice and smooth, it isn&#x27;t too thick or too watery.</li>
            <li>so words of wisdom, make sure that when you use this, apply lotion to your hands and any dry areas first (ankles, knees, elbows) or they will look orange and wipe off your hands after application.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel super soft afterward</li>
            <li>the fragrance is a little strong, and might bother some, but I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see how much one session would make so</li>
            <li>so, it did very well.</li>
            <li>, just doesn&#x27;t work as fast for me as some of my others.</li>
            <li>The very 1st time I used this product, I saw immediate results.  </li>
            <li>The tan really lasts.</li>
            <li>If I did tan on a schedule I would imagine I would get really tan.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t wash my hands (or wipe them) after my first application so the dry part on my hands between my fingers is golden!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, its a subtle sweet cherry and</li>
            <li>I used to be hooked on Designer Skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; but this stuff is better and at half the price.</li>
            <li>Provides good color, but smells like cherry cough medicine -- not pleasant.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for a long time and am never disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li>i have five different lotions at all times and i ran out of this one first!</li>
            <li>Black Cherry leaves you really orange looking.</li>
            <li>it gets you a dark tan quickly, and the dark bronzing agents never leave your skin orange.</li>

            <li> i have five different lotions at all times and i ran out of this one first!</li>
            <li> Black Cherry leaves you really orange looking.</li>
            <li> it gets you a dark tan quickly, and the dark bronzing agents never leave your skin orange.</li>
            <li> Gives you an even natural tan after a few sessions 3-4.</li>
            <li> but I used this lotion 1 time for 2 15 minute sessions and the next day I could not believe how dark I was.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of cherries that much, but the smell was very faint</li>
            <li> (I was afraid it might be really strong).</li>
            <li> it gives you an instant tan whether you tan a little or a lot!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face too and my skin hasn&#x27;t been clogging and my face is as dark as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saving money on tanning less often.</li>
            <li> If Black Cherry was $75 a bottle I would still buy it.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used this nugget 4 times and using that little sticker you place somewhere for your tan line tattoo or whatevs</li>
            <li> Turns you orange ,don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
            <li> Seems to be watered down or it isnt suppose to be as thick as others.  </li>
            <li> But, it usually takes about 7-8 sessions on a level 2 bed to get some noticeable color on me.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get out of bottle,but like it does the job.</li>
            <li> It gives you a Very fake tan look, especially if you don&#x27;t evenly put it on.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this tanning lotion because it gives her a subtle fake tan while helping her tan at the tanners.</li>
            <li> Also, the after-tan odor eliminating ingredient did  work at all - I developed that awful burnt skin smell immediately after tanning.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> &quot; I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great lotion much cheaper than buying at the salon. Gives you an even natural tan after a few sessions 3-4. Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best Tanning lotion I have ever used! Gets nice color but doesn&#x27;t burn you and it has anti aging properties in it!</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;ve been tanning for about 4 years now, so this isn&#x27;t my first rodeo. Products I&#x27;ve used are listed below and this one is pretty darn good. Let it be known that I have olive skin, yellow if you will bc I&#x27;ve got some Pacific Islander and Portuguese in me. But, it usually takes about 7-8 sessions on a level 2 bed to get some noticeable color on me.  Well, I&#x27;ve used this nugget 4 times and using that little sticker you place somewhere for your tan line tattoo or whatevs, I can already see the heart! (4 Sessions, 10 min each) It smells just fine, not a tingler, but it is a bronzer. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with looking orange but I didn&#x27;t wash my hands (or wipe them) after my first application so the dry part on my hands between my fingers is golden! ;o) so words of wisdom, make sure that when you use this, apply lotion to your hands and any dry areas first (ankles, knees, elbows) or they will look orange and wipe off your hands after application. Makes your skin feel super soft afterward and it smells like cherries, so it&#x27;s pretty grand. I give it a 4. It&#x27;s my favorite. I use it on my face too and my skin hasn&#x27;t been clogging and my face is as dark as the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other used Tanning Products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoke by Supre&#x27; (3 1/2*. has a bronzer, gave me a light brown color but, to me it&#x27;s the BEST smelling stuff I&#x27;ve ever used!)&lt;br /&gt;Melt by Designer Skin (3* if you like tinglers, this is for you. made me way too hot, made my butt itch alot, DO NOT USE IT ON YOUR FACE!!! it burns. smells like watermelon, gave me a good color)&lt;br /&gt;Worship Me by Designer Skin (3 1/2* Smells really good, like vanilla ish, but it takes a long time to make me tan. about 10 sessions but it gives a really nice brown color)</li>
            <li> i have five different lotions at all times and i ran out of this one first! not a bad thing i just couldn&#x27;t stop using it! it gives you an instant tan whether you tan a little or a lot! i own my own tanning bed and i know my lotions and this one tops the chart! and it&#x27;s so freakin&#x27; CHEAP! I&#x27;m on here today to order more!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GREAT AND DID GIVE ME COLOR. NO ORANGE STREAKS WITH THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This lotion is really good!</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Black Cherry leaves you really orange looking. It gives you a Very fake tan look, especially if you don&#x27;t evenly put it on. I would not recommend this lotion to anyone.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, have had much better..It leaves your cuticles stained if you don&#x27;t get rubbed in good or wash your hands...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good bronzer that smells good and makes you look tan, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> I have just started tanning and this doesn&#x27;t have a tingle but it smells great and works great. I wanted to see how much one session would make so, I wore a tub top in my first session and now have a tan line so, it did very well. I know next time to not wear anything to get rid of my new tan line, LOL!!!</li>
            <li> Turns you orange ,don&#x27;t waste you money</li>
            <li> I got this and the 2010 Squeeze Mangosteen made by the same company.  I have 5 different types of lotion and this one does ok. I like my others better but use this more than the Mangosteen kind.  Nice cherry smell and gives a good color, just doesn&#x27;t work as fast for me as some of my others.</li>
            <li> I used to work at a tanning salon and have used tons of different lotions (and some of the most expensive). I purchased this lotion because I did some research online and it was one of the \\&quot;top for 2011.\\&quot; I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. The lotion goes on nice and smooth, it isn&#x27;t too thick or too watery. I don&#x27;t really like the smell of cherries that much, but the smell was very faint (I was afraid it might be really strong). I especially liked how I really didn&#x27;t smell like I had been tanning after I used it. I tan super easily anyway, but have found that this lotion seems to help me and also definitely keeps my skin moisturized. Plus the amount that you get is a ton. It&#x27;s a great buy!</li>
            <li> I own a tanning bed and my bulbs are not as strong as a salon.  The very 1st time I used this product, I saw immediate results.  I love the smell, its a subtle sweet cherry and my skin doesn&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed afterward, I didn&#x27;t have to shower right away. Highly Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> turned my hands orange even after washing them!!!</li>
            <li> This is not a fake review! I heard about this tanning lotion from my sister. This and one called dragon fruit ( I think that&#x27;s what she called it ) either way, they are from the same brand. I used this once and was amazed that 2 days later I was even darker still! I wait till I need to tan instead of on a regular schedule. I went in and the tanning tech asked where I&#x27;ve been. The tan really lasts. If I did tan on a schedule I would imagine I would get really tan. It&#x27;s not my style but if its yours, this is the lotion for you. I&#x27;m just saving money on tanning less often.</li>
            <li> There is no tanning lotion out there that gets you darker faster. I own my own tanning bed and the bulbs are getting old but I used this lotion 1 time for 2 15 minute sessions and the next day I could not believe how dark I was. I went from a medium tan to brown in one day. I used to be hooked on Designer Skin&#x27;s &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34; but this stuff is better and at half the price. If Black Cherry was $75 a bottle I would still buy it. It&#x27;s that good. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of bottle,but like it does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this product because its smells good and it leaves my skin soft and I also get a golden bronzy tan.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome lotion. It gives me great color..the fragrance is a little strong, and might bother some, but I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> The lotion is great it gets you a dark tan quickly, and the dark bronzing agents never leave your skin orange. I won&#x27;t use any other product!</li>
            <li> Seems to be watered down or it isnt suppose to be as thick as others.  Didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.</li>
            <li> Best there is. Have been using this for a long time and am never disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> Do not recommend.  Looks streaky after using,  like sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this tanning lotion because it gives her a subtle fake tan while helping her tan at the tanners.</li>
            <li> Provides good color, but smells like cherry cough medicine -- not pleasant. Also, the after-tan odor eliminating ingredient did  work at all - I developed that awful burnt skin smell immediately after tanning. Will not purchase again.</li>
