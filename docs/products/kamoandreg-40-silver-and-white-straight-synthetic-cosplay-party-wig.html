            <li>This wig is great for the price..</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Was for Granddaughters cosplay, She loved it and wore it for Comicon Phoenix.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how good the quality is.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with purchase, I messed it up by brushing it.</li>
            <li>Love this wig!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>As far as I know the quality is perfect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig came in in fairly good time and in clean packaging.</li>
            <li>Washes nice and styles easy.</li>
            <li>Tangles easily but also looks nice.</li>
            <li>Oh so cheap!  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a detangler spray  on it so it doesn&#x27;t get too nappy</li>
            <li>Lovely color.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok its still cute.</li>
            <li>Pleased with quality of the wig.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect white for the purpose in which I bought it.</li>
            <li>, it was amazing when I tried it on originally.</li>
            <li>It tangled a bit easily, but I had detangler</li>
            <li>so it was sorta easy to get it out</li>
            <li>The perfect length of what I wanted, it reached down to my bum which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>So, I have yet to wear it out for a full day, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Bangs are long, it is great for Halloween.</li>
            <li>If you use it right out of the package it will keep this wig tangle free.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have someone who has a problem with their real hair, and he uses these as his real hair.</li>
            <li>It also came super fast!</li>
            <li>I was able to take it right from the package, try it on, and put it back in without it tangling.</li>
            <li>suppose it&#x27;s my fault for ordering it when the description says &#x27;silver white,&#x27; but I had hoped it would give off more of the silver/blue tone in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Make sure when you get any long wig like this</li>
            <li>They last about 2-3 months each if he gets lazy and doesn&#x27;t take care of them, but it&#x27;s surely worth rebuying to keep him happy.</li>
            <li>He wears the wigs daily, and sleeps with them on just fine.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It got very tangled</li>
            <li>It looks natural and no one knows that it&#x27;s not his real hair.</li>
            <li>it is thin but it looks good on and is has to tell.</li>
            <li>It was scheduled to come some time near November 7th</li>

            <li> it is thin but it looks good on and is has to tell.</li>
            <li> It was scheduled to come some time near November 7th</li>
            <li> The bangs are sooooooo long, (cover my whole face and a little past my chin) but that makes it great for cutting and styling them.</li>
            <li> It is a little thin, but it comes all the way to my waist, and the top of my butt</li>
            <li> so long too.</li>
            <li> It worked because it had to, but the wig came in looking like grey hair, and the bangs are shorter than they</li>
            <li> Long wig worked well for costume.</li>
            <li> just be careful</li>
            <li> It is about the usual fullness for a low priced costume wig.</li>
            <li> So thin that you can see the netting on the back of the head because there are only a few meager sparse hairs covering it.</li>
            <li> However if you&#x27;re looking for a thick wig this is def not for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Queen Elsa costume but was disappointed with the difference between the picture and the actual wig.</li>
            <li> Fibers are thin but the wig doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;fake shiny&amp;#34; look to it</li>
            <li> Very thin but still covers the cap.</li>
            <li> Not what is pictured, very thin.</li>
            <li> Terrible wig.</li>

            <li> Oh so cheap!  Love it.  I did cut off  a big chunk.  For the price it really is wonderful.  Its so long too. Make sure to use a detangler spray  on it so it doesn&#x27;t get too nappy</li>
            <li> Very nice. Lovely color. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Worked excellent for my amythist costume. Washes nice and styles easy.</li>

            <li> its white not silver. But that&#x27;s ok its still cute. However if you&#x27;re looking for a thick wig this is def not for you. Very thin but still covers the cap.</li>
            <li> Happy that My Item arrive today,,&lt;br /&gt;very Satisfy w/ it..&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought this for a Queen Elsa costume but was disappointed with the difference between the picture and the actual wig.

            <li> This wig is great for the price.. it is thin but it looks good on and is has to tell. Make sure when you get any long wig like this you get some sort of anti tangling spray that will work for wigs. If you use it right out of the package it will keep this wig tangle free.</li>
            <li> I must have bought like 10 of these already. That&#x27;s how good the quality is. Honestly I have someone who has a problem with their real hair, and he uses these as his real hair. It looks natural and no one knows that it&#x27;s not his real hair. He wears the wigs daily, and sleeps with them on just fine. As far as I know the quality is perfect. They last about 2-3 months each if he gets lazy and doesn&#x27;t take care of them, but it&#x27;s surely worth rebuying to keep him happy. Posting a picture of him so you guys can see (he doesn&#x27;t mind). 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Its perfect! It is the perfect white for the purpose in which I bought it. The bangs are sooooooo long, (cover my whole face and a little past my chin) but that makes it great for cutting and styling them. It is a little thin, but it comes all the way to my waist, and the top of my butt (I am 5&#x27;5&#x27;&#x27;). For this fact, I think making it any thicker would make it too heavy and too much to keep from untangling. I was able to take it right from the package, try it on, and put it back in without it tangling. So, I have yet to wear it out for a full day, but so far so good. I really like it! It also came super fast! It was scheduled to come some time near November 7th and I got it today 10/25/2014. Awesome ^_^ I ordered it the 14th</li>
            <li> Bangs are long, it is great for Halloween. It does tangle.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. Tangles easily but also looks nice. Fibers are thin but the wig doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;fake shiny&amp;#34; look to it so it&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> Love this wig! I actually needed it shorter, so I chopped a bit off. I wish I could&#x27;ve kept it longer though, it was amazing when I tried it on originally.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with purchase, I messed it up by brushing it. It got very tangled and I had to cut it so just be careful</li>
            <li> Got this for my kiddo&#x27;s costume. Not what is pictured, very thin.</li>
            <li> Terrible wig. So thin that you can see the netting on the back of the head because there are only a few meager sparse hairs covering it.</li>
