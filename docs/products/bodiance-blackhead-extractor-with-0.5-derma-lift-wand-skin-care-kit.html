            <li>Great price and easy to use.</li>
            <li>ll skins; but it is amazing the results I have gotten using it with Vitamin C Serum/Hyaluronic Acid and vitamin E....</li>
            <li>literally amazing</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it feels kind of like scratching maybe?</li>
            <li>But in a nice way.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s like having my own mini acupuncture treatment.</li>
            <li>Nice protective case.</li>
            <li>this is the best one I have tried very effective and superior to others I have purchased  before would definitely recommend this is the one to purchase price is right</li>
            <li>saying that&#x27;s the most effective for the face.</li>
            <li>comes in a nice and practical protective â€“ storage case, what makes easy to wash and sanitize the micro roller.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week with moisturizing night cream</li>
            <li>The vitamin C feels really refreshing after rolling.</li>
            <li>I love this gadget.</li>
            <li>but I hit a wall and wasn&#x27;t able to get my skin to continue to improve.</li>
            <li>I love the way my face feels and the way it glows after I do a treatment with the derma roller.</li>
            <li>okay I have read and seen all the hyp about proactive restorative products with an MD Roller....</li>
            <li>, the results after one use was astonishing...</li>
            <li>Needed more instructions for this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve decided to do a multi-entry review, as that&#x27;s the most helpful for me.</li>
            <li>Well, I think I can safely say, this IS it.</li>
            <li>This is also the recommended frequency of use by many experts.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews about derma rollers before my purchase.</li>
            <li>I am confident that within 3 to 6 months, I will see more results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After that I tried it on my arm hoping it might serve me better there</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I e-mailed questions to the company.  </li>
            <li>Once a week is enough.&amp;#34; My chin does look better.</li>
            <li>and made my face look better than it has since before puberty!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can see some improvement on some of my scars and my complexion is more even toned.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty good about reading directions and looking them up when need be.</li>
            <li>good and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li>the product is easy to use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for her to use</li>
            <li>I found them to be very gentle and still effective.</li>
            <li>First time: I didn&#x27;t use a numbing cream--I don&#x27;t like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li>squeaky but works fine</li>
            <li>And then maybe my skin is not overly sensitive, as it feels even somewhat pleasant at times.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really made me feel much better about my 53-year-old skin!</li>
            <li>This is nice as it has the stainless steel needles, but I had to upgrade to 1.0 for my face.</li>
            <li>feel cleaner and absorbed more cream.</li>
            <li>and I know that the next morning, my skin will look and feel great.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for your skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the smaller size needle.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel too cheap or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be ordering for my daughter,sister in-law and a few of my best friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and makes her feel</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m [mumble-mumble] years old with good skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>But my sister is using this long time ago and her face looks great.</li>
            <li>A bit brisk at first, but think I will love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes.</li>
            <li>use 91% rubbing alcohol from CVS to clean it after each use, soak it and then dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have used a couple of times to reduce pores--not certain that is working--but better for me than using any liquid product</li>
            <li>I am a 59 years old and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>I actually look forward to using it, it feels so good</li>
            <li>Now--I have always had good skin and looked 10 years younger than what I am anyway.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if it works fast, but there&#x27;s no pain when rolling even if I apply pressure. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as far as for beauty use.... well, It was nice on my face</li>
            <li>actually it feels kinda good</li>
            <li>There is a mild prickly sensation, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>I had already achieved tremendous results using retinol and vitamin C</li>
            <li>I am HOOKED than you and thank you for the lovely follow up email with tips and instructions love your personal touch.</li>
            <li>I watched a bunch of YouTube videos first, and some of the women&#x27;s faces turned bright red after.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Would strongly recommend and I am very picky.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li>but this thing really works!!</li>
            <li>grievances with my own personal appearance includes large pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>If you can stand the treatment, I&#x27;d say it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>thinking using a heavier duty one on my legs before I oil them would be worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product as a object is nice enough.</li>
            <li>Right after I roll it over my face, I feel how my pores open up and every cell of my skin breathes more freely.</li>
            <li>At fisrt, my skin felt a bit sore and kind of dried out, but it was the process of getting to the actual place it is, my skin has changed so much after getting this product, can&#x27;t believe how good it works!</li>
            <li>:) Only issue is not sure how OFTEN to use, so many conflicting suggestions on the internet, Overall very happy with the product,</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this roller along with a good facial cream or serum.</li>
            <li>I use this fr face and it plumps up my skin right away.</li>
            <li>I am in my early 40s, and I just want to prevent sagging and get rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference on my skin pores after the first use.</li>
            <li>At first, I was a bit intimidated by the Derma Roller and was scared to use it that first time.</li>
            <li>and I get a glow (surely form the tiny trauma)</li>
            <li>I also definitely felt like I was getting more out of my skincare products by applying them after using my derma roller.</li>
            <li>-- I just tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li>first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I want to say that this product is well made and the 3 stars is not a reflection of the product&#x27;s construction.</li>
            <li>With all that said I may purchase the 1.0 mm next for a deeper penetration to see if that will work better.</li>
            <li>I have given it 4 stars to start with as the results are not immediately evident.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really liking this!  </li>
            <li>I used it one time exactly as the instructions indicated.  </li>
            <li>It seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li>but I just haven&#x27;t been able to get into the routine of using it regularly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know more in a few months but so far, I really have liked it.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my deeper acne scars, however I recently purchased a 1.5mm from somewhere else because I was told that the deeper needle is more for acne scarring.</li>
            <li>(1) I loved that it came in packaging indicating autoclaving, (2) the multiple needles rolled smoothly across my skin with little to no discomfort,</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use just roll it over the dark spots before bed and watch them fade during time</li>
            <li>I use this with Vitamin C serum and in just few use the result is amazing.</li>
            <li>again, another high recommendation on trying one of these!</li>
            <li>and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li>I use a gentle lotion afterwards</li>
            <li>but it was surprisingly very relaxing.</li>
            <li>1st purchase of one so can&#x27;t really compare to others.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really hurt much during the process and afterward it feels and looks like a sunburn for a day or 2.</li>
            <li>But it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They also went from white to a permanent light red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks that it really work on my acne.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;This is much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to really start seeing the results after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li>I know it doesn&#x27;t look like much</li>
            <li>I must really point out how much evenly toned my skin is on my face.</li>
            <li>The roller doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for me.</li>
            <li>she really has a tool that works at all.</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li>recommended that my skin feels much softer for days.</li>
            <li>I used this roller only once so far as I was instructed that I should not use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used today for the first time and was apprehensive, but the 0.5mm needles were not painful, but did cause the desired agitation to the skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier and highly recommend anyone out there looking for a facial derma roller to get this one and have the same results that I am enjoying!</li>
            <li>My skin is quite smooth and not very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Not only is this tool super gentle</li>
            <li>but then I had to be very careful to keep my face and hands very clean after</li>
            <li>but I have to say I love that it gets the black heads</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something to help with pores, skin blemishes and the problems associated with getting older.  </li>
            <li>A 0.5 mm dermaroller is sufficient for collagen production, but my main goal is to have my skin absorb the serum and cream that I use.</li>
            <li>These measures have always given me a healthy glow and a much younger appearance than my chronological age.</li>
            <li>so you have to have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend adding the derma roller to your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>have high end</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this little roller.  </li>
            <li>and I feel my complexion looks a little better.</li>
            <li>Because new skin cells grow and develop at deeper dermal layers, the foods, liquids, and chemicals you take into your body will have an eventual effect on what you see in the mirror.</li>
            <li>Cannot live without needle rolling.</li>
            <li>Anyway--I love this little gadget!</li>
            <li>I got this neatly packaged product delivered just a short while ago but already like it very much &amp; can feel its effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>The first use was a bit uncomfortable but the second really felt good on the skin.</li>
            <li>It is exactly how you would imagine hundred of tiny needles poking you would feel like.  </li>
            <li>So many other companies selling this similar product at much higher costs, and after comparing, the only difference is cost!</li>
            <li>and it made some of my (flat scars) that are not from acne what appears to be permanently wide and slightly more raised.</li>
            <li>let you know in a few weeks easy instructions</li>
            <li>But I hope to report at a later date some reduction of the lines and perhaps, if I&#x27;m lucky, smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this every other day and while I don&#x27;t see a major difference in pore size I can visibly see that my skin glow a bit more the next morning.</li>
            <li>it did sound a little barbaric.</li>
            <li>brief research on dermarolling showed that I don&#x27;t have to apply any serum afterwards, as the main thing that happens is the new collagen getting created.</li>
            <li>I found that it was clinically proven to help generate new collagen in the skin especially on the face, which was my main goal.</li>
            <li>has clearly diminished.</li>
            <li>but it has hurt my skin as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I will only use in one or twice a month but wholy molly mother of God</li>
            <li>It has worked so well so far</li>
            <li>I used aloe vera and a natural (no chemicals) moisturizer after.</li>
            <li>I have found I actually use it about twice a month and am seeing a real difference.</li>
            <li>So far like it.</li>
            <li>I do not expect complete reversal of my aging process; that would be preposterous.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m 64 years old.</li>
            <li>So far I did not apply any, and getting the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will try far too many things at least once.</li>
            <li>I feel I can use it more often, and it only takes a few minutes each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also strive to take in adequate amounts of water, protein and vitamin C in multiple doses throughout the day as metabolism is a never-ending process (as long as you&#x27;re alive, anyway).</li>
            <li>By using the smaller needles (as recommended), I feel like I am getting just the right degree of puncturing to the skin to allow my creams and serums to penetrate properly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re young with not a lot of damage and just want to take care of some small wrinkling, and dull looking skin, then this will be great for you.</li>
            <li>that was on a clean and little pressure to the face.</li>
            <li>After just a few days I see significant improvement in texture and reduction in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am 57 with decent skin, but using this roller only twice has enhanced my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer and actually look forward to using this little gadget on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I have only used it once so far and would have to return in quite a few weeks to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li>not able to give a better rating as this is long term  process.</li>
            <li>Personally, I try to take in as much organic and locally raised/grown food as I can.</li>
            <li>Originally it was purchased to use on my temples to help grow back hair that had come out wear tight braids.</li>
            <li>My face is not so dry anymore, dark spot vanished and my face is so smooth..</li>
            <li>I sterilize mine after each use with alcohol, rinse it off in hot water, and let it air dry before putting it back into the case...that simple!!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>My experience with this roller is not painful as the needles are not that long but sharp.</li>
            <li>I expected the same, since I have fairly light, sensitive skin, but it only turned slightly pink, as if I had just worked out, and had faded completely within an hour.</li>
            <li>Have only been using for a couple of weeks, but it has helped clear blemishes up without picking at them.  </li>
            <li>only  used once but does seem to work so far like it said</li>
            <li>a bit early to see results from the actual use</li>
            <li>The skin on my tummy that was left thin and crepey from 3 pregnancies feels soft and healthy again.</li>
            <li>I have used the Bodiance Derma Roller 0.5 for just a few weeks, and feel that my skin is looking better with less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>A slight nuisance, but I&#x27;m good at tuning irritating noises out.</li>
            <li>and she reports only occasional mild discomfort on less &amp;#34;padded&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This little machine is really helping my skin to clear up and look healthier.  </li>
            <li>WASTED lots of money and then along comes this little derma roller - works like magic.  </li>
            <li>and after just a few weeks it started completely clearing my very acne-covered face</li>
            <li>I was really interested in trying a derma roller but was a little intimidated.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had much luck with it diminishing my dark spots yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li>I have had dark spots for a while and really wanted to get rid of them</li>
            <li>I took my time and gently held slight even pressure, when I was done my face</li>
            <li>(I normally have mixed dry to normal perfectly clear skin and generally small pores.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It also works great with the prescription acne medication, Differen.</li>
            <li> Yes your skin gets &amp;#34;Rosey&amp;#34; after you prick it a couple thousand times with hundreds of needles, lol.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Works great good quality</li>
            <li> Good feel and great</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> Again, good packaging, so no damage whatsoever in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> but the product is good quality and the delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Feels really good....</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve seen some remarkable changes in my skin and I am thrilled with the results.  </li>
            <li> Again, I was impressed with how quickly my Derma Roller arrived.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I love these!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Great price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> ll skins; but it is amazing the results I have gotten using it with Vitamin C Serum/Hyaluronic Acid and vitamin E....</li>
            <li> literally amazing</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it feels kind of like scratching maybe?</li>
            <li> But in a nice way.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s like having my own mini acupuncture treatment.</li>
            <li> Nice protective case.</li>
            <li> this is the best one I have tried very effective and superior to others I have purchased  before would definitely recommend this is the one to purchase price is right</li>
            <li> saying that&#x27;s the most effective for the face.</li>
            <li> comes in a nice and practical protective â€“ storage case, what makes easy to wash and sanitize the micro roller.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week with moisturizing night cream</li>
            <li> The vitamin C feels really refreshing after rolling.</li>
            <li> I love this gadget.</li>
            <li> but I hit a wall and wasn&#x27;t able to get my skin to continue to improve.</li>
            <li> I love the way my face feels and the way it glows after I do a treatment with the derma roller.</li>
            <li> okay I have read and seen all the hyp about proactive restorative products with an MD Roller....</li>
            <li> , the results after one use was astonishing...</li>
            <li> Needed more instructions for this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve decided to do a multi-entry review, as that&#x27;s the most helpful for me.</li>
            <li> Well, I think I can safely say, this IS it.</li>
            <li> This is also the recommended frequency of use by many experts.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about derma rollers before my purchase.</li>
            <li> I am confident that within 3 to 6 months, I will see more results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After that I tried it on my arm hoping it might serve me better there</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I e-mailed questions to the company.  </li>
            <li> Once a week is enough.&amp;#34; My chin does look better.</li>
            <li> and made my face look better than it has since before puberty!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can see some improvement on some of my scars and my complexion is more even toned.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty good about reading directions and looking them up when need be.</li>
            <li> good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> It is easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> the product is easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for her to use</li>
            <li> I found them to be very gentle and still effective.</li>
            <li> First time: I didn&#x27;t use a numbing cream--I don&#x27;t like that kind of thing.</li>
            <li> squeaky but works fine</li>
            <li> And then maybe my skin is not overly sensitive, as it feels even somewhat pleasant at times.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really made me feel much better about my 53-year-old skin!</li>
            <li> This is nice as it has the stainless steel needles, but I had to upgrade to 1.0 for my face.</li>
            <li> feel cleaner and absorbed more cream.</li>
            <li> and I know that the next morning, my skin will look and feel great.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the smaller size needle.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too cheap or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be ordering for my daughter,sister in-law and a few of my best friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and makes her feel</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m [mumble-mumble] years old with good skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited.  </li>
            <li> But my sister is using this long time ago and her face looks great.</li>
            <li> A bit brisk at first, but think I will love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes.</li>
            <li> use 91% rubbing alcohol from CVS to clean it after each use, soak it and then dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have used a couple of times to reduce pores--not certain that is working--but better for me than using any liquid product</li>
            <li> I am a 59 years old and my skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to using it, it feels so good</li>
            <li> Now--I have always had good skin and looked 10 years younger than what I am anyway.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works fast, but there&#x27;s no pain when rolling even if I apply pressure. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as far as for beauty use.... well, It was nice on my face</li>
            <li> actually it feels kinda good</li>
            <li> There is a mild prickly sensation, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li> I had already achieved tremendous results using retinol and vitamin C</li>
            <li> I am HOOKED than you and thank you for the lovely follow up email with tips and instructions love your personal touch.</li>
            <li> I watched a bunch of YouTube videos first, and some of the women&#x27;s faces turned bright red after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Would strongly recommend and I am very picky.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li> but this thing really works!!</li>
            <li> grievances with my own personal appearance includes large pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> If you can stand the treatment, I&#x27;d say it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> thinking using a heavier duty one on my legs before I oil them would be worth a shot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product as a object is nice enough.</li>
            <li> Right after I roll it over my face, I feel how my pores open up and every cell of my skin breathes more freely.</li>
            <li> At fisrt, my skin felt a bit sore and kind of dried out, but it was the process of getting to the actual place it is, my skin has changed so much after getting this product, can&#x27;t believe how good it works!</li>
            <li> :) Only issue is not sure how OFTEN to use, so many conflicting suggestions on the internet, Overall very happy with the product,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this roller along with a good facial cream or serum.</li>
            <li> I use this fr face and it plumps up my skin right away.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 40s, and I just want to prevent sagging and get rid of fine lines.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference on my skin pores after the first use.</li>
            <li> At first, I was a bit intimidated by the Derma Roller and was scared to use it that first time.</li>
            <li> and I get a glow (surely form the tiny trauma)</li>
            <li> I also definitely felt like I was getting more out of my skincare products by applying them after using my derma roller.</li>
            <li> -- I just tried this for the first time.</li>
            <li> first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I want to say that this product is well made and the 3 stars is not a reflection of the product&#x27;s construction.</li>
            <li> With all that said I may purchase the 1.0 mm next for a deeper penetration to see if that will work better.</li>
            <li> I have given it 4 stars to start with as the results are not immediately evident.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this!  </li>
            <li> I used it one time exactly as the instructions indicated.  </li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well</li>
            <li> but I just haven&#x27;t been able to get into the routine of using it regularly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know more in a few months but so far, I really have liked it.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my deeper acne scars, however I recently purchased a 1.5mm from somewhere else because I was told that the deeper needle is more for acne scarring.</li>
            <li> (1) I loved that it came in packaging indicating autoclaving, (2) the multiple needles rolled smoothly across my skin with little to no discomfort,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to use just roll it over the dark spots before bed and watch them fade during time</li>
            <li> I use this with Vitamin C serum and in just few use the result is amazing.</li>
            <li> again, another high recommendation on trying one of these!</li>
            <li> and it really makes a difference.  </li>
            <li> I use a gentle lotion afterwards</li>
            <li> but it was surprisingly very relaxing.</li>
            <li> 1st purchase of one so can&#x27;t really compare to others.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really hurt much during the process and afterward it feels and looks like a sunburn for a day or 2.</li>
            <li> But it really doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They also went from white to a permanent light red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks that it really work on my acne.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to really start seeing the results after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t look like much</li>
            <li> I must really point out how much evenly toned my skin is on my face.</li>
            <li> The roller doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for me.</li>
            <li> she really has a tool that works at all.</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t really need it</li>
            <li> recommended that my skin feels much softer for days.</li>
            <li> I used this roller only once so far as I was instructed that I should not use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used today for the first time and was apprehensive, but the 0.5mm needles were not painful, but did cause the desired agitation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier and highly recommend anyone out there looking for a facial derma roller to get this one and have the same results that I am enjoying!</li>
            <li> My skin is quite smooth and not very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Not only is this tool super gentle</li>
            <li> but then I had to be very careful to keep my face and hands very clean after</li>
            <li> but I have to say I love that it gets the black heads</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to help with pores, skin blemishes and the problems associated with getting older.  </li>
            <li> A 0.5 mm dermaroller is sufficient for collagen production, but my main goal is to have my skin absorb the serum and cream that I use.</li>
            <li> These measures have always given me a healthy glow and a much younger appearance than my chronological age.</li>
            <li> so you have to have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend adding the derma roller to your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> have high end</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this little roller.  </li>
            <li> and I feel my complexion looks a little better.</li>
            <li> Because new skin cells grow and develop at deeper dermal layers, the foods, liquids, and chemicals you take into your body will have an eventual effect on what you see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without needle rolling.</li>
            <li> Anyway--I love this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I got this neatly packaged product delivered just a short while ago but already like it very much &amp; can feel its effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> The first use was a bit uncomfortable but the second really felt good on the skin.</li>
            <li> It is exactly how you would imagine hundred of tiny needles poking you would feel like.  </li>
            <li> So many other companies selling this similar product at much higher costs, and after comparing, the only difference is cost!</li>
            <li> and it made some of my (flat scars) that are not from acne what appears to be permanently wide and slightly more raised.</li>
            <li> let you know in a few weeks easy instructions</li>
            <li> But I hope to report at a later date some reduction of the lines and perhaps, if I&#x27;m lucky, smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and while I don&#x27;t see a major difference in pore size I can visibly see that my skin glow a bit more the next morning.</li>
            <li> it did sound a little barbaric.</li>
            <li> brief research on dermarolling showed that I don&#x27;t have to apply any serum afterwards, as the main thing that happens is the new collagen getting created.</li>
            <li> I found that it was clinically proven to help generate new collagen in the skin especially on the face, which was my main goal.</li>
            <li> has clearly diminished.</li>
            <li> but it has hurt my skin as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I will only use in one or twice a month but wholy molly mother of God</li>
            <li> It has worked so well so far</li>
            <li> I used aloe vera and a natural (no chemicals) moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> I have found I actually use it about twice a month and am seeing a real difference.</li>
            <li> So far like it.</li>
            <li> I do not expect complete reversal of my aging process; that would be preposterous.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m 64 years old.</li>
            <li> So far I did not apply any, and getting the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will try far too many things at least once.</li>
            <li> I feel I can use it more often, and it only takes a few minutes each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also strive to take in adequate amounts of water, protein and vitamin C in multiple doses throughout the day as metabolism is a never-ending process (as long as you&#x27;re alive, anyway).</li>
            <li> By using the smaller needles (as recommended), I feel like I am getting just the right degree of puncturing to the skin to allow my creams and serums to penetrate properly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re young with not a lot of damage and just want to take care of some small wrinkling, and dull looking skin, then this will be great for you.</li>
            <li> that was on a clean and little pressure to the face.</li>
            <li> After just a few days I see significant improvement in texture and reduction in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 57 with decent skin, but using this roller only twice has enhanced my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer and actually look forward to using this little gadget on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once so far and would have to return in quite a few weeks to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li> not able to give a better rating as this is long term  process.</li>
            <li> Personally, I try to take in as much organic and locally raised/grown food as I can.</li>
            <li> Originally it was purchased to use on my temples to help grow back hair that had come out wear tight braids.</li>
            <li> My face is not so dry anymore, dark spot vanished and my face is so smooth..</li>
            <li> I sterilize mine after each use with alcohol, rinse it off in hot water, and let it air dry before putting it back into the case...that simple!!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> My experience with this roller is not painful as the needles are not that long but sharp.</li>
            <li> I expected the same, since I have fairly light, sensitive skin, but it only turned slightly pink, as if I had just worked out, and had faded completely within an hour.</li>
            <li> Have only been using for a couple of weeks, but it has helped clear blemishes up without picking at them.  </li>
            <li> only  used once but does seem to work so far like it said</li>
            <li> a bit early to see results from the actual use</li>
            <li> The skin on my tummy that was left thin and crepey from 3 pregnancies feels soft and healthy again.</li>
            <li> I have used the Bodiance Derma Roller 0.5 for just a few weeks, and feel that my skin is looking better with less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> A slight nuisance, but I&#x27;m good at tuning irritating noises out.</li>
            <li> and she reports only occasional mild discomfort on less &amp;#34;padded&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This little machine is really helping my skin to clear up and look healthier.  </li>
            <li> WASTED lots of money and then along comes this little derma roller - works like magic.  </li>
            <li> and after just a few weeks it started completely clearing my very acne-covered face</li>
            <li> I was really interested in trying a derma roller but was a little intimidated.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had much luck with it diminishing my dark spots yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots for a while and really wanted to get rid of them</li>
            <li> I took my time and gently held slight even pressure, when I was done my face</li>
            <li> (I normally have mixed dry to normal perfectly clear skin and generally small pores.</li>
            <li> However--these new compliments can only be attributed to this little device.</li>
            <li> First of all it is up to me how hard to press when I roll.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a former way over-skilled, way over-educated medical paraprofessional, I tend to treat beauty and beauty products as a hobby almost, and so I&#x27;m kind of frustrated that I can&#x27;t get this to work for me.</li>
            <li> However, I used on my upper cheek (not directly under my eye, but on my cheek bone) and it didn&#x27;t seem that I over did it, but it created a scar that I can now not get rid of.  </li>
            <li> Since evidence of increased collagen production does take time (usually 1-4 weeks, depending on general health, age, nutrition, etc.), further review and commentary will be noted at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And my face looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun too long.</li>
            <li> Less blotchiness, fewer clogged pores, and generally a smoother texture.  </li>
            <li> and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> She is also using with a vitamin c serum and only says her skin gets dry and tight because of it.</li>
            <li> I did not because it only felt like a slight sunburn anyway.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been such a short time, and my skin is getting firmer, small wrinkles are disappearing, as well as pores around my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this derma roller for a little while, and I don&#x27;t know what to think yet.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t see with the naked eye, I used that sucker at least three times a week and am always surprised at the gunk I get out of my pores, it&#x27;s gross but it works, the cheeks are harder because of the fat</li>
            <li> Really do not like this.</li>
            <li> Looking younger already in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see if this product can lessen these effects.</li>
            <li> What I like is it does not cost hundreds of dollars, which I have spent and nothing ever worked.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , skin is fairly tough, and I live in a dry to the bone climate.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like I am and have a hard time picking up new habits like this, probably a waste of money.  </li>

            <li> some say it hurts a little, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it.</li>

            <li> This is not a product for the faint of heart.  Even when I&#x27;m pressing lightly, I feel it is painful and a bit unnerving.  It is exactly how you would imagine hundred of tiny needles poking you would feel like.  That said, I&#x27;ve seen some remarkable changes in my skin and I am thrilled with the results.  Less blotchiness, fewer clogged pores, and generally a smoother texture.  If you can stand the treatment, I&#x27;d say it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Great tool! I don&#x27;t think it hurts at all. Actually, I like the way it feels &amp; the way my skin has improved since using it! Quality product!</li>
            <li> This is nice as it has the stainless steel needles, but I had to upgrade to 1.0 for my face. I&#x27;m 49 with lots of sun damage. If you&#x27;re young with not a lot of damage and just want to take care of some small wrinkling, and dull looking skin, then this will be great for you. I recommend using a lotion with any oil you like while rollng, such as Argan, Emu, Coconut, and some Viiman C oil to put on when you&#x27;re finished. The vitamin C feels really refreshing after rolling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a matter of getting used to. I noticed a difference on my skin pores after the first use. It hurts a little while you are doing it. so you have to have a high pain tolerance. Afterwards I use Vit. E oil for faster healing. I love this gadget.</li>
            <li> feel cleaner and absorbed more cream.</li>
            <li> Works great, I have seen a difference in  my skin, happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of money won&#x27;t do anything bad product don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Seems to work fairly well.</li>
            <li> This product is great and has already made a difference in the appearance of my skin. I had already achieved tremendous results using retinol and vitamin C but I hit a wall and wasn&#x27;t able to get my skin to continue to improve. This definitely did the trick. Within a week others were commenting on my skins appearance. I am a 59 years old and my skin looks amazing. Yeah!!!</li>
            <li> I believe this product made my forehead wrinkles deeper.</li>
            <li> Again, I was impressed with how quickly my Derma Roller arrived. Again, good packaging, so no damage whatsoever in the product. At first, I was a bit intimidated by the Derma Roller and was scared to use it that first time. Let&#x27;s face it...it did sound a little barbaric. But, once I did, I was hooked. By using the smaller needles (as recommended), I feel like I am getting just the right degree of puncturing to the skin to allow my creams and serums to penetrate properly. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and I can sit and watch television while using it. I sterilize mine after each use with alcohol, rinse it off in hot water, and let it air dry before putting it back into the case...that simple!!&lt;br /&gt;Once again, another high recommendation on trying one of these!</li>
            <li> I love these!  I just sit around watching the trash t.v. And roll away, feels good too!</li>
            <li> Works great good quality</li>
            <li> Really do not like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I was totally freaked out at the thought of poking my face with a bunch of needles, but once I finally worked up the nerve to try it, I can tell you, I&#x27;m hooked. I do it twice a week, usually at night after a shower. It doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it feels kind of like scratching maybe? But in a nice way. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos first, and some of the women&#x27;s faces turned bright red after. I expected the same, since I have fairly light, sensitive skin, but it only turned slightly pink, as if I had just worked out, and had faded completely within an hour. After rolling, I apply my serums and creams and then seal it all off with either a heavy duty moisturizer or a nighttime mask (there&#x27;s one I like called a water sleeping mask or something like that, they sell it at target). I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 months now, and my skin looks great. Pores are definitely smaller, I have only had one zit, and I feel like my skin is glowing. I actually look forward to using it, it feels so good and I know that the next morning, my skin will look and feel great. I haven&#x27;t had much luck with it diminishing my dark spots yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> I love this little roller.  There is a mild prickly sensation, but not bad at all.  After using the derma roller, I put on my vitamin C, hydraulic acid serum and it really makes a difference.  I am 57 with decent skin, but using this roller only twice has enhanced my skin.  I highly recommend adding the derma roller to your skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I have used the Bodiance Derma Roller 0.5 for just a few weeks, and feel that my skin is looking better with less wrinkles.  It is easy to use and you don&#x27;t have to make puncture wounds on your face to get results.  I love the way my face feels and the way it glows after I do a treatment with the derma roller.</li>
            <li> i returned this item.</li>
            <li> Meets my expectations for the price.  I usually do it 3 times a week, apply the OZ Naturals serum and Ponds moisturizer after.</li>
            <li> Every now and then vanity sucks me down the rabbit hole of these of things.  I have no idea if it works, but I like using it to stimulate the surface of my skin.  I use a gentle lotion afterwards and I get a glow (surely form the tiny trauma) but it has hurt my skin as far as I can tell.  I will say people have commented on my skin looking good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thinking using a heavier duty one on my legs before I oil them would be worth a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 62, skin is fairly tough, and I live in a dry to the bone climate.  I will try far too many things at least once.</li>
            <li> Awful.  I was so excited.  However, I used on my upper cheek (not directly under my eye, but on my cheek bone) and it didn&#x27;t seem that I over did it, but it created a scar that I can now not get rid of.  Instead of helping, it created a dark spot!</li>
            <li> okay I have read and seen all the hyp about proactive restorative products with an MD Roller....however their price was astranomical !&lt;br /&gt;so whats a girl to do ...look on Amazon...I did a great deal of reseach and took the plunge and purches this erma roller tool 0.5!&lt;br /&gt;I have high end PCA products so I had planned to continue using them.  got it yesterday in the mail. went home cleansed, toned, and derma rolled both direcrections felt a bit prickley, but now painful I took my time and gently held slight even pressure, when I was done my face was a tad read and felt tingly...I put my Vit. C serum on and my moisturizer, and eye cream about an hour later I looked in the mirror and I was amazed, speachless, the results after one use was astonishing...cant wait to see the results in 3 to 5 months.  you must sanitze your personal roll after each use.  I will only use in one or twice a month but wholy molly mother of God this is drastic improvements at a fraction of the cost.  I am HOOKED than you and thank you for the lovely follow up email with tips and instructions love your personal touch.</li>
            <li> Needed more instructions for this item.</li>
            <li> I got this neatly packaged product delivered just a short while ago but already like it very much &amp; can feel its effect on my skin. It&#x60;s like having my own mini acupuncture treatment. Right after I roll it over my face, I feel how my pores open up and every cell of my skin breathes more freely. There is a bit of this tingling after-effect on my skin, which I like a lot. Sometimes after getting chemical facial treatments, I would feel the same way - but in this case, I know - it&#x60;s just the roller, no chemicals involved. (: Will definitely continue using it. Already see the results - the texture and tone of my skin visibly improved.</li>
            <li> this is the best one I have tried very effective and superior to others I have purchased  before would definitely recommend this is the one to purchase price is right</li>
            <li> I was really interested in trying a derma roller but was a little intimidated. Not only is this tool super gentle but it was surprisingly very relaxing. I noticed an improvement in my skin after about a week. I also definitely felt like I was getting more out of my skincare products by applying them after using my derma roller.</li>
            <li> 1st purchase of one so can&#x27;t really compare to others. It&#x27;s well made and easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t really hurt much during the process and afterward it feels and looks like a sunburn for a day or 2. I am seeing results.:) Only issue is not sure how OFTEN to use, so many conflicting suggestions on the internet, Overall very happy with the product,</li>
            <li> no change, does not preform for me as stated on the box, had some bad breaking of the skin and had to stop &amp;  that was on a clean and little pressure to the face. Maybe different for others.</li>
            <li> This is definitely seeming to do something to my face!! It has worked so well so far and I will definitely be purchasing another one in a couple months!!! This is fantastic for your skin and I would definitely suggest for people to try this product!!! I use this almost every day once a day and it seems to continue to look nicer and nicer!! Definitely recommend this!!</li>
            <li> not able to give a better rating as this is long term  process. the product is easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this derma roller for a little while, and I don&#x27;t know what to think yet.  But I read some glowing reviews, and I&#x27;m giving it a try.  It&#x27;s almost painless and not a lot of trouble to use.  I&#x27;m hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> Just started for acne scarring. Will continue each week.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything about this process, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After one week of using it every other day,&lt;br /&gt;I can see a noticeable improvement in the texture of my face and the dark spots are disappearing! I chose the smaller (.5 mm) needles&lt;br /&gt;and I found them to be very gentle and still effective. Sometimes I use my facial serum afterwords sometimes I don&#x27;t. Still works either way. I&#x27;m happy with the smaller size needle. I feel I can use it more often, and it only takes a few minutes each time.&lt;br /&gt;Happy, Happy.</li>
            <li> 10/11/14 -- I just tried this for the first time. I&#x27;ve decided to do a multi-entry review, as that&#x27;s the most helpful for me. I got the 0.5 needles after I saw a video from a spa saying that&#x27;s the most effective for the face. So...here goes... (I&#x27;m [mumble-mumble] years old with good skin. A bit of sagging I don&#x27;t like and a couple of lines beside my mouth that I watch like a hawk. Those lines and the neck will be the thing to keep an eye on.)  First time: I didn&#x27;t use a numbing cream--I don&#x27;t like that kind of thing. But it really doesn&#x27;t hurt. It stings a little, like a sunburn. And my face looks like I&#x27;ve been in the sun too long. I used aloe vera and a natural (no chemicals) moisturizer after. I&#x27;ve convinced myself I look 10 years younger...but I wouldn&#x27;t take my word for it!  I&#x27;ll post again as this process goes on.  02/24/15 -- I apologize. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been 4 months! Anyway--I love this little gadget! I have found I actually use it about twice a month and am seeing a real difference. I recently posted a photo to FB--and one woman said I look younger than when she knew me 20 years ago! I&#x27;ve been told by others that I can &amp;#34;pass&amp;#34; for 25-30 years younger than I am.  Now--I have always had good skin and looked 10 years younger than what I am anyway. However--these new compliments can only be attributed to this little device. I haven&#x27;t done anything else different. The little lines I was focused on in Oct. are much finer and even the sagging (HATE that word!) has clearly diminished. So I am solidly a fan!  (I have added a cold-roller to my routine after I use this. It eliminates any redness and stinging, if I&#x27;ve been a little over-zealous.)  05/28/15 -- Well, I think I can safely say, this IS it. I am a satisfied customer and actually look forward to using this little gadget on a regular basis. I&#x27;m pretty amazed!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something to help with pores, skin blemishes and the problems associated with getting older.  WASTED lots of money and then along comes this little derma roller - works like magic.  After just a few days I see significant improvement in texture and reduction in the puffiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. So many other companies selling this similar product at much higher costs, and after comparing, the only difference is cost!</li>
            <li> I had previously owned a longer microneedle (1.5) which was very painful when used. This derma roller has made my pores appear  less visible and does not cause any discomfort  when used on my face. It&#x27;s very well made and easy to handle. I simply rinse it off when done using it , roll it in alcohol to sterilize  and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have received this derma roller a few days before Christmas. I was instructed to use 91% alcohol before and after  I use this product, so I went and bought one bottle from Wal Mart first thing in the morning.  I have also done a lot of research and watched a number of YouTube videos before I used this roller on my face. A 0.5 mm dermaroller is sufficient for collagen production, but my main goal is to have my skin absorb the serum and cream that I use. My experience with this roller is not painful as the needles are not that long but sharp. It gives a tingling sensation which is quite tolerable. I ran the roller under tap water and let it stay in alcohol for 30 minutes after using it. I also applied my Vitamin C serum on my skin immediately. My skin is quite smooth and not very sensitive. I am in my early 40s, and I just want to prevent sagging and get rid of fine lines. I used this roller only once so far as I was instructed that I should not use it more than once a week. This is also the recommended frequency of use by many experts. After one use, I felt like my skin was glowing.  I highly recommend this roller along with a good facial cream or serum.</li>
            <li> Love it! This 0.5 derma roller helps prep my face before I use a 0.7 derma roller (different seller) which was unused for a couple of months. Good feel and great before I apply my facial cream. Thanks</li>
            <li> Have used this for 2 weeks, see no difference at all.</li>
            <li> only  used once but does seem to work so far like it said</li>
            <li> good and fast delivery</li>
            <li> a bit early to see results from the actual use but the product is good quality and the delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> Looking younger already in just a few weeks. Great price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This roller worked wonders on my pores. Should have  bought two!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone. I use this with Vitamin C serum and in just few use the result is amazing. My face is not so dry anymore, dark spot vanished and my face is so smooth.. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if it works fast, but there&#x27;s no pain when rolling even if I apply pressure. :)</li>
            <li> So far like it. The first use was a bit uncomfortable but the second really felt good on the skin. Will be using it again.</li>
            <li> At fisrt, my skin felt a bit sore and kind of dried out, but it was the process of getting to the actual place it is, my skin has changed so much after getting this product, can&#x27;t believe how good it works! 100% recommended..</li>
            <li> So far so good! I&#x27;ve been seeing improvements, I&#x27;ve had it for almost a month now..it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 3 weeks now, 1-2 times per week. I&#x27;ve noticed an improvement in skin tone and elasticity. The skin on my tummy that was left thin and crepey from 3 pregnancies feels soft and healthy again. It also works great with the prescription acne medication, Differen.</li>
            <li> First of all, I want to say that this product is well made and the 3 stars is not a reflection of the product&#x27;s construction. However, I have been using it for a bit and have not seen any results. Originally it was purchased to use on my temples to help grow back hair that had come out wear tight braids. I will say that once you get use to using it the discomfort is very minimal. With all that said I may purchase the 1.0 mm next for a deeper penetration to see if that will work better.</li>
            <li> I will continue to review the efficacy of this product over time. I have given it 4 stars to start with as the results are not immediately evident. Since evidence of increased collagen production does take time (usually 1-4 weeks, depending on general health, age, nutrition, etc.), further review and commentary will be noted at a later date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note to readers. Health, wellness, and perceptual beauty of the skin does start with nutrition. Because new skin cells grow and develop at deeper dermal layers, the foods, liquids, and chemicals you take into your body will have an eventual effect on what you see in the mirror. Personally, I try to take in as much organic and locally raised/grown food as I can. I eat at least 5 cups of leafy greens everyday, as well as a variety of multi-colored fruits and vegetables. I also strive to take in adequate amounts of water, protein and vitamin C in multiple doses throughout the day as metabolism is a never-ending process (as long as you&#x27;re alive, anyway). I also practice stress management, exercise regularly, and treat myself to 7-9 hours of sleep each day. These measures have always given me a healthy glow and a much younger appearance than my chronological age. However, aging being what it is has taken some toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grievances with my own personal appearance includes large pores and fine lines. I&#x27;m curious to see if this product can lessen these effects. I do not expect complete reversal of my aging process; that would be preposterous. But I hope to report at a later date some reduction of the lines and perhaps, if I&#x27;m lucky, smaller pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes on the product: (1) I loved that it came in packaging indicating autoclaving, (2) the multiple needles rolled smoothly across my skin with little to no discomfort, (3) I did see beads of blood on the bridge of my nose, so be wary of how hard you press this into the skin, (4) after the initial application, my skin looked as if it were sunburned (I applied vitamin C serum, then vitamin E oil afterwards), and (5) the roller on my unit squeaks when being rolled. A slight nuisance, but I&#x27;m good at tuning irritating noises out. Regardless, designers/manufacturers may want to re-address this issue.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews about derma rollers before my purchase. As soon as I got the product, I used it that night. I did see a difference after using it. I am confident that within 3 to 6 months, I will see more results. Use a numbing cream if needed. I did not because it only felt like a slight sunburn anyway. This process allows the skin care products to penetrate your skin deeper. I&#x27;m impressed already.  What I like is it does not cost hundreds of dollars, which I have spent and nothing ever worked.&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as I continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about this product....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product as a object is nice enough. It doesn&#x27;t feel too cheap or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as for beauty use.... well, It was nice on my face but then I had to be very careful to keep my face and hands very clean after or I&#x27;d get whiteheads. (I normally have mixed dry to normal perfectly clear skin and generally small pores. I was just hoping for a tiny boost in tone and elasticity now that I&#x27;m nearing my 30&#x27;s.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that I tried it on my arm hoping it might serve me better there and it made some of my (flat scars) that are not from acne what appears to be permanently wide and slightly more raised. They also went from white to a permanent light red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not being over zealous with the thing either. :/ I&#x27;m pretty good about reading directions and looking them up when need be. I&#x27;m a former way over-skilled, way over-educated medical paraprofessional, I tend to treat beauty and beauty products as a hobby almost, and so I&#x27;m kind of frustrated that I can&#x27;t get this to work for me.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first; and I gotta imagine it&#x27;s not for ll skins; but it is amazing the results I have gotten using it with Vitamin C Serum/Hyaluronic Acid and vitamin E.... twice a week for a month...literally amazing and I&#x27;m 64 years old.</li>
            <li> I have used the roller twice and I&#x27;m glad I e-mailed questions to the company.  They are a work in progress so if you have questions, ASK. It doesn&#x27;t hurt but does prick. I&#x27;ve been told by the company, &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t over-do it. Once a week is enough.&amp;#34; My chin does look better. It had lots of bumps from teen pimples. It IS hard to be patient &amp; not over-do-it. We are all wanting instant results. So this is a test in patience &amp; trusting the roller to do its thing. I&#x27;ll know more in a few months but so far, I really have liked it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this a month and notices no improvement in her skin.  She is also using with a vitamin c serum and only says her skin gets dry and tight because of it.</li>
            <li> I was holding back on rating this untill I used it for a while.  That being said I dont think I notice a difference in my skin.  If I do it is very small and not worth raving over.  Yes your skin gets &amp;#34;Rosey&amp;#34; after you prick it a couple thousand times with hundreds of needles, lol.  But I dont think that it has helped with moisturizing my skin and my pores are NO different.  Hey everyone is different for the $20. go for it and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> squeaky but works fine</li>
            <li> I saw dermaroller services offered at a spa. It was expensive, over $100 per visit. So I decided to see if I could do it myself at home. I have this roller for a few weeks now and use it 2-3 time a week. It&#x27;s been such a short time, and my skin is getting firmer, small wrinkles are disappearing, as well as pores around my nose. Looks like it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brief research on dermarolling showed that I don&#x27;t have to apply any serum afterwards, as the main thing that happens is the new collagen getting created. I&#x27;ll experiment with and without using serums. So far I did not apply any, and getting the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 91% rubbing alcohol from CVS to clean it after each use, soak it and then dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot - some say it hurts a little, but I haven&#x27;t noticed it. First of all it is up to me how hard to press when I roll. And then maybe my skin is not overly sensitive, as it feels even somewhat pleasant at times.</li>
            <li> I bought this to work on my cowl marks between my eyebrows knowing the results from the derma roller would take some time, but I didn&#x27;t know how I would feel about the pore cleaning tool but I have to say I love that it gets the black heads you can&#x27;t see with the naked eye, I used that sucker at least three times a week and am always surprised at the gunk I get out of my pores, it&#x27;s gross but it works, the cheeks are harder because of the fat but I rubbed it over my cheeks and got tons of gunk out... Highly recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> It looks that it really work on my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to use it! But my sister is using this long time ago and her face looks great. I&#x27;ll do the same and I &#x27;ll see if this work for me too.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is much more than I expected. Very good product!!!!!!! Would strongly recommend and I am very picky.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this just a couple days and my skin is glowing. Feels really good....Its like a mini spa treatment /massage.Will be ordering for my daughter,sister in-law and a few of my best friends.Should get one for my boyfriend also before he steals mine.</li>
            <li> Got this about a week after ordering. Nice protective case. I&#x27;ve only used today for the first time and was apprehensive, but the 0.5mm needles were not painful, but did cause the desired agitation to the skin. I can&#x27;t wait to really start seeing the results after I&#x27;ve used it awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get used to the Derma Roller...it is painful on the face.  Not sure if I have to use a numbing cream with this.  I saw a video on YouTube and the woman was practically ripping her face off with it (using numbing cream).  Will keep trying!</li>
            <li> I had been doing some research online for several weeks looking for a something similar that I saw in a recent visit to a spa. I found derma rollers were probably the direction I want to go. After looking at several brands and styles and comparing them I chose the Bodiance derma roller micro needle roller. I found that it was clinically proven to help generate new collagen in the skin especially on the face, which was my main goal. I purchased it and used it as directed and in a matter of weeks there was a noticeable reduction of my wrinkles and age spots. I couldn&#x27;t be happier and highly recommend anyone out there looking for a facial derma roller to get this one and have the same results that I am enjoying!</li>
            <li> I got Micro needle roller a week ago.&lt;br /&gt;This comes in a nice and practical protective â€“ storage case, what makes easy to wash and sanitize the micro roller.&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a week with moisturizing night cream I observed much smaller pores and wrinkles reduction. I donâ€™t know how it works, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;  I would highly recommend this product.  Just follow the cleaning procedures</li>
            <li> have used a couple of times to reduce pores--not certain that is working--but better for me than using any liquid product</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few weeks, no positive result whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Doesntb hurt at all. Been using for one month but can&#x27;t tell that it is working at all either</li>
            <li> Very pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I used a couple of times but I need to learn no to press so hard. It will work with time</li>
            <li> I think the needles are a little dull according to how i am told they are supposed to feel. I have only used it once so far and would have to return in quite a few weeks to give an accurate review.</li>
            <li> I use this fr face and it plumps up my skin right away. Cannot live without needle rolling.</li>
            <li> I know it doesn&#x27;t look like much but this thing really works!! I use it every night (or every other night) and after just a few weeks it started completely clearing my very acne-covered face (it even got to the deep scars after a while!) and made my face look better than it has since before puberty!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you get this you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> This little machine is really helping my skin to clear up and look healthier.  I&#x27;ve been using it for five weeks now and it&#x27;s really made me feel much better about my 53-year-old skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really liking this!  Have only been using for a couple of weeks, but it has helped clear blemishes up without picking at them.  Will have to see what it does for my forehead wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Works Great! I can see some improvement on some of my scars and my complexion is more even toned. I must really point out how much evenly toned my skin is on my face. This doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for my deeper acne scars, however I recently purchased a 1.5mm from somewhere else because I was told that the deeper needle is more for acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I used it one time exactly as the instructions indicated.  That was the only &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; think I did.  That day I got a horrible burning sensation on my face, mainly around my eyes and I started peeling slightly.  never used again and problem has not reoccurred.</li>
            <li> I should have just bought the pore cleaner for a few dollars.  That&#x27;s great. The roller doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing much for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter who suffers with cystic acne. She has been using the device for just a couple weeks and is already seeing skin improvement. It&#x27;s easy for her to use and she reports only occasional mild discomfort on less &amp;#34;padded&amp;#34; areas on her face (forehead). It&#x27;s easy to keep clean and makes her feel she really has a tool that works at all.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day and while I don&#x27;t see a major difference in pore size I can visibly see that my skin glow a bit more the next morning.</li>
            <li> Only used twice no opinion yet used with E-Mart numbing cream but you don&#x27;t really need it actually it feels kinda good let you know in a few weeks easy instructions</li>
            <li> A bit brisk at first, but think I will love it.</li>
            <li> used as directed saw nothing except a very red skin every time no change in skin</li>
            <li> It seems to work pretty well but I just haven&#x27;t been able to get into the routine of using it regularly.  If you&#x27;re like I am and have a hard time picking up new habits like this, probably a waste of money.  However, I do notice when I use it in addition to the acid recommended that my skin feels much softer for days.</li>
            <li> I have had dark spots for a while and really wanted to get rid of them and this actually works&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use just roll it over the dark spots before bed and watch them fade during time</li>
            <li> This...is just as weird as it looks. I&#x27;m not sure about it. It was too uncomfortable for me to use more than a couple of nights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks. I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes. I am still hopeful. It does sting a bit after using the roller, but not too bad. I use it with a vitamin c serum and I feel my complexion looks a little better.</li>
