            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for two days, four applications, amazing results!</li>
            <li>It had great reviews, and the price told me that this stuff must be made well with good ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful how much better my tush looks and feels.</li>
            <li>BEST MOST AMAZING STUFF EVER.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>I read all these reviews and thought to myself &amp;#34;well, good that it worked for them, but it probably won&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>this was from the good exfoliation the lotion provides.  </li>
            <li>I put a good amount of the product on my hands and rubbed it on my rear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>Works really good.</li>
            <li>but I had a good feeling about this one, so I then purchased the Butt Acne Clearing lotion</li>
            <li>This stuff works really good.</li>
            <li>This product works so good</li>
            <li>Good to know before hand.</li>

            <li>Super impressed with this product!</li>
            <li>I feel more confident and so happy!</li>
            <li>so she sweats a great deal and has had acne problems for many years.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great anyway:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for about three weeks now, right before bed each night, and it has worked marvelously.</li>

            <li>this stuff is amazing truly.</li>
            <li>The lotion came and with a couple of days there was a noticeable difference, and after a week, the difference was amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>This is amazing.</li>
            <li>An amazing product it worked wonders</li>
            <li>This product is AMAZING.    </li>
            <li>this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked until I found this amazing lotion.</li>
            <li>OMG -- srsly -- this stuff works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It may not work for everyone but for me, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>The transformation has been amazing</li>
            <li>now been 3,5 weeks, and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>This is absolutely one of the best cosmetic products I&#x27;ve ever used (along with Cetaphil).  </li>
            <li>It works honestly</li>
            <li>Honestly.</li>
            <li>but it also softens the skin, a benefit I wasn&#x27;t really expecting but am very happy about.</li>
            <li>But hey, nice problem to have I guess...</li>
            <li>I have tried popular acne medications, seen a dermatologist and they still kept showing up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for the longest for an affordable but effective product and boy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 and eat a fairly balanced diet consisting of mostly fruits</li>
            <li>im so happy to have this lotion i want to buy one more bottle :)</li>
            <li>I have been searching for something that honestly takes away AND prevents breakouts.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence about spending 30-plus dollars on a lotion that can cure acne on your buttocks (believe me, I was), I can honestly say, you needn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li>but I have been diligent and make sure I don&#x27;t skip a day, and I am very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and feels great.</li>
            <li>it has a light pleasant smell, and</li>
            <li>Product arrive extremely quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>Love love this product!</li>
            <li>Now I can feel more confident in myself!</li>
            <li>:) Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>After two weeks of using this wonderful product, my butt is clearer (albeit the remaining blemish from previous breakouts) and beautifully softer.</li>
            <li>Ok so I will give my honest review of this product.</li>
            <li>Best acne product by far.</li>
            <li>cream must be magic, it is amazing.</li>
            <li>covered).&lt;br /&gt;It is a true lifesaver!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using the product and it seems to be working very quickly!</li>
            <li>I would not sit for 2 hrs after each application, thinking that if the lotion absorbs better, it would be more effective and work faster.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m so happy with the results definitely going to keep getting this love it!!</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews but this lotion is incredible.</li>
            <li>Great product with consistent use.</li>
            <li>First time reviewing anything, I must say this stuff works great.</li>
            <li>I cleared up quickly, which is surprising because I&#x27;ve used sulphur products for face acne and didn&#x27;t get any</li>
            <li>no nasty smell easy and effective.</li>
            <li>better then anything else I have tried</li>
            <li>Love the lotion.</li>
            <li>(maybe once I get in better shape).</li>
            <li>After doing some more research, again, I came across this product.  </li>
            <li>I looked up &#x27;butt&#x27; and &#x27;acne&#x27; in Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Sure, I chuckled at the name, but I just said might as well try it out.  </li>
            <li>As I am incredibly allergic to mosquitoes, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So, okay.</li>
            <li>I can say is that I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>okay, is this a joke?&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll get one or two bumps every now</li>
            <li>and then if I skip a day or something, but it&#x27;s SO much better than what I had before.</li>
            <li>I am glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very simple and seems to do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, so it is not fully cleared but it has improved GREATLY!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure once I run out.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>the stuff is magic</li>
            <li>I have not had any more breakouts &amp; it has been a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to try the Butt Acne clearing lotion because I have tried so many products and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>Have struggled with acne for many years and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>From then on, it just kept getting better and</li>
            <li>Now it is finally MUCH better.    </li>
            <li>It works perfectly for facial acne, too.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Then to top it all off the stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Made my booty break out even more.</li>
            <li>but I can tell that this product is the most helpful solution I have used yet.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more..</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found it...</li>
            <li>a nice smooth even look to it and</li>
            <li>Will now try to see if it&#x27;ll work on my thigh too :)</li>
            <li>For the price, I figured I&#x27;d give a shot, I&#x27;m glad I have.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s 99% better.</li>
            <li>that I write this review on behalf of my lovely girlfriend.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is silky smooth... !</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is now sexy g-string shopping time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things without any results&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product love using it.</li>
            <li>When there&#x27;s no improvement many people fall into despair.  </li>
            <li>Magic in the bottle..</li>
            <li>I have more confidence when wearing a bikini and in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I tried so many products, including diaper rash cream and over the counter acne medication.</li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Gives you a nice, smooth butt.  </li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>
            <li>Salicylic acid works better on my bum than this cream.</li>
            <li>This lotion exfoliates the skin of my butt better than any soap I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with butt pimples for many, many years.</li>
            <li>I found this worked better.</li>
            <li>My butt acne has gotten much better after using.</li>
            <li>Me feel confident again ..</li>
            <li>This is by no means a magical product.</li>
            <li>but it isn’t a magical solution or anything.</li>
            <li>Just ordered my 3rd bottle, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It really does work !!!!</li>
            <li>I got very excited when I discovered this product on the Internet.</li>
            <li>really happy I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li>Struggled with butt acne for years and this would have been great in high</li>
            <li>I wish it was cheaper, but I&#x27;ll pay this price to be able to sit comfortably after so many years of just dealing with the pain.</li>
            <li>There is nothing more embarrassing than acne on the bum but this lotion is helping to ease that embarrassment and more importantly my skin.</li>
            <li>This has worked great for me and makes your skin so soft!  </li>
            <li>this is great for sensitive skin and as of now has smoothed out all my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen great results so far!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, and does exactly what it says, I will def recommend to others who also suffer from butt acne!</li>
            <li>For those of us who deal with adult acne, this is a great find and</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is cruelty free as I am an animal advocate.</li>
            <li>After about 3 days, bumps were mostly gone, bum was totally smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li>And just so you are aware, this product comes with a sheet requesting that you leave a good review so they can ship you an additional FREE bottle.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff, I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really effective and useful after a couple of days you can already tell the difference</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been embarrassed to let my husband see my bum for years, but now it&#x27;s downright exciting! : )</li>
            <li>but I highly believe most people will be very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I also noticed the lotion does absorb very quickly too.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong chemical smell and that it doesn&#x27;t burn when applied to your skin.  </li>
            <li>strongly suggest that you try this</li>
            <li>Smells strongly like chemicals even though it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good acne clearing product.</li>
            <li>I saw amazing results in just the first 3 days (I use it twice a day).</li>
            <li>Yes, this stuff is pricey, but this has been the first lotion or product of any kind that has cleared up the acne and breakouts</li>
            <li>Smells fine, feels alright.</li>
            <li>At 23, it&#x27;s super embarrassing!</li>
            <li>It has really made my skin baby butt smooth!!</li>
            <li>Might be costly if you have a huge booty.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days I noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I received this for free from Poshly to try.</li>
            <li>My butt is smooth to the touch now not bumpy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion for the last 2 years and its a great lotion for my butt acne and maintenance.</li>
            <li>Also, the lotion makes my skin feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>The majority of the acne was cleared by the end of the week and the larger pimples were greatly reduced in size.  </li>
            <li>and It leaves the skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy it is specific for the problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my butt to make my skin softer and now my butt is as smooth as baby skin.</li>
            <li>I got a smooth hydrated canvas to work on.</li>
            <li>and my rear is smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li>Smooth ass in a couple days</li>
            <li>I love it no crazy ingredients</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>If my towel falls, I no longer am filled with shame.</li>
            <li>and I am already seeking fantastic results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this product for free.</li>
            <li>I am a light skinned AA</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>Its really good to clear skin.</li>
            <li>And from the combo of sweat and tight fitting work out clothes, I have dealt with this humiliating problem forever!!!</li>
            <li>I started using the lotion in January and in February bought my first G-string bikini and in March proudly showed off my sexy back side on the beach in Cancun!!  </li>
            <li>My rear is clean and smooth..</li>
            <li>And as many said, it did soften up my butt very fast, and it seemed to be doing something about the redness in my skin.</li>
            <li>A little background - My girlfriend has wonderful fair skin, However her only problem area was her butt.    </li>
            <li>but I only apply it once at night (every night) and the results have been amazing!</li>
            <li>As someone with KP, this product has noticeably and significantly reduced any inflammation</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products (tea tree lotion, witch hazel, stridex acne clearing pads &amp; more) to clear my butt acne &amp; none have worked!</li>
            <li>Like, significant results.</li>
            <li>With consistent use though, I am almost pimple free!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed this time.</li>
            <li>, What cached my attention was the name of the company &amp;#34;green heart labs&amp;#34; It was very interesting that they seem to work with natural products.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using for 3 days, and normally I wouldn&#x27;t review so quickly, but for me this product have been performing wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my bum clean.</li>
            <li>Twice a day on clean skin.</li>
            <li>I laughed at the name and really didn&#x27;t think it would do much but was intrigued by the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my way to a totally clear bum, and I love it!</li>
            <li>if you have body acne, specially on your rear, buy it with no doubt.</li>
            <li>Hope my experience helps you make the right decision and wish you a tender butt!</li>
            <li>wonderful and fast active ingredients to improve skin on the rear.</li>
            <li>After 2-3 weeks of consistent use I finally had the beautiful, smooth, sexy clear bum</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I experienced more than 50% clear skin on my buttocks.</li>
            <li>My barren butt is full of life once again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this butt acne issue for many years, I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and it really works well.  </li>
            <li>Been using coconut oil lately and seen very good results, plus it&#x27;s way cheaper!!!</li>
            <li>Yet true.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, glad</li>
            <li>it really does work:)</li>
            <li>As many others, I was very sceptical, but i wanted to believe it would work</li>
            <li>Well, good thing I found it again this year and started using it daily as instructed.</li>
            <li>But I’m definitely having some good results.  </li>
            <li>Having cowboyed all my life it&#x27;s fair to say butts should be properly cared for.  </li>
            <li>Does that sound right to you for that price?</li>
            <li>At first glance, it looks like regular lotion, smells fine, and feels creamy, in a good way.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until I have completed a full six months in hopes that the mild scaring will have diminished.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different things to clear the acne up and this by far is the best product out there!</li>
            <li>Dries quickly, does not stain clothes.  </li>
            <li>i plan on getting more soon enough :)</li>
            <li>So far so good, it is working very well</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly in skins , leaves no greasiness ..</li>
            <li>This stuff eliminates booty hurts quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily, this has softened the darkness.</li>
            <li>When I  applied the lotion on it quickly healed the acne and smoothed out my skin.</li>
            <li>New Me!!!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from embarrassing butt acne, the stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying something cheaper and more effective like &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Clear Clear Advantage</li>
            <li>It takes some time to see full results but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>You need to use the right product and this is the right product!  </li>
            <li>I use it morning and night on face and my skin is beautiful, soft and my pores even look smaller!!!</li>
            <li>Most of the acne was pretty much gone, and the scars started to lighten alot.</li>
            <li>Very pleased to have smooth skin for the first time in a long time, on my bottom.</li>
            <li>I was unsure at first bcuz it was so pricey!</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>This really does work!!  </li>
            <li>so I can have a pretty butt forever!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey for the amount given, but it works!</li>
            <li>This will be my fourth order of this amazing cream.  </li>
            <li>but it was truly worth it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone with any kind of issues on their back, legs, etc.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from leg and buttock acne for most of my adult life.</li>
            <li>For me though, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>My face has been clear most of my life.</li>
            <li>so I have also tried many natural products and remedies, but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li>Some people have not really had any good results, but I have.</li>
            <li>probably broke out more frequently than before I started using the lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion is not only effective in clearing acne but also fading and reducing the look of scars.</li>
            <li>Although this product is quite pricey for the size bottle, it really is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I felt I had to for this product.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost 2 weeks and already my bottom is 90% clear and to top this off</li>
            <li>read the reviews of this product on Amazon, and was curious about the good word it was given.</li>
            <li>, I thought it was worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>but I thought what the hell, its worth a shot.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been battling butt/inner thigh acne, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li>I got so excited after reading all the positive reviews, that I ordered one bottle right away.</li>
            <li>If you have a pretty mild problem, you can probably use facewash for about 1/4th of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and works pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>really, i thought i&#x27;d always have that problem, but i&#x27;m so excited about this that i just had to write about it.</li>
            <li>Skin was softer within 1-2 days, new spots stopped appearing within 1 week, overall excellent visible improvement within 2 weeks, and old spots faded quickly (about a month; normally that would probably take 3-4 months with my skin).</li>
            <li>Clears everything right up would get again</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the the results right away like others but after day five..</li>
            <li>and there right around the time I get my period, but I no longer have a ton of bumps and cyst.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t stop because you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone who start using this must understand that it doesnt help much right away.</li>
            <li>People might be leaving high reviews before they even use or see results from this cream just to get another free bottle.  </li>
            <li>Good product, but works after some time, not right away.</li>
            <li>My booty has never felt so smooth &amp; soft!!  </li>
            <li>That sounds silly, but I now feel like I&#x27;ll be able to confidently wear those cute, skimpy bikini bottoms (after a few more trips to the gym!), and I&#x27;m so happy to finally not be self-conscious of this problem in the bedroom.</li>
            <li>The use of this product was a quick repair to many different attempts.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing and has made such a positive impact on my confidence.</li>
            <li>Plus I like that it is made in the USA and seems to be a small company, which I am happy to support.</li>
            <li>I have been applying morning and night and 1) love that it barely smells and</li>
            <li>It is pricey, but if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice the cash for the results, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>As an avid gym goer this was an intriguing product.</li>
            <li>I continued my regime through it, the rash went away after a few days, and on week 4 my rear was smooth, clear, no bumps/&amp;#34;pimples&amp;#34; at all, no rash, and I cannot believe how great my skin looks and feels ever since.</li>
            <li>I only have little bumps almost like permanent goose bumps and this worked for that perfectly!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying different products for the last 8 years and nothing has worked as fast and good as this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I have been off of it for two months and got my first bump and reordered right away....</li>
            <li>It took a couple of weeks to clear my skin up (which I expected) and the results are great.</li>
            <li>Now I use this lotion once at night for maintenance, still cleaning with a towelette at night and occasional exfoliation in the AM, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s embarrassing, and something I would very much like to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a sexier woman, and can&#x27;t thank Green Heart Labs enough for coming up with a perfect solution for such a mortifying issue. :-)</li>
            <li>Skin feels very smooth with regular use, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>So instead of writing you a product review about how great this lotion is, I&#x27;m pretty angry that I had to explain that my butt acne is actually more toward my thigh area, and isn&#x27;t the ravaged teenage faced acme issue that sticks in most people&#x27;s minds when they think of the word acne.</li>
            <li>it works great for the those hard to diminish blemishes.</li>
            <li>(that will likely be lightened with more use) and a couple zits that are healing up.</li>
            <li>This was the first product to show up.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life I haven&#x27;t had to be embarrassed in front of my husband.</li>
            <li>I noticed NO difference with this product and used it for a month, exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>At first I was like,</li>
            <li>I did do some research and it appears that this product has the best results; therefore, I am hoping that it clears up my butt acne as well considering the price for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>As the title of my review says, it really works!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finishing my first bottle</li>
            <li>but I got back on it and my skin is better again.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>The first week of using Butt Acne Clearing Lotion my acne grew smaller &amp; I did get more of  breakout but figured (hoped)</li>
            <li>First, I have to acknowledge how fast it came in the mail!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty pricey, but it works.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with this problem for many years, and it has always affected my confidence and level of comfort (especially in the bedroom)!!</li>
            <li>I find it works best on a clean and dry &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; and slathered on fairly thick.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>One bottle lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think too!</li>
            <li>Its soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more to make sure the bumps don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but gave it some time</li>
            <li>Any department store product is around 1.7oz and the same price or more and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 3/4 of the way through my first bottle</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free, and the pH is balanced for the sensitive skin of the buttocks.</li>
            <li>I found this product and bought it for the first time because of the rating.</li>
            <li>If i could give this a negative I would, I got it cause all the great reviews</li>
            <li>I was so close to scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist but decided to try this product first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works!!</li>
            <li>I bought this product fully expecting to be throwing away $33, but after almost 3 decades of trying just about anything to get rid of unsightly butt bumps I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have always had clear smooth skin all my life and</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I have tried many different things like lightning creams, alcohol, all kinds of acne clearing products and none has ever worked.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for scar removal, this may not be the best choice( again I can&#x27;t review scary removal, because I just started using)  </li>
            <li>I know everybody is different, this seems as reviews states works for many, and not for others.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pretty neutral and it just works-</li>
            <li>trying vitamin E creams for months with only slightly better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works as described and it works fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks to butt acne clearing lotion!</li>
            <li>The skin on my bum is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>However, you have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so smooth amd soft.</li>
            <li>I found it worked better on the back of my arms than my rear.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to find something that actually makes a significant difference on body blemishes.</li>
            <li>I started to notice a change within the first couple of days using it.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Much to my suprise, this stuff worked!  </li>
            <li>At first i thought it wasn’t working at all: the pimples improved during the fist week</li>
            <li>Small bottle for a big price, but you get great results!!!!</li>
            <li>Well everything keeps getting better with time, my existing pimples have almost completely disappeared and I’m not getting new breakouts.</li>
            <li>Not only is the skin softer, but it is super smooth as well.</li>
            <li>I kid you not baby baby soft !!!! .</li>
            <li>My hands remains busy even till now !!!!    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty excited to see how far I would&#x27;ve come at the half-way point of this</li>
            <li>This is our 2nd bottle and will certainly re-order, as this product has introduce a great deal of confidence in my gf which was lost for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m down to the bottom and will be getting more!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so happy someone have taken this problem seriously, and helped me and others.</li>
            <li>I look way better naked and have a bunch of confidence in intimate situations now.  </li>
            <li>Was very surprised how well and quickly this worked.  </li>
            <li>The order came quickly and was exactly what I wanted, it does clear up acne</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the first night I applied the product on my bottom, I felt very relieved.</li>
            <li>And since this is such an embarrassing issue for me a woman and I&#x27;m sure for a lot of people I highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t completely clear my acne, I did notice tremendous results.</li>
            <li>I was upset to see i still had acne scars after using the whole bottle, thats what i pretty much baught it for</li>
            <li>but it seemed to mildly help even with old scaring.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and has results very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I had these large cysts/boils.</li>
            <li>But almost in the same time, i saw that even tho this new outbreak was happening, my skin seemed alot better in between -</li>
            <li>It took away a significant amount of redness and blemishes but did&#x27;t seem to rid the bumps that appeared to be the same size as my first application.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day as directed and noticed a clear up during the first day of use!  </li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and free of little bumps and zits.</li>
            <li>I had one surface right before my period, which is relatively normal I think, and I have one, maybe two more super small ones.</li>
            <li>My pimpled up rear was such a huge insecurity of mine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge outbreaks now but an occasional pimple.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my back and it has kept that area acne free as well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really worked for me</li>
            <li>I actually received this product, for free, through Poshly.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re really inflamed-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone that needs it!</li>
            <li>The only plus side is that this stuff is odor free and didn&#x27;t bleach my clothing.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with having this type of body acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li>so you do not need to use so much.</li>
            <li>Scarring is also very susceptible in that region.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been an absolute miracle for me.</li>
            <li>Got it fast</li>
            <li>I look in the mirror now with so much confidence that I didn&#x27;t know I even had.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with this embarrassing problem since high school and have tried EVERYTHING!  </li>
            <li>I have had acne on my butt my whole life.</li>
            <li>I had this problem) told me I have such a smooth bum.</li>
            <li>All thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>It worked for some acne on my thighs, not too much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from this embarrassing problem!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I discovered sulfur about a year ago and it was an amazing find, especially for those of you that swear by benzoyl peroxide but are tired of it bleaching everything you own</li>
            <li>I have been using but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li>and it is really clearing up my butt</li>
            <li>nothing has ever cleared them up that fast.</li>
            <li>Nobody wants to admit that they might have an issue like this, but it happens.</li>
            <li>I Highly Recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like this &amp;#34;butt acne&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li>This works really well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use all that much at all</li>
            <li>but it still feels very sticky.</li>
            <li>As much as I like the results, I&#x27;m going to have to find something else.</li>
            <li>It really clears up the acne</li>
            <li>This is only the second time I have experienced breakouts on my back and butt</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>For the price I haven&#x27;t seen much if any difference after a month</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that this lotion would help treat my butt acne.</li>
            <li>It really does.</li>
            <li>It is much softer now.  </li>
            <li>It is very embarrassing that I still get acne on my rear well into my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>This stuff worked really well clearing up my backside.</li>
            <li>So I got very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>After weeks of usage, my butt acne stills persists and I feel very frustrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not greasy, no fragrance, and readily water soluble.)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use that much, just about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li>So for me to leave a review means it really works....</li>
            <li>My skin was so much softer, more so than regular lotion and STAYED soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve religiously used salicylic acid pads to keep my skin clear, but this stuff works much better.</li>
            <li>Makes your tush clean clear and soft!</li>
            <li>I consider mine as, mild case and at first I really didn&#x27;t see any difference, until the 2nd weeks has passed and boy</li>
            <li>In 12 hours, my butt was completely clear!!!  </li>
            <li>Not all clear yet but heading in the right direction.</li>
            <li>This obviously made me excited, but I still didn&#x27;t have too much faith.</li>
            <li>The product&#x27;s price is a little steep, but honestly, what would you be willing to pay for a clear bum?</li>
            <li>This is something, like many other reviewers,</li>
            <li>At the end of the first month, my butt was completely clear!</li>
            <li>I am sure it would work for other issues as well.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it might feel like constant maintenance, but it&#x27;s easy to work into your daily routine, the same way you might put lotion on after a shower.  </li>
            <li>And since I apply generously I clean the excess on my back &amp; it seems to work there too!</li>
            <li>Prior to application at night, I would clean my rear with a 2% salicylic acid pre-moistened towelette.</li>
            <li>or &amp;#34;Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer&amp;#34; (and no, I don&#x27;t work for Clean and Clear!).</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and my body has always experienced acne problems as long as I could remember - face, back, shoulders etc.  </li>
            <li>I had mild to moderate acne on my booty and also keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li>so i can definitely tell you this stuff is super worth it and fast acting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been embarrassed by this problem since I was a teenager, and am so glad I have finally found something that actually works!  </li>
            <li>I will continue buying it for sure because it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that actually seems to help!  </li>
            <li>Firstly, I used it for a couple of days, my butt got better, then I got lazy, stopped using it.</li>
            <li>and I was able go back to wearing short shorts and bikinis again.  </li>
            <li>I have some residual darkish marks from older acne issues (I guess, not an acne expert here)</li>
            <li>as most of us know it isn&#x27;t really acne, there is a scientific name for it, and I&#x27;m not going to waste anymore of your time about that,</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more bottles of this in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s left my skin smooth, clear, and doesn&#x27;t discolor clothes like acne medication would.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a decent size for the price.</li>
            <li>For the first 2 weeks, my skin felt obviously softer but I still got some red bumps or &amp;#34;pimples.&amp;#34; During week 3, I got what felt like a rash on my rear consisting of many, many small colorless bumps all around the skin.</li>
            <li>the only reason why I don&#x27;t give it a 5 rating is the price is steep, but worth it because it really works....</li>
            <li>and I have to say I did notice a major difference in my skin - its a lot smoother and despite the warm weather and being very active now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend if you have an acne problem on your rear and nothing has ever helped.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations because I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne on the butt for 5 years now.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in hopes that its high price entailed a high quality product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for people with recurring acne, scars, etc.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>One day on I was searching through google for a natural product that can clear acne naturally but quickly.</li>
            <li>even while taking Accutane the pimples didn&#x27;t really even stop - they slowed down at first but quickly came</li>
            <li>I am 8 days in to use and completely clear!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another bottle once my first has run out!</li>
            <li>but I like that because it does not feel as sticky as other products and it is easy to spread</li>
            <li>It feels natural and non greasy on the skin, has no harsh chemical smells and as a matter of fact is very gentle feeling and smelling.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped to clear up the acne that occurs from sweating and exercising.  </li>
            <li>It works really fast; within a week I had clear skin.</li>
            <li>I tried nearly &#x27;everything&#x27; and this really cleared me up.</li>
            <li>I have been very self conscious about the acne on my butt over the years.</li>
            <li>The application is very soothing and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever really liked &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; my hiney since it always feels bumpy but curious to see if it did anything, I have to say I can&#x27;t remember the last time my butt felt that supple and smooth (or less bumpy).</li>
            <li>Finally, a solution to a problem that is really simple and easy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across the Butt Acne Clearing Lotion online one day while searching for anything new that I hadn&#x27;t tried yet.  </li>
            <li>However, if it prevents the acne she won&#x27;t need to worry about new scars.</li>
            <li>however still have new cysts forming.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s specifically to treat new acne breakouts.</li>
            <li>But then, after five days of use, i got a new outbreak of bumps.</li>
            <li>I live in Spain, and eventhough courier services were almost the price of the product</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t seem to stop new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also recently tried benzoyl peroxide with success, but this product is a complete package.</li>
            <li>No other skin product has worked so well or quickly for me, and I&#x27;ve been plagued by acne for the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li>skin is just about 100% clear and feeling very soft and spankable!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s very soft), but I have not noticed a reduction in the bumps.</li>
            <li>You might think the price is somewhat high, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive &amp; get razor burn after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>It is very soft and supple again.  </li>
            <li>After a couple days I stopped getting new pimples, and now 2 weeks later, all that is left is some original redness of the skin</li>
            <li>Have had a clear butt since I posted it!</li>
            <li>I started rubbing about a nickel-sized amount into my booty cheeks every morning and ever night, and saw a completely clear and softer butt in about 3 days!</li>
            <li>So my last resort was to possibly try and get laser treatment, which is obviously costly, when I decided to research one more time to see if anything else had come out.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product that has cleared things up and kept them cleared up.  </li>
            <li>The results were definitely worth the price for me, and I will continue to purchase this product for as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The majority of the acne was cleared within 10-14 days, and again with consistent use it will prevent future breakout.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Not only has it cleared the red bumps significantly</li>
            <li>only problem with the product is the labeling, I find it embarrassing, but I just rip the labels off when I first get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I recommend giving it a try, it&#x27;s not that expensive, as compared to many others, and if it doesn&#x27;t rid your buttne, at least it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks until I started seeing significant progress, then back to once a day for a couple weeks, and I am going to continue every other day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would also recommend exfoliating with granulated sugar in the shower daily ;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely recommend to my girlfriends so they can get themselves ready for bikini season!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne completely, but almost!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it 2 times a day for just about a week &amp; my skin is almost completely cleared up!</li>
            <li>I bought a bottle in November and even though I admittedly have not been using it twice a day, it has still been working to clear up existing pimples and prevent new ones from forming.</li>
            <li>Also the lotion is very sticky and does not dry up, it has to be wiped off to avoid getting it on clothes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy about how this lotion has worked for me, but I was very sad to see it doesn&#x27;t come in a BIGGER bottle</li>
            <li>I usually try to stick to the more natural healing</li>
            <li>I recently did full body makeup on women who would be naked in an adult scene.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that when applying to skin it is not necessary to use a large amount (a dime sized drop per butt cheek should be plenty).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure everyone&#x27;s skin and body chemistry is a little different but this one works well for me.</li>
            <li>and I seen a huge difference within a few days.</li>
            <li>Another few days were gone and my acne was COMPLETELY gone, with the still prevalent smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that as I continue to use this, that my scars and blemishes will completely clear up.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is ready to have clear skin, once and for all.</li>
            <li>While the changes didn&#x27;t occur overnight, I felt the difference in my skin almost immediately and saw the pimples clear up within two weeks.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t just clear it up, but it erased all my acne scars.</li>
            <li>Helps keep my booty skin clear as well as bikini line because it helps prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I have had this embarrassing problem since I started puberty and to have something that is helping and looks like it is going to clear me up makes me feel ecstatic.</li>
            <li>I recommended for people who don&#x27;t know why the bottom just won&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li>Use it but know that acne in this area will keep returning (mine is aggravated by sitting and workout clothes) and that you have to keep using this product in order for things to stay clear.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has almost completely clear it up in TWO days..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s completely clear.  </li>
            <li>I have clear skin, however not in the rear.</li>
            <li>But as far as ridding current buttne it works fast</li>
            <li>Also, while researching this product I noticed reviewers upset because it does nothing to clear up acne scars...</li>
            <li>this lotion seemed to help clear up the breakouts.  </li>
            <li>This product started working instantly to clear up that embarrassing butt acne.  </li>
            <li>My active pimples started to dry out, I’m not getting as many breakouts as i used to -although</li>
            <li>have struggled with since early adolescence and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I applied it for several weeks as instructed, but did not see much of a change.</li>
            <li>It is completely non scented and did not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li>Wow, I wish I would have saved my $33 dollars.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by my results.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is only 4 oz which is reasonable to me.  </li>
            <li>and my skin there is just so soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if my backside will ever be totally acne-free but this absolutely reduces it.</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with butt acne since I was a teenager (now in my early 40s).  </li>
            <li>Wow, what can I say...</li>
            <li>My 18 year old daughter plays college sports and has been an athlete all of her life</li>
            <li>I started using this lotion and now have a clear and baby soft bum.</li>
            <li>Since I have used this lotion my butt has gotten sooo soft and guess what?</li>
            <li>Change your bath towel and wash towel frequently.  </li>
            <li>Minimizing existing bumps, plus it makes my skin feel SO soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m completely flabbergasted by the results.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a week and all ready no razor burn anymore</li>
            <li>And I used to always be so self conscious when I had to go to the beach or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it leaves your skin so soft and</li>
            <li>I suffered outbreaks ever since I was about 12 years old (about to be 30 now).</li>
            <li>I hope that with continuos use it can diminish the appearance considerably.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin, but thankfully I have no irritations.</li>
            <li>1st of all, I&#x27;m a 39 year old man.  </li>
            <li>I recommend keeping your money, using natural skin lightening soap and cocoa butter for people of color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only noticeable in swimwear, the acne is very visible while I&#x27;m wearing shorts.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin sooooo soft my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin is now.</li>
            <li>My butt is clear and soft.</li>
            <li>This also seems to really help with cystic acne, of which I get the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about five weeks now and it has completely cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>I will say that it absolutely cleared up the acne on my buttocks and backs of my thighs plus it definitely made a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I would pay several times as much for the results it gave me.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works on keratosis pilaris (red bumps on backs of arms, legs, etc).  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m never self conscious about wearing a bikini.</li>
            <li>whole butt was covered with either big bylls or scars.</li>
            <li>And the outbreak was in old scars.</li>
            <li>It took a total of 4 weeks to start seeing real results.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been a few days but seems smoother softer and better looking..</li>
            <li>some good moisturizers can have similar effects with less than half the price.</li>
            <li>I used it as directed on top of my extreme cleaning routine, but nothing, no positive results, but hopefully will work for someone else.</li>
            <li>I have so many bumps and scars, its ridiculous.</li>
            <li>This product is the first ever acne lotion formulated specifically for the buttocks, it is soothing and begins working instantly, I began seeing results after only 24 hours!</li>
            <li>However, this product helps get you skin back to normal and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After one and a half week, the results really started to show for real.</li>
            <li>However, not many products are available for body acne/keratosis pilaris/other body skin problems.</li>
            <li>Not sure if my butt acne free because of this product</li>
            <li>It arrived only few days after my purhcase, and I used it twice daily for better results.</li>
            <li>and I definitely will buy again when it&#x27;s finished because I haven&#x27;t got a new outbreak since I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several topical treatments, acne clearing face washes on the problem area and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle and it fixed my problem completely after about 3 weeks of my regime.</li>
            <li>It also left my skin very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li>the bottle is small but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I never expected it to work so well!</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;ve gone to 5 different dermatologists over 15 years, and tried more prescriptions that I can count.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 6 months now and have been able to drop back to just applying after I get out of the shower every day and it only takes a tiny little amount...</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders dandruff shampoo, fast clearing, but also dries you out, then symptoms creep back, olive oil and scrub and rinse with hot as you can stand water works but time consuming and messy</li>
            <li>I saw a tremendous different not only blemish the dark skin coz of the old acne, it preventing the skin from another outbreak!</li>
            <li>Green Heart Labs has significantly improved my confidence and I can&#x27;t thank them enough!</li>
            <li>You have to use this product consistenly; I finally have clear skin after a month of using it.</li>
            <li>Helps clear up occasional break outs almost overnight.</li>
            <li>not only does it clear you up, it also adds a pleasingly supple touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days now and my bum is almost clear already.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had clear skin on my butt since before i could remember and its the only thing that has ever worked.</li>
            <li>It does not help clear butt acne scars/discolorations, but it does help prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also leaves your butt extra soft, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I use daily and my bottom stays so soft.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried several different lotions, creams, and cleansers that all have claimed to work magic.</li>
            <li>For my entire adult life I have been embarrassed to wear swim suits or shorts for fear that a pimple or acne scar would be visible.  </li>
            <li>After using the lotion for 1 week , Yes 1 week !!!!, with my eyes  and hands as proof,  95 % of the acne was gone and it left her butt baby soft.</li>
            <li>The skin on my upper thigh/butt area is extremely sensitive, so when my legs are exposed during shorts season I have to deal with embarrassing acne.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so embarrassing that I don&#x27;t want my boyfriend to look at my bare butt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this lotion for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems, old scars are even starting to fade!</li>
            <li>I am a busy Mom of two and sometimes skip a day (or 2) and the acne will start to come back.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not great.</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely in love and can&#x27;t stop looking at my behind in the mirror.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick and dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the product since I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to no avail.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical at first but actually noticed good results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want people I live with seeing that I use such a thing for such an already embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product everyday since right after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>This product really does work, IF you use it continuously for at least 2 weeks straight (twice or thrice per day)..</li>
            <li>Once it clears up, you won&#x27;t necessarily need it as often, but I do use a bit just to help keep blemishes from coming back and keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has worked for her sensitive skin on her face and her back.</li>
            <li>It actually made it worse, creating more irritation.</li>
            <li>Another bonus was the fact it did not dry my skin out at all which for</li>
            <li>I was sceptical about spending $30 on acne cream initially, but it really is worth every cent, and one bottle lasts a few months.</li>
            <li>The lotion still would not dry up after 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does not dry out or bleach clothing, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li>Not only have my break outs not cleared up, I&#x27;ve actually broken out a bit more.</li>
            <li>Even though the price seems a little high, a friend of mine told me a prescription version of this is nearly $85.00 WITH insurance!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little while, but it has certainly cleared up the issue so far.  </li>
            <li>I am a little hesitant about buying products online without trying them out first</li>
            <li>I decided to order the product even though the price was a little steep, but I figured I was willing to try if the product was so well</li>
            <li>It is expensive, and if you do 2 applications/day as recommended, you&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quick.</li>
            <li>I got lots of stretch marks while pregnant and for some reason will get big, red, cystic like blemishes in the stretch marks (maybe one or two) and seemed to always have a few smaller bumps scattered throughout.  </li>
            <li>It is expensive and shipping to Australia is really costly but is worth the money!</li>
            <li>As far as the product I will continue buying it as long as it continues working as well as it has been for 5 months.</li>
            <li>In the mean time I will probably use other products to help with the healing process, but I really love this brand.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this lotion; it truly was made for relief of acne of the butt, unlike other products made for the face.</li>
            <li>In my morning showers, about every other day, I would lightly exfoliate using a mesh sponge and a liquid body soap (sometimes plain, sometimes Neutrogena&#x27;s 2% salicylic acid grapefruit liquid body soap; I mixed it up).</li>
            <li>but a few times a week to do get one or two large zits.</li>
            <li>This lotion is gentle, with just a little bit of exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth this high price.</li>

            <li> BEST MOST AMAZING STUFF EVER.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> I read all these reviews and thought to myself &amp;#34;well, good that it worked for them, but it probably won&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this was from the good exfoliation the lotion provides.  </li>
            <li> I put a good amount of the product on my hands and rubbed it on my rear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> Works really good.</li>
            <li> but I had a good feeling about this one, so I then purchased the Butt Acne Clearing lotion</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good.</li>
            <li> This product works so good</li>
            <li> Good to know before hand.</li>

            <li> Super impressed with this product!</li>
            <li> I feel more confident and so happy!</li>
            <li> so she sweats a great deal and has had acne problems for many years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great anyway:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for about three weeks now, right before bed each night, and it has worked marvelously.</li>

            <li> Within the first day I was already seeing great results!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, this lotion is amazing and truly works.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing truly.</li>
            <li> The lotion came and with a couple of days there was a noticeable difference, and after a week, the difference was amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>

            <li> This product is AMAZING.    </li>
            <li> this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked until I found this amazing lotion.</li>
            <li> OMG -- srsly -- this stuff works amazingly well.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It may not work for everyone but for me, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> The transformation has been amazing</li>
            <li> now been 3,5 weeks, and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> This is absolutely one of the best cosmetic products I&#x27;ve ever used (along with Cetaphil).  </li>
            <li> It works honestly</li>
            <li> Honestly.</li>
            <li> but it also softens the skin, a benefit I wasn&#x27;t really expecting but am very happy about.</li>
            <li> But hey, nice problem to have I guess...</li>
            <li> I have tried popular acne medications, seen a dermatologist and they still kept showing up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the longest for an affordable but effective product and boy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 and eat a fairly balanced diet consisting of mostly fruits</li>
            <li> im so happy to have this lotion i want to buy one more bottle :)</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something that honestly takes away AND prevents breakouts.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about spending 30-plus dollars on a lotion that can cure acne on your buttocks (believe me, I was), I can honestly say, you needn&#x27;t be.  </li>
            <li> but I have been diligent and make sure I don&#x27;t skip a day, and I am very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and feels great.</li>
            <li> it has a light pleasant smell, and</li>
            <li> Product arrive extremely quickly and works great.</li>
            <li> Love love this product!</li>
            <li> Now I can feel more confident in myself!</li>
            <li> :) Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using this wonderful product, my butt is clearer (albeit the remaining blemish from previous breakouts) and beautifully softer.</li>
            <li> Ok so I will give my honest review of this product.</li>
            <li> Best acne product by far.</li>
            <li> cream must be magic, it is amazing.</li>
            <li> covered).&lt;br /&gt;It is a true lifesaver!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using the product and it seems to be working very quickly!</li>
            <li> I would not sit for 2 hrs after each application, thinking that if the lotion absorbs better, it would be more effective and work faster.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so happy with the results definitely going to keep getting this love it!!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews but this lotion is incredible.</li>
            <li> Great product with consistent use.</li>
            <li> First time reviewing anything, I must say this stuff works great.</li>
            <li> I cleared up quickly, which is surprising because I&#x27;ve used sulphur products for face acne and didn&#x27;t get any</li>
            <li> no nasty smell easy and effective.</li>
            <li> better then anything else I have tried</li>
            <li> Love the lotion.</li>
            <li> (maybe once I get in better shape).</li>
            <li> After doing some more research, again, I came across this product.  </li>
            <li> I looked up &#x27;butt&#x27; and &#x27;acne&#x27; in Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Sure, I chuckled at the name, but I just said might as well try it out.  </li>
            <li> As I am incredibly allergic to mosquitoes, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So, okay.</li>
            <li> I can say is that I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> okay, is this a joke?&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll get one or two bumps every now</li>
            <li> and then if I skip a day or something, but it&#x27;s SO much better than what I had before.</li>
            <li> I am glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very simple and seems to do a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, so it is not fully cleared but it has improved GREATLY!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li> I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure once I run out.</li>
            <li> I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> the stuff is magic</li>
            <li> I have not had any more breakouts &amp; it has been a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try the Butt Acne clearing lotion because I have tried so many products and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> Have struggled with acne for many years and nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> From then on, it just kept getting better and</li>
            <li> Now it is finally MUCH better.    </li>
            <li> It works perfectly for facial acne, too.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Then to top it all off the stuff doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Made my booty break out even more.</li>
            <li> but I can tell that this product is the most helpful solution I have used yet.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying more..</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found it...</li>
            <li> a nice smooth even look to it and</li>
            <li> Will now try to see if it&#x27;ll work on my thigh too :)</li>
            <li> For the price, I figured I&#x27;d give a shot, I&#x27;m glad I have.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s 99% better.</li>
            <li> that I write this review on behalf of my lovely girlfriend.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is silky smooth... !</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is now sexy g-string shopping time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things without any results&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product love using it.</li>
            <li> When there&#x27;s no improvement many people fall into despair.  </li>
            <li> Magic in the bottle..</li>
            <li> I have more confidence when wearing a bikini and in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I tried so many products, including diaper rash cream and over the counter acne medication.</li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice, smooth butt.  </li>
            <li> I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Salicylic acid works better on my bum than this cream.</li>
            <li> This lotion exfoliates the skin of my butt better than any soap I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with butt pimples for many, many years.</li>
            <li> I found this worked better.</li>
            <li> My butt acne has gotten much better after using.</li>
            <li> Me feel confident again ..</li>
            <li> This is by no means a magical product.</li>
            <li> but it isn’t a magical solution or anything.</li>
            <li> Just ordered my 3rd bottle, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It really does work !!!!</li>
            <li> I got very excited when I discovered this product on the Internet.</li>
            <li> really happy I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Struggled with butt acne for years and this would have been great in high</li>
            <li> I wish it was cheaper, but I&#x27;ll pay this price to be able to sit comfortably after so many years of just dealing with the pain.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more embarrassing than acne on the bum but this lotion is helping to ease that embarrassment and more importantly my skin.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for me and makes your skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> this is great for sensitive skin and as of now has smoothed out all my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great results so far!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and does exactly what it says, I will def recommend to others who also suffer from butt acne!</li>
            <li> For those of us who deal with adult acne, this is a great find and</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is cruelty free as I am an animal advocate.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days, bumps were mostly gone, bum was totally smooth to the touch.  </li>
            <li> And just so you are aware, this product comes with a sheet requesting that you leave a good review so they can ship you an additional FREE bottle.  </li>
            <li> Good stuff, I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really effective and useful after a couple of days you can already tell the difference</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been embarrassed to let my husband see my bum for years, but now it&#x27;s downright exciting! : )</li>
            <li> but I highly believe most people will be very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the lotion does absorb very quickly too.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong chemical smell and that it doesn&#x27;t burn when applied to your skin.  </li>
            <li> strongly suggest that you try this</li>
            <li> Smells strongly like chemicals even though it&#x27;s unscented.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good acne clearing product.</li>
            <li> I saw amazing results in just the first 3 days (I use it twice a day).</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff is pricey, but this has been the first lotion or product of any kind that has cleared up the acne and breakouts</li>
            <li> Smells fine, feels alright.</li>
            <li> At 23, it&#x27;s super embarrassing!</li>
            <li> It has really made my skin baby butt smooth!!</li>
            <li> Might be costly if you have a huge booty.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days I noticed a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Poshly to try.</li>
            <li> My butt is smooth to the touch now not bumpy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion for the last 2 years and its a great lotion for my butt acne and maintenance.</li>
            <li> Also, the lotion makes my skin feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> The majority of the acne was cleared by the end of the week and the larger pimples were greatly reduced in size.  </li>
            <li> and It leaves the skin so smooth.</li>
            <li> and I am so happy it is specific for the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my butt to make my skin softer and now my butt is as smooth as baby skin.</li>
            <li> I got a smooth hydrated canvas to work on.</li>
            <li> and my rear is smooth and bump free.</li>
            <li> Smooth ass in a couple days</li>
            <li> I love it no crazy ingredients</li>
            <li> Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> If my towel falls, I no longer am filled with shame.</li>
            <li> and I am already seeking fantastic results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this product for free.</li>
            <li> I am a light skinned AA</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> Its really good to clear skin.</li>
            <li> And from the combo of sweat and tight fitting work out clothes, I have dealt with this humiliating problem forever!!!</li>
            <li> I started using the lotion in January and in February bought my first G-string bikini and in March proudly showed off my sexy back side on the beach in Cancun!!  </li>
            <li> My rear is clean and smooth..</li>
            <li> And as many said, it did soften up my butt very fast, and it seemed to be doing something about the redness in my skin.</li>
            <li> A little background - My girlfriend has wonderful fair skin, However her only problem area was her butt.    </li>
            <li> but I only apply it once at night (every night) and the results have been amazing!</li>
            <li> As someone with KP, this product has noticeably and significantly reduced any inflammation</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products (tea tree lotion, witch hazel, stridex acne clearing pads &amp; more) to clear my butt acne &amp; none have worked!</li>
            <li> Like, significant results.</li>
            <li> With consistent use though, I am almost pimple free!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed this time.</li>
            <li> , What cached my attention was the name of the company &amp;#34;green heart labs&amp;#34; It was very interesting that they seem to work with natural products.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using for 3 days, and normally I wouldn&#x27;t review so quickly, but for me this product have been performing wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my bum clean.</li>
            <li> Twice a day on clean skin.</li>
            <li> I laughed at the name and really didn&#x27;t think it would do much but was intrigued by the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my way to a totally clear bum, and I love it!</li>
            <li> if you have body acne, specially on your rear, buy it with no doubt.</li>
            <li> Hope my experience helps you make the right decision and wish you a tender butt!</li>
            <li> wonderful and fast active ingredients to improve skin on the rear.</li>
            <li> After 2-3 weeks of consistent use I finally had the beautiful, smooth, sexy clear bum</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I experienced more than 50% clear skin on my buttocks.</li>
            <li> My barren butt is full of life once again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this butt acne issue for many years, I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and it really works well.  </li>
            <li> Been using coconut oil lately and seen very good results, plus it&#x27;s way cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> Yet true.  </li>
            <li> Works really well, glad</li>
            <li> it really does work:)</li>
            <li> As many others, I was very sceptical, but i wanted to believe it would work</li>
            <li> Well, good thing I found it again this year and started using it daily as instructed.</li>
            <li> But I’m definitely having some good results.  </li>
            <li> Having cowboyed all my life it&#x27;s fair to say butts should be properly cared for.  </li>
            <li> Does that sound right to you for that price?</li>
            <li> At first glance, it looks like regular lotion, smells fine, and feels creamy, in a good way.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until I have completed a full six months in hopes that the mild scaring will have diminished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different things to clear the acne up and this by far is the best product out there!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, does not stain clothes.  </li>
            <li> i plan on getting more soon enough :)</li>
            <li> So far so good, it is working very well</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly in skins , leaves no greasiness ..</li>
            <li> This stuff eliminates booty hurts quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily, this has softened the darkness.</li>
            <li> When I  applied the lotion on it quickly healed the acne and smoothed out my skin.</li>
            <li> New Me!!!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from embarrassing butt acne, the stuff is magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend buying something cheaper and more effective like &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Clear Clear Advantage</li>
            <li> It takes some time to see full results but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> You need to use the right product and this is the right product!  </li>
            <li> I use it morning and night on face and my skin is beautiful, soft and my pores even look smaller!!!</li>
            <li> Most of the acne was pretty much gone, and the scars started to lighten alot.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to have smooth skin for the first time in a long time, on my bottom.</li>
            <li> I was unsure at first bcuz it was so pricey!</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> This really does work!!  </li>
            <li> so I can have a pretty butt forever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey for the amount given, but it works!</li>
            <li> This will be my fourth order of this amazing cream.  </li>
            <li> but it was truly worth it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with any kind of issues on their back, legs, etc.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from leg and buttock acne for most of my adult life.</li>
            <li> For me though, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My face has been clear most of my life.</li>
            <li> so I have also tried many natural products and remedies, but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> Some people have not really had any good results, but I have.</li>
            <li> probably broke out more frequently than before I started using the lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not only effective in clearing acne but also fading and reducing the look of scars.</li>
            <li> Although this product is quite pricey for the size bottle, it really is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I felt I had to for this product.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 weeks and already my bottom is 90% clear and to top this off</li>
            <li> read the reviews of this product on Amazon, and was curious about the good word it was given.</li>
            <li> , I thought it was worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> but I thought what the hell, its worth a shot.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been battling butt/inner thigh acne, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> I got so excited after reading all the positive reviews, that I ordered one bottle right away.</li>
            <li> If you have a pretty mild problem, you can probably use facewash for about 1/4th of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and works pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> really, i thought i&#x27;d always have that problem, but i&#x27;m so excited about this that i just had to write about it.</li>
            <li> Skin was softer within 1-2 days, new spots stopped appearing within 1 week, overall excellent visible improvement within 2 weeks, and old spots faded quickly (about a month; normally that would probably take 3-4 months with my skin).</li>
            <li> Clears everything right up would get again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the the results right away like others but after day five..</li>
            <li> and there right around the time I get my period, but I no longer have a ton of bumps and cyst.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stop because you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone who start using this must understand that it doesnt help much right away.</li>
            <li> People might be leaving high reviews before they even use or see results from this cream just to get another free bottle.  </li>
            <li> Good product, but works after some time, not right away.</li>
            <li> My booty has never felt so smooth &amp; soft!!  </li>
            <li> That sounds silly, but I now feel like I&#x27;ll be able to confidently wear those cute, skimpy bikini bottoms (after a few more trips to the gym!), and I&#x27;m so happy to finally not be self-conscious of this problem in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> The use of this product was a quick repair to many different attempts.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing and has made such a positive impact on my confidence.</li>
            <li> Plus I like that it is made in the USA and seems to be a small company, which I am happy to support.</li>
            <li> I have been applying morning and night and 1) love that it barely smells and</li>
            <li> It is pricey, but if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice the cash for the results, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> As an avid gym goer this was an intriguing product.</li>
            <li> I continued my regime through it, the rash went away after a few days, and on week 4 my rear was smooth, clear, no bumps/&amp;#34;pimples&amp;#34; at all, no rash, and I cannot believe how great my skin looks and feels ever since.</li>
            <li> I only have little bumps almost like permanent goose bumps and this worked for that perfectly!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different products for the last 8 years and nothing has worked as fast and good as this lotion!  </li>
            <li> I have been off of it for two months and got my first bump and reordered right away....</li>
            <li> It took a couple of weeks to clear my skin up (which I expected) and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Now I use this lotion once at night for maintenance, still cleaning with a towelette at night and occasional exfoliation in the AM, and so far, so good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s embarrassing, and something I would very much like to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a sexier woman, and can&#x27;t thank Green Heart Labs enough for coming up with a perfect solution for such a mortifying issue. :-)</li>
            <li> Skin feels very smooth with regular use, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> So instead of writing you a product review about how great this lotion is, I&#x27;m pretty angry that I had to explain that my butt acne is actually more toward my thigh area, and isn&#x27;t the ravaged teenage faced acme issue that sticks in most people&#x27;s minds when they think of the word acne.</li>
            <li> it works great for the those hard to diminish blemishes.</li>
            <li> (that will likely be lightened with more use) and a couple zits that are healing up.</li>
            <li> This was the first product to show up.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life I haven&#x27;t had to be embarrassed in front of my husband.</li>
            <li> I noticed NO difference with this product and used it for a month, exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> At first I was like,</li>
            <li> I did do some research and it appears that this product has the best results; therefore, I am hoping that it clears up my butt acne as well considering the price for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> As the title of my review says, it really works!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m finishing my first bottle</li>
            <li> but I got back on it and my skin is better again.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> The first week of using Butt Acne Clearing Lotion my acne grew smaller &amp; I did get more of  breakout but figured (hoped)</li>
            <li> First, I have to acknowledge how fast it came in the mail!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with this problem for many years, and it has always affected my confidence and level of comfort (especially in the bedroom)!!</li>
            <li> I find it works best on a clean and dry &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; and slathered on fairly thick.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think too!</li>
            <li> Its soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more to make sure the bumps don&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but gave it some time</li>
            <li> Any department store product is around 1.7oz and the same price or more and doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 3/4 of the way through my first bottle</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free, and the pH is balanced for the sensitive skin of the buttocks.</li>
            <li> I found this product and bought it for the first time because of the rating.</li>
            <li> If i could give this a negative I would, I got it cause all the great reviews</li>
            <li> I was so close to scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist but decided to try this product first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product fully expecting to be throwing away $33, but after almost 3 decades of trying just about anything to get rid of unsightly butt bumps I was willing to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have always had clear smooth skin all my life and</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I have tried many different things like lightning creams, alcohol, all kinds of acne clearing products and none has ever worked.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for scar removal, this may not be the best choice( again I can&#x27;t review scary removal, because I just started using)  </li>
            <li> I know everybody is different, this seems as reviews states works for many, and not for others.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pretty neutral and it just works-</li>
            <li> trying vitamin E creams for months with only slightly better results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works as described and it works fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks to butt acne clearing lotion!</li>
            <li> The skin on my bum is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> However, you have to be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so smooth amd soft.</li>
            <li> I found it worked better on the back of my arms than my rear.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to find something that actually makes a significant difference on body blemishes.</li>
            <li> I started to notice a change within the first couple of days using it.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Much to my suprise, this stuff worked!  </li>
            <li> At first i thought it wasn’t working at all: the pimples improved during the fist week</li>
            <li> Small bottle for a big price, but you get great results!!!!</li>
            <li> Well everything keeps getting better with time, my existing pimples have almost completely disappeared and I’m not getting new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Not only is the skin softer, but it is super smooth as well.</li>
            <li> I kid you not baby baby soft !!!! .</li>
            <li> My hands remains busy even till now !!!!    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty excited to see how far I would&#x27;ve come at the half-way point of this</li>
            <li> This is our 2nd bottle and will certainly re-order, as this product has introduce a great deal of confidence in my gf which was lost for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m down to the bottom and will be getting more!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy someone have taken this problem seriously, and helped me and others.</li>
            <li> I look way better naked and have a bunch of confidence in intimate situations now.  </li>
            <li> Was very surprised how well and quickly this worked.  </li>
            <li> The order came quickly and was exactly what I wanted, it does clear up acne</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the first night I applied the product on my bottom, I felt very relieved.</li>
            <li> And since this is such an embarrassing issue for me a woman and I&#x27;m sure for a lot of people I highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t completely clear my acne, I did notice tremendous results.</li>
            <li> I was upset to see i still had acne scars after using the whole bottle, thats what i pretty much baught it for</li>
            <li> but it seemed to mildly help even with old scaring.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin super soft.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and has results very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I had these large cysts/boils.</li>
            <li> But almost in the same time, i saw that even tho this new outbreak was happening, my skin seemed alot better in between -</li>
            <li> It took away a significant amount of redness and blemishes but did&#x27;t seem to rid the bumps that appeared to be the same size as my first application.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day as directed and noticed a clear up during the first day of use!  </li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and free of little bumps and zits.</li>
            <li> I had one surface right before my period, which is relatively normal I think, and I have one, maybe two more super small ones.</li>
            <li> My pimpled up rear was such a huge insecurity of mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge outbreaks now but an occasional pimple.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my back and it has kept that area acne free as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really worked for me</li>
            <li> I actually received this product, for free, through Poshly.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re really inflamed-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone that needs it!</li>
            <li> The only plus side is that this stuff is odor free and didn&#x27;t bleach my clothing.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with having this type of body acne my whole life.  </li>
            <li> so you do not need to use so much.</li>
            <li> Scarring is also very susceptible in that region.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been an absolute miracle for me.</li>
            <li> Got it fast</li>
            <li> I look in the mirror now with so much confidence that I didn&#x27;t know I even had.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with this embarrassing problem since high school and have tried EVERYTHING!  </li>
            <li> I have had acne on my butt my whole life.</li>
            <li> I had this problem) told me I have such a smooth bum.</li>
            <li> All thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> It worked for some acne on my thighs, not too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from this embarrassing problem!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I discovered sulfur about a year ago and it was an amazing find, especially for those of you that swear by benzoyl peroxide but are tired of it bleaching everything you own</li>
            <li> I have been using but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li> and it is really clearing up my butt</li>
            <li> nothing has ever cleared them up that fast.</li>
            <li> Nobody wants to admit that they might have an issue like this, but it happens.</li>
            <li> I Highly Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like this &amp;#34;butt acne&amp;#34; product</li>
            <li> This works really well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use all that much at all</li>
            <li> but it still feels very sticky.</li>
            <li> As much as I like the results, I&#x27;m going to have to find something else.</li>
            <li> It really clears up the acne</li>
            <li> This is only the second time I have experienced breakouts on my back and butt</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> For the price I haven&#x27;t seen much if any difference after a month</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this lotion would help treat my butt acne.</li>
            <li> It really does.</li>
            <li> It is much softer now.  </li>
            <li> It is very embarrassing that I still get acne on my rear well into my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked really well clearing up my backside.</li>
            <li> So I got very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> After weeks of usage, my butt acne stills persists and I feel very frustrated.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not greasy, no fragrance, and readily water soluble.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use that much, just about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> So for me to leave a review means it really works....</li>
            <li> My skin was so much softer, more so than regular lotion and STAYED soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve religiously used salicylic acid pads to keep my skin clear, but this stuff works much better.</li>
            <li> Makes your tush clean clear and soft!</li>
            <li> I consider mine as, mild case and at first I really didn&#x27;t see any difference, until the 2nd weeks has passed and boy</li>
            <li> In 12 hours, my butt was completely clear!!!  </li>
            <li> Not all clear yet but heading in the right direction.</li>
            <li> This obviously made me excited, but I still didn&#x27;t have too much faith.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s price is a little steep, but honestly, what would you be willing to pay for a clear bum?</li>
            <li> This is something, like many other reviewers,</li>
            <li> At the end of the first month, my butt was completely clear!</li>
            <li> I am sure it would work for other issues as well.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it might feel like constant maintenance, but it&#x27;s easy to work into your daily routine, the same way you might put lotion on after a shower.  </li>
            <li> And since I apply generously I clean the excess on my back &amp; it seems to work there too!</li>
            <li> Prior to application at night, I would clean my rear with a 2% salicylic acid pre-moistened towelette.</li>
            <li> or &amp;#34;Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer&amp;#34; (and no, I don&#x27;t work for Clean and Clear!).</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and my body has always experienced acne problems as long as I could remember - face, back, shoulders etc.  </li>
            <li> I had mild to moderate acne on my booty and also keratosis pilaris.  </li>
            <li> so i can definitely tell you this stuff is super worth it and fast acting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been embarrassed by this problem since I was a teenager, and am so glad I have finally found something that actually works!  </li>
            <li> I will continue buying it for sure because it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that actually seems to help!  </li>
            <li> Firstly, I used it for a couple of days, my butt got better, then I got lazy, stopped using it.</li>
            <li> and I was able go back to wearing short shorts and bikinis again.  </li>
            <li> I have some residual darkish marks from older acne issues (I guess, not an acne expert here)</li>
            <li> as most of us know it isn&#x27;t really acne, there is a scientific name for it, and I&#x27;m not going to waste anymore of your time about that,</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more bottles of this in the future.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s left my skin smooth, clear, and doesn&#x27;t discolor clothes like acne medication would.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a decent size for the price.</li>
            <li> For the first 2 weeks, my skin felt obviously softer but I still got some red bumps or &amp;#34;pimples.&amp;#34; During week 3, I got what felt like a rash on my rear consisting of many, many small colorless bumps all around the skin.</li>
            <li> the only reason why I don&#x27;t give it a 5 rating is the price is steep, but worth it because it really works....</li>
            <li> and I have to say I did notice a major difference in my skin - its a lot smoother and despite the warm weather and being very active now</li>
            <li> I highly recommend if you have an acne problem on your rear and nothing has ever helped.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations because I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne on the butt for 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in hopes that its high price entailed a high quality product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for people with recurring acne, scars, etc.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One day on I was searching through google for a natural product that can clear acne naturally but quickly.</li>
            <li> even while taking Accutane the pimples didn&#x27;t really even stop - they slowed down at first but quickly came</li>
            <li> I am 8 days in to use and completely clear!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another bottle once my first has run out!</li>
            <li> but I like that because it does not feel as sticky as other products and it is easy to spread</li>
            <li> It feels natural and non greasy on the skin, has no harsh chemical smells and as a matter of fact is very gentle feeling and smelling.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped to clear up the acne that occurs from sweating and exercising.  </li>
            <li> It works really fast; within a week I had clear skin.</li>
            <li> I tried nearly &#x27;everything&#x27; and this really cleared me up.</li>
            <li> I have been very self conscious about the acne on my butt over the years.</li>
            <li> The application is very soothing and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever really liked &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; my hiney since it always feels bumpy but curious to see if it did anything, I have to say I can&#x27;t remember the last time my butt felt that supple and smooth (or less bumpy).</li>
            <li> Finally, a solution to a problem that is really simple and easy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across the Butt Acne Clearing Lotion online one day while searching for anything new that I hadn&#x27;t tried yet.  </li>
            <li> However, if it prevents the acne she won&#x27;t need to worry about new scars.</li>
            <li> however still have new cysts forming.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s specifically to treat new acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> But then, after five days of use, i got a new outbreak of bumps.</li>
            <li> I live in Spain, and eventhough courier services were almost the price of the product</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t seem to stop new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also recently tried benzoyl peroxide with success, but this product is a complete package.</li>
            <li> No other skin product has worked so well or quickly for me, and I&#x27;ve been plagued by acne for the last 20+ years.</li>
            <li> skin is just about 100% clear and feeling very soft and spankable!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s very soft), but I have not noticed a reduction in the bumps.</li>
            <li> You might think the price is somewhat high, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive &amp; get razor burn after shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> It is very soft and supple again.  </li>
            <li> After a couple days I stopped getting new pimples, and now 2 weeks later, all that is left is some original redness of the skin</li>
            <li> Have had a clear butt since I posted it!</li>
            <li> I started rubbing about a nickel-sized amount into my booty cheeks every morning and ever night, and saw a completely clear and softer butt in about 3 days!</li>
            <li> So my last resort was to possibly try and get laser treatment, which is obviously costly, when I decided to research one more time to see if anything else had come out.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product that has cleared things up and kept them cleared up.  </li>
            <li> The results were definitely worth the price for me, and I will continue to purchase this product for as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The majority of the acne was cleared within 10-14 days, and again with consistent use it will prevent future breakout.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Not only has it cleared the red bumps significantly</li>
            <li> only problem with the product is the labeling, I find it embarrassing, but I just rip the labels off when I first get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I recommend giving it a try, it&#x27;s not that expensive, as compared to many others, and if it doesn&#x27;t rid your buttne, at least it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks until I started seeing significant progress, then back to once a day for a couple weeks, and I am going to continue every other day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would also recommend exfoliating with granulated sugar in the shower daily ;)</li>
            <li> I will definitely recommend to my girlfriends so they can get themselves ready for bikini season!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne completely, but almost!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it 2 times a day for just about a week &amp; my skin is almost completely cleared up!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle in November and even though I admittedly have not been using it twice a day, it has still been working to clear up existing pimples and prevent new ones from forming.</li>
            <li> Also the lotion is very sticky and does not dry up, it has to be wiped off to avoid getting it on clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy about how this lotion has worked for me, but I was very sad to see it doesn&#x27;t come in a BIGGER bottle</li>
            <li> I usually try to stick to the more natural healing</li>
            <li> I recently did full body makeup on women who would be naked in an adult scene.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that when applying to skin it is not necessary to use a large amount (a dime sized drop per butt cheek should be plenty).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure everyone&#x27;s skin and body chemistry is a little different but this one works well for me.</li>
            <li> and I seen a huge difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> Another few days were gone and my acne was COMPLETELY gone, with the still prevalent smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that as I continue to use this, that my scars and blemishes will completely clear up.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is ready to have clear skin, once and for all.</li>
            <li> While the changes didn&#x27;t occur overnight, I felt the difference in my skin almost immediately and saw the pimples clear up within two weeks.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t just clear it up, but it erased all my acne scars.</li>
            <li> Helps keep my booty skin clear as well as bikini line because it helps prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had this embarrassing problem since I started puberty and to have something that is helping and looks like it is going to clear me up makes me feel ecstatic.</li>
            <li> I recommended for people who don&#x27;t know why the bottom just won&#x27;t clear up.</li>
            <li> Use it but know that acne in this area will keep returning (mine is aggravated by sitting and workout clothes) and that you have to keep using this product in order for things to stay clear.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has almost completely clear it up in TWO days..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s completely clear.  </li>
            <li> I have clear skin, however not in the rear.</li>
            <li> But as far as ridding current buttne it works fast</li>
            <li> Also, while researching this product I noticed reviewers upset because it does nothing to clear up acne scars...</li>
            <li> this lotion seemed to help clear up the breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This product started working instantly to clear up that embarrassing butt acne.  </li>
            <li> My active pimples started to dry out, I’m not getting as many breakouts as i used to -although</li>
            <li> have struggled with since early adolescence and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I applied it for several weeks as instructed, but did not see much of a change.</li>
            <li> It is completely non scented and did not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> Wow, I wish I would have saved my $33 dollars.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by my results.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is only 4 oz which is reasonable to me.  </li>
            <li> and my skin there is just so soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if my backside will ever be totally acne-free but this absolutely reduces it.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with butt acne since I was a teenager (now in my early 40s).  </li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say...</li>
            <li> My 18 year old daughter plays college sports and has been an athlete all of her life</li>
            <li> I started using this lotion and now have a clear and baby soft bum.</li>
            <li> Since I have used this lotion my butt has gotten sooo soft and guess what?</li>
            <li> Change your bath towel and wash towel frequently.  </li>
            <li> Minimizing existing bumps, plus it makes my skin feel SO soft.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m completely flabbergasted by the results.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a week and all ready no razor burn anymore</li>
            <li> And I used to always be so self conscious when I had to go to the beach or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it leaves your skin so soft and</li>
            <li> I suffered outbreaks ever since I was about 12 years old (about to be 30 now).</li>
            <li> I hope that with continuos use it can diminish the appearance considerably.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin, but thankfully I have no irritations.</li>
            <li> 1st of all, I&#x27;m a 39 year old man.  </li>
            <li> I recommend keeping your money, using natural skin lightening soap and cocoa butter for people of color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only noticeable in swimwear, the acne is very visible while I&#x27;m wearing shorts.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin sooooo soft my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin is now.</li>
            <li> My butt is clear and soft.</li>
            <li> This also seems to really help with cystic acne, of which I get the occasional breakout.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about five weeks now and it has completely cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> I will say that it absolutely cleared up the acne on my buttocks and backs of my thighs plus it definitely made a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I would pay several times as much for the results it gave me.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works on keratosis pilaris (red bumps on backs of arms, legs, etc).  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m never self conscious about wearing a bikini.</li>
            <li> whole butt was covered with either big bylls or scars.</li>
            <li> And the outbreak was in old scars.</li>
            <li> It took a total of 4 weeks to start seeing real results.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been a few days but seems smoother softer and better looking..</li>
            <li> some good moisturizers can have similar effects with less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I used it as directed on top of my extreme cleaning routine, but nothing, no positive results, but hopefully will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> I have so many bumps and scars, its ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This product is the first ever acne lotion formulated specifically for the buttocks, it is soothing and begins working instantly, I began seeing results after only 24 hours!</li>
            <li> However, this product helps get you skin back to normal and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After one and a half week, the results really started to show for real.</li>
            <li> However, not many products are available for body acne/keratosis pilaris/other body skin problems.</li>
            <li> Not sure if my butt acne free because of this product</li>
            <li> It arrived only few days after my purhcase, and I used it twice daily for better results.</li>
            <li> and I definitely will buy again when it&#x27;s finished because I haven&#x27;t got a new outbreak since I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several topical treatments, acne clearing face washes on the problem area and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it fixed my problem completely after about 3 weeks of my regime.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin very soft to the touch.  </li>
            <li> the bottle is small but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I never expected it to work so well!</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;ve gone to 5 different dermatologists over 15 years, and tried more prescriptions that I can count.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 6 months now and have been able to drop back to just applying after I get out of the shower every day and it only takes a tiny little amount...</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders dandruff shampoo, fast clearing, but also dries you out, then symptoms creep back, olive oil and scrub and rinse with hot as you can stand water works but time consuming and messy</li>
            <li> I saw a tremendous different not only blemish the dark skin coz of the old acne, it preventing the skin from another outbreak!</li>
            <li> Green Heart Labs has significantly improved my confidence and I can&#x27;t thank them enough!</li>
            <li> You have to use this product consistenly; I finally have clear skin after a month of using it.</li>
            <li> Helps clear up occasional break outs almost overnight.</li>
            <li> not only does it clear you up, it also adds a pleasingly supple touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days now and my bum is almost clear already.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had clear skin on my butt since before i could remember and its the only thing that has ever worked.</li>
            <li> It does not help clear butt acne scars/discolorations, but it does help prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also leaves your butt extra soft, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I use daily and my bottom stays so soft.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried several different lotions, creams, and cleansers that all have claimed to work magic.</li>
            <li> For my entire adult life I have been embarrassed to wear swim suits or shorts for fear that a pimple or acne scar would be visible.  </li>
            <li> After using the lotion for 1 week , Yes 1 week !!!!, with my eyes  and hands as proof,  95 % of the acne was gone and it left her butt baby soft.</li>
            <li> The skin on my upper thigh/butt area is extremely sensitive, so when my legs are exposed during shorts season I have to deal with embarrassing acne.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so embarrassing that I don&#x27;t want my boyfriend to look at my bare butt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems, old scars are even starting to fade!</li>
            <li> I am a busy Mom of two and sometimes skip a day (or 2) and the acne will start to come back.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great.</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely in love and can&#x27;t stop looking at my behind in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick and dries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the product since I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to no avail.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but actually noticed good results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want people I live with seeing that I use such a thing for such an already embarrassing problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product everyday since right after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> This product really does work, IF you use it continuously for at least 2 weeks straight (twice or thrice per day)..</li>
            <li> Once it clears up, you won&#x27;t necessarily need it as often, but I do use a bit just to help keep blemishes from coming back and keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has worked for her sensitive skin on her face and her back.</li>
            <li> It actually made it worse, creating more irritation.</li>
            <li> Another bonus was the fact it did not dry my skin out at all which for</li>
            <li> I was sceptical about spending $30 on acne cream initially, but it really is worth every cent, and one bottle lasts a few months.</li>
            <li> The lotion still would not dry up after 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does not dry out or bleach clothing, which is a bonus.</li>
            <li> Not only have my break outs not cleared up, I&#x27;ve actually broken out a bit more.</li>
            <li> Even though the price seems a little high, a friend of mine told me a prescription version of this is nearly $85.00 WITH insurance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little while, but it has certainly cleared up the issue so far.  </li>
            <li> I am a little hesitant about buying products online without trying them out first</li>
            <li> I decided to order the product even though the price was a little steep, but I figured I was willing to try if the product was so well</li>
            <li> It is expensive, and if you do 2 applications/day as recommended, you&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quick.</li>
            <li> I got lots of stretch marks while pregnant and for some reason will get big, red, cystic like blemishes in the stretch marks (maybe one or two) and seemed to always have a few smaller bumps scattered throughout.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive and shipping to Australia is really costly but is worth the money!</li>
            <li> As far as the product I will continue buying it as long as it continues working as well as it has been for 5 months.</li>
            <li> In the mean time I will probably use other products to help with the healing process, but I really love this brand.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lotion; it truly was made for relief of acne of the butt, unlike other products made for the face.</li>
            <li> In my morning showers, about every other day, I would lightly exfoliate using a mesh sponge and a liquid body soap (sometimes plain, sometimes Neutrogena&#x27;s 2% salicylic acid grapefruit liquid body soap; I mixed it up).</li>
            <li> but a few times a week to do get one or two large zits.</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle, with just a little bit of exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth this high price.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement with the dark spots left from previous breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for 3 months now and it is only half empty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a life saver, especially for someone who is extremely self conscious about their skin.</li>
            <li> My behind eventually became as clear and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and even the marks of past acne have either faded, or disappeared completely.</li>
            <li> Dark spots/scars are much lighter or completely gone, acne has significantly decreased and my skin feels much smoother.</li>
            <li> For me it&#x27;s due to riding horses and bikes frequently.  </li>
            <li> Since puberty, this has been an extremely embarrassing problem for me (I&#x27;m 22 years old now).</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure of the exact results because I have not used it long enough to know whether it works or not.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and cannot wait to see what happens over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> For the last few years I was starting to get a new zit</li>
            <li> Before using this lotion, I would get at least 1-2 breakouts weekly and get so frustrated, filled with embarrassment not ever wanting to wear anything short and sexy</li>
            <li> Once acne is cleared use less frequently, maybe 2-3 times a week but definitely don&#x27;t stop.</li>
            <li> Thanks Green Heart Labs!</li>
            <li> Butt acne is something that is pretty common but not always talked about.</li>
            <li> I wonder if they used it long enough and if they followed the directions.</li>
            <li> After my recent trip abroad I started getting some acne on my butt from sitting on the airplane too long on a 14 hour flight.  </li>
            <li> They cleared up the existing ones within a few days and have kept any new ones at bay.  </li>
            <li> After two and a half weeks, my rear was clear.  </li>
            <li> I even stopped using fabric softner, used detergent for sensitive skin, and got an all natural soap thinking it would at least lesson the severity from all the articles and reviews I had read.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the label is very blunt and can&#x27;t be removed</li>
            <li> Slow process, it doesn&#x27;t clear it completely</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion last year but never really stick to using it daily</li>
            <li> No new undesirable acne appeared and I am starting to see a slight difference where the old pre-existing blemishes have been.  </li>
            <li> after one single day of using this product (once in the morning and once at night), the goose bump skin that i always had was gone, not to mention actual pimples.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout ever since using this lotion religiously.</li>
            <li> Anything that rids my face and butt from cystic acne and leaves me able to go out with little to no make up gets 5 stars any day!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for nearly three weeks now, and only a small dime sized dab twice daily.  </li>
            <li> I applied after every shower and let air dry as long as possible before putting on clothing.  </li>
            <li> I alternate every other shower with salicylic acid wash and 10% benozoil peroxide wash because they work in different ways).  </li>
            <li> I truly have no idea what makes this product any different from other skin lotions or topical acne treatments.</li>
            <li> but i gave it time mainly because i spent $30 in such a small bottle and because it did make my skin smoother.  </li>
            <li> You have to be diligent and patient and do this for at least 2-3 weeks straight</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with small red breakouts on my rear for as long as I can remember even though the rest of my body and face are clear.</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose, it really helps but at least with me wasn&#x27;t miraculous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few weeks and the only blemishes left are the scars (which are also starting to fade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After starting to use it 2x per day, slowly but surely my back side started to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I had this butt problem from a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with bum acne on and off for a long time and</li>
            <li> Before my rear had embarrassing red pimples and felt really rough.  </li>
            <li> Did nothing for me a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> I would dread riding my bike long distances because I was worried about the bumps.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to work, and has cleared my rear.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with butt acne for a long time and never thought they made anything specifically for it.</li>
            <li> There was no sensitive reaction to the product either.  </li>
            <li> It does not clear up the scars.</li>
            <li> My acne went from my upper back down to my lower buttocks.</li>
            <li> My skin was less red and what was left of the acne was no longer as inflamed as it was.</li>
            <li> This cream does work really well, but the container size is small for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> I have suffered from this since as long as I can remember!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only applied this every other day twice a day for the past two weeks and my skin already has almost completely cleared up!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a extremely embarrassing problem and this product is the only thing that has worked for me after all my searching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to wear shorts or regular bikini bottoms from embarrassment of my bad skin on my butt &amp; legs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really depends on how serious your condition are.</li>
            <li> but I would rather have some dry skin than acne.</li>
            <li> I use a generous, nickel-sized amount, and although it does leave a bit of a sticky residue that takes a minute or two to dry, this stuff WORKS.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even remember the last time it didn&#x27;t have an active breakout.</li>
            <li> A few months later, acne came back.</li>
            <li> Good product, very expensive, just a small bottle</li>
            <li> It has a thick creamy lotion consistency (a little bit sticky when dried, but its fine if you use cotton underwear)</li>
            <li> No new breakouts.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get rid of dark spots left by acne.</li>
            <li> (my acne seems to get worse on my rear when I work out in the hot weather).</li>
            <li> Each summer as I grow older, I seem to have an acne breakout- on my face, my back, and this year my behind.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this product for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I find that the lotion not only clears up acne, but it also helps to lighten the scars from previous blemishes.</li>
            <li> The scars got grotesk (black and red), and seeing it would make</li>
            <li> He gets acne on his upper back (usually from running and sweating in the heat as well).</li>
            <li> They just prescribe super expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Skin is softer and acne is going away with no new breakouts!</li>
            <li> that were painful and now my bum is clear and free of any bumps and has lightened scars from previous bumps....</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product because I had never heard of it before and like many other people</li>
            <li> A little background on my acne, it&#x27;s very deep and hurtful cystic acne on my face and bottom.</li>
            <li> However, he is not consistent because he could care less what his back looks like.</li>
            <li> The benefit to this stuff is that it smells better than other sulfur products and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry the skin as badly</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it</li>
            <li> My lifelong problem is now gone.</li>
            <li> I only use this maybe every few days</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Heart Labs for giving me back my self confidence!!!</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks it went away and hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> its been such a life saver, For years I was never comfortable wearing a swimsuit or being at the beach with my girlfriend.</li>
            <li> Only had this product a few days and the results are already showing.</li>
            <li> It only took a few days to start working for me.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is you have to keep up with the application and it does take a few weeks to work.</li>
            <li> I have had maybe a tiny few pimples show up</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this would work, but within a few weeks of using it my skin has totally cleared up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> i have been using in for two weeks and really no difference</li>
            <li> Was hestitant to try this item, I suffer from Keratosis(inflamed hair follicals), steroid creams help some but never really healed my buttocks.</li>
            <li> This lotion is missing one key ingredient: salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactive and proactive plus, facial scrubs (which do help, but it&#x27;s abrasive and leave the skin raw.)</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way....</li>
            <li> If the zit isn&#x27;t completely gone by the morning it is at least less noticeable</li>
            <li> my other hygiene products we&#x27;re not named after one of the issues they treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the other manufacturers did not make statements about the people who buy their products the way that you did.</li>
            <li> I was having no luck with any other lotions/washes, so combing this with my body scrub and a toner is relieving beyond all belief.</li>
            <li> In just a week, I noticed a smoothness and softness not found with other products I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for clearing acne on body skin and they did nothing for the buttock acne.</li>
            <li> I no longer any other lotion.</li>
            <li> Still, other sulfur products are cheaper if your looking to save a buck (or $35).</li>
            <li> So in other words, you&#x27;ll have to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I use the Acne Clearing lotion twice a day along with other products.  </li>
            <li> I am now recommending this to clients and other makeup artists to use all of the body including the face.</li>
            <li> I started using this about every other day</li>
            <li> I faithfully use twice daily and over the past 3 weeks there has been a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> at first I thought this was too expensive for an acne lotion that might be just like the others.</li>
            <li> No more butt and inner thigh acne!</li>
            <li> It does make your rear a little dry</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> , the pimples i get now are smaller, less painful and disappear quickly.  </li>
            <li> (It does not stain or bleach fabric, but I did try to let it dry for a few minutes before putting on clothes.</li>
            <li> this is not that expensive as some people have said, it&#x27;s a large bottle 4oz for around $40 with shipping.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend because as anyone with lower body acne knows, finding solutions that work is ridiculously hard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d had a pretty bad case for several years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived last late month, and I have used it twice a day, faithfully.</li>
            <li> but  the dark spot from the acne are still there.</li>
            <li> my dark spots have lightened up.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical but after seeing results and how quickly it began clearing my skin, I am truly shocked.</li>
            <li> I think this product has fake high reviews due to that reason.  </li>
            <li> I mean all acne products come up short on that.</li>
            <li> I would not spend money on any other product!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, just be patient and continue using it and it&#x27;ll work!</li>
            <li> By the 3rd week all my acne was gone, even the dark marks that usually are left behind were gone.  </li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other products by Green Heart Labs.</li>
            <li> Been using it for around two and a half weeks now and the skin is a lot clearer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Let me just say that in a week or less I started visibly noticing a difference of the acne on my rear, and I noticed my skin getting smoother.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week</li>
            <li> and I have been breaking out much less.</li>
            <li> I saw results in less than a week.</li>
            <li> you will feel a slight sting.</li>
            <li> I am wary of such products, especially when they claim a cure for specialized areas of the body.  </li>
            <li> and I wish it were less costly</li>
            <li> less than a dime size.  </li>
            <li> I was somehow hit with this wave of acne on my rear end randomly, with big boils and red spots everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half now and am noticing some results.</li>
            <li> maybe less.  </li>
            <li> less than a week of using this lotion AM/PM</li>
            <li> This combination of tanning bed and lotion worked in less then month.</li>
            <li> After a about a week and a half, I saw a noticeable difference in the amount of bumps.</li>
            <li> The bottle has lasted me about a month but around a week and a half in I started applying a thicker coat.</li>
            <li> just be careful because it will sting a little if the lotion is put on skin that has just been shaved!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of my acne issue for years at this point, and have had little to no success.  </li>
            <li> it seems that I have tried every product on the market with little to no success.</li>
            <li> Or at least for a long time.</li>
            <li> First, I need to clarify that if you&#x27;re waiting for overnight results you&#x27;re in for a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other cures for it, but alas, nothing seemed to work that</li>
            <li> Saw no difference, and felt bad that I spent so much on a bottle!</li>
            <li> I use a little every night after shower and wear cotton.  </li>
            <li> I have always struggled w/ ingrown hairs and a little acne.</li>
            <li> Just a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> , Amlactin lotion seems to work, just a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> Well I have used 1/4 bottle still have a little acne and brown spots I will continue to use the remaining amount to see what happens.  </li>
            <li> I realize that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different and not everyone will get the full benefit, but if you&#x27;re tired of painful and unsightly butt acne, give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Just a bit over priced for the little bottle</li>
            <li> When I found this stuff I was a bit skeptical (I mean its called &amp;#34;butt acne clearing lotion&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> And its taken a little over a week to get rid of the few pimples.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried this or that in the past, and my measly attempts always made everything worse, but this is so easy to use</li>
            <li> I was worried it was a knock off or some scam, but it turned out to be the real deal, don&#x27;t be afraid to spend your money on this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not so much about the money, it&#x27;s about being hopeful for something that leads you to another disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my 30s, and up until a couple weeks ago, I still had them (and even worse than when I was younger).</li>
            <li> , I need to thank the people at customer service for Green Heart Labs.</li>
            <li> Bought this during my pregnancy because hormones made me break out even worse, plus gross preggo sweat.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this lotion and have been using it for a few days already.  </li>
            <li> I had a few blemishes from time to time and none since using this product.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately  it only made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> It softens and I started seeing results within a few days.  </li>
            <li> One of a few products that lives up to its advertisement.</li>
            <li> so I ordered Green Heart just to try it out (can&#x27;t hurt), within A DAY I saw results.</li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few blemishes since, but nothing like before.</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Heart Labs for creating this.</li>
            <li> Iv tried proactive&#x27;s salicylic scrub, and didn&#x27;t see results as well as i have this round.</li>
            <li> It went on without any harsh smell and after about 5 days of application the acne went away</li>
            <li> Waste of my dang time and money, after I bought it I saw it cheaper else</li>
            <li> This product reduced redness and swelling of my acne within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Been using for a few days</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble since.</li>
            <li> Used 1-2 times/day and all bumps cleared up in a few days.</li>
            <li> Green Heart Labs</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for Green Heart Labs But</li>
            <li> I notice a difference if I stop using it for a few days, so I try not to skip.</li>
            <li> I sit in front of a computer for work and exercise everyday...</li>
            <li> I tried a few products before it, but I have noticed a difference with this lotion within two days of application (twice a day).</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affective and you see results within few days.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> It started ten years ago, and with no treatment that helped, it got worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So i kept using (heavily).</li>
            <li> Another waste of money;</li>
            <li> I use to get a few bumps at once</li>
            <li> Takes less than a week to see results!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the price, the bottle is really tiny and in 4-5 weeks I’ve already been through half of it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy being a woman.</li>
            <li> When it came and I opened the box, I was a little worried when I saw how small the bottle</li>
            <li> I also rub a little on my thighs and it has cleared up ingrown hairs and small bumps</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong,  after reading some the reviews, I was still skeptical because there were so many different reviews, but I was desperate</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say alittle bit goes a long way (1 thin layer of lotion over skin).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive, that&#x27;s the only drawback.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, so only use a little bit morning and night.</li>
            <li> price is a little steep, but I guess it just depends on how fed up you are!</li>
            <li> if you have problems down there, give it a shot!!</li>
            <li> The name is rather crude &#x27;butt&#x27; (haha)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful to have stumbled across green hearts labs!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would recommend this to someone</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this cream actually works.  </li>
            <li> I seen some reviews where people are saying it did nothing for them and that it may be fake or a scam, my personal opinion is that may be the fault of the amazon seller.</li>
            <li> wish Green Heart Labs would come up with a butt acne scar/dark spot eraser or something one day!</li>
            <li> I suffered small acne because of the hormon imbalance.</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Heart Labs!</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Hearts Lab!</li>
            <li> No more bitty pimples.</li>
            <li> I was too embarrassed feeling as if no one would see past my pimpled bums.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this lotion (especially with the embarrassing name!)</li>
            <li> I was terribly uncomfortable wearing a bikini, wearing shorts, and especially having sex!</li>
            <li> Removes discoloration from past bumps too.</li>
            <li> But unfortunately, after using it twice/day for three weeks, it simply did not do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> EVERYONE should see a Naturopath Dr at some point in their lives…that is how I found out what was wrong after YEARS of just dealing with this problem, among others…regular Dr could never properly diagnose and their solution was ALWAYS to just write prescription after body damaging prescription).</li>
            <li> Thank you Green Heart Labs!</li>
            <li> It takes a small amount in the morning and at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> but they are not the cystic acne that I usually have on my period.</li>
            <li> The difference is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> He has let me try this a few times and WHAT a difference!</li>
            <li> Not sure I would try this product again.</li>
            <li> and yes, as others stated makes your butt really soft, very weird to speak of...</li>
            <li> only problem I have with it is the name.. how awkward would it be for someone to find this in your bathroom :/</li>
            <li> we all know, its hard to find anything about this online, but some how i came across this add this summer.</li>
            <li> I got the same result (softer skin, fewer chicken bumps, continued acne) by using AmLactin lotion.</li>
            <li> I figured it can&#x27;t hurt to at least give it a go</li>
            <li> It was rather embarrassing to say the least</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a day, twice if I remember.</li>
            <li> but then again it&#x27;s very expensive for such a small bottle and</li>
            <li> It works slowly, but it does work.</li>
            <li> and I see the slow exfoliation taking place.  </li>
            <li> That could mean anything to anyone.</li>
            <li> Although there was a drawback due to the price ( I almost didnt buy it because it so expensive)</li>
            <li> after 3 to 4 days it worked no more breakouts!</li>
            <li> No magic for me!</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing butt acne for me!</li>
            <li> No more bumps on my rump!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical per usual, but I have been using it 2 times a day for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> there are no more tough pimples or signs of bothersome acne.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the acne came back after I stopped using it after a few weeks (as it&#x27;s expensive!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The thing is, if you&#x27;ve got a serious problem, you&#x27;ll probably buy this at any price.  </li>
            <li> Seriously this is a miracle.</li>
            <li> Seriously clears up everything.</li>
            <li> I had horrible acne on my back and  buttocks as I am starting to go through menopause</li>
            <li> This product seriously works.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as always since I had little hope at this point, but decided \\&quot;what the hell, might as well try it.\\</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;buttne&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a concern that others may see it, however mine is painful and has left scars.  </li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it!</li>
            <li> I know that sounds crazy, and totally unrealistic, but I saw some reduced redness and inflammation the next morning.</li>
            <li> For the first time something cleared up my horrible butt acne.</li>
            <li> The relentless butt pimples just made me straight up miserable, so I did some research online, stumbled upon clearbutt.com, and read up on the butt acne clearing lotion.</li>
            <li> amd veggies so still experiencing acne all over is frustrating.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried everything from peroxide to coconut oil!</li>
            <li> and then once they disappear they leave ugly dark scars.</li>
            <li> I was a little shocked when I saw the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some lotions/cleansers/astringents are so harsh and painful-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with very painful acne/cysts on my butt for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> My complaint is that I find it smells really bad and is sticky even after it dries.</li>
            <li> I got desperate recently after a particularly bad and painful outbreak.  </li>
            <li> Silly name and a bit pricey</li>
            <li> A very short time ago I was looking at my rear in the bathroom window and just being disgusted with how it looked.  </li>
            <li> Its expensive though.</li>
            <li> I was totally insecure before using this lotion, and I tried every thing in order to reduce those harmful pimples until I found this medicine .</li>
            <li> despite the silly name.</li>
            <li> No more booty bumps!!!!</li>
            <li> I researched it online, read all the reviews and skeptical as I was I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> Sadly it did not work on the butt.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but decided to give it a try</li>
            <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;miracle acne clearing butt lotion&amp;#34; being completely skeptical, but this stuff is</li>
            <li> It is expensive indeed.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless remedies, face ance treatment, terrible idea.  </li>
            <li> I thought because it was so expensive that it would work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this product, but figured I had nothing to lose.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over two months and it hasn&#x27;t cleared it up completely unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the lotion is very thin</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought and used this product for 3 weeks, applying twice daily. It actually made it worse, creating more irritation. The acne did not go away.</li>
            <li> Yes, this stuff is pricey, but this has been the first lotion or product of any kind that has cleared up the acne and breakouts I get from sweating during workouts.  This has worked great for me and makes your skin so soft!  This will be my fourth order of this amazing cream.  I only use it once a day but I have been diligent and make sure I don&#x27;t skip a day, and I am very satisfied with the results.  Very pleased to have smooth skin for the first time in a long time, on my bottom.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. I got the same result (softer skin, fewer chicken bumps, continued acne) by using AmLactin lotion.</li>
            <li> The order came quickly and was exactly what I wanted, it does clear up acne better then anything else I have tried&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no cons about this seller</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in fact made me breakout.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not, works great. I ride a LOT, so that&#x27;s why things are like they are, and this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> Clears everything right up would get again</li>
            <li> Greart product and prompt mail</li>
            <li> Love the lotion. I use it as a zit zapper... I do not have terrible acne but a few times a week to do get one or two large zits. I apply the lotion to the zits only just before going to bed. If the zit isn&#x27;t completely gone by the morning it is at least less noticeable and I don&#x27;t even have to pick at anything!</li>
            <li> This cream does work really well, but the container size is small for the price I paid! I know the blemishes will come back as soon as I run out, so it&#x27;s going to be pricey.</li>
            <li> This product is great! The name is rather crude &#x27;butt&#x27; (haha) it definitely does work. Been using it for around two and a half weeks now and the skin is a lot clearer and smoother. I would recommend it to anyone who can&#x27;t seem to get rid of those pesky red bumps. It is expensive and shipping to Australia is really costly but is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase this because of the price but it was truly worth it. This is something, like many other reviewers, have struggled with since early adolescence and nothing worked. It&#x27;s held me back from getting close with anyone. After I started using this, I noticed results one day after.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not great.</li>
            <li> Stop reading reviews and click buy it now. Takes 2-weeks to see results for me. Once acne is cleared use less frequently, maybe 2-3 times a week but definitely don&#x27;t stop. NOTHING ELSE HAS WORKED FOR ME. Silly name and a bit pricey but it works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pimples on my butt since I was a baby, and always assumed it was something I&#x27;d be cursed with for the rest of my life. I&#x27;m now in my 30s, and up until a couple weeks ago, I still had them (and even worse than when I was younger). For the last few years I was starting to get a new zit a day- even while taking Accutane the pimples didn&#x27;t really even stop - they slowed down at first but quickly came back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product, bit my e-tongue at the price, and have been applying it (per the instructions) generously 2x a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying it the night I got it, the next morning I woke up and could tell there was already a difference. After a couple days I stopped getting new pimples, and now 2 weeks later, all that is left is some original redness of the skin (that will likely be lightened with more use) and a couple zits that are healing up. This stuff actually works... I almost want to cry looking at my ass in the mirror (maybe once I get in better shape). I&#x27;ve had this problem/embarrassment/issue holding me back for almost 30 years... if you have problems down there, give it a shot!!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS FOR MY FRIEND AND THEY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> I applied it for several weeks as instructed, but did not see much of a change.</li>
            <li> This cream is seriously amazing! It goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all which is a huge plus. It is completely non scented and did not stain my clothes. I also noticed the lotion does absorb very quickly too. I used this for over 2 weeks and I have to say I did notice a major difference in my skin - its a lot smoother and despite the warm weather and being very active now I have not had any breakouts as of yet since applying daily. Another bonus was the fact it did not dry my skin out at all which for an acne product is awesome. I also use it on my back and it has kept that area acne free as well.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to get rid of my acne issue for years at this point, and have had little to no success.  It&#x27;s embarrassing, and something I would very much like to get rid of.  After doing some more research, again, I came across this product.  I was skeptical per usual, but I have been using it 2 times a day for a few weeks now and i have to say, I have never seen something work so well!  I&#x27;m on my way to a totally clear bum, and I love it!</li>
            <li> A very short time ago I was looking at my rear in the bathroom window and just being disgusted with how it looked.  Overall, I&#x27;ve always had sensitive skin, and my body has always experienced acne problems as long as I could remember - face, back, shoulders etc.  My rear has always been bad though, and it has just been something that has bothered me and has given me embarrassment.  I looked up &#x27;butt&#x27; and &#x27;acne&#x27; in Amazon, and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  This was the first product to show up.  Sure, I chuckled at the name, but I just said might as well try it out.  It had great reviews, and the price told me that this stuff must be made well with good ingredients.  Let me just say that in a week or less I started visibly noticing a difference of the acne on my rear, and I noticed my skin getting smoother.  Another few days were gone and my acne was COMPLETELY gone, with the still prevalent smooth skin.  I have been using this product everyday since right after I get out of the shower.  The results are incredible.  My rear is clean and smooth.. there are no more tough pimples or signs of bothersome acne.  I&#x27;ve even started using this on my back since it works so well.  This is absolutely one of the best cosmetic products I&#x27;ve ever used (along with Cetaphil).  I highly recommend if you have an acne problem on your rear and nothing has ever helped.  Don&#x27;t let the name - or the price - scare you away.  This stuff works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really worked for me</li>
            <li> The use of this product was a quick repair to many different attempts.  I am a runner and often have the problem of soreness after the runs.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the help.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped to clear up the acne that occurs from sweating and exercising.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Already seeing improvements!!</li>
            <li> I have had acne on my buttocks since I was a child. This is the first time in my life I haven&#x27;t had to be embarrassed in front of my husband. It works really fast; within a week I had clear skin. I can&#x27;t live without this.</li>
            <li> I actually received this product, for free, through Poshly. While it didn&#x27;t completely clear my acne, I did notice tremendous results. My skin was less red and what was left of the acne was no longer as inflamed as it was. This product even took the itchiness and inflammation out of a mosquito bite I had on my lower back! As I am incredibly allergic to mosquitoes, I was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely continue to use this product and have already recommended it to several people.</li>
            <li> It worked after a couple of days :) a great choice and really satisfying!</li>
            <li> Wow, I wish I would have saved my $33 dollars. This is a joke. I&#x27;m 24 and struggled with breakouts occasionally. I noticed NO difference with this product and used it for a month, exactly as directed. Save your money!!!</li>
            <li> So, okay. You sell a lotion called Butt Acne.&lt;br /&gt;All I can say is that I&#x27;m glad my other hygiene products we&#x27;re not named after one of the issues they treat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was embarrassing enough to have a guest accidentally see a bottle of &amp;#34;Butt Acne&amp;#34; in my bathroom, but imagine if he had seen it next to a bottle of Armpit Bacteria, Face Pustules, and Old-Looking (Lady Speed Stick, Clearasil, Oil of Olay)? Thankfully, the other manufacturers did not make statements about the people who buy their products the way that you did. And that is the reason that I do not have to explain my armpit bacteria problem to guests who see my deodorant because it is simply called Lady Speed Stick. Not &amp;#34;Butt Acne.&amp;#34; Do you have any idea what that name implies? That could mean anything to anyone. So instead of writing you a product review about how great this lotion is, I&#x27;m pretty angry that I had to explain that my butt acne is actually more toward my thigh area, and isn&#x27;t the ravaged teenage faced acme issue that sticks in most people&#x27;s minds when they think of the word acne.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Poshly to try. At first I was like, okay, is this a joke?&lt;br /&gt;Once I got over my initial feelings on the name--talk about needing to take this out of your medicine cabinet and hiding it before company comes!--I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that it works.  It works great.&lt;br /&gt;It also leaves your butt extra soft, which is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because of the price.  I was a little shocked when I saw the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, if you&#x27;ve got a serious problem, you&#x27;ll probably buy this at any price.  If you have a pretty mild problem, you can probably use facewash for about 1/4th of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall amazing products, very happy with my experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than a week and I&#x27;m already seeing results. My skin has become a lot smoother and I have been breaking out much less. I&#x27;m hoping that as I continue to use this, that my scars and blemishes will completely clear up. In the mean time I will probably use other products to help with the healing process, but I really love this brand. It&#x27;s a life saver, especially for someone who is extremely self conscious about their skin. I was having no luck with any other lotions/washes, so combing this with my body scrub and a toner is relieving beyond all belief. I&#x27;m so thankful to have stumbled across green hearts labs!</li>
            <li> You have to use this product consistenly; I finally have clear skin after a month of using it. I also used a body soap for acne which may have helped.</li>
            <li> This lotion is AMAZING!!! I have suffered from this since as long as I can remember! Nothing seemed to cure it. I would break out so bad on my buttocks. Until I came across this. I was unsure at first bcuz it was so pricey! but 3 weeks later I literally have no acne and my scars are going away! Love love this product! Now I can feel more confident in myself! MUST TRY!</li>
            <li> Like others, I was very skeptical about this product. However, not many products are available for body acne/keratosis pilaris/other body skin problems. Out of desperation (and being a product junkie), I tried it out....and could not believe how well it worked. No other skin product has worked so well or quickly for me, and I&#x27;ve been plagued by acne for the last 20+ years. I saw results in less than a week. Skin was softer within 1-2 days, new spots stopped appearing within 1 week, overall excellent visible improvement within 2 weeks, and old spots faded quickly (about a month; normally that would probably take 3-4 months with my skin). It&#x27;s a little expensive, that&#x27;s the only drawback. However, I will continue to repurchase as I&#x27;m extremely happy with the result. Plus I like that it is made in the USA and seems to be a small company, which I am happy to support.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only applied this every other day twice a day for the past two weeks and my skin already has almost completely cleared up!(:</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but it didn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in the texture of my skin (it&#x27;s very soft), but I have not noticed a reduction in the bumps. For the price, I&#x27;ll likely opt to soften my bum a different way.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this thinking it was a cure.  I mean all acne products come up short on that. I was pleasantly surprised by my results.  The bottle is only 4 oz which is reasonable to me.  Might be costly if you have a huge booty.  I use a little every night after shower and wear cotton.  I look way better naked and have a bunch of confidence in intimate situations now.  My butt is smooth to the touch now not bumpy.  This makes a difference even with lights off.</li>
            <li> This product really does work, IF you use it continuously for at least 2 weeks straight (twice or thrice per day)..&lt;br /&gt;It really depends on how serious your condition are. I consider mine as, mild case and at first I really didn&#x27;t see any difference, until the 2nd weeks has passed and boy oh boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a personal note, I need to thank the people at customer service for Green Heart Labs. Amazing service!</li>
            <li> After 12 years of dealing with those embarrassing red bumps and &amp;#34;pimples&amp;#34; on my butt and thighs - this stuff was the cure! It took maybe a week for visible results, but I could tell the next morning that this was working. It&#x27;s been a few weeks and the only blemishes left are the scars (which are also starting to fade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is a little steep, but I guess it just depends on how fed up you are! And I guess what you&#x27;re expectations are. I didn&#x27;t believe it would work and I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;ll get one or two bumps every now and then if I skip a day or something, but it&#x27;s SO much better than what I had before. Will be continuing to purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this during my pregnancy because hormones made me break out even worse, plus gross preggo sweat. Always breaking out on upper thighs and rear. After 3 days I noticed a huge improvement. My skin was so much softer, more so than regular lotion and STAYED soft. I cleared up quickly, which is surprising because I&#x27;ve used sulphur products for face acne and didn&#x27;t get any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re really inflamed- you will feel a slight sting. But overall, I can&#x27;t complain!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been embarrassed to let my husband see my bum for years, but now it&#x27;s downright exciting! : ) after one single day of using this product (once in the morning and once at night), the goose bump skin that i always had was gone, not to mention actual pimples. augh. i&#x27;ve tried this or that in the past, and my measly attempts always made everything worse, but this is so easy to use and it just works great. it&#x27;s been a couple of weeks now, and i still use it twice a day. i still have tiny red dots, but they&#x27;re not raised, and they&#x27;re fading. and my skin there is just so soft. really, i thought i&#x27;d always have that problem, but i&#x27;m so excited about this that i just had to write about it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this lotion for the last 2 years and its a great lotion for my butt acne and maintenance. Excellent product. I wish I had bought this product years ago.  I highly recommend this to anyone that needs it!</li>
            <li> Did not work :(have been using for a couple weeks still have blemishes. Made my skin softer but did not take the pimples away</li>
            <li> It works and works as it says !! Enough said, il keep buying it until it doesn&#x27;t !! Expensive, but worth it</li>
            <li> This truly works. I tried nearly &#x27;everything&#x27; and this really cleared me up. Its expensive though. If you want a cheaper option try the lotion Amlactin.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for my skin. Feels too watery and I would not recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. It works slowly, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this lotion and have been using it for a few days already.  However, I am not sure of the exact results because I have not used it long enough to know whether it works or not. I did do some research and it appears that this product has the best results; therefore, I am hoping that it clears up my butt acne as well considering the price for such a small bottle. The package arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered. I will update this review as soon as some time has gone by and I can see whether it is working on me or not.</li>
            <li> I was totally insecure before using this lotion, and I tried every thing in order to reduce those harmful pimples until I found this medicine . I just recommend it to any person who has the same problem.</li>
            <li> That does not work as advertised</li>
            <li> Something that finally works ~~~~~!</li>
            <li> The only plus side is that this stuff is odor free and didn&#x27;t bleach my clothing.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product !!! Please make a biger bottle !!</li>
            <li> I just started to use it and my skin has improve a lot. I used after I take a bath and it is working for me.</li>
            <li> Acne was gone but when i stop use it come again and worsted</li>
            <li> I recenty bought the Butt Acne clearing lotion because I was desperate. Wearing a bikini was embarrassing with the acne I would get just under my butt cheeks. Although there was a drawback due to the price ( I almost didnt buy it because it so expensive) I am glad I gave it a shot. This lotion is very simple and seems to do a wonderful job. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have that strong chemical smell and that it doesn&#x27;t burn when applied to your skin.  I may have to find something else because of the price or maybe I will just save my money up for it .</li>
            <li> I have dealt with having this type of body acne my whole life.  It&#x27;s so embarrassing, I&#x27;ve tried several other cures for it, but alas, nothing seemed to work that well.  I bought this lotion to try to fix the issue.  When it arrived, I peeled the label off.  I didn&#x27;t want anyone to see I had a bottle of BUTT ACNE lotion in my possession or on my bathroom shelf.  How embarrassing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I began applying it every time I got out of the shower.  I used about the size of a dime in my hand, and rubbed it into my skin.  After two and a half weeks, my rear was clear.  I&#x27;m very happy about how this lotion has worked for me, but I was very sad to see it doesn&#x27;t come in a BIGGER bottle size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Heart Labs, please offer bigger bottle sizes so we can buy in bulk!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using the product and it seems to be working very quickly! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week, so it is not fully cleared but it has improved GREATLY! The lotion does not stink, burn, stain, or cause any slimyness. I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Works GREAT!!! I use it on both my bottom and my chest and can def say that even the PMS acne was kept at bay! Very happy with this product and will continue to purchase!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my back and shoulders for when I work out and break out from sweat. It works!</li>
            <li> I laughed at the name and really didn&#x27;t think it would do much but was intrigued by the reviews. To my surprise not even a week after using it, I can totally tell the difference. Buy it! You&#x27;ll love it...despite the silly name.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd bottle.  I use daily and my bottom stays so soft. I had a few blemishes from time to time and none since using this product. I workout 5 days a week and this product prevents breakouts from workouts.</li>
            <li> I have seriously tried everything from peroxide to coconut oil! My pimpled up rear was such a huge insecurity of mine. It took two weeks to fully work but when it finally gave me the results I&#x27;ve been looking for for years I jumped with joy the bottle is small but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am wary of such products, especially when they claim a cure for specialized areas of the body.  As someone with KP, this product has noticeably and significantly reduced any inflammation I may of had.  In just a week, I noticed a smoothness and softness not found with other products I have tried.  I have been using it for nearly three weeks now, and only a small dime sized dab twice daily.  As the title of my review says, it really works!  Sure, it might feel like constant maintenance, but it&#x27;s easy to work into your daily routine, the same way you might put lotion on after a shower.  It feels natural and non greasy on the skin, has no harsh chemical smells and as a matter of fact is very gentle feeling and smelling.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is ready to have clear skin, once and for all.</li>
            <li> It Reallly Works! Thank you! My lifelong problem is now gone. I was skeptical, but glad I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> This is a similar cream that I got a sample of from a dermatologist. It is very good for rashes and butt pimples.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical of this product because I had never heard of it before and like many other people it seems that I have tried every product on the market with little to no success. HOWEVER, this lotion is amazing and truly works. The consistency of the lotion is very thin but I like that because it does not feel as sticky as other products and it is easy to spread so you do not need to use so much. I would recommend this lotion to anyone who has to deal with acne on their bum...mild or severe. It is a bit pricy but I highly believe most people will be very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I had mild to moderate acne on my booty and also keratosis pilaris.  After using this product for about 2 1/2 weeks twice daily I finally got results.  You have to be diligent and patient and do this for at least 2-3 weeks straight but it did work for me and I am now doing an experiment on the back of my arms where I also have keratosis to see if it will help with that as well.</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year white female. I have always struggled w/ ingrown hairs and a little acne. I have tried several products intended for the face on my rear end but unfortunately  it only made my skin worse. Scarring is also very susceptible in that region. The skin is very different in that area and finally there&#x27;s a product that addresses that! I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> works beautifully to make your rear end softer and smoother!  Dries quickly, does not stain clothes.  Only been using it for about 10 days and i can already see and feel a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with very painful acne/cysts on my butt for as long as I can remember. Since I&#x27;ve started using this stuff 6 months ago, I&#x27;ve had no issues AT ALL. This stuff has been an absolute miracle for me. I wish it was cheaper, but I&#x27;ll pay this price to be able to sit comfortably after so many years of just dealing with the pain.</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this product, I started using it. It takes some time to see full results but it&#x27;s well worth it. I tried everything for several years to get rid of this problem and I finally found a solution. Just before summer, finally a cure! Remember don&#x27;t get discouraged, give it some time!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product! Got it fast and I saw results in four days. I&#x27;m sure everyone&#x27;s skin and body chemistry is a little different but this one works well for me.</li>
            <li> I was at my breaking point thinking I would forever be cursed with this embarrising problem. I had tried numerous of products from Neutrogena body care to Proactive and nothing seemed to work. I even stopped using fabric softner, used detergent for sensitive skin, and got an all natural soap thinking it would at least lesson the severity from all the articles and reviews I had read. So my last resort was to possibly try and get laser treatment, which is obviously costly, when I decided to research one more time to see if anything else had come out. That&#x27;s when I came across this product and it&#x27;s AMAZING! At first I was skeptical but after seeing results and how quickly it began clearing my skin, I am truly shocked. I never expected it to work so well! Also, the lotion makes my skin feel incredibly smooth. I look in the mirror now with so much confidence that I didn&#x27;t know I even had. There is hope in that wonderful lotion. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected as far as consistency , and the result wasn&#x27;t either. Not sure if I would recommend this to someone</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I&#x27;ve tried several different lotions, creams, and cleansers that all have claimed to work magic. Well, this product is simply amazing!! I&#x27;ve been using it for nearly a month now and my skin has changed immensely. Not only is the skin softer, but it is super smooth as well. I find that the lotion not only clears up acne, but it also helps to lighten the scars from previous blemishes. I would recommend this product to anyone dealing with butt acne. While the changes didn&#x27;t occur overnight, I felt the difference in my skin almost immediately and saw the pimples clear up within two weeks. No more booty bumps!!!! ;0)</li>
            <li> It works! After two weeks of using this wonderful product, my butt is clearer (albeit the remaining blemish from previous breakouts) and beautifully softer. My barren butt is full of life once again. I will keep using this product just to ensure this aphrodisiac smoothness.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I believe it is working.  No new undesirable acne appeared and I am starting to see a slight difference where the old pre-existing blemishes have been.  I am definitely going to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, wonderful product.  Suprisingly moisturizes along with great results.  Some lotions/cleansers/astringents are so harsh and painful- this is great for sensitive skin and as of now has smoothed out all my &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; areas!  I would recommend this to anyone with any kind of issues on their back, legs, etc. etc.!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product!! I was very skeptical but after 3 to 4 days it worked no more breakouts! I&#x27;ve tried several different remedies and this is the only one that&#x27;s worked!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying different products for the last 8 years and nothing has worked as fast and good as this lotion!  I bought one bottle and worked so well that I keep buying the 2-pack now every time.  I saw amazing results in just the first 3 days (I use it twice a day). At the end of the first month, my butt was completely clear! Now I keep using it just to prevent breakouts.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this product was going to work but it did I m really happy I highly recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but this cream actually works.  It softens and I started seeing results within a few days.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Love it! Seriously this is a miracle. For the first time something cleared up my horrible butt acne. It didn&#x27;t just clear it up, but it erased all my acne scars. I&#x27;m finishing my first bottle it&#x27;s a bit pricey. Totally worth it even my boyfriend can&#x27;t keep his hands off my rear end. My butt acne was horrible almost cyst like. It works honestly it&#x27;s the best that has happened to my cheeks </li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Seriously clears up everything. It&#x27;s the only things that&#x27;s worked for me and believe me I&#x27;ve tried everything. Love love love</li>
            <li> Its been three weeks and I have to say Im seeing results. I had bad scaring but I can see that there is a change and that it is beginning to lighten!!!! Go ahead and give it a try you will be happy you did!</li>
            <li> Honestly. I read all these reviews and thought to myself &amp;#34;well, good that it worked for them, but it probably won&#x27;t work for me&amp;#34;. I mean, I&#x27;ve gone to 5 different dermatologists over 15 years, and tried more prescriptions that I can count. Orals, creams, gels, washes... you name it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing worked... until butt acne clearing lotion. Now I feel like some weirdo, cause I keep wanting to look at my butt in the mirror! I can&#x27;t even remember the last time it didn&#x27;t have an active breakout. I will never NOT have this in my cabinet again.  What a find!</li>
            <li> miracle in a jar!!! it clears up everything so happy with this stuff!! i plan on getting more soon enough :)</li>
            <li> I used it as directed on top of my extreme cleaning routine, but nothing, no positive results, but hopefully will work for someone else.</li>
            <li> Works well! Wish the bottle was bigger but I&#x27;m definitely a happy gal!!</li>
            <li> Excelent product!!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products (tea tree lotion, witch hazel, stridex acne clearing pads &amp; more) to clear my butt acne &amp; none have worked! This truly has been the best. It worked within the first few days! I love it &amp; will never use anything else! I&#x27;m a lifer!!</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with this embarrassing problem since high school and have tried EVERYTHING!  This is the first and only product that has cleared things up and kept them cleared up.  If you are looking for a for sure product that gets the job done, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would have an unpleasant odor but it doesn&#x27;t. It absorbs quickly into the skin and feels great.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this stuff and I wish it were less costly but this stuff works SO WELL. I&#x27;ve tried other products for clearing acne on body skin and they did nothing for the buttock acne. This one is great. After two days I could already see an improvement. After two weeks my butt had no acne and I&#x27;d had a pretty bad case for several years. Unfortunately the acne came back after I stopped using it after a few weeks (as it&#x27;s expensive!) but I got back on it and my skin is better again. Not only does it get rid of acne but it also softens the skin, a benefit I wasn&#x27;t really expecting but am very happy about. I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure once I run out.</li>
            <li> I have had acne on my butt my whole life. I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for ways to fix it and nothing has worked until now! I heard about this stuff from a friend and have been using it ever since!</li>
            <li> Even though the price seems a little high, a friend of mine told me a prescription version of this is nearly $85.00 WITH insurance! I will continue to purchase this product. Helps keep my booty skin clear as well as bikini line because it helps prevent ingrown hairs. Thanks!</li>
            <li> So far so good, it is working very well it&#x27;s only been a few days but seems smoother softer and better looking..</li>
            <li> I have only just started using this product but it already seems to be working. I cannot wait to see how this product continues to work and improve my skin</li>
            <li> This cleared my acne in a couple of week. If I use once a week, it stays away. My skin is the best it has ever been.</li>
            <li> This really does work!!  I only use this maybe every few days and it still works perfectly!!  I only have little bumps almost like permanent goose bumps and this worked for that perfectly!!  I am sure it would work for other issues as well.  It has really made my skin baby butt smooth!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne on my bum all my life and can&#x27;t believe I never knew about this product til now!  this stuff is amazing truly. yes it is quite pricey but it works!!  Get it!!!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to.  Helps clear up occasional break outs almost overnight. I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I just received this lotion and started it on Friday night (3 days ago) and I can already see the difference! Not all clear yet but heading in the right direction. I have had this embarrassing problem since I started puberty and to have something that is helping and looks like it is going to clear me up makes me feel ecstatic. It does make your rear a little dry but I would rather have some dry skin than acne. I highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> This lotion has smoothed my skin in a matter of days. My skin is so soft and smooth I can hardly believe it!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! Makes your tush clean clear and soft! I recommended for people who don&#x27;t know why the bottom just won&#x27;t clear up. the stuff is magic</li>
            <li> I work out a lot. And from the combo of sweat and tight fitting work out clothes, I have dealt with this humiliating problem forever!!! I am 8 days in to use and completely clear!! Love! And will continue to use!!</li>
            <li> all my life i struggled with body blemishes. so i can definitely tell you this stuff is super worth it and fast acting. not only does it clear you up, it also adds a pleasingly supple touch. so just take a chance, this stuff will change your life!</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product years ago!  It has been a week or so since I have purchased the product and day by day my skin is getting clearer.  Just in time for swimsuit season.  If you are looking at this product wondering, trust the reviews and purchase, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It works!! For years I&#x27;ve been searching for a product and this is a miracle in a bottle! I&#x27;m on my third bottle! However I&#x27;m Scared to stop using it in case my problem comes back...</li>
            <li> I switched birth control and suffered butt breakout as a result.  Drug store stuff cleared to about 75% but still left embarrassing purple spots.  This stuff works but not overnight so stick with it.  I applied after every shower and let air dry as long as possible before putting on clothing.  After about 30 days…much improvement!  I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> Does not work. It&#x27;s not FDA approval.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!  I have always gotten big, red sore acne on my buttocks.  I have exfoliated with various scrubs &amp; loofah pads &amp; even used acne medications but nothing worked.  The first week of using Butt Acne Clearing Lotion my acne grew smaller &amp; I did get more of  breakout but figured (hoped) this was from the good exfoliation the lotion provides.  By the 3rd week all my acne was gone, even the dark marks that usually are left behind were gone.  My booty has never felt so smooth &amp; soft!!  I love it!  I have not had any more breakouts &amp; it has been a couple of months.  Will definitely continue to purchase Butt Acne Clearing Lotion!!</li>
            <li> Each summer as I grow older, I seem to have an acne breakout- on my face, my back, and this year my behind.  Desperate for a solution, I found myself purchasing this product and am very happy with the results after 1 week of use. I have been applying morning and night and 1) love that it barely smells and 2) am so so happy it has cleared the majority of my acne! For those of us who deal with adult acne, this is a great find and well worth the price. I look forward to trying other products by Green Heart Labs. Oh I have also been using this on my bikini line and it seems to lessen the irritation/ingrown hair bumps that happen after shaving!!</li>
            <li> Ok so I will give my honest review of this product. I seen some reviews where people are saying it did nothing for them and that it may be fake or a scam, my personal opinion is that may be the fault of the amazon seller. I purchased mine thru walgreens online (go to any walgreens and return it if your unsatisfied). I absolutely love this product. If I wasnt too embarrassed to post pics I would post  before and afters. My acne went from my upper back down to my lower buttocks. This miracle cream not only cleared my butt acne but took the scars away as well. My butt looks like a baby&#x27;s bottom now! In the beginning I used it twice daily, now I only use it once a month. It has a thick creamy lotion consistency (a little bit sticky when dried, but its fine if you use cotton underwear) it has a light pleasant smell, and the best of all one bottle has lasted me 6 months! Let&#x27;s just say alittle bit goes a long way (1 thin layer of lotion over skin). The only downside is the price. Its pricey for only 4 oz. Also it takes time. My acne cleared up in about 2-3 months with regular use, now I just maintain. Im medium complexion/hispanic heritage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with embarrassing bum acne since puberty and have tried everything there is to try from medicated washes, topical creams, changing laundry detergents a million times...you name it I tried it.  I stumbled across the Butt Acne Clearing Lotion online one day while searching for anything new that I hadn&#x27;t tried yet.  I researched it online, read all the reviews and skeptical as I was I decided to give it a shot.  I figured it can&#x27;t hurt to at least give it a go and boy am I glad I did!!!  After starting to use it 2x per day, slowly but surely my back side started to clear up.  After 2-3 weeks of consistent use I finally had the beautiful, smooth, sexy clear bum I never thought I&#x27;d have!  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 6 months now and have been able to drop back to just applying after I get out of the shower every day and it only takes a tiny little amount...less than a dime size.  I started using the lotion in January and in February bought my first G-string bikini and in March proudly showed off my sexy back side on the beach in Cancun!!  Thank you Green Heart Labs for giving me back my self confidence!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER!!! buy it buy it buy it it works! i&#x27;m so happy with the results definitely going to keep getting this love it!!</li>
            <li> Best acne product by far. Takes less than a week to see results!</li>
            <li> One of a few products that lives up to its advertisement.</li>
            <li> First, I have to acknowledge how fast it came in the mail! At first glance, it looks like regular lotion, smells fine, and feels creamy, in a good way. I put a good amount of the product on my hands and rubbed it on my rear. It feels soothing soon after application. I let it air out for a couple of minutes while I brushed my teeth. I haven&#x27;t ever really liked &amp;#34;feeling&amp;#34; my hiney since it always feels bumpy but curious to see if it did anything, I have to say I can&#x27;t remember the last time my butt felt that supple and smooth (or less bumpy). I&#x27;m pretty excited to see how far I would&#x27;ve come at the half-way point of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish Green Heart Labs would come up with a butt acne scar/dark spot eraser or something one day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty pricey, but it works. My toddler had butt acne and it just was not going away. Found this and tried it out. After just a few weeks it went away and hasn&#x27;t come back. Very happy. Now I just have a lot left and don&#x27;t know what to do with it. But hey, nice problem to have I guess...</li>
            <li> Worked for me....BUT I found that I have to use it daily.  It did a great job of clearing up the problem and minimizing scars.  I thought at one point &amp;#34;I&#x27;m CURED&amp;#34; but then the bumps started coming back.  Use it but know that acne in this area will keep returning (mine is aggravated by sitting and workout clothes) and that you have to keep using this product in order for things to stay clear.  For me anyway it was a not a one month and done.</li>
            <li> I was upset to see i still had acne scars after using the whole bottle, thats what i pretty much baught it for and i saw no results.</li>
            <li> I was somehow hit with this wave of acne on my rear end randomly, with big boils and red spots everywhere. At 23, it&#x27;s super embarrassing! I wouldn&#x27;t even go to the beach one weekend because I didn&#x27;t want to be seen in a bikini. I have a big trip coming up and needed to get it together so I ordered Green Heart just to try it out (can&#x27;t hurt), within A DAY I saw results. Like, significant results. I&#x27;ve only used it for 3 days now and my bum is almost clear already. I will definitely keep using this as a healing and prevention method. SOO happy I stumbled across this product, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been very self conscious about the acne on my butt over the years. After using this product it has cleared it up so well. Today my boyfriend (who doesn&#x27;t know I had this problem) told me I have such a smooth bum. I was so happy inside. Best compliment ever. All thanks to this product. I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with this problem for many years, and it has always affected my confidence and level of comfort (especially in the bedroom)!! I&#x27;ve tried lots and lots of things, and basically came to the conclusion I&#x27;d have to suffer with this for the rest of my life. My mom has the same problem, so I figured I was genetically cursed. I was searching online hoping to come across some type of treatment I hadn&#x27;t heard of or tried yet, and then I came across this miracle lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even tell you how thankful I am. I&#x27;ve been using the lotion for about three weeks now, right before bed each night, and it has worked marvelously. I saw results the very next day. I know that sounds crazy, and totally unrealistic, but I saw some reduced redness and inflammation the next morning. This obviously made me excited, but I still didn&#x27;t have too much faith. With consistent use though, I am almost pimple free! I had one surface right before my period, which is relatively normal I think, and I have one, maybe two more super small ones. Not even noticeable to anyone but myself. I do have some scarring from the years I have suffered with this problem, and thankfully, those are diminishing as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product has given me hope for the future! That sounds silly, but I now feel like I&#x27;ll be able to confidently wear those cute, skimpy bikini bottoms (after a few more trips to the gym!), and I&#x27;m so happy to finally not be self-conscious of this problem in the bedroom. The product&#x27;s price is a little steep, but honestly, what would you be willing to pay for a clear bum? The results were definitely worth the price for me, and I will continue to purchase this product for as long as they sell it.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try the Butt Acne clearing lotion because I have tried so many products and nothing has worked. I was not disappointed this time. After just one week, a condition that I have dealt with for years seemed to be under control. After three weeks, it seems to have disappeared! I would highly recommend this product. It is truly amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been embarrassed by this problem since I was a teenager, and am so glad I have finally found something that actually works!  I have tried different routines with different face washes in hopes they would work, with no results.  I have also tried coconut oil after reading it might help... NOTHING worked till I tried this!</li>
            <li> Have struggled with acne for many years and nothing has worked. I&#x27;ve seen countless dermatologists that have prescribed things, to no avail. This works like a charm! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this butt acne issue for many years, I&#x27;ve been using this for 4 months and it really works well.  I find it works best on a clean and dry &amp;#34;area&amp;#34; and slathered on fairly thick.  I apply it 1-2 times per day.  I will continue buying it for sure because it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve tried that actually seems to help!  I don&#x27;t know if my backside will ever be totally acne-free but this absolutely reduces it.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with body acne for years especially in this embarrassing area.  This is the only product which has delivered its promises!  The majority of the acne was cleared by the end of the week and the larger pimples were greatly reduced in size.  I will be using this product for a long time!!</li>
            <li> It works, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations because I&#x27;ve been dealing with acne on the butt for 5 years now. Sadly it did not work on the butt. It worked for some acne on my thighs, not too much. Just a little. I would give it a try just because it might work for you but it did not work for me. I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 2 weeks...no change.</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a little over a week now and I&#x27;m impressed. My skin is soft and haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I&#x27;ve been using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from leg and buttock acne for most of my adult life. This stuff really works. You might think the price is somewhat high, but as the old saying goes, you get what you pay for. Try it, what do you have to lose? (&#x27;cept for those damn pimples!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month &amp; it has completed cleared up my skin. I only used it once a day every morning after showering. My skin is very sensitive &amp; get razor burn after shaving my legs. This helps my skin for every blemish. I no longer any other lotion. Clears up face also!</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly in skins , leaves no greasiness ..No itching or burning ,helps a lot in the breakouts in the skin. Works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with butt acne since I was a teenager (now in my early 40s).  I got desperate recently after a particularly bad and painful outbreak.  The lotion came and with a couple of days there was a noticeable difference, and after a week, the difference was amazing.  I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from this embarrassing problem!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  I was skeptical but decided to give it a try and it was great!  Cleared up my skin in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve religiously used salicylic acid pads to keep my skin clear, but this stuff works much better. I&#x27;ve had a few blemishes since, but nothing like before. It is expensive, and if you do 2 applications/day as recommended, you&#x27;ll go through the bottle pretty quick. For me though, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow, what can I say...I purchased this &amp;#34;miracle acne clearing butt lotion&amp;#34; being completely skeptical, but this stuff is legit!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived last late month, and I have used it twice a day, faithfully. My behind eventually became as clear and smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, and even the marks of past acne have either faded, or disappeared completely. This lotion does work, but not instantly. Follow the instructions, and use it twice a day, morning and night. Just stick with it, and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. After about a week or so, I got the results that I was looking for! From then on, it just kept getting better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had bouts with &amp;#34;butt acne&amp;#34; since puberty, and no matter what I did and tried, nothing seemed to work...Up until now that is! So happy to have discovered this awesome product. I&#x27;ll definitely be picking up another bottle once my first has run out!</li>
            <li> I discovered sulfur about a year ago and it was an amazing find, especially for those of you that swear by benzoyl peroxide but are tired of it bleaching everything you own (I was one of those people). The benefit to this stuff is that it smells better than other sulfur products and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry the skin as badly (I use it primarily on my back for back acne). Still, other sulfur products are cheaper if your looking to save a buck (or $35).</li>
            <li> I have been using but I don&#x27;t really notice a difference</li>
            <li> It really works! I had this butt problem from a long time. I thought it were fungal infection or dermatitis. But neither anti-fungal or hydrocortisone stuff could ever relieve it. Then I decided to give Amazon a try and found this lotion. It is expensive indeed. Firstly, I used it for a couple of days, my butt got better, then I got lazy, stopped using it. A few months later, acne came back. I went back to this lotion and used it regularly for a couple of weeks. Now it is finally MUCH better.    Hope my experience helps you make the right decision and wish you a tender butt!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write product reviews but this lotion is incredible. I workout a lot and have been plagued with acne on my rear end for years. I have tried almost everything to get rid of it once and for all. This lotion has almost completely clear it up in TWO days.. Thank you Green Heart Labs for creating this. I feel so much more confident already!!</li>
            <li> It worked at the begining but then it stopped working... Been using coconut oil lately and seen very good results, plus it&#x27;s way cheaper!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone with bumps or redness on their behinds! My acne and discoloration was gone within two weeks. My bikini life has been saved forever!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great results so far! Iv tried proactive&#x27;s salicylic scrub, and didn&#x27;t see results as well as i have this round. One bottle lasts much longer than you&#x27;d think too! So happy I took the chance and made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I would not spend money on any other product! This is the ONLY thing that has ever cleared my body acne 100%.   I was searching for an acne product, for body acne, specifically. This stuff is amazing. It works perfectly for facial acne, too. I&#x27;ve used proactive and proactive plus, facial scrubs (which do help, but it&#x27;s abrasive and leave the skin raw.) This is by far my favorite product. There&#x27;s no pain, use it just like lotion and It leaves the skin so smooth. I&#x27;ll use it at night, and in the morning, it&#x27;s cleared up.   I can&#x27;t imagine how it couldn&#x27;t work for everyone. It&#x27;s honestly worth every penny. Once it clears up, you won&#x27;t necessarily need it as often, but I do use a bit just to help keep blemishes from coming back and keep my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review some time ago. I have to write again. This stuff is amazing and I&#x27;m disappointed to see others giving it bad reviews. I wonder if they used it long enough and if they followed the directions. I had horrible acne on my back and  buttocks as I am starting to go through menopause so my hormones are changing. I had these large cysts/boils. This is amazing. The description never said anything about removing scars. It doesn&#x27;t claim to be a scar remover. My 18 year old daughter plays college sports and has been an athlete all of her life so she sweats a great deal and has had acne problems for many years. This is the only thing that has worked for her sensitive skin on her face and her back. She is African American and has eczema as well.  It does not clear up the scars. However, if it prevents the acne she won&#x27;t need to worry about new scars. I, too, wish I could post a before and after picture. I also love the fact that it is cruelty free as I am an animal advocate.</li>
            <li> An amazing product it worked wonders</li>
            <li> I rate this 5 stars because I no longer have to be ashamed of my booty! Its soft and smooth now.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I heard wonders about it and read reviews and I am so happy it is specific for the problem.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. I suffered from this annoying folliculitis for 8 months. Antibiotics helped the problem,  however once I was off of them,  some of the bumps kept reoccuring. I started using this lotion and now have a clear and baby soft bum. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more to make sure the bumps don&#x27;t come back. Like other reviewers said, just be patient and continue using it and it&#x27;ll work!</li>
            <li> I bought this for because for years I had problems with acne on my rear end. I tried all kinds of washes and creams.. but nothing helped. I came across this lotion on the internet and read all the great reviews and decided to give it a try. Since I have used this lotion my butt has gotten sooo soft and guess what? My acne is gone! I would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Have had a clear butt since I posted it! It seems to be helping any blemishes I have as well! Definitely recommend because as anyone with lower body acne knows, finding solutions that work is ridiculously hard. This stuff does!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, and does exactly what it says, I will def recommend to others who also suffer from butt acne!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week and a half now and am noticing some results. At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was working, but gave it some time and it is really clearing up my butt and I am not seeing acne coming back. I highly recommend this product and cannot wait to see what happens over the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best beauty product I&#x27;ve ever purchased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My plastic surgeon recommended this for my back acne and he also told me I could use it basically anywhere I had acne. I use it on my back and my face. I use it morning and night on face and my skin is beautiful, soft and my pores even look smaller!!! I use this as a primer for my makeup (powder foundation) an I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of complements on how great my skins looks. I&#x27;ve also used it on my butt to make my skin softer and now my butt is as smooth as baby skin. I also had those bumps on the back of my arms so I put this on it 2 nights in a row and they are gone.. nothing has ever cleared them up that fast. I&#x27;m so impressed with product I&#x27;ve told all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this is not that expensive as some people have said, it&#x27;s a large bottle 4oz for around $40 with shipping. Any department store product is around 1.7oz and the same price or more and doesn&#x27;t even work. You can&#x27;t compare this to something you can buy at Target because all of those products are same.They are either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide and this product has neither of these in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with it is the name.. how awkward would it be for someone to find this in your bathroom :/</li>
            <li> I ordered this product about 4 months ago and I still have spots. Its no longer any acne occuring but  the dark spot from the acne are still there. It does make your butt softer thought.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! If you are a regular exerciser and wear workout clothes you know how some areas can get. This stuff eliminates booty hurts quickly.</li>
            <li> After struggling for years with acne on my buttocks, I began to lose hope in finding a solution. Finally, I came across this product and decided to try it, and by golly it worked! I no longer have to worry about embarrassing blemishes peeking out when going to the pool! Green Heart Labs has significantly improved my confidence and I can&#x27;t thank them enough!</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Smooths and clears your butt from breakouts. It&#x27;s a really good product. I gave it 4 stars because it does the job BUT after you stop using it, your breakouts come back. So in other words, you&#x27;ll have to keep buying it. I hope they make a formula to where you only have to use one bottle to stop breakouts from coming back forever! Or at least for a long time.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I&#x27;m 3/4 of the way through my first bottle and I see the slow exfoliation taking place.  The texture of my skin has greatly improved.  It is very soft and supple again.  I love it!!  I use the Acne Clearing lotion twice a day along with other products.  My routine:  At every shower (which is sometimes twice a day) I alternate every other shower with salicylic acid wash and 10% benozoil peroxide wash because they work in different ways).  I also use Hibiclens wash every 3 days because it kills staph.  Staph bacteria is what gets inside your follicules and causes the acne.  I&#x27;ve had this forever so I&#x27;m an expert. Change your bath towel and wash towel frequently.  Shower immediately after exercise...no sitting around in sweaty yoga pants and stopping for coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is just about 100% clear and feeling very soft and spankable!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! I have been using it now for about a week and I definitely notice a difference. Skin is softer and acne is going away with no new breakouts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking every where for a product like this! it works great for the those hard to diminish blemishes. no irritation what so ever. wonderful and fast active ingredients to improve skin on the rear. defiantly a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> This stuff works no questions asked!! Definitely would recommend.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works.  Nobody wants to admit that they might have an issue like this, but it happens.</li>
            <li> After my recent trip abroad I started getting some acne on my butt from sitting on the airplane too long on a 14 hour flight.  It was rather embarrassing to say the least so I bought this to treat it.  The application is very soothing and didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It went on without any harsh smell and after about 5 days of application the acne went away and I was able go back to wearing short shorts and bikinis again.  It also left my skin very soft to the touch.  Works great for its purpose</li>
            <li> Great product with consistent use. Struggled with butt acne for years and this would have been great in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the acne was cleared within 10-14 days, and again with consistent use it will prevent future breakout.</li>
            <li> This product is truly amazing! its been such a life saver, For years I was never comfortable wearing a swimsuit or being at the beach with my girlfriend. This product is the first ever acne lotion formulated specifically for the buttocks, it is soothing and begins working instantly, I began seeing results after only 24 hours! It is fragrance free, and the pH is balanced for the sensitive skin of the buttocks. This product is AMAZING.    I Highly Recommend it!</li>
            <li> I found this product and bought it for the first time because of the rating. When I tried it, it works! I suffered small acne because of the hormon imbalance. I went to see dermatologist a couple of times but they prescribed me with antibiotics. With butt acne clearing lotion, I definitely  see the different. It definitely does the job. I saw a tremendous different not only blemish the dark skin coz of the old acne, it preventing the skin from another outbreak! The lotion make my bottom skin moist too! It nourishes the skin. I use it twice a day, after my morning shower and before I go to sleep. I leave it till it dries up which take only minutes. This is my 2nd bottle and I definitely will buy again when it&#x27;s finished because I haven&#x27;t got a new outbreak since I&#x27;m using it. Love love love this product. Thank you Green Heart Labs!</li>
            <li> Waste of my dang time and money, after I bought it I saw it cheaper else where! Then to top it all off the stuff doesn&#x27;t work. Made my booty break out even more. Didn&#x27;t work on any of my ance anywhere on my body. It does tingle so you think it&#x27;s doing something but nope. No magic for me! This will not work if you have keratosis pilaris &amp;#34;KP&amp;#34;, maybe run of the mill reg ance but it does not work on KP or cycstic ance. If i could give this a negative I would, I got it cause all the great reviews but once again I bought something for my trash can!!!</li>
            <li> I have never written an Amazon review but holy heck this product is amazing. It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Super impressed with this product! I was so close to scheduling an appointment with a dermatologist but decided to try this product first. I have been dealing with bum acne on and off for a long time and I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works!!</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! Have been using it for months. It is a little expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist.  I recently did full body makeup on women who would be naked in an adult scene.  Everyone had a bit of butt acne issues. I prepped the skin with this and sent them home with an ounce of it so they could treat it overnight.  The results were superb.  I got a smooth hydrated canvas to work on. I am now recommending this to clients and other makeup artists to use all of the body including the face.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t finished it but it seemed to mildly help even with old scaring. however still have new cysts forming.</li>
            <li> So I recently discovered that the skin disease I had was called hidradenitis suppurativa.  After a recent spout of abcesses on my rear, I had had enough.  My dermatologist has given me prescription to doxycycline (which gives me an upset stomach and womanly issues) and topical creams like clyndamyacin.  Neither of these gave me relief like Butt Acne Clearing Lotion.  This product reduced redness and swelling of my acne within a few days.  Its only been a couple of weeks but I can tell that this product is the most helpful solution I have used yet.  There is nothing more embarrassing than acne on the bum but this lotion is helping to ease that embarrassment and more importantly my skin. Thank you Green Hearts Lab!</li>
            <li> Everyone is differnent, but for me, I finally found something that works! I have been dealing with embarrassing breakouts for years. I have so many bumps and scars, its ridiculous. But I came across this product and I Love It! Been using for a few days but I can already notice a difference. No new breakouts. Minimizing existing bumps, plus it makes my skin feel SO soft. Two thumbs up for me. Thanks Green Heart Labs!</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever used that has actually worked!!!  I have tried everything!!!  This is an embarrassing problem but I will gladly share my experience with this product!!!!!!!!!! I use it twice a day as directed and noticed a clear up during the first day of use!  For my entire adult life I have been embarrassed to wear swim suits or shorts for fear that a pimple or acne scar would be visible.  I cant wait for this summer!!!  New Me!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product fully expecting to be throwing away $33, but after almost 3 decades of trying just about anything to get rid of unsightly butt bumps I was willing to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 days now (twice a day -- morning and night) and I&#x27;m completely flabbergasted by the results.  After about 3 days, bumps were mostly gone, bum was totally smooth to the touch.  A week after that and it&#x27;s completely clear.  I have some residual darkish marks from older acne issues (I guess, not an acne expert here) but I&#x27;m hoping with time those will go away too.  I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a while to find something for the occasional acne breakout on my buttocks I get from working out and to cure my razor burn in my bikini area... This stuff is amazing...I have only been using it for a week and all ready no razor burn anymore and my butt is clearing up in a hurry...I will be buying more..I am so glad I found it...It really does work !!!!</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with severe butt acne for about six months now. I have always had clear smooth skin all my life and then all of a sudden this nightmare appears. The red bumps show up out of nowhere and then once they disappear they leave ugly dark scars. I have tried popular acne medications, seen a dermatologist and they still kept showing up. I was so fed up that I decided to Google to see if everyone else was dealing with butt acne and that is how I found this wonderful product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong,  after reading some the reviews, I was still skeptical because there were so many different reviews, but I was desperate so I decided to give it a try. After the clearing lotion arrived I started to use it immediately. I didn&#x27;t see the the results right away like others but after day five..Wow! Not only has it cleared the red bumps significantly, it has given my butt a nice smooth even look to it and my dark spots have lightened up. This product may not be for everybody but it is definitely for me!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin softer and my keratosis pilaris symptoms have improved.. would recommend if you are struggling with mild-severe keratosis symptoms</li>
            <li> Only had this product a few days and the results are already showing. So happy to get rid of this embarrassing acne.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have issues with blemishes on my bum until after I had my son.  I got lots of stretch marks while pregnant and for some reason will get big, red, cystic like blemishes in the stretch marks (maybe one or two) and seemed to always have a few smaller bumps scattered throughout.  I started using this about every other day and I haven&#x27;t had any trouble since. They cleared up the existing ones within a few days and have kept any new ones at bay.  If I don&#x27;t use it for a week or so, they will start to come back,  so now I use it regularly. A little bit goes a long way. I&#x27;ve had my first bottle for 3 months now and it is only half empty. I use about a dime size per cheek.  This is has become product staple for me.</li>
            <li> This is embarrassing problem.  For me it&#x27;s due to riding horses and bikes frequently.  And I used to always be so self conscious when I had to go to the beach or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have been using the cream for a couple weeks, and the red dots cleared up within days of (morning and night) use.  And its taken a little over a week to get rid of the few pimples.  But it leaves your skin so soft and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it.  The containers are not that big, I&#x27;m guessing one should last a couple months maybe less.  So I would say buy in bulk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem with the product is the labeling, I find it embarrassing, but I just rip the labels off when I first get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I hope it works for you as well!!</li>
            <li> Product has made my skin smoother. I faithfully use twice daily and over the past 3 weeks there has been a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> First, I need to clarify that if you&#x27;re waiting for overnight results you&#x27;re in for a disappointment. NOTHING brings results overnight. And if it does, then it&#x27;s just a temporary solution. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 14 days now &amp; have seen changes not only in the texture of the skin but on the darkness of some scars I&#x27;ve had for years. My face has been clear most of my life. I cannot say the same for my glutes &amp; back. I suffered outbreaks ever since I was about 12 years old (about to be 30 now). Never found anything that could attack this. I don&#x27;t have huge outbreaks now but an occasional pimple. I do have some scars that had darkened over the years. Luckily, this has softened the darkness. And since I apply generously I clean the excess on my back &amp; it seems to work there too! I hope that with continuos use it can diminish the appearance considerably. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great! I was sceptical about spending $30 on acne cream initially, but it really is worth every cent, and one bottle lasts a few months. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have clear skin, however not in the rear. I&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing worked until I found this amazing lotion. Before my rear had embarrassing red pimples and felt really rough.  After using this lotionfor 3 weeks I notice a big difference and my rear is smooth and bump free. I feel more confident and so happy! Not even going to the dermatologist helped but this lotion  is awsome !</li>
            <li> No difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> Results are the first few days!</li>
            <li> OMG -- srsly -- this stuff works amazingly well. One week later and I&#x27;m baby smooth!! Will now try to see if it&#x27;ll work on my thigh too :)</li>
            <li> Was very surprised how well and quickly this worked.  Used 1-2 times/day and all bumps cleared up in a few days. It is a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Good product, very expensive, just a small bottle</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!! I could tell a difference the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Awesome. No more bitty pimples. Works really good. Smooth ass in a couple days</li>
            <li> I have had been embarrassed on my butt acne for quite some time. I have tried many different things like lightning creams, alcohol, all kinds of acne clearing products and none has ever worked. I usually try to stick to the more natural healing so I have also tried many natural products and remedies, but nothing has worked. One day on I was searching through google for a natural product that can clear acne naturally but quickly. Then I came upon the butt acne clearing lotion, What cached my attention was the name of the company &amp;#34;green heart labs&amp;#34; It was very interesting that they seem to work with natural products.  I am a little hesitant about buying products online without trying them out first but I had a good feeling about this one, so I then purchased the Butt Acne Clearing lotion, I received it in literally 3 days.  I lie to you not within 4 days of using the lotion I already feel the difference. It&#x27;s incredible. I noticed the acne is drying it and my skin is starting to feel softer. I also have sensitive skin, but thankfully I have no irritations. I am so exited about this product I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little while, but it has certainly cleared up the issue so far.  I will definitely continue to use this product and would recommend it to anyone experiencing this problem.</li>
            <li> Some people have not really had any good results, but I have. I am definitely going to continue to purchase the clearing cream. It took about a week to see some results I&#x27;ve had it for four and no longer have any acne, give it a shot what do you have to lose?</li>
            <li> 1st of all, I&#x27;m a 39 year old man.  Butt acne as most of us know it isn&#x27;t really acne, there is a scientific name for it, and I&#x27;m not going to waste anymore of your time about that, just Google it..&lt;br /&gt;Back to this product.  I have only been using for 3 days, and normally I wouldn&#x27;t review so quickly, but for me this product have been performing wonderfully.  My &amp;#34;buttne&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a concern that others may see it, however mine is painful and has left scars.  I&#x27;ve been fighting buttne for over 25 years. If you&#x27;re looking for scar removal, this may not be the best choice( again I can&#x27;t review scary removal, because I just started using)  But as far as ridding current buttne it works fast and yes, as others stated makes your butt really soft, very weird to speak of... Yet true.  I know everybody is different, this seems as reviews states works for many, and not for others.  For the price, I figured I&#x27;d give a shot, I&#x27;m glad I have.  I have tried countless remedies, face ance treatment, terrible idea.  Head and shoulders dandruff shampoo, fast clearing, but also dries you out, then symptoms creep back, olive oil and scrub and rinse with hot as you can stand water works but time consuming and messy, Amlactin lotion seems to work, just a little greasy.  I really like this &amp;#34;butt acne&amp;#34; product, I recommend giving it a try, it&#x27;s not that expensive, as compared to many others, and if it doesn&#x27;t rid your buttne, at least it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  I hope my experiences have helped.</li>
            <li> Literally did nothing at all! probably broke out more frequently than before I started using the lotion.</li>
            <li> Well I have used 1/4 bottle still have a little acne and brown spots I will continue to use the remaining amount to see what happens.  I hope this works</li>
            <li> The only thing that ever worked. It took about 3 weeks but it&#x27;s 99% better. A miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working!! And I don&#x27;t even put it on twice a day and sometime I forget to even put it on some days and it still works, I&#x27;m going to continue to purchase this product over and over I love it! And I had this ance for years.. And nothing until this lotion. 🙌🙌🙌🙌</li>
            <li> Amlactin does the trick this stuff doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I thought because it was so expensive that it would work. I used it for a month and it did nothing for me. Definitely not worth this high price. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of dark spots left by acne. I recommend keeping your money, using natural skin lightening soap and cocoa butter for people of color.</li>
            <li> already finished the bottle and i have yet to see any improvement</li>
            <li> I would just like to state at the begin that I write this review on behalf of my lovely girlfriend.  A little background - My girlfriend has wonderful fair skin, However her only problem area was her butt.    Before using  the Butt acne clearing lotion, her butt was approx. 25% covered with acne.  After using the lotion for 1 week , Yes 1 week !!!!, with my eyes  and hands as proof,  95 % of the acne was gone and it left her butt baby soft.I kid you not baby baby soft !!!! . My hands remains busy even till now !!!!    Green Heart Labs my only recommendation is that you start providing this in a bigger bottle.( please note 1 bottle will last about 2-3 weeks of 2x daily use)  This is our 2nd bottle and will certainly re-order, as this product has introduce a great deal of confidence in my gf which was lost for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the longest for an affordable but effective product and boy this Butt acne does the job. I&#x27;ve always struggled with not only acne on my face but acne back there, I hated to even go to the pool or beach. I was too embarrassed feeling as if no one would see past my pimpled bums. Thank goodness for Green Heart Labs But Acne clearing lotion. I see the difference and I am absolutely in love and can&#x27;t stop looking at my behind in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> The skin on my upper thigh/butt area is extremely sensitive, so when my legs are exposed during shorts season I have to deal with embarrassing acne. It sucks. It&#x27;s not only noticeable in swimwear, the acne is very visible while I&#x27;m wearing shorts. I&#x27;ve tried several topical treatments, acne clearing face washes on the problem area and nothing really worked. You could see a visible difference in my skin in literally a matter of days! I used the lotion only once a day after showering since my skin is on the oily side (directions suggest to use twice daily), but I would recommend this product for any skin type. The smell is pretty neutral and it just works- and works pretty quickly. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from embarrassing butt acne, the stuff is magic. Also, while researching this product I noticed reviewers upset because it does nothing to clear up acne scars... this lotion is not a scar diminishing product it&#x27;s specifically to treat new acne breakouts. Hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I love it no crazy ingredients no nasty smell easy and effective. Just what I needed!!!!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this lotion (especially with the embarrassing name!).. but it works beautifully.  My skin wasn&#x27;t terrible, but it was annoying as hell... less than a week of using this lotion AM/PM and my skin is silky smooth... !</li>
            <li> Since puberty, this has been an extremely embarrassing problem for me (I&#x27;m 22 years old now). Over the years, I tried using several topical acne treatments with either salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide in them but, of course, nothing worked. I was terribly uncomfortable wearing a bikini, wearing shorts, and especially having sex! The relentless butt pimples just made me straight up miserable, so I did some research online, stumbled upon clearbutt.com, and read up on the butt acne clearing lotion. I was skeptical as always since I had little hope at this point, but decided \\&quot;what the hell, might as well try it.\\&quot; I now SWEAR by butt acne clearing lotion! This is the greatest stuff to ever exist... I started rubbing about a nickel-sized amount into my booty cheeks every morning and ever night, and saw a completely clear and softer butt in about 3 days! NOT ONE UGLY BLEMISH ON MY REAR!!! I feel like a sexier woman, and can&#x27;t thank Green Heart Labs enough for coming up with a perfect solution for such a mortifying issue. :-) I plan to continue buying this lotion so I can have a pretty butt forever!</li>
            <li> Good product, but works after some time, not right away. But it works, butt acne will be gone.i would recommend this product to everyone who has butt acne</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Works perfectly! Also works great on bikini area to prevent ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I had a severe butt acne problem, within a week it starting noticeably clearing up. I was worried it was a knock off or some scam, but it turned out to be the real deal, don&#x27;t be afraid to spend your money on this.</li>
            <li> Works really well, glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I having been looking everywhere for products to help me with the acne on my butt. I have finally found it. It only took a few days to start working for me. I will continue to use this. Thank you</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t. Just don&#x27;t. I purchased this in hopes that its high price entailed a high quality product. I used the entire bottle. Saw no difference, and felt bad that I spent so much on a bottle!</li>
            <li> BEST MOST AMAZING STUFF EVER.&lt;br /&gt;Been trying vitamin E creams for months with only slightly better results.&lt;br /&gt;This cream must be magic, it is amazing. So happy.&lt;br /&gt;It is now sexy g-string shopping time.</li>
            <li> This works really well and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. My complaint is that I find it smells really bad and is sticky even after it dries. I don&#x27;t use all that much at all but it still feels very sticky. As much as I like the results, I&#x27;m going to have to find something else.</li>
            <li> It works. Solves pimple issues and is a must for preventative maintenance. Just shower regularly and apply this afterwards. Keeps my bum clean.</li>
            <li> I truly have no idea what makes this product any different from other skin lotions or topical acne treatments. I use a generous, nickel-sized amount, and although it does leave a bit of a sticky residue that takes a minute or two to dry, this stuff WORKS. I somehow always forget to put it on at night, so I am seeing results after about a week of once-daily use. This lotion is not only effective in clearing acne but also fading and reducing the look of scars. I have ultra-sensitive skin and am not bothered by the lotion, which is a great thing. I would highly recommend this for people with recurring acne, scars, etc. Plus, I have never used a lotion that has made my skin softer, and I am almost tempted to use it as a body lotion. It is pricey, but if you&#x27;re willing to sacrifice the cash for the results, it is definitely worth a try. I will definitely be ordering more bottles of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! It seems to be working and clearing up my acne. I recomend this product. You should try it out.</li>
            <li> I could feel the lotion working to heal my acne the 1st time I applied. I&#x27;m happy with the results!</li>
            <li> This product works great!! I&#x27;ve tried so many things without any results&lt;br /&gt;I strongly suggest that you try this it really does work:)</li>
            <li> This stuff works really good. I will continue to buy this product love using it. It really clears up the acne</li>
            <li> Works great! Clears up all bumps in one or two days. Removes discoloration from past bumps too. Leaves skin super soft. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> People often mistakenly use acne products for this problem.  When there&#x27;s no improvement many people fall into despair.  You need to use the right product and this is the right product!  Works great!</li>
            <li> I applied as per directions.  This product did not work.  I used for 1 week and did not see any improvement.</li>
            <li> This product works as described and it works fast! This is only the second time I have experienced breakouts on my back and butt and I have no idea why. However, this product helps get you skin back to normal and leaves your skin soft. I used it twice a day for the first couple of weeks until I started seeing significant progress, then back to once a day for a couple weeks, and I am going to continue every other day as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this product out, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Magic in the bottle..</li>
            <li> For years and years I struggled with butt and back acne. I came across this product after my worst break out ever. After 2 days of using it, my skin was a lot smoother and softer. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. It actually makes the acne go away! With patience and applying this twice a day my acne was gone. I still get some here and there right around the time I get my period, but I no longer have a ton of bumps and cyst. I have more confidence when wearing a bikini and in the bedroom. Haha. I am so glad I found this product. It&#x27;s pretty pricey for the amount given, but it works!</li>
            <li> For the price I haven&#x27;t seen much if any difference after a month</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this lotion would help treat my butt acne. But unfortunately, after using it twice/day for three weeks, it simply did not do anything for my skin. I had to return the product (of course the shipping costs both ways were not refunded). Also the lotion is very sticky and does not dry up, it has to be wiped off to avoid getting it on clothes. I would not sit for 2 hrs after each application, thinking that if the lotion absorbs better, it would be more effective and work faster. The lotion still would not dry up after 2 hrs.&lt;br /&gt;I ended up going to the dermatologist and getting a prescription lotion, which seems to be working after several days. And btw my dr. said that the Butt Lotion contains nothing that would treat acne.</li>
            <li> works great i even use it on my face and no breakouts love it!!</li>
            <li> use it. Don&#x27;t stop because you don&#x27;t see results right away. I almost stopped but then i decided to keep using it and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I haven&#x27;t had clear skin on my butt since before i could remember and its the only thing that has ever worked. I had tried EVERYTHING before finding this lotion. It makes your skin sooooo soft my boyfriend couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin is now. I love it and would recommend using this at least once a day and twice when you can and also go to a tanning bed a few times and let your butt get some uv rays. Its really good to clear skin. This combination of tanning bed and lotion worked in less then month. My butt is clear and soft.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see results been applying for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It has solved my butt problem that I thought was hopeless. Thanks to butt acne clearing lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had but acne for about 5 years or so now and it&#x27;s so embarrassing that I don&#x27;t want my boyfriend to look at my bare butt. I saw this stuff on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I bought a bottle in November and even though I admittedly have not been using it twice a day, it has still been working to clear up existing pimples and prevent new ones from forming. I can already tell a difference! This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> This is the third bottle I have purchased and it definitely works. I have been plagued with small red breakouts on my rear for as long as I can remember even though the rest of my body and face are clear. I feared wearing thong underwear with jeans because of irritation. I would dread riding my bike long distances because I was worried about the bumps. I tried so many products, including diaper rash cream and over the counter acne medication. This product seriously works. I use it at least once a day, twice if I remember. I notice a difference if I stop using it for a few days, so I try not to skip. It&#x27;s left my skin smooth, clear, and doesn&#x27;t discolor clothes like acne medication would. It&#x27;s amazing and has made such a positive impact on my confidence. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the lotion with no smell. I will comment again after 30 days of usage to let you guys know if it works because my friend tried it before me &amp; she said it does work.</li>
            <li> Although this product is quite pricey for the size bottle, it really is worth it.  I had a problem with breakouts on my bum, which I have since found out was caused by a hormonal imbalance (side note: EVERYONE should see a Naturopath Dr at some point in their lives…that is how I found out what was wrong after YEARS of just dealing with this problem, among others…regular Dr could never properly diagnose and their solution was ALWAYS to just write prescription after body damaging prescription). So in conjunction with a change in diet, and adding supplements, etc. this lotion seemed to help clear up the breakouts.  This also seems to really help with cystic acne, of which I get the occasional breakout.  Not just for use on the bum, but anywhere you have a breakout!  Skin feels very smooth with regular use, which is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a good helper! I would also recommend exfoliating with granulated sugar in the shower daily ;)</li>
            <li> This is One of the best Products I have ever Purchased. It works great and I seen a huge difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> After on 3 days of using this product, I can already see the results.  YEAH!!!  Finally, a solution to a problem that is really simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Perfect works, I feel the skin is very smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to whoever has the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;Butt Acne..!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about five weeks now and it has completely cleared up my skin. I could not be more pleased with the results. I can&#x27;t wait until I have completed a full six months in hopes that the mild scaring will have diminished. Thank you Green Heart Labs!</li>
            <li> Finally - something that works! It took a couple of weeks to clear my skin up (which I expected) and the results are great. Definitely going to keep this product in my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I felt I had to for this product.  I have suffered from embarrassing \\&quot;acne\\&quot; on my bum for YEARS.  I&#x27;m 42 and I still have it.  I&#x27;ve tried everything...including all the prescribed medications--even accutane.  I sit in front of a computer for work and exercise everyday...both things seem to aggravate my problem.  I was skeptical to try this product, but figured I had nothing to lose.  In 12 hours, my butt was completely clear!!!  In two weeks, all skin discolorations were gone as well.  The skin on my bum is soft and smooth.  I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using the product.  It takes a small amount in the morning and at bedtime.  I&#x27;ve also recently tried benzoyl peroxide with success, but this product is a complete package.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works! Have been using it for months. It is a little expensive but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I decided to get this! It&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve found that actually works. I&#x27;ve had this lotion for about a month and haven&#x27;t had any problems, old scars are even starting to fade! Will definitely continue buying</li>
            <li> This works. It really does. However, you have to be consistent with it. I am a busy Mom of two and sometimes skip a day (or 2) and the acne will start to come back.  I will say that it absolutely cleared up the acne on my buttocks and backs of my thighs plus it definitely made a difference in the texture of my skin. It is much softer now.  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s not too thick and dries pretty fast. The only drawback is you have to keep up with the application and it does take a few weeks to work.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I bought it out of desperation. It has outlived my wildest dreams. I am no longer embarrassed of how my posterior looks. If my towel falls, I no longer am filled with shame. It didn&#x27;t take long to work, and has cleared my rear. It is worth the money. I would pay several times as much for the results it gave me.</li>
            <li> Great product! Already feels smoother!</li>
            <li> This lotion is gentle, with just a little bit of exfoliation. I tried a few products before it, but I have noticed a difference with this lotion within two days of application (twice a day). The bottle is a decent size for the price.</li>
            <li> at first I thought this was too expensive for an acne lotion that might be just like the others. it&#x27;s affective and you see results within few days. if you have body acne, specially on your rear, buy it with no doubt. I love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I experienced more than 50% clear skin on my buttocks. I have been using this for almost 2 weeks and already my bottom is 90% clear and to top this off, it&#x27;s so smooth amd soft. Honestly, I was skeptical about the effectiveness of the product since I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun to no avail. I&#x27;m 25 and eat a fairly balanced diet consisting of mostly fruits amd veggies so still experiencing acne all over is frustrating. This is a miracle! I have also began to use this on my face and have onpy had 2 blemishes tops at a time. A little background on my acne, it&#x27;s very deep and hurtful cystic acne on my face and bottom. This sometimes ends up on my back thighs. I have had maybe a tiny few pimples show up but they are not the cystic acne that I usually have on my period. It may not work for everyone but for me, it&#x27;s amazing. Anything that rids my face and butt from cystic acne and leaves me able to go out with little to no make up gets 5 stars any day!!!!!</li>
            <li> Gives you a nice, smooth butt.  Stuff seems to be very effective at clearing butt pimples.  I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing results in a few weeks. Highly recommended.  This truly works. It takes some time to see the results.</li>
            <li> This product works so good im so happy to have this lotion i want to buy one more bottle :)</li>
            <li> I have been searching for something that honestly takes away AND prevents breakouts. It&#x27;s a extremely embarrassing problem and this product is the only thing that has worked for me after all my searching. My only complaint is the label is very blunt and can&#x27;t be removed and I don&#x27;t want people I live with seeing that I use such a thing for such an already embarrassing problem. As far as the product I will continue buying it as long as it continues working as well as it has been for 5 months.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. Finally an acne product that does what it says it will do! I have struggled with butt acne for a long time and never thought they made anything specifically for it. BUT they have, and it WORKS! Wonderful product. I would highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion really works on keratosis pilaris (red bumps on backs of arms, legs, etc).  I found it worked better on the back of my arms than my rear.  Salicylic acid works better on my bum than this cream.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne on my rear since my teenage years. It is very embarrassing that I still get acne on my rear well into my 20&#x27;s. My rear is covered in scars as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews of this product on Amazon, and was curious about the good word it was given. I decided to order the product even though the price was a little steep, but I figured I was willing to try if the product was so well reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was shipped very fast. When it came and I opened the box, I was a little worried when I saw how small the bottle was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the first night I applied the product on my bottom, I felt very relieved. I have been using the product for a day and already my bottom feels smoother and clearer. This lotion exfoliates the skin of my butt better than any soap I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lotion; it truly was made for relief of acne of the butt, unlike other products made for the face. Try it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff worked really well clearing up my backside. I will definitely recommend to my girlfriends so they can get themselves ready for bikini season! I&#x27;ll be getting more--that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> This lotion is just awesome!!! Ive been suffering from cystic acne on my bum since I was a teenager. When I  applied the lotion on it quickly healed the acne and smoothed out my skin. No more embarrassing butt acne for me!</li>
            <li> Was skeptical at first but actually noticed good results after a few weeks. Just have to remember to use it regularly</li>
            <li> Like this product. Not sure if my butt acne free because of this product but it&#x27;s great anyway:) try it yourself</li>
            <li> Within the first day I was already seeing great results! I&#x27;ve tried many different things to clear the acne up and this by far is the best product out there! The transformation has been amazing and I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on my second bottle!</li>
            <li> Product arrive extremely quickly and works great. Have been using it for a few days and I am already seeking fantastic results. No more bumps on my rump!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks now and have seen great improvement. I have also been using it on my upper thighs and it works just as well there too--just be careful because it will sting a little if the lotion is put on skin that has just been shaved! I am excited to find something that actually makes a significant difference on body blemishes.</li>
            <li> One of the best skin treatment lotions I have ever purchased! I didn&#x27;t think this would work, but within a few weeks of using it my skin has totally cleared up. Now I&#x27;m never self conscious about wearing a bikini. My skin is smooth and free of little bumps and zits. I&#x27;ve found that when applying to skin it is not necessary to use a large amount (a dime sized drop per butt cheek should be plenty). It is expensive, so only use a little bit morning and night. I also rub a little on my thighs and it has cleared up ingrown hairs and small bumps :) Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve already started to see results.  I&#x27;ve had butt acne since puberty and this is the ONLY thing that has even come close to clearing it up!!</li>
            <li> I have had terrible butt acne for years. It started ten years ago, and with no treatment that helped, it got worse and worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My whole butt was covered with either big bylls or scars. The scars got grotesk (black and red), and seeing it would make a grown man cry I think.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of years ago, I finaly got a lotion that could keep it under some sort of control, but nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we all know, its hard to find anything about this online, but some how i came across this add this summer. I got so excited after reading all the positive reviews, that I ordered one bottle right away. As many others, I was very sceptical, but i wanted to believe it would work so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started putting on the lotion when it arrived (morning and night)everyday. And as many said, it did soften up my butt very fast, and it seemed to be doing something about the redness in my skin. But then, after five days of use, i got a new outbreak of bumps. So I got very dissapointed. But almost in the same time, i saw that even tho this new outbreak was happening, my skin seemed alot better in between - And the outbreak was in old scars. So i kept using (heavily). After one week, i could se progress. My butt still had acne, and still covered with scars, but it looked alot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one and a half week, the results really started to show for real. Most of the acne was pretty much gone, and the scars started to lighten alot. - And my butt was feeling softer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its now been 3,5 weeks, and the results are amazing. Everything is cleaned up, and the scars are gone by atleast 80% (and my butt was totaly covered).&lt;br /&gt;It is a true lifesaver!! Words cannot describe how I&#x27;m feeling. Years with this problem is finaly comming to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy someone have taken this problem seriously, and helped me and others. I will keep advertising this lotion to everyone I can in my country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone who start using this must understand that it doesnt help much right away. And I still got outbreakes after a week of use. But keep using it, and it will work for foluculits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for a month now. The difference is unbelievable. It hasn&#x27;t only cleared my acne, it has also softened my skin. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good acne clearing product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence about spending 30-plus dollars on a lotion that can cure acne on your buttocks (believe me, I was), I can honestly say, you needn&#x27;t be.  I started to notice a change within the first couple of days using it.  My cheeks were softer and I haven&#x27;t had a break out since using it.  Now, i&#x27;m just waiting for the acne scars to go away!  I realize that everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different and not everyone will get the full benefit, but if you&#x27;re tired of painful and unsightly butt acne, give it a try.  It just might work wonders for you, too!</li>
            <li> I got very excited when I discovered this product on the Internet. I live in Spain, and eventhough courier services were almost the price of the product, I thought it was worth giving it a try. It arrived only few days after my purhcase, and I used it twice daily for better results. After weeks of usage, my butt acne stills persists and I feel very frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not so much about the money, it&#x27;s about being hopeful for something that leads you to another disappointment.</li>
            <li> Eh It&#x27;s working, I would recommend it. Just a bit over priced for the little bottle but it&#x27;s ok. ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sick of dermatologists. They never can help. They just prescribe super expensive stuff. Plus, I have no health insurance so just walking in the door is $200. I really wanted this to work. It didn&#x27;t. It stung like a mofo, but (BUTT) it didn&#x27;t seem to stop new breakouts. I&#x27;m 42 and since about a year ago with all the f&#x27;d up hormone changes happening with my body, my butt suffers.  It&#x27;s embarrassing. I&#x27;ll just make another appointment to see the dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not easy being a woman. You men have NO idea what we endure. It&#x27;s expensive too.</li>
            <li> This product started working instantly to clear up that embarrassing butt acne.  I would recommend this to anyone.  There was no sensitive reaction to the product either.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Butt acne is something that is pretty common but not always talked about. As an avid gym goer this was an intriguing product. I like to use it after my post workout shower. I think it does what is promises. However, I think it is pricey and that a cheaper product might also do the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this product for free.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just about a year now. It works great! It&#x27;s the only thing I have found to actually do something for me. It does not dry out or bleach clothing, which is a bonus. You need to use this as directed. Twice a day on clean skin. It doesn&#x27;t get rid of my acne completely, but almost! I am trying to search for an acne body cleanser to use along with it. (my acne seems to get worse on my rear when I work out in the hot weather). My husband has tried this also. He gets acne on his upper back (usually from running and sweating in the heat as well). He has let me try this a few times and WHAT a difference! However, he is not consistent because he could care less what his back looks like. But It does work!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product that does exactly what it claims to.  Very effective and fast!&lt;br /&gt;Love it.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with butt pimples for many, many years. I tried everything: creams, lotions, changing types of underwear, etc. but nothing worked. When I found this stuff I was a bit skeptical (I mean its called &amp;#34;butt acne clearing lotion&amp;#34;) but I thought what the hell, its worth a shot. After a about a week and a half, I saw a noticeable difference in the amount of bumps. Another week and they were all gone. The name says it all: this lotion clears butt acne!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product. My skin has definitely improved since I began using this product.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and it fixed my problem completely after about 3 weeks of my regime. Here&#x27;s what I did. I applied this twice a day: once in the morning and once at night. (It does not stain or bleach fabric, but I did try to let it dry for a few minutes before putting on clothes. It&#x27;s also not greasy, no fragrance, and readily water soluble.) Prior to application at night, I would clean my rear with a 2% salicylic acid pre-moistened towelette. In my morning showers, about every other day, I would lightly exfoliate using a mesh sponge and a liquid body soap (sometimes plain, sometimes Neutrogena&#x27;s 2% salicylic acid grapefruit liquid body soap; I mixed it up). For the first 2 weeks, my skin felt obviously softer but I still got some red bumps or &amp;#34;pimples.&amp;#34; During week 3, I got what felt like a rash on my rear consisting of many, many small colorless bumps all around the skin. I continued my regime through it, the rash went away after a few days, and on week 4 my rear was smooth, clear, no bumps/&amp;#34;pimples&amp;#34; at all, no rash, and I cannot believe how great my skin looks and feels ever since. Now I use this lotion once at night for maintenance, still cleaning with a towelette at night and occasional exfoliation in the AM, and so far, so good. This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I always thought I would just be stuck &amp;#34;dealing with&amp;#34; my terrible looking bum. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear shorts or regular bikini bottoms from embarrassment of my bad skin on my butt &amp; legs. I found this stuff online &amp; it has changed my life. I&#x27;ve been using it 2 times a day for just about a week &amp; my skin is almost completely cleared up! I&#x27;m def a fan for life.</li>
            <li> I love it! Its working great on my son&#x27;s face!</li>
            <li> Will fill you in later but I can tell you this is a tiny bottle. The price was $32.99 for 4 ounces. The bottle is about 2/3 the size of a bar of soap. Does that sound right to you for that price? It says &amp;#34;Apply generously twice a day.&amp;#34; Generously twice a day this would last two or three days. Says you can&#x27;t get the area you have used it on in the sun while using and for a week after. Good to know before hand. Smells fine, feels alright. Has arnica and calendula in it so that is good. Arnica is a root that you can use as pain relief.</li>
            <li> i have been using in for two weeks and really no difference</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do anything.  And just so you are aware, this product comes with a sheet requesting that you leave a good review so they can ship you an additional FREE bottle.  I think this product has fake high reviews due to that reason.  People might be leaving high reviews before they even use or see results from this cream just to get another free bottle.  Smells strongly like chemicals even though it&#x27;s unscented.  Never did anything for my acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference. Dark spots/scars are much lighter or completely gone, acne has significantly decreased and my skin feels much smoother. The bottle has lasted me about a month but around a week and a half in I started applying a thicker coat. I found this worked better. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> the only thing that ever worked for me.....thank you for making this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see any changes and it&#x27;s been a few weeks..</li>
            <li> Slow process, it doesn&#x27;t clear it completely</li>
            <li> My butt acne has gotten much better after using. I have been using this for over two months and it hasn&#x27;t cleared it up completely unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I used this for about 1 month every day as recommended and it didn&#x27;t seem to wow me like I expected.  It took away a significant amount of redness and blemishes but did&#x27;t seem to rid the bumps that appeared to be the same size as my first application. Not sure I would try this product again.</li>
            <li> This product Was great.I am a light skinned AA So bumps In this area Are really ugly .after I use I noticed the difference. I will always keep This On hand.made Me feel confident again ..</li>
            <li> This cream has helped my husband with his acne...It is simple to use and has results very quickly.  We recommend this product</li>
            <li> its not a lasting solution.</li>
            <li> Was hestitant to try this item, I suffer from Keratosis(inflamed hair follicals), steroid creams help some but never really healed my buttocks. I have used this lotion for two days, four applications, amazing results! Wonderful how much better my tush looks and feels. No pain today, redness gone, flakes and inflamed hair follicals healing! Definitely will recommend this product and continue to use for rest of my life!!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion last year but never really stick to using it daily so I didn&#x27;t see much results, and then I stopped for a while because I misplaced it. Well, good thing I found it again this year and started using it daily as instructed. The instruction say apply it twice daily but I only apply it once at night (every night) and the results have been amazing! No more butt and inner thigh acne! I don&#x27;t even use that much, just about the size of a quarter. As soon as I feel a bump surfacing, I rub this lotion on and next day, it&#x27;s gone. I don&#x27;t know how it works but gosh, it&#x27;s been a life safer for me. If you&#x27;ve been battling butt/inner thigh acne, this is worth a try. If you stick to the routine of using it daily, you won&#x27;t regret purchasing this lotion! It does not help clear butt acne scars/discolorations, but it does help prevent future breakouts. I haven&#x27;t had a single breakout ever since using this lotion religiously. Before using this lotion, I would get at least 1-2 breakouts weekly and get so frustrated, filled with embarrassment not ever wanting to wear anything short and sexy but this lotion changed that. I&#x27;m down to the bottom and will be getting more!</li>
            <li> Much to my suprise, this stuff worked!  I have been using it not even faithfully and my skin has cleared up.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is by no means a magical product. But I’m definitely having some good results.  At first i thought it wasn’t working at all: the pimples improved during the fist week but then the progress stoped and everything was the same during the next 3 weeks. Another waste of money; but i gave it time mainly because i spent $30 in such a small bottle and because it did make my skin smoother.  It took a total of 4 weeks to start seeing real results. My active pimples started to dry out, I’m not getting as many breakouts as i used to -although i still get a fair amount-, the pimples i get now are smaller, less painful and disappear quickly.  Overall i do like this product but it isn’t a magical solution or anything. Anything that improves &amp;#34;a little&amp;#34; this problem is always welcome. The only bad thing is the price, the bottle is really tiny and in 4-5 weeks I’ve already been through half of it.  UPDATE 04/03/2015: Well everything keeps getting better with time, my existing pimples have almost completely disappeared and I’m not getting new breakouts. I hope this becomes a lasting result.</li>
            <li> Synopsis: Save your money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dets.: Ordered this lotion on July 16th, so I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month. Not only have my break outs not cleared up, I&#x27;ve actually broken out a bit more. This lotion is missing one key ingredient: salicylic acid. I&#x27;d recommend buying something cheaper and more effective like &amp;#34;Clean &amp; Clear Clear Advantage Daily Acne Clearing Lotion&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Clean and Clear Dual Action Moisturizer&amp;#34; (and no, I don&#x27;t work for Clean and Clear!).</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose, it really helps but at least with me wasn&#x27;t miraculous. If you&#x27;re using it 2 times daily it&#x27;s really effective and useful after a couple of days you can already tell the difference but then again it&#x27;s very expensive for such a small bottle and some good moisturizers can have similar effects with less than half the price.</li>
            <li> It does work! Small bottle for a big price, but you get great results!!!! The lotion doesn&#x27;t have a smell, which is definitely a plus!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I have been using it for over a year now.... A little goes a long way.... the only reason why I don&#x27;t give it a 5 rating is the price is steep, but worth it because it really works.... I use to get a few bumps at once that were painful and now my bum is clear and free of any bumps and has lightened scars from previous bumps.... I have been off of it for two months and got my first bump and reordered right away.... I never leave reviews and order everything from Amazon.... So for me to leave a review means it really works.... And since this is such an embarrassing issue for me a woman and I&#x27;m sure for a lot of people I highly recommend this product....</li>
            <li> First time reviewing anything, I must say this stuff works great. Just ordered my 3rd bottle, very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Perfectly happy with the results after about a month of using. So far I haven&#x27;t seen that much improvement with the dark spots left from previous breakouts. I would suggest using another product for that in combination with this lotion. But I haven&#x27;t had a break out since using the lotion and it dramatically makes the skin smoother. Love it.</li>
            <li> Having cowboyed all my life it&#x27;s fair to say butts should be properly cared for.  Thank you for offering this.</li>
    </ol>
