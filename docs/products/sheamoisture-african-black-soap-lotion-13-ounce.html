            <li>The lotion works very good on oily skin to not clog pores to make skin oily.</li>
            <li>great for my hair too</li>
            <li>Maybe it need to be in a jar if the cost isn&#x27;t to great.</li>
            <li>Great product, but it should be packaged in a tub.  </li>
            <li>Just great stuff.</li>
            <li>It is also great for acne, leaves not residue, is creamy, and smells amazing.</li>

            <li>I love the scent!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing for your skin</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, but itsnt too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure as the product goes, so will my patience.</li>
            <li>But I love it as a night moisturizer</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this for many months, I switched to CeraVe for my morning moisturizer and a glycolic acid lotion for evenings.</li>
            <li>It would seem that the Research &amp; Design team would come up with a better bottle design to dispense the lotion.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love.</li>
            <li>Give it a try, I think you will love it.</li>
            <li>I had to cut the top off and scoop it out.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I am allergic to so many beauty ingredients</li>
            <li>This is a very nice product, really good for extremely dry &amp; irritated skin.</li>
            <li>It is great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I tried du du osun but it was really strong and a job to bathe/shower with.</li>
            <li>Ok this stuff smells good, but Ive been told even by women its a little girly...idc honestly.</li>
            <li>The bar is huge too.</li>
            <li>like to use natural products, and this is the best lotion natural or not.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy</li>
            <li>Fantastic lotion.  </li>
            <li>I am now 26 and was recommended by a friend to try this and also because Aveeno discontinued my original soap.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, rather neutral and not very strong.</li>
            <li>A NEW BOTTLE DISPENSE METHOD WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li>I have to unscrew the top to actually get a decent amount out, but aside from the packaging the consistency of the product itself is money worthy.</li>
            <li>My skin is really improving and is baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d certainly buy it again if it was.</li>
            <li>Love this!  Very thick and rich.  </li>
            <li>She really loves it and her skin does, too.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>She really likes it</li>
            <li>I rate this lotion a four star, but what I really dislike about it is the why the lotion is package.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need that much of it also.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>If possible, see if you can somehow scoop it out of its current receptacle into a tub of some kind</li>
            <li>and I loved it, but the salicylic acid and other ingredients in this lotion give me that extra oomph of skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is great just like every other shea moisturizer products ready the other reviews</li>
            <li>Suitable for male or female use.</li>
            <li>Once the stuff gets like 1-2&amp;#34; down from the top</li>
            <li>But it is the smooth and thick texture that makes this stuff pretty good for psoriasis and regular dry skin.</li>
            <li>It has cleared up so many little nagging skin issues I have.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for a little more then a week</li>
            <li>Nice and thick.  </li>
            <li>This thick, rich cream (not really a lotion) is a great healing lotion for cracked, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>almost completely gone!</li>
            <li>I am a product junkie, so I can&#x27;t say this is my one and only, but it easily could be (and might be after I go through all of my other lotions and potions and creams and what-not).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of 100% natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Completely agree with Matt.</li>
            <li>I end up putting it in old Bath &amp; Body Works tubs.</li>
            <li>and my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>and now I recommend this to patients since is natural</li>
            <li>I am ready to saw the bottle open and put the lotion into a jar.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is more of a thick cream.</li>
            <li>Like, easily marketable as a body butter thick.</li>
            <li>However, the price here on Amazon is much higher than you&#x27;ll find at stores and other online retailers.</li>
            <li>The consistency is very, very thick &amp; thicker than most body butters.</li>
            <li>Other lotions often just wash right off as soon as you get your hands wet, or they&#x27;re greasy.  </li>
            <li>I also use black soap as well thanks again</li>

            <li> I also use black soap as well thanks again</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have the black soap smell like the other SheaMoisture black soap products, but that&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but it is so thick and hard to get out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this lotion for a very long time, it helps with her acne on her shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as long as its on the market</li>
            <li> This stuff dosen&#x27;t dry my face out,infact my face has cleared up.</li>
            <li> My hands have been so dry</li>
            <li> Dry skin people can benefit as well since the creamy texture of the lotion truly moisturizers the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thick and rich that is to hard to get the lotion out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The weather is about to change and this Black African Shea Butter lotion does moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I should be in a tub, it is impossible to squeeze out of the top.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a local goat milk lotion</li>
            <li> As another poster remarked, my ONLY issue with this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is the packaging/dispensing system is not really adequate for the consistency of the lotion.</li>
            <li> This black soap type soap,body wash and especially the lotion are the bomb.</li>
            <li> So I tried this for my acne along with the Shea Moisture African black soap bar.</li>
            <li> complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the other SheaMoisture products, but at least the scent is faint.</li>
            <li> It is VERY moisturizing, but a little too thick to get out the bottle.</li>
            <li> The lotion is fantastic, no scent, very thick, lasts long, but the packaging is not good at all.</li>
            <li> No thanks, ya&#x27;ll.</li>
            <li> It even helps the rough redness of my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut the bottle open (no easy feat), then transfer product to an empty body butter wide-mouth tub</li>
            <li> I use ONLY this lotion after every shower and I have seen a dramatic improvement in the clarity and softness of my skin in the short time of use.</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how hard it is to squeeze the lotion out of this bottle.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle the product comes in.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion hate the packaging.  </li>
            <li> I just store it upside down</li>
            <li> This lotion is so thick it is hard to get out of the bottle, and it the moisture last long.</li>
            <li> and that seems to help a little.</li>
            <li> I keep the bottle upside down in a tumbler -it&#x27;s too thick to squeeze out otherwise.  </li>
            <li> I admit that it is a little thick</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll be wishing it wasn&#x27;t as thick as it is.</li>
            <li> stuff is THICK.</li>
            <li> and I mean any of there products</li>
            <li> When she&#x27;s diligent about putting it on, her eczema is seriously diminished.</li>
            <li> As others have said, it&#x27;s tough to get it out of the container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, I think I will whip with some olive or coconut oil to liquify.</li>
            <li> i hate that it is so pricy, but because the lotion is so thick and creamy i dont have to use as much as i do other lotions.</li>
            <li> It is incredibly difficult to squeeze the lotion out of the tube.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have terrible psoriasis and MCS (Multiple Chemical Syndrome)</li>
            <li> This lotion is the consistency of of cold butter, so it is nearly impossible to get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle :(</li>
            <li> and you are violently shaking it like a ketchup bottle in a diner to get it out</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with bad acne since I was 15!</li>
            <li> it is almost impossible to get it out of the bottle bi when you do woww!!!!</li>
            <li> However, I have a friend with terrible eczema on her hands and arms, and I gave her the rest of my container.</li>
            <li> I was having a horrible episode of flakiness and irritation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok this stuff smells good, but Ive been told even by women its a little girly...idc honestly. Good smell is good smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the only gripe about this stuff is its not in a pump bottle. Once the stuff gets like 1-2&amp;#34; down from the top and you are violently shaking it like a ketchup bottle in a diner to get it out, you&#x27;ll be wishing it wasn&#x27;t as thick as it is. But it is the smooth and thick texture that makes this stuff pretty good for psoriasis and regular dry skin. I would only recommend it on new/light/mild psoriasis as I have no experience with anything else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great just like every other shea moisturizer products ready the other reviews it is almost impossible to get it out of the bottle bi when you do woww!!!! This stuff is amazing for your skin I also use black soap as well thanks again shea I will use any and I mean any of there products they are the best</li>
            <li> Smells so good.  Also makes my skin feel softer</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely awesome and lasts all day!  Get it!</li>
            <li> I use this stuff after my nightly shower as an evening moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is THICK. Like, easily marketable as a body butter thick. As others have said, it&#x27;s tough to get it out of the container. I just store it upside down and that seems to help a little. I&#x27;m sure as the product goes, so will my patience. If possible, see if you can somehow scoop it out of its current receptacle into a tub of some kind&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a longtime sufferer of acne, and this stuff moisturizes my skin without causing breakouts. I was previously using a local goat milk lotion and I loved it, but the salicylic acid and other ingredients in this lotion give me that extra oomph of skin lovin&#x27; I needed.&lt;br /&gt;It does have the black soap smell like the other SheaMoisture black soap products, but that&#x27;s fine and I really enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use this in the morning under my makeup, as it would make my skin greasy. No thanks, ya&#x27;ll. But I love it as a night moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;After using this for many months, I switched to CeraVe for my morning moisturizer and a glycolic acid lotion for evenings. That seems to help my acne the very best. However, I have a friend with terrible eczema on her hands and arms, and I gave her the rest of my container. She LOVES IT! When she&#x27;s diligent about putting it on, her eczema is seriously diminished. She really loves it and her skin does, too.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Very thick and rich.  I&#x27;ve been using it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause acne!</li>
            <li> great for my hair too</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie, so I can&#x27;t say this is my one and only, but it easily could be (and might be after I go through all of my other lotions and potions and creams and what-not). As another poster remarked, my ONLY issue with this &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is the packaging/dispensing system is not really adequate for the consistency of the lotion. This lotion is more of a thick cream. The smell is pleasant, rather neutral and not very strong. Suitable for male or female use. It&#x27;s made of 100% natural ingredients.  And at last, leaves skin moisturized without being oily. It really is good stuff. However, the price here on Amazon is much higher than you&#x27;ll find at stores and other online retailers.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It works well on my skin. My only complaint is the bottle the product comes in. It is incredibly difficult to squeeze the lotion out of the tube. It would seem that the Research &amp; Design team would come up with a better bottle design to dispense the lotion. Maybe a pump or something. I cannot stress enough how hard it is to squeeze the lotion out of this bottle. I am 5&#x27;11 225lbs and work out three/four days a week and I struggle with it. PLEASE DESIGN A NEW BOTTLE DISPENSE METHOD WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> Completely agree with Matt. The lotion is fantastic, no scent, very thick, lasts long, but the packaging is not good at all. I always have to cut it to get it out. I should be in a tub, it is impossible to squeeze out of the top. I end up putting it in old Bath &amp; Body Works tubs.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion hate the packaging.  You can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle :(</li>
            <li> Love, love, love. It leaves me smelling good all day and has cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> This black soap type soap,body wash and especially the lotion are the bomb. I have thyroid disease so my skin is severely dry,itchy and lack luster at times. I have acne on my chest (embarrassing) and face also and my skin is sensitive. I tried du du osun but it was really strong and a job to bathe/shower with. This stuff dosen&#x27;t dry my face out,infact my face has cleared up. I don&#x27;t itch after using anyone of these. Oh I&#x27;m also a nurse and now I recommend this to patients since is natural you can&#x27;t go wrong.This lotion is so thick it is hard to get out of the bottle, and it the moisture last long. My skin is really improving and is baby soft and smooth.Give it a try, I think you will love it. The bar is huge too. They sell it at Target/Walmart/Walgreens in-store and online.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this lotion for a very long time, it helps with her acne on her shoulders and back. We couldn&#x27;t find it at Target, Walgreens, or CVS. We knew we would find it on Amazon. She really likes it and we hope that Amazon will continue to sell it.</li>
            <li> My hands have been so dry this winter my knuckles were bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;I like to use natural products, and this is the best lotion natural or not.  Other lotions often just wash right off as soon as you get your hands wet, or they&#x27;re greasy.  This is perfect!  I put it on once or twice a day and my hands are so soft.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t smell as great as the other SheaMoisture products, but at least the scent is faint.</li>
            <li> I rate this lotion a four star, but what I really dislike about it is the why the lotion is package.  It&#x27;s so thick and rich that is to hard to get the lotion out of the bottle.  Maybe it need to be in a jar if the cost isn&#x27;t to great. The weather is about to change and this Black African Shea Butter lotion does moisturize my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! i hate that it is so pricy, but because the lotion is so thick and creamy i dont have to use as much as i do other lotions. I have terrible psoriasis and MCS (Multiple Chemical Syndrome) so it makes beauty products a battle field in which most products are like landmines! It smells amazing, but itsnt too overpowering. I love this stuff!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, but it should be packaged in a tub.  This lotion is the consistency of of cold butter, so it is nearly impossible to get it out of the bottle.  I had to cut the top off and scoop it out.  Hope to see it repackaged soon, I&#x27;d certainly buy it again if it was.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion.  It has cleared up so many little nagging skin issues I have.  I&#x27;ve got my mom using it.  And I use it regularly on my dog too.  Just great stuff.</li>
            <li> I use ONLY this lotion after every shower and I have seen a dramatic improvement in the clarity and softness of my skin in the short time of use. Only a week. I 100% recommend this product for use. It is VERY moisturizing, but a little too thick to get out the bottle. I have to unscrew the top to actually get a decent amount out, but aside from the packaging the consistency of the product itself is money worthy.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful.  You don&#x27;t need that much of it also.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thick, rich cream (not really a lotion) is a great healing lotion for cracked, dry skin.  It keeps my hands, elbows and feet supple and youthful-looking longer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It even helps the rough redness of my rosacea.  I keep the bottle upside down in a tumbler -it&#x27;s too thick to squeeze out otherwise.  It may seem pricey, but a bottle lasts and lasts - you only need a dab!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion but it is so thick and hard to get out.</li>
            <li> It is great for sensitive skin! I will continue to use this product as long as its on the market</li>
            <li> I was having a horrible episode of flakiness and irritation. This lotion, along with the wash saved my skin and my confidence. It&#x27;s very thick, I think I will whip with some olive or coconut oil to liquify.</li>
            <li> This lotion is great! The lotion works very good on oily skin to not clog pores to make skin oily. It is also great for acne, leaves not residue, is creamy, and smells amazing. People with acne/ or oily skin should buy this product. Dry skin people can benefit as well since the creamy texture of the lotion truly moisturizers the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with bad acne since I was 15! I am now 26 and was recommended by a friend to try this and also because Aveeno discontinued my original soap. So I tried this for my acne along with the Shea Moisture African black soap bar. I admit that it is a little thick but it suggests to apply to a damp face for it to soak into your skin and it works! I have been using this for a little more then a week and my face feels smoothe, looks brighter and my brown scars are evening out and acne almost completely gone! I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product, really good for extremely dry &amp; irritated skin. Packaging is horrible-I couldn&#x27;t get it out of the bottle (have bilateral carpal tunnel issues &amp; my hands just don&#x27;t work anymore). The consistency is very, very thick &amp; thicker than most body butters. I had to cut the bottle open (no easy feat), then transfer product to an empty body butter wide-mouth tub&lt;br /&gt;Sundial Products: hello! Who tested your packaging?</li>
            <li> Nice and thick.  No junk or chemicals.  Shea butter is the ultimate moisturizer. No residual rashes or eczema. Love it</li>
            <li> Fantastic lotion.  I am allergic to so many beauty ingredients but this lotion relieves my itching and leaves my skin looking younger and healthier. The lotion looks like you would have to work to rub it in but no, it melts into your skin like whipped butter. I do wish that it came in a tub instead of a squeeze bottle.  I am ready to saw the bottle open and put the lotion into a jar.  It is now my forever lotion.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing. I love the scent!</li>
