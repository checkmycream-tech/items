            <li>it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Loving the wig(: does tangle but</li>
            <li>Basically be gentle with this wig, and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Good for a cheap cosplay wig that won&#x27;t be worn too often.</li>
            <li>The purple and red are perfect! !</li>
            <li>Love the length and quality.</li>
            <li>Still love the wig.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>is more curly-er then the picture&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>This wig is okay.</li>
            <li>I was more looking for something for every-other-day wear, and this wig&#x27;s cap shows sometimes.</li>
            <li>and I plan to wear this with my pastel outfits some day :)</li>
            <li>God I love this wig.</li>
            <li>PROS: very soft, beautiful color, looks like the picture</li>
            <li>shipped within the time it stated it would, so that was something pretty good about it, as well as the after-it&#x27;s-styled bit I mentioned before.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for cosplay with minimal styling needed before wearing.</li>
            <li>The wig was very nice and curly,its pretty full except on the top.&lt;br /&gt;You can kind of see the wig lace when you shift the bangs a certain way.</li>
            <li>in early&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Easily styled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s pretty nice</li>
            <li>Bought this wig for a Touhou cosplay; at first, shipping said it might arrive later than when I would&#x27;ve needed it, but it came well ahead of time, and it fits and looks perfect!</li>
            <li>The color is fairly accurate.</li>
            <li>My daughter wore it for Halloween and it looked fantastic</li>
            <li>awsome fit.</li>
            <li>:/&lt;br /&gt;Now for the rest;&lt;br /&gt;-had to pay an additional $20 for faster shipping and in the description it says if you choose that option you will get a free gift with receiving your wig.</li>
            <li>It is really soft and it is one of the best wigs I have bought so far for so cheap.</li>
            <li>only downside is the hairline is not that great and u will most likeley need a hat or floral headband to hide it,but other than that the color is gorgeous and overall it&#x27;s a great Wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super long, and is a beautiful shade of lavender.</li>
            <li>sure what her exact height</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>beautiful and super long, make sure you have a good wig brush to keep from getting tangled due to the length.</li>
            <li>love it, curls are beautiful, but it&#x27;s hard to brush and tangles super easily</li>
            <li>Positive: The wig itself is fantastic!</li>
            <li>This wig is great and super long I&#x27;m.</li>
            <li>Wig cap is kind of small and the wig gets tangled easily, but its really cute!</li>
            <li>(I had to adjust constantly as it often slipped off a bit) and a good bit of cap showed.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it and wore it outside</li>
            <li>I quickly tried it on and the wig cap that comes with</li>
            <li>but it is very pretty and well made</li>
            <li>Lovely color and very soft, but</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more wigs from this seller!</li>
            <li>The EXACTLY way it looks in the picture!</li>
            <li>I had to pay 22 dollars for faster shipping, but I&#x27;d say it was probably worth it.</li>
            <li>Not only did the wig show up ealier than expected, but it is absolutely beautiful!</li>
            <li>A nice, long wig with full curls.</li>
            <li>all great quality wig for what you pay for, just not as thick and full of volume like the picture.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and  easy to work with (I had to style-</li>
            <li>/&gt;The hair is beautifully colored, but is SUPER thin.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture and</li>
            <li>overall I absolutely love the wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m i first time wig buyer and this exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Negative:</li>
            <li>But it wasn&#x27;t the best wig, one of the weft is falling off, and its very thin.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had with it is that if you don&#x27;t part it the right way, the cap shows, but it could be easily covered up with a headpiece or hat.</li>
            <li>The photo is about how it looks color wise but the curls are hard to manage and not &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; but full curls that are way too much</li>
            <li>It came in a couple weeks earlier than I expected, and the bonus wig cap was great.</li>
            <li>I love the long bangs.</li>
            <li>Super soft and comfy</li>
            <li>But it is super soft</li>
            <li>If your head isnt too terribly large, I would think that wouldnt be an issue tho.</li>
            <li>It must have had a bumpy ride during transit because it arrived really tangled.</li>
            <li>It took a lot of effort to get it to be manageable but the wig really completed the look I was going for in my costume.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well of a review I can give because I haven&#x27;t cosplayed much</li>
            <li>Worked real well.  </li>
            <li>My friends thought it was my real hair dyed.</li>
            <li>the size of two quarters stacked on top of each other.</li>
            <li>I added some brown eyeliner where the part is to make it look like my natural roots, and it turned out pretty well.</li>
            <li>I thought this wig would look really fishy since the price was very low but its really pretty and looks like real hair!</li>
            <li>Had the wig cap showing issues as many have spoken of, however I ordered multiple of the same color and after wefting two together the issue is now non existent.</li>
            <li>The wig itself isn&#x27;t the best quality and is a bit thin but for the price that&#x27;s to be expected so for the price</li>
            <li>so I normally would wear this wig with a hat or a flower crown to disguise it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a normal halloween wig.</li>
            <li>The fibers have little shine which makes them seem more natural.</li>
            <li>These came a week early!</li>
            <li>It is made out of a soft, light material (unlike other wigs that feel as if you tied weights to your hair).</li>
            <li>It came in a week early!</li>
            <li>Definitely made the whole costume!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;Tangles a little easily</li>
            <li>along the natural hairline of the wig there is a lot of CAP showing</li>
            <li>Order early.</li>
            <li>If I do wear it I would have to wear a hat, but the thickness for the length doesn&#x27;t even look close to natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thickly laced (well, thicker than most abnormally colored wigs) and the color is what is showed in the picture.</li>
            <li>The color is really beautiful but the wig is a little on the thin side.</li>
            <li>The only thing thats bad about this wig is the way the hair line, the wig knots easily (be gentle with it) and it took a while to get here other than that its a pretty good wig!</li>
            <li>It is a small cap, and I guess Im just used to the larger ones that are one size fits most.</li>
            <li>The wig is beautiful, the only problem is that it&#x27;s a little small on my big head.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected-</li>
            <li>The shipping came really fast, the only problem was that I paid so much for shipping I expected a bigger gift and only got A temporary tattoo</li>
            <li>One thing though- be careful not to comb or style with too much force as the hair will fall out.</li>

            <li> The wig is beautiful, the only problem is that it&#x27;s a little small on my big head.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected-</li>
            <li> The shipping came really fast, the only problem was that I paid so much for shipping I expected a bigger gift and only got A temporary tattoo</li>
            <li> One thing though- be careful not to comb or style with too much force as the hair will fall out.</li>
            <li> only real cons I can think of is that the wig was a bit too small for my head</li>
            <li> Pretty hard to brush</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve had it a month, I ended up cuttong it up to my shoulders because it tangled up into a giant rat&#x27;s nest and that was as long as I could get it!</li>
            <li> Item arrived today, earlier than expected by a week.</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to come.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t take to long to get here</li>
            <li> The wig is a bit shorter in length than I expected, but it looks similar to the image in color and texture.</li>
            <li> The bangs were not too long in my opinion.</li>
            <li> it is small, but tight enough for me so that my hair doesn&#x27;t move as much.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the hair is sparse on the back of the head and the cap shows through.&lt;br /&gt;Easily fixed with careful placement and accessories~</li>
            <li> Other than that I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> As for the packaging, it was in a small grey package and put into a clear Ziploc like bag.</li>
            <li> the person wearing the wig is my cousin~ the wig goes down to her lower back</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super disappointed, as I liked it but am unable to wear it for that reason.</li>
            <li> Smaller than my other wigs and thinner than my other wigs</li>
            <li> I got it within a week, two days before its expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I spent 4 hours brushing this wig out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It constantly attacks me with frizzies :/</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> It came in a knotty shiny mess.</li>
            <li> It was a little tight&lt;br /&gt;Irritated</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a little too costume-y looking for my taste.</li>
            <li> I brushed it out, but that just made it even worse.</li>
            <li> ; Does shed a little&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; A little itchy after a few hours&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; A little too small for my head</li>
            <li> I can see where some people say it&#x27;s a little small in the front and the cap may show, but I don&#x27;t find it too hard to hide under this wig&#x27;s luscious bangs!</li>
            <li> Very soft and luxurious, does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> thin, gets tangled very easily, hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> The color and the shine, (not the bad party city shine the human hair shine)</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and tucking it up in a wig cap</li>
            <li> It was too thin and you can see the wig cap underneath it.</li>
            <li> (it wasn&#x27;t windy and it was kinda chilly) and quite a few people complimented it asking if it was real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> got frizzy after 1 wear, bangs make it look weird</li>
            <li> Very thin, you can see the cap from underneath the hair.</li>

            <li> beautiful and super long, make sure you have a good wig brush to keep from getting tangled due to the length.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this wig to style it for aisha from elsword ^.^ but had change of plans and was not able to do it anyway~ - The wig is perfect! The color and the shine, (not the bad party city shine the human hair shine) •w• the person wearing the wig is my cousin~ the wig goes down to her lower back im not sure what her exact height but it is around 5&#x27;0~5&#x27;2 ish - The only thing thats bad about this wig is the way the hair line, the wig knots easily (be gentle with it) and it took a while to get here other than that its a pretty good wig!</li>
            <li> The color is really beautiful but the wig is a little on the thin side. It must have had a bumpy ride during transit because it arrived really tangled. It took a lot of effort to get it to be manageable but the wig really completed the look I was going for in my costume.</li>
            <li> My daughter wore it for Halloween and it looked fantastic</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well of a review I can give because I haven&#x27;t cosplayed much but that&#x27;s what I had used it for.&lt;br /&gt;The only real cons I can think of is that the wig was a bit too small for my head (I had to adjust constantly as it often slipped off a bit) and a good bit of cap showed. It also came knotted but after I styled it a bit, it looked better.&lt;br /&gt;It shipped within the time it stated it would, so that was something pretty good about it, as well as the after-it&#x27;s-styled bit I mentioned before. It looks a good bit better after styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the title says I would consider buying again if I couldn&#x27;t find a wig.</li>
            <li> I placed the order for this wig in January for a convention today (March). I received it four days ago.&lt;br /&gt;The hair is beautifully colored, but is SUPER thin. I have very thick hair and tucking it up in a wig cap made the mesh show underneath even more.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good practice wig, but I won&#x27;t be ordering from this place again.</li>
            <li> I had to pay 22 dollars for faster shipping, but I&#x27;d say it was probably worth it. I got it within a week, two days before its expected delivery date. It&#x27;s a very good quality wig, not too shiny. I added some brown eyeliner where the part is to make it look like my natural roots, and it turned out pretty well. I will definitely buy more wigs from this seller!</li>
            <li> These came a week early! Its beautiful ! The purple and red are perfect! !</li>
            <li> The wig was very nice and curly,its pretty full except on the top.&lt;br /&gt;You can kind of see the wig lace when you shift the bangs a certain way.</li>
            <li> It was too thin and you can see the wig cap underneath it.</li>
            <li> Perfect as is and lovely</li>
            <li> Not only did the wig show up ealier than expected, but it is absolutely beautiful! It is made out of a soft, light material (unlike other wigs that feel as if you tied weights to your hair). I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> Worked real well.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It constantly attacks me with frizzies :/</li>
            <li> Love the length and quality. Color and style are the same as in the picture,&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that the hair is sparse on the back of the head and the cap shows through.&lt;br /&gt;Easily fixed with careful placement and accessories~</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected- but still good for the price. Had the wig cap showing issues as many have spoken of, however I ordered multiple of the same color and after wefting two together the issue is now non existent.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, easy to wear, went perfectly with my Steven Universe cosplay.</li>
            <li> so cute and beautiful ;^; ahh would buy from again</li>
            <li> The color is just like in the photo. It fits well and it&#x27;s perfect for cosplay with minimal styling needed before wearing. The wig caps provided are a great feature.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture and overall I absolutely love the wig. But it sheds a lot and suggest using a wig brush or anything without bristles!</li>
            <li> Wig was good quality. I love the long bangs. Pretty hard to brush and there is a lot of cap showing at the front, but great for the price. The fibers have little shine which makes them seem more natural.</li>
            <li> came with wig cap. awsome fit.</li>
            <li> The wig is great! It&#x27;s super long, and is a beautiful shade of lavender. It works great for cosplay. Super soft and comfy</li>
            <li> Smaller than my other wigs and thinner than my other wigs but it is very pretty and well made</li>
            <li> It came in a week early! Now that I&#x27;ve had it a month, I ended up cuttong it up to my shoulders because it tangled up into a giant rat&#x27;s nest and that was as long as I could get it! When I first got it, the wig was about to my waist and it was beautiful and curly! I absolutely loved it and wore it outside (it wasn&#x27;t windy and it was kinda chilly) and quite a few people complimented it asking if it was real!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Soft&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Lightweight&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Beautiful color and matched the picture&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Came in early&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Easily styled&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; Does shed a little&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; A little itchy after a few hours&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62; A little too small for my head&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Tangles a little easily</li>
            <li> Item arrived today, earlier than expected by a week. Was in good condition, no discoloration, and as pictures. No gaps in weft/cap not visible through hair. Very soft and luxurious, does not smell bad. Pleased with delivery time and quality! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> PROS: very soft, beautiful color, looks like the picture&lt;br /&gt;CONS: thin, gets tangled very easily, hard to brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all great quality wig for what you pay for, just not as thick and full of volume like the picture.</li>
            <li> The photo is about how it looks color wise but the curls are hard to manage and not &amp;#34;wavy&amp;#34; but full curls that are way too much</li>
            <li> Positive: The wig itself is fantastic! The EXACTLY way it looks in the picture! I&#x27;m i first time wig buyer and this exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Negative: along the natural hairline of the wig there is a lot of CAP showing so I normally would wear this wig with a hat or a flower crown to disguise it. :/&lt;br /&gt;Now for the rest;&lt;br /&gt;-had to pay an additional $20 for faster shipping and in the description it says if you choose that option you will get a free gift with receiving your wig. The shipping came really fast, the only problem was that I paid so much for shipping I expected a bigger gift and only got A temporary tattoo the size of two quarters stacked on top of each other. Pretty disappointing. Other than that I will definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this wig! The color is perfect and it fits comfortably on my head. The only issue I had with it is that if you don&#x27;t part it the right way, the cap shows, but it could be easily covered up with a headpiece or hat.</li>
            <li> Lovely color and very soft, but the wig cap part is TINY. I&#x27;m super disappointed, as I liked it but am unable to wear it for that reason.</li>
            <li> The wig is beautiful, the only problem is that it&#x27;s a little small on my big head. It&#x27;s gonna take a while to get used to the big bangs in my face, but i&#x27;ll manage. Still love the wig. Good for its price. Can&#x27;t seem to find any see through parts in it which is good.</li>
            <li> A nice, long wig with full curls. The color is fairly accurate. It&#x27;s a bit thin, but the light netting matches the hair, and the curls make it look fuller. The curls need a bit of work after coming out of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;The customer service was great. One of my products was damaged, and they messaged me back immediately. Good for a cheap cosplay wig that won&#x27;t be worn too often.</li>
            <li> Wig cap is kind of small and the wig gets tangled easily, but its really cute!</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to come. Order early.</li>
            <li> It was okay. Shipping was exexcellent it arrived 5days before. But it wasn&#x27;t the best wig, one of the weft is falling off, and its very thin. But it is super soft</li>
            <li> It came in a knotty shiny mess. It looks like those $3 wigs you&#x27;d buy at a Holloween shop. I brushed it out, but that just made it even worse. I spent 4 hours brushing this wig out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5.</li>
            <li> I used it for a Lumpy Space Princess costume.</li>
            <li> This wig is great and super long I&#x27;m. 5&#x27;10 and it reaches to the end of my back.the only downside is the hairline is not that great and u will most likeley need a hat or floral headband to hide it,but other than that the color is gorgeous and overall it&#x27;s a great Wig.</li>
            <li> This purple wig was perfect, it fits great and looks beautiful a great buy!</li>
            <li> I thought this wig would look really fishy since the price was very low but its really pretty and looks like real hair! My friends thought it was my real hair dyed. I will buy wigs here again :D</li>
            <li> Very thin, you can see the cap from underneath the hair. If I do wear it I would have to wear a hat, but the thickness for the length doesn&#x27;t even look close to natural.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Perfect color&lt;br /&gt;Curl is more curly-er then the picture&lt;br /&gt;Came with wig cap&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t take to long to get here&lt;br /&gt;Amazing for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;I have a big head with a lot of hair. It was a little tight&lt;br /&gt;Irritated my skin after a couple hours&lt;br /&gt;Some of the curls fell out when I opened it</li>
            <li> The wig itself isn&#x27;t the best quality and is a bit thin but for the price that&#x27;s to be expected so for the price it&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> I really do like this wig, its a gorgeous style, and a wonderful length. It came in a couple weeks earlier than I expected, and the bonus wig cap was great. The only thing I wish was different about it is the cap. It is a small cap, and I guess Im just used to the larger ones that are one size fits most. If your head isnt too terribly large, I would think that wouldnt be an issue tho.</li>
            <li> Loving the wig(: does tangle but it&#x27;s like a normal halloween wig. Also the cap d</li>
            <li> got frizzy after 1 wear, bangs make it look weird</li>
            <li> I love this wig! It&#x27;s thickly laced (well, thicker than most abnormally colored wigs) and the color is what is showed in the picture. The hair is soft and  easy to work with (I had to style- and then I washed the hairspray gunk out. It went well.) and it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous. One thing though- be careful not to comb or style with too much force as the hair will fall out. Basically be gentle with this wig, and it&#x27;s perfect. Definitely will order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> love it, curls are beautiful, but it&#x27;s hard to brush and tangles super easily</li>
            <li> This wig is okay. I was more looking for something for every-other-day wear, and this wig&#x27;s cap shows sometimes. Sometimes it&#x27;s a little too costume-y looking for my taste.</li>
            <li> Bought this wig for a Touhou cosplay; at first, shipping said it might arrive later than when I would&#x27;ve needed it, but it came well ahead of time, and it fits and looks perfect! I can see where some people say it&#x27;s a little small in the front and the cap may show, but I don&#x27;t find it too hard to hide under this wig&#x27;s luscious bangs! Definitely made the whole costume!</li>
            <li> The package arrived last evening to my surprise since I had just spoken to one of the sellers about when they arrive heh. They definitely arrived way before the delivery estimate by about a week earlier. As for the packaging, it was in a small grey package and put into a clear Ziploc like bag. The wig was covered in a hairnet and I could somewhat see the hair cap issue others have stated. I quickly tried it on and the wig cap that comes with it is small, but tight enough for me so that my hair doesn&#x27;t move as much. The wig is a bit shorter in length than I expected, but it looks similar to the image in color and texture. It is really soft and it is one of the best wigs I have bought so far for so cheap. I saw no hair cap showing when I tried it on so it&#x27;s not too big of a deal. The bangs were not too long in my opinion. All in all, it&#x27;s pretty nice and I plan to wear this with my pastel outfits some day :) (In the photo, it&#x27;s a bit darker than how the wig actually looks and it&#x27;s not overly shiny. I literally put it on after I got the package if you couldn&#x27;t tell pff)</li>
            <li> God I love this wig. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> SHE REALLY LOVED IT  !!!!</li>
