            <li>I get so many compliments on this hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair style.</li>
            <li>is ok</li>
            <li>I am glad I read all the reviews before purchasing this unit.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like a 1</li>
            <li>I love it so much!!</li>
            <li>but my hair is a huge deal to me.</li>
            <li>I use foundatin to match the lace with my light brown complection.</li>
            <li>hair still looks more natural the more it relaxes.</li>
            <li>Its cool.</li>
            <li>Trimming the lace is pretty easy on or off yoru head.</li>
            <li>I also would have liked for it to be bigger, the fit is a bit too snug</li>
            <li>I love how this hair looks when its all fresh and super soft.</li>
            <li>I would have loved it if I didn&#x27;t have to put it so far back on my head to have it fit.</li>
            <li>It is a very pretty at first glance ...</li>
            <li>Came in the right color.</li>
            <li>I like it, it is nice for a synthetic but definately takes a lot of care to avoid tangles or dry look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned it for 4 days, So I don&#x27;t have too many complaints about it now, but even if I did &amp;</li>
            <li>this wig has a  nice parting ,  wear it to an outing looking more like a  real human hair, it tangle a little bit which resolved with a detangle, also shake and go, and curls will be bouncy</li>
            <li>Nice wig, but 1b is like charcoal black and dye</li>
            <li>There is a huge clip in back and two in the front on the sides.</li>
            <li>but much wig hair becomes entangled ... and the hair tips and got burned ...</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really have the time or interest.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and the baby hairs make it look completely natural.</li>
            <li>It looks better down than in a braid if you ask me.</li>
            <li>The wig looked exactly like the picture which is very rare, the hair is a nice quality, but the wig cap is entirely too small for people with a normal sized head/or people who actually have hair under their wigs.</li>
            <li>get&#x27;s a little tangled so you need to make sure that you comb through it.</li>
            <li>It is a little snug fitting</li>
            <li>but it comes with few hair, the color is ok</li>
            <li>it just has to come out of the braid too quickly because it starts to come loose.</li>
            <li>However the highlights are intense in the front which I wish we&#x27;re more subtle.</li>
            <li>They are all true both good and bad.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more, which it came in black and rd&lt;br /&gt;Dark</li>
            <li>braid is much tighter than another French braid wig I have.</li>
            <li>It is SO LONG and pretty.</li>
            <li>Its soft and looks extremely natural.</li>
            <li>I love this hair style except the style of the braid down the back doesn&#x27;t last but</li>
            <li>If you want something different or a new look, this might be the one for you.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d suggest you braid down your hair first before putting this wig on.</li>

            <li> like wearing a new one every week and a half - I haven&#x27;t made it two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wear it braided for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> It is so long</li>
            <li> Normally, average size wigs are big on me, but not this wig.</li>
            <li> There is not too much loose hair around my face.</li>
            <li> three day then the braid starts to come loose  </li>
            <li> I brought the wig for the style of  one braid down the back</li>
            <li> It is longer than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The braid is a very loose one and it&#x27;s coming apart already.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the #1B because all the reviews said the 1 was too dark and looked fake and that was absolutely true.  </li>
            <li> I mean the texture is unbelievably soft..</li>
            <li> I have bought this wig at least three times though in different colors.</li>
            <li> You take the braid down and wear it curly.</li>
            <li> however you can take the braid down an</li>
            <li> just were the hair down.  </li>
            <li> Wearing as a half wig, not a lacefront.</li>
            <li> so I bought the 1B (which is black)</li>
            <li> My only concern, I afraid to unbraid the hair, because I know it will not look the same.</li>
            <li> Not sure I can purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy again.</li>

            <li> Nice wig, but 1b is like charcoal black and dye do not work on it. Not sure I can purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I like it, it is nice for a synthetic but definately takes a lot of care to avoid tangles or dry look. I also would have liked for it to be bigger, the fit is a bit too snug</li>
            <li> The wig looked exactly like the picture which is very rare, the hair is a nice quality, but the wig cap is entirely too small for people with a normal sized head/or people who actually have hair under their wigs. I would have loved it if I didn&#x27;t have to put it so far back on my head to have it fit. Wearing as a half wig, not a lacefront.</li>
            <li> It is a very pretty at first glance ... but much wig hair becomes entangled ... and the hair tips and got burned ...</li>
            <li> Ordered it, shipped that night and got it in the mIl TWO DAYS LATER!! Amazing!! Loved how it felt. Came in the right color. It&#x27;s super soft and the baby hairs make it look completely natural. Definitely recommend this wig! I love it so much!!</li>
            <li> Perfect pony tail for working out and sleep overs</li>
            <li> get&#x27;s a little tangled so you need to make sure that you comb through it. It looks better down than in a braid if you ask me. It is a little snug fitting so I&#x27;d suggest you braid down your hair first before putting this wig on. I&#x27;ve only owned it for 4 days, So I don&#x27;t have too many complaints about it now, but even if I did &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. And I think for the price it&#x27;s a deal. :)</li>
            <li> I like that it looks like it shows in pic. it just has to come out of the braid too quickly because it starts to come loose. I have bought this wig at least three times though in different colors. Its cool.</li>
            <li> I agree with several of the reviews. This is the smallest wig size I&#x27;ve ever had. Normally, average size wigs are big on me, but not this wig. I too had to check and verify this wig was not a 3/4 wig. The lace is stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The braid is much tighter than another French braid wig I have. I got the 1B and I like the color and style. There is not too much loose hair around my face. For the price, this wig is OK. It is longer than I expected.  I&#x27;ll wear it braided for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This hair is brilliant. Whoever thought of this is a genius. You take the braid down and wear it curly. Soooo cute.</li>
            <li> this wig has a  nice parting ,  wear it to an outing looking more like a  real human hair, it tangle a little bit which resolved with a detangle, also shake and go, and curls will be bouncy</li>
            <li> OMG I love this wig. Its OFFICALLY my go to. I have never wore it in the braided style. I always clip the rubberband and unbraid the hair. It is SO LONG and pretty. Its soft and looks extremely natural. Lots of room to part on the lace but I always use the part provided. Trimming the lace is pretty easy on or off yoru head. I use foundatin to match the lace with my light brown complection. I get so many compliments on this hair.  There is a huge clip in back and two in the front on the sides. There are also shapers (if thats what they are called) I like forming them to keep the lace flush with my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;I like wearing a new one every week and a half - I haven&#x27;t made it two weeks. You can&#x27;t beat the price and and I don&#x27;t think $120 / month to keep my hair looking fly is unreasonable. I&#x27;ve paid 5x that amount - but my hair is a huge deal to me. One day I might actually take the time to condition this wig after a weeks use but I don&#x27;t really have the time or interest. I love how this hair looks when its all fresh and super soft. I don&#x27;t think there is anything you can do to make it bounce back like that. I did fall asleep in this wig and do some ummm physical activity twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair still looks more natural the more it relaxes.</li>
            <li> Oh My Word, when this wig arrived, I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on. I wore this wig on Thanksgiving Day and everyone complimented me on my hair. My only concern, I afraid to unbraid the hair, because I know it will not look the same. If you want something different or a new look, this might be the one for you.</li>
            <li> Where can I start from.the wig feel amazing I mean the texture is unbelievably soft..I used it three time and people won&#x27;t stop starting, and asking where I got it from ..I will definitely be ordering more, which it came in black and rd&lt;br /&gt;Dark red as Ombre...</li>
            <li> However the highlights are intense in the front which I wish we&#x27;re more subtle. However I like the style and ease of the product.  May seek identical with darker highlights.  Maybe</li>
            <li> I love this hair style except the style of the braid down the back doesn&#x27;t last but three day then the braid starts to come loose  however you can take the braid down an just were the hair down.  I brought the wig for the style of  one braid down the back so after three wares I need to find some one who can braid. I love this hair style.</li>
            <li> It is so long but it comes with few hair, the color is ok and I look different  for me is ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about the complexion of the model and wanted her colour wig but it was sold out in the store and online so I bought the 1B (which is black) and it looks like great.  I&#x27;m really happy with the fit and purchase.</li>
            <li> I am glad I read all the reviews before purchasing this unit.  They are all true both good and bad.  I ordered the #1B because all the reviews said the 1 was too dark and looked fake and that was absolutely true.  Even though it says 1B it&#x27;s more like a 1 I could have gone a shade lighter.  The braid is a very loose one and it&#x27;s coming apart already.  With that said, it&#x27;s a beatuful looking unit and the hair is perfect.  Not sure if I would buy again.</li>
