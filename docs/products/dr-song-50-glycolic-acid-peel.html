    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I tried the 30% Glycolic and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>Very good !!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>very good for the price</li>
            <li>After dryness goes away, it reveals beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>the company is great too.</li>
            <li>Great products for the price.</li>
            <li>and you have great skin.</li>
            <li>This peel works great,  </li>
            <li>I tried Dr. Song&#x27;s 50% lactic acid and had great results, and the 40% glycolic acid was just great.</li>
            <li>Very nice and helpful.</li>
            <li>Stay out of the sun for 24 hours, but once a month has given me remarkable results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong for over the counter!</li>
            <li>I have used the Dr. Song 30% for over a year, with good results and zero discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Good stuff</li>
            <li>Again It&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>I felt like it was as hoped for: a step up from my more diluted but still great glycolic acid product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>songs products are excellent and do exactly what they say.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Never thought I could do my own peel.</li>
            <li>this stuff makes my skin look so much better.</li>
            <li>And i will continue to order :)</li>
            <li>I think I did apply it for about 1-2 more minutes (of course a bit more stinging and blistering).  </li>
            <li>I will however, use the product much more often than once a month.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m confident that it will continue to soften my skin and slough freckles and fade malasma.  </li>
            <li>Youtube has many videos on how to use a product like this.</li>
            <li>The product is very easy to use, the gel makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions and easily applied the product with a cotton ball and kept it on for one minute.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so easy</li>
            <li>I was sort of a light sting and the fumes bothered my eyes, but waving my hands in front of my face helped.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a such great products!!&lt;br /&gt;Roxanne</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I am very thankful for the opportunity to buy a potent product that can be used in a variety of ways.</li>
            <li>I apply it with a vinyl glove and set my phone timer to 45 seconds, then rinse it off as quickly as I can.  </li>
            <li>I had a problem with my order and it was quickly taken care of by Dr Song&#x27;s team.</li>
            <li>(Now I don&#x27;t really apply the product there because I see how easy it take to that area.)&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my 50% Lactic Acid came in the mail</li>
            <li>The benefit is that you can get it closer to your eyes without irritation and I could really see a difference in the fine lines on the eye where I got the solution</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fair to say that I kind of like the lactic acid peel better only because it feels more slow, gentle, and deep-- not as much like the top layer is getting singed off.</li>
            <li>It burns yes, but the burning stops right when you rinse.  </li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>This works very well, Watch it closely so you don&#x27;t burn yourself!  </li>
            <li>I had fear at first</li>
            <li>I can feel it, so like to think it&#x27;s doing something positive for my skin.</li>
            <li>The company hasn&#x27;t been very helpful either.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Then when I rinse my face I didn&#x27;t notice any change but after that  I applied 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E and my face started to look very well</li>
            <li>but my face really improve.</li>
            <li>and I was determined to make my whole face peel.  </li>
            <li>This really made my nose and chin blister up.  </li>
            <li>I guess because that area is more sensitive or because I left the product on there for longer.  </li>
            <li>I was already using a 12% glycolic acid product daily which is pretty much the Holy Grail, so I decided to up it a very large notch and try this stuff</li>
            <li>My skin tone looks a lot more even, and my giant cheeks pores are not so giant anymore.</li>
            <li>Lastly, when I go to repurchase these products, as stated I am slightly more drawn to the lactic acid although at the time mine was $5 more expensive.  </li>
            <li>Follow their instructions and do not keep it on longer, especially the first time.</li>
            <li>I am also hopefully that it helps with some light pink acne scars, but only time will tell!  </li>
            <li>Burns but gives you baby soft skin.</li>
            <li>when apply the acid glycolic, I felt like my face and my eyes was burning; even when I didn&#x27;t apply near to my eyes.</li>
            <li>I assume that this is precautionary for those with sensitive skin as well as a way to reduce the chance of laws suits.  </li>
            <li>I cannot see paying a professional for this treatment.</li>
            <li>I left it on for about a minute or two the first time again, then a day or so later I did it for 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>how long you need the product on to make certain areas peel because all parts of your face are different in sensitivity and skin</li>
            <li>You can definitely feel the peeling action when this goes on your skin.  </li>
            <li>The next day my skin is flaky and then so soft I can&#x27;t believe it.</li>
            <li>(unless you only treat half of your face, haha)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I also find that I&#x27;m not a big fan of waiting the few days to let my face naturally peel.  </li>
            <li> got curious on how it would work if I did it the next day</li>
            <li> I think once per week for one minute will slowly and gently take layers off</li>
            <li> Skin got dry in some places, but that is what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> My face was sort of pink</li>
            <li> Follow directions carefully!  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers stated, I was sort of nervous to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the risk and pain it causes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve used a 30% in the past or need a stronger peel, I would suggest this 40%.</li>
            <li> these things said, I am going to continue to use the product, but probably no more that in 1 minute intervals (I may use the lactic acid in 2 minute intervals) unless I know I&#x27;ll be home for the week-- maybe during Thanksgiving or Spring Break, but with kids, this is hard.  </li>
            <li> feel like it&#x27;s hard to time</li>
            <li> As with any skin product it&#x27;s so hard to say because there is no control group</li>
            <li> I have slowly increased my time with each peel.&lt;br /&gt;Results?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the personality to look terrible around town with my face looking leathery and scaly for a few days while I agree to not disturb the peeling with my fingers (not to mention, using it harshly is more dangerous</li>
            <li> Pure crap!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this stuff works, stings like crazy for the 45 seconds</li>
            <li> Horrible, just horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Follow directions carefully!  Works really well! Burns but gives you baby soft skin. I can only leave the product on for about 5 minutes and I have been using a glycolic cleanser for months and I started with Dr songs 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;doctor songs products are excellent and do exactly what they say.</li>
            <li> This works very well, Watch it closely so you don&#x27;t burn yourself!  It&#x27;s very strong for over the counter!</li>
            <li> this stuff definitely works. My skin tone looks a lot more even, and my giant cheeks pores are not so giant anymore. ha. this stuff makes my skin look so much better. the company is great too. Very nice and helpful. I have already ordered from them again. And i will continue to order :)</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me and burnt my skin. The company hasn&#x27;t been very helpful either. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s not worth the risk and pain it causes.</li>
            <li> very good for the price</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Great products for the price. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used the Dr. Song 30% for over a year, with good results and zero discomfort.  So I ramped it up to the 40%. What a difference 10% can make!  Maybe it&#x27;s just my skin, but this stuff works, stings like crazy for the 45 seconds I leave it on, but my face peels just 3 days later.  Follow the directions to a tee. I apply it with a vinyl glove and set my phone timer to 45 seconds, then rinse it off as quickly as I can.  Stay out of the sun for 24 hours, but once a month has given me remarkable results. But trust the directions and respect the words Acid and Peel</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my order and it was quickly taken care of by Dr Song&#x27;s team. Can&#x27;t wait to try my peel. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> when apply the acid glycolic, I felt like my face and my eyes was burning; even when I didn&#x27;t apply near to my eyes. Then when I rinse my face I didn&#x27;t notice any change but after that  I applied 20% Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic Acid + Vitamin E and my face started to look very well (it took 4 days). I don&#x27;t know which one worked or maybe both of them but my face really improve.</li>
            <li> I tried the 30% Glycolic and was very impressed. Since the launch sale was still on, I went back for the 40%. The product is very easy to use, the gel makes it easy to control.</li>
            <li> Very good !! I like the after feeling and it does work!</li>
            <li> It will take off age spots or liver spots.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...can&#x27;t believe the change in my overall skin appearance. This product did work. Never thought I could do my own peel. I don&#x27;t need anything else except maybe some type of moisturiser. Truly simplifies skin care. Once a week and you have great skin.</li>
            <li> Horrible, just horrible. Doesn&#x27;t work! Stings like it suppose to, but doesn&#x27;t flake nor does any pealing. Pure crap!</li>
            <li> I was already using a 12% glycolic acid product daily which is pretty much the Holy Grail, so I decided to up it a very large notch and try this stuff (I also tried the 50% Lactic Acid which I&#x27;ll be writing a review on).&lt;br /&gt;It comes with instructions to leave it on for 1 minute then increase the time by1-2 minutes with 4 weeks between each use.  I assume that this is precautionary for those with sensitive skin as well as a way to reduce the chance of laws suits.  As other reviewers stated, I was sort of nervous to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions and easily applied the product with a cotton ball and kept it on for one minute.  I was sort of a light sting and the fumes bothered my eyes, but waving my hands in front of my face helped. I rinsed the solution off.  My face was sort of pink and you could even see some tiny water blisters on my nose.  I felt like it was as hoped for: a step up from my more diluted but still great glycolic acid product.&lt;br /&gt;I got curious on how it would work if I did it the next day and/or a longer time amount and if I could actually get my face to peel. I think I did apply it for about 1-2 more minutes (of course a bit more stinging and blistering).  The area around the lower sides of my nose peeled-- I guess because that area is more sensitive or because I left the product on there for longer.  (Now I don&#x27;t really apply the product there because I see how easy it take to that area.)&lt;br /&gt;Finally, my 50% Lactic Acid came in the mail and I was determined to make my whole face peel.  It&#x27;s fair to say that I kind of like the lactic acid peel better only because it feels more slow, gentle, and deep-- not as much like the top layer is getting singed off. I left it on for about a minute or two the first time again, then a day or so later I did it for 3 minutes.  This really made my nose and chin blister up.  My chin, this time was the only part that peeled and it peeled a lot.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s hard to time how long you need the product on to make certain areas peel because all parts of your face are different in sensitivity and skin thickness-- with time, determination, and documentation, anyone could figure it out .  I also find that I&#x27;m not a big fan of waiting the few days to let my face naturally peel.  And let&#x27;s face it, who doesn&#x27;t have OCD and wouldn&#x27;t also want to  peel and pick on the area?  Plus it&#x27;s sort of embarrassing to be around town with an unidentified skin problem on your face.&lt;br /&gt;With these things said, I am going to continue to use the product, but probably no more that in 1 minute intervals (I may use the lactic acid in 2 minute intervals) unless I know I&#x27;ll be home for the week-- maybe during Thanksgiving or Spring Break, but with kids, this is hard.  I don&#x27;t have the personality to look terrible around town with my face looking leathery and scaly for a few days while I agree to not disturb the peeling with my fingers (not to mention, using it harshly is more dangerous and I worry about scaring)..  I will however, use the product much more often than once a month.  I think once per week for one minute will slowly and gently take layers off and I&#x27;m confident that it will continue to soften my skin and slough freckles and fade malasma.  I am also hopefully that it helps with some light pink acne scars, but only time will tell!  Lastly, when I go to repurchase these products, as stated I am slightly more drawn to the lactic acid although at the time mine was $5 more expensive.  The benefit is that you can get it closer to your eyes without irritation and I could really see a difference in the fine lines on the eye where I got the solution closer.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I am very thankful for the opportunity to buy a potent product that can be used in a variety of ways.</li>
            <li> After using a short time I found my facial skin appeared smoother and softer which in turn would be a younger look. Thank you</li>
            <li> You can definitely feel the peeling action when this goes on your skin.  It burns yes, but the burning stops right when you rinse.  I don&#x27;t mind though because to me that means its working.  Follow their instructions and do not keep it on longer, especially the first time. I have slowly increased my time with each peel.&lt;br /&gt;Results?  As with any skin product it&#x27;s so hard to say because there is no control group (unless you only treat half of your face, haha) so who knows?  I can feel it, so like to think it&#x27;s doing something positive for my skin.</li>
            <li> This peel works great,  I have been using the 30% one for awhile, but decided to give it a bump and go for the 40%.  If you&#x27;ve used a 30% in the past or need a stronger peel, I would suggest this 40%.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh! I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve done 2 peels with it.  The next day my skin is flaky and then so soft I can&#x27;t believe it. I can&#x27;t wait to do my next one!  My brown spots are fading every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Again It&#x27;s a good thing. I had fear at first but it&#x27;s so easy I cannot see paying a professional for this treatment. Youtube has many videos on how to use a product like this.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I would definitely purchase again. Skin got dry in some places, but that is what it is supposed to do. After dryness goes away, it reveals beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! I tried Dr. Song&#x27;s 50% lactic acid and had great results, and the 40% glycolic acid was just great. I used it on m husband who has a facial scar and already I see a reduction in the appearance of it. Thank you for making a such great products!!&lt;br /&gt;Roxanne</li>
