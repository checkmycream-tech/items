            <li>The BEST.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect for me - defines and accentuates my eyes without making me look like a raccoon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These eyeliners do provide the perfect point.</li>
            <li>Just like the name, it is always a perfect point for this product.</li>
            <li>A perfect, muted tone that is ideal for under the eye and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This one is very good, although not as good as</li>
            <li>Great brow pencil.</li>
            <li>Got just what I ordered &amp; am a happy camper.  </li>
            <li>My wife is happy, therefore...</li>
            <li>I am happy.</li>
            <li>A nice, muted tone that is ideal for under the eye and filling in patchy eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>I have green/brown eyes, fair skin, and ash blond going gray hair.  </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I am very happy with the crayon itself, and the price is very reasonable at under $4.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy Amazon has it available.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use with a good result.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite pencil.  </li>
            <li>I actually use it on my eyebrows and it is a perfect color match.  </li>
            <li>I order extras always to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li>I love this pencil.  </li>
            <li>I have worn this eyeliner for years, love it.</li>
            <li>Still love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and apply.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth not clumpy.</li>
            <li>I especially like it as an under the eye liner because it didn&#x27;t smudge at all while wearing it on a very warm and humid day.  </li>
            <li>It goes on pretty smoothly, which is one of my biggest complaints about many pencil type liners.</li>
            <li>I love this, it&#x27;s really a neutral</li>
            <li>Many thanks.</li>
            <li>They are inexpensive and arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>the seller wants to provide good business, I SUGGEST he tell the truth, DOUBLE CHECK</li>
            <li>Can be applied with a light touch so result looks very natural instead of like a manikin!</li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s favorite eye liner and she&#x27;s been using it for the last several or more years.  </li>
            <li>and I like the grey khaki because it&#x27;s a good option -- not too dark but not too light!</li>
            <li>Great color - just dark enough.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I could live without it!!</li>
            <li>I use this for my eyebrows, which are very sparse.  </li>
            <li>really like the Grey Khaki color, texture, and firmness of the crayon itself, and it glides on smoothly without having to stretch the skin around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>We would sometimes have a hard time finding it at stores and one day, after looking at five local stores, I tried Amazon and found joy at last.  </li>
            <li>Does need to be touched up if you&#x27;re interested in keeping the same intensity all day.</li>
            <li>hard, clear plastic sleeve that sticks way out on the top can scratch when the crayon falls below that sleeve, so keep that in mind while using it.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so far.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Grey Khaki  Eyeliner because nearly every Cosmetic</li>

            <li> So. has stopped making  their&lt;br /&gt;eyeliner and eyebrow pencils in grey.  </li>
            <li> Have used this eyeliner/eyebrow pencil--for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> These pencils were all very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> The color was as expected.</li>

            <li> I called the seller when I received the DIRTY &amp; EXPIRED PRODUCT yesterday. He gave some poor excuse &amp; stated that he&#x27;d give me a credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I appreciate the gesture, he shouldn&#x27;t have made up a lousy excuse that it was NOT NOTICABLE because IT WAS. A DIRTY BOX, EYELINER TIP FELL APART IN THE BOX, the other end to lighten the liner under the eye WAS YELLOW &amp; FELL APART AS WELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the seller wants to provide good business, I SUGGEST he tell the truth, DOUBLE CHECK WHAT GOES OUT, &amp; admit when he&#x27;s made an error.</li>
            <li> I love this, it&#x27;s really a neutral and if you put it over eyeshadow it accentuates that color.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite pencil.  I actually use it on my eyebrows and it is a perfect color match.  My local drug store is always sold out of this color so I&#x27;m happy Amazon has it available.  I don&#x27;t think I could live without it!!</li>
            <li> The BEST. I hope they never stop making this color. I order extras always to be sure I never run out.</li>
            <li> Great brow pencil. The color was as expected. It goes on smooth not clumpy. Easy to use and apply. Seems to last well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and I like the grey khaki because it&#x27;s a good option -- not too dark but not too light! Does need to be touched up if you&#x27;re interested in keeping the same intensity all day.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Grey Khaki  Eyeliner because nearly every Cosmetic So. has stopped making  their&lt;br /&gt;eyeliner and eyebrow pencils in grey.  This one is very good, although not as good as the grey&lt;br /&gt;eyebrow pencils I used to get.</li>
            <li> I love this pencil.  I have blue/green eyes, strawberry blond hair and ivory skin. The color is perfect for me - defines and accentuates my eyes without making me look like a raccoon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and my mother complimented my eye makeup for the 1st time! (I bought her a pencil to commemorate the occasion.)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; ve purchased my pencils as add-ons with other purchases. They are inexpensive and arrive quickly. The only thing I would change, if I could, is that they are not smudge-proof.</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows, which are very sparse.  Been using for years.</li>
            <li> Great color - just dark enough.  Stays on and doesn&#x27;t smudge.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far. It goes on pretty smoothly, which is one of my biggest complaints about many pencil type liners.</li>
            <li> Arrvd on time &amp; well pkd.  This should last me a while!</li>
            <li> I have worn this eyeliner for years, love it.</li>
            <li> A nice, muted tone that is ideal for under the eye and filling in patchy eyebrows.  I especially like it as an under the eye liner because it didn&#x27;t smudge at all while wearing it on a very warm and humid day.  I have green/brown eyes, fair skin, and ash blond going gray hair.  I  really like the Grey Khaki color, texture, and firmness of the crayon itself, and it glides on smoothly without having to stretch the skin around my eyes.  Like others commented, the 1/4&amp;#34; hard, clear plastic sleeve that sticks way out on the top can scratch when the crayon falls below that sleeve, so keep that in mind while using it.  I see no purpose for that unnecessary plastic tip other than to waste the crayon.  I tried to push it down or peel it off, but it is a hard and unyielding plastic tip and I only succeeded in breaking off the crayon!  I knocked off a star for that annoyance and because I question how much of the crayon will be wasted because of it.  Poor design on the part of CoverGirl.  If they improve the design, I will upgrade it to 5 stars.  Meanwhile, I am very happy with the crayon itself, and the price is very reasonable at under $4.</li>
            <li> way darker than looks in pic.</li>
            <li> Got just what I ordered &amp; am a happy camper.  Many thanks.</li>
            <li> These eyeliners do provide the perfect point. No need to have a sharpener. Easy to use with a good result.</li>
            <li> Have used this eyeliner/eyebrow pencil--for a very long time.  Still love it.</li>
            <li> These pencils were all very dry and brittle.  My mom has purchased and used these for years.  She asked me to go to a local store and replace them.</li>
            <li> A perfect, muted tone that is ideal for under the eye and eyebrows. Doesn&#x27;t have the yellow cast that browns do. Can be applied with a light touch so result looks very natural instead of like a manikin! I prefer expresso for the upper lid.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite eye liner and she&#x27;s been using it for the last several or more years.  We would sometimes have a hard time finding it at stores and one day, after looking at five local stores, I tried Amazon and found joy at last.  We bought 5 pencils a year ago and she still has one left unopened.  My wife is happy, therefore... I am happy.</li>
            <li> Just like the name, it is always a perfect point for this product. It is difficult to find a color that works well for for brown hair in the later stages of turning grey, but this is the exception.</li>
