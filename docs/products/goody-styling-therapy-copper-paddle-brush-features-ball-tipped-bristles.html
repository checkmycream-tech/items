            <li>Like most of us who have dandruff (including me) we try everything to control it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if this is helping my scalp quite yet</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair look.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair brush.</li>
            <li>I get the best scalp massage while brushing and because I have Asian hair</li>
            <li>I love this brush.  </li>
            <li>They feel really fantastic on your scalp!</li>
            <li>In that sense, we both represent &amp;#34;blind study&amp;#34; participants who are 100% satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Great product, just wish they made it with real copper bristles.  </li>

            <li>I recommend this brush to anyone with scalp issues or just want to maintain healthy hair</li>
            <li>my hair looks better.</li>
            <li>yet I&#x27;m thrilled the brush is still available via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love how it helps my scalp.</li>
            <li>I had to order a different paddle brush, but will keep this one too because it feels so great on my scalp!</li>
            <li>in a while, I will order many more of These brushes.</li>
            <li>The most scalp stimulating brush heavier</li>
            <li>Glad to have found it again</li>
            <li>and this is better.  </li>
            <li>It covers more area and the bristles seem to hold up better</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>These are the best brushes for my frizzy, coarse and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Eh, I&#x27;m not so sure about this...</li>
            <li>she was more tan excited !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li>I was extremely happy and surprised to find it on line![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I think buying five or six of these brushes a year is more than worth it for the peace of not having an itchy head and how lovely my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I would not use it to detangle, as people have commented the bristles pull out easy</li>
            <li>Love this brush, I always make sure I have one, it really separates the hair providing more volume and messages the scalp.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair smooth and shiny while waking up my scalp.  </li>
            <li>but it has been flake free for 4 days.</li>
            <li>Believe or not it&#x27;s a great present too.</li>
            <li>it just brushes smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush although one of the copper bristles fell out the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It actually helps get rid of dandruff which is great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for bringing me this amazing tool.</li>
            <li>It makes him very calm.</li>
            <li>and/or dandruff claims at the time of original investment.  </li>
            <li>Many thanks to the seller, NY Discounts!</li>
            <li>So excited</li>
            <li>I wore out my original one of these brushes and just had to get a replacement.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy you did - it feels like you&#x27;re stimulating your circulation which relieves the pain that sometimes come with dry scalp.</li>
            <li>,  I really didn&#x27;t see any visible difference in dandruff but the whole Brush is good.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what she wanted and is used several times each day with great results.  </li>
            <li>and I think with the brush and the different types of shampoo out there you can do a good job of maintaining that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sturdy brush and has those great little rubber tips.  </li>
            <li>This is actually the second brush I own of this, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>The brush is designed to use copper to kill the underlying cause of dandruff, and the paddle-brish shape is great for coverage of the head in just a few strokes.</li>
            <li>calm scratch that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re hurting yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with it so far.</li>
            <li>and I rarely have itching anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice enough brush, but hasn&#x27;t helped my dandruff as advertised.</li>
            <li>I use it right after washing my hair and it detangles</li>
            <li>There is a trick of dripping elmers glue over the brush, then dust rings slide right off -</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and nice and firm.</li>
            <li>I am surprised I like the brush so much. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle on scalp, no scratching feeling at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>feels like a massage in the scalp and the sensation is very very relaxing, wont regret to have one of this</li>
            <li>Really helps minimize dandruff!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>My solution is two paddle brushes, the second one made for detangling. :)</li>
            <li>The copper brush lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t seem to deteriorate, and feels great on the scalp (and back).</li>
            <li>It has, however, worked wonders for my scalp (which I mostly attributed to stiff-bristle stimulation prior to searching for a replacement).  </li>
            <li>I think I lost the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes my hair incredibly soft and it&#x27;s fantastic for styling with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to over</li>
            <li>Was exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>Also, sometimes it leaves this coppery smell on my hair when I brush it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>do love the way the bristles actually reach my head.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>the new one seems better than I remember the old one being.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me, so was excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this brush and couldnt wait to try it, Little did i know I would spend most of the day smelling like a penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brush gets all the way through the hair and down to the scalp and feels amazing when brushing your hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a large size, but lightweight.</li>
            <li>I think this bigger size makes a huge difference in how well it lasts.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the brush is huge.  </li>
            <li>did not do much for me and the copper wore off</li>
            <li>it really works buy one</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I just quit trying to find a cure,  but the itch and the flakes very humiliating.  </li>
            <li>It takes a gentle touch to get the hair out without just yanking on the pins.  </li>
            <li>absolutely nothing to eliminate dandruff or stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li>However, it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Gentle on hair.</li>
            <li>but he has been very itchy everywhere. )</li>
            <li>My dog wants one too.</li>
            <li>I use moisturizing conditioners and they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Something I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>People seem to have complained that the brush makes your hair smell, the problem solve for that is use a good smelling shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Honestly I only bought this brush because I liked the wide paddle and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>This particular model is a large brush...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find the same brush for her on Amazon...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work better than any other brush.</li>
            <li>Also, keep the same idea in mind when you clean the brush.</li>
            <li>I love this brush, I bought this brush a few years ago and it has been exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I get nice cold and refreshing feeling while brushing with a Goody Copper brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My wife has long blonde hair and is extremely pleased with the quality and ease of use of this product.  </li>
            <li>Nicely built and study bristles to penetrate my thick hair.</li>
            <li>it is a comfortable massage to help clear loose flake from the scalp.</li>
            <li>but I needed a new brush</li>
            <li>Bought this in a store years ago, and it was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>The first element to give out on this brush (in my direct experience) is the netted polymer material that holds the stiff bristles in place... but bear in mind that ours held up through regular use for many years.  </li>
            <li>;) If you are the type to clean/disinfect your brush regularly, this one can be a chore.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended a copper brush and I grabbed the first one I saw at a local pharmacy store.  </li>
            <li>(I have long straight hair) and works itself through my hair gently.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush so much!!The little balls on the end cant fall off and the spiky things don&#x27;t bend or break off!!</li>
            <li>The bristles don&#x27;t clear up all my dandruff, but I have seen some improvement.</li>
            <li>I bought this to loosen dandruff before showering and so far it has been working.</li>
            <li>I make sure to brush at least twice a day although I think the directions are three times.</li>
            <li>It untangles my naturally curly/knotty hair with ease and the bristles invigorate the scalp.</li>
            <li>but he really loves to get brushed with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;(He</li>
            <li>Overall, it makes my hair feel and look very silky after I brush it.</li>
            <li>Completely defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dandruff, but I have a really sensitive scalp and it gets dry and flaky in parts.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll be sure to keep this post updated in the next few weeks to the next month.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The narrower one loses its bristles easily as I brush.  </li>
            <li>My friends say thanks  ten times already for such gift.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it after a few tries and would not recommend this brush unless you enjoy hurting yourself!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve only had it for a week</li>
            <li>this brush has changed my scalp completely and I can&#x27;t thank the creators of this enough.  </li>
            <li>I made this mistake and this is now why every time I brush my hair my entire head smells like old pennies.</li>
            <li>This brush is a little more firm than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>We owned this model prior for several years before it recently degenerated and we required a new one.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the most uncomfortable brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I just bought it for the second time after having my first one for years due to it starting to fall apart.</li>
            <li>Use it on dry hair to gently massage your scalp when it&#x27;s dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li>I have mid-back length, SUPER THICK hair, and</li>

            <li> I had to order a different paddle brush, but will keep this one too because it feels so great on my scalp!</li>
            <li> in a while, I will order many more of These brushes.</li>
            <li> The most scalp stimulating brush heavier</li>
            <li> Glad to have found it again</li>
            <li> and this is better.  </li>
            <li> It covers more area and the bristles seem to hold up better</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for my frizzy, coarse and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Eh, I&#x27;m not so sure about this...</li>
            <li> she was more tan excited !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy and surprised to find it on line![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I think buying five or six of these brushes a year is more than worth it for the peace of not having an itchy head and how lovely my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I would not use it to detangle, as people have commented the bristles pull out easy</li>
            <li> Love this brush, I always make sure I have one, it really separates the hair providing more volume and messages the scalp.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair smooth and shiny while waking up my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but it has been flake free for 4 days.</li>
            <li> Believe or not it&#x27;s a great present too.</li>
            <li> it just brushes smoothly through my hair.  </li>
            <li> This is a great brush although one of the copper bristles fell out the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It actually helps get rid of dandruff which is great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much for bringing me this amazing tool.</li>
            <li> It makes him very calm.</li>
            <li> and/or dandruff claims at the time of original investment.  </li>
            <li> Many thanks to the seller, NY Discounts!</li>
            <li> So excited</li>
            <li> I wore out my original one of these brushes and just had to get a replacement.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be happy you did - it feels like you&#x27;re stimulating your circulation which relieves the pain that sometimes come with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> ,  I really didn&#x27;t see any visible difference in dandruff but the whole Brush is good.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what she wanted and is used several times each day with great results.  </li>
            <li> and I think with the brush and the different types of shampoo out there you can do a good job of maintaining that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sturdy brush and has those great little rubber tips.  </li>
            <li> This is actually the second brush I own of this, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> The brush is designed to use copper to kill the underlying cause of dandruff, and the paddle-brish shape is great for coverage of the head in just a few strokes.</li>
            <li> calm scratch that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re hurting yourself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with it so far.</li>
            <li> and I rarely have itching anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice enough brush, but hasn&#x27;t helped my dandruff as advertised.</li>
            <li> I use it right after washing my hair and it detangles</li>
            <li> There is a trick of dripping elmers glue over the brush, then dust rings slide right off -</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and nice and firm.</li>
            <li> I am surprised I like the brush so much. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle on scalp, no scratching feeling at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> feels like a massage in the scalp and the sensation is very very relaxing, wont regret to have one of this</li>
            <li> Really helps minimize dandruff!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> My solution is two paddle brushes, the second one made for detangling. :)</li>
            <li> The copper brush lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t seem to deteriorate, and feels great on the scalp (and back).</li>
            <li> It has, however, worked wonders for my scalp (which I mostly attributed to stiff-bristle stimulation prior to searching for a replacement).  </li>
            <li> I think I lost the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It makes my hair incredibly soft and it&#x27;s fantastic for styling with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to over</li>
            <li> Was exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes it leaves this coppery smell on my hair when I brush it for the first time.</li>
            <li> and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> do love the way the bristles actually reach my head.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> the new one seems better than I remember the old one being.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me, so was excited to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this brush and couldnt wait to try it, Little did i know I would spend most of the day smelling like a penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brush gets all the way through the hair and down to the scalp and feels amazing when brushing your hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a large size, but lightweight.</li>
            <li> I think this bigger size makes a huge difference in how well it lasts.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the brush is huge.  </li>
            <li> did not do much for me and the copper wore off</li>
            <li> it really works buy one</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I just quit trying to find a cure,  but the itch and the flakes very humiliating.  </li>
            <li> It takes a gentle touch to get the hair out without just yanking on the pins.  </li>
            <li> absolutely nothing to eliminate dandruff or stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li> However, it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Gentle on hair.</li>
            <li> but he has been very itchy everywhere. )</li>
            <li> My dog wants one too.</li>
            <li> I use moisturizing conditioners and they don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Something I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> People seem to have complained that the brush makes your hair smell, the problem solve for that is use a good smelling shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Honestly I only bought this brush because I liked the wide paddle and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> This particular model is a large brush...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find the same brush for her on Amazon...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work better than any other brush.</li>
            <li> Also, keep the same idea in mind when you clean the brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I bought this brush a few years ago and it has been exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I get nice cold and refreshing feeling while brushing with a Goody Copper brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My wife has long blonde hair and is extremely pleased with the quality and ease of use of this product.  </li>
            <li> Nicely built and study bristles to penetrate my thick hair.</li>
            <li> it is a comfortable massage to help clear loose flake from the scalp.</li>
            <li> but I needed a new brush</li>
            <li> Bought this in a store years ago, and it was time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> The first element to give out on this brush (in my direct experience) is the netted polymer material that holds the stiff bristles in place... but bear in mind that ours held up through regular use for many years.  </li>
            <li> ;) If you are the type to clean/disinfect your brush regularly, this one can be a chore.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended a copper brush and I grabbed the first one I saw at a local pharmacy store.  </li>
            <li> (I have long straight hair) and works itself through my hair gently.  </li>
            <li> I love this brush so much!!The little balls on the end cant fall off and the spiky things don&#x27;t bend or break off!!</li>
            <li> The bristles don&#x27;t clear up all my dandruff, but I have seen some improvement.</li>
            <li> I bought this to loosen dandruff before showering and so far it has been working.</li>
            <li> I make sure to brush at least twice a day although I think the directions are three times.</li>
            <li> It untangles my naturally curly/knotty hair with ease and the bristles invigorate the scalp.</li>
            <li> but he really loves to get brushed with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;(He</li>
            <li> Overall, it makes my hair feel and look very silky after I brush it.</li>
            <li> Completely defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dandruff, but I have a really sensitive scalp and it gets dry and flaky in parts.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll be sure to keep this post updated in the next few weeks to the next month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The narrower one loses its bristles easily as I brush.  </li>
            <li> My friends say thanks  ten times already for such gift.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few tries and would not recommend this brush unless you enjoy hurting yourself!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only had it for a week</li>
            <li> this brush has changed my scalp completely and I can&#x27;t thank the creators of this enough.  </li>
            <li> I made this mistake and this is now why every time I brush my hair my entire head smells like old pennies.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little more firm than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> We owned this model prior for several years before it recently degenerated and we required a new one.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the most uncomfortable brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I just bought it for the second time after having my first one for years due to it starting to fall apart.</li>
            <li> Use it on dry hair to gently massage your scalp when it&#x27;s dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> I have mid-back length, SUPER THICK hair, and</li>
            <li> The paddle portion will come loose if dropped on a hard surface (personal experience), and without a full tang, can be tricky to repair.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that you can&#x27;t use it for detangling your hair right away, you have to wait for it to tarnish a bit.</li>
            <li> Tough to clean thoroughly.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has helped my dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the brush is a little bit of a hassle, since it needs to be cleaned with lemon juice, but other than that, I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> It has a large surface area which works well for people with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The paddle style makes it a little bit more difficult to style one&#x27;s hair, but if all you want to do is brush you hair and massage your scalp at the same time, this does the trick.  </li>
            <li> She specifically requested a copper-brissled brush like the one she had in Europe which has long since worn out.  </li>
            <li> and the copper appears to be wearing off or discolored from constant brushing of wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought another one which I use every morning after I blow dry my long hair.</li>
            <li> The other reviews of the copper wearing off and the slight odor are true, but it does not bother me in the least.</li>
            <li> Will want to try other items from this brand in future.</li>
            <li> but overall I would prefer to buy the brush every couple months than endure other treatments.</li>
            <li> I like to dry brush</li>
            <li> I am grateful for my friends recommendation and I recommend this to anyone suffering from itchy dry flaky scalp!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this one, my current one, for less than a year now</li>
            <li> The only down side is the Amazon product description doesn&#x27;t mention it is not recommended for use on wet hair</li>
            <li> This model does NOT include any strange anti-dandruff additives (that seem to be inferred on other models from Goody).&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the copper helps with dry scalp, but the brush bristles are stiff enough to feel theraputic.  </li>
            <li> Bulk hair can be raked out by hand, but little dust rings are left over around each bristle and must be picked out one by one.</li>
            <li> However, the bristles can be a little harsh for my sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> This may sound crazy, but for someone who deals with an itchy scalp, using this brush is like heaven.</li>
            <li> Initially it seemed to make my scalp flakier but after a few washes and continued use of the brush this seems to be under control.</li>
            <li> Instructions say not to use on wet or damp hair.</li>
            <li> my hair/scalp, shower, then use the brush to comb out my wet hair.</li>
            <li> Although the instructions do not suggest use on wet hair, I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Since I ordered it to use when blow drying wet hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> DO NOT use this on wet hair.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use this with wet hair or a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The reason why is that the copper bristles, while study for scalp massage, are not strong enough if you pull it through knots.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t flex like other paddle brushes.</li>
            <li> I can no longer use any other brush.</li>
            <li> Of course, they do not do that due to price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product would work when I bought this product for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I got other brushes but they ripped my hair out and didn&#x27;t help my flakes.</li>
            <li> not order this brush, its a waste of money and youll smell like a pouch of loose change.</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the paddle constantly pulls apart from the handle.</li>
            <li> I think that I had the old one for at least 3 years, but I am not sure.</li>
            <li> Then they are just average paddle brushes.</li>
            <li> and i believe helps hold the dandruth down.</li>
            <li> I believe the brush has helped my scalp to feel less ichy.</li>
            <li> I love these products because I am hardly ever disappointed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch with 100% that it helps with dandruff because I also use prescription shampoo, but it is not that expensive and it is a pretty sturdy brush that holds up to my thick hair.</li>
            <li> The rigid copper bristles almost scratch my scalp and in my humble opinion the &amp;#34;therapy copper&amp;#34; is just a marketing gimmick.  </li>
            <li> When I do I just use this brush for a few minutes and poof</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago my friend gave me this brush and told me what it was for.</li>
            <li> and now i hardly get any with just brushing for 5 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li> Not really sure whether it has resolved my dandruff issues</li>
            <li> Though not sure whether this helps with dandruff reduction, but sitll is a quality product.</li>
            <li> The itch usually started about an hour or so of styling my hair.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this in any local retail store.  </li>
            <li> This brush padding is very firm.</li>
            <li> Also, the bristles are very firm</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only dose this brush make your hair smell bad, its also really rough.</li>
            <li> May be its a little expensive compared to the other brushes</li>
            <li> It has a thick handle that MAY be tricky for small hands.&lt;br</li>
            <li> cooper makes some smell contacting with scalp oils, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and dandruff comes along with it.</li>
            <li> and we both have extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a serious dandruff problem and it snows without using it after a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to throw the brush out after only using it a couple of times because the smell is so bad.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the copper thing, but this brush has a weird plastic-y smell that somehow transfers to my hair and makes me head STINK.</li>
            <li> , I mean my head doesn&#x27;t itch anymore!</li>
            <li> It does not leave my hair smelling badly and only has a faint smell when I use simultaneously it with my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I think this made my dandruff worse</li>
            <li> I have tried every product on the market and some made it worse.</li>
            <li> and this satisfies that itch without irritating and scratching the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have thick and curly hair that is difficult to manage, let alone get to the scalp.</li>
            <li> The water where I live is beyond horrible.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I like this brush and the results.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find this again since I purchased it at some obscure store on the East Coast.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased very expensive shampoo/conditioners and nothing has helped except this copper brush.</li>
            <li> I have an incredibly bad scalp and nothing seems to help</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use to get dandruff bad until i discovered these brushes..</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the description of the brush which didn&#x27;t mention that the rubber surface holding all the bristles is made from latex.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> did not do much for me and the copper wore off</li>
            <li> Tingly, invigorating brushing.  Makes my hair smooth and shiny while waking up my scalp.  I don&#x27;t know if the copper helps with dry scalp, but the brush bristles are stiff enough to feel theraputic.  My girlfriend liked the brush, too, so I sent one as a gift!  Great product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this brush for about two weeks. Initially it seemed to make my scalp flakier but after a few washes and continued use of the brush this seems to be under control. Not really sure whether it has resolved my dandruff issues but the brush feels great against my scalp.</li>
            <li> I get nice cold and refreshing feeling while brushing with a Goody Copper brush.&lt;br /&gt;Also cooper makes some smell contacting with scalp oils, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I know cooper helps with some skins problems, but I can&#x27;t say for sure if it&#x27;s brush helped me or hair masks :)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle on scalp, no scratching feeling at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice brush to have.</li>
            <li> Nice feeeling on scalp when brushing my hair, it won&#x27;t hurt but feel like massageing your scalp and hair look fluffier.</li>
            <li> It untangles well and brushes without snags. Only had it a week can&#x27;t say yet it the cooper is soothing my seborrheic dermatitis. Or the henna but it has been flake free for 4 days.</li>
            <li> Really helps minimize dandruff!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its after using this brush or switching my regular shampoo,but I got rid of my dandruff and itching to some extent. I&#x27;ve been using this for over 2 weeks and its good,easy to hold.I use it in the morning and in the evening. May be its a little expensive compared to the other brushes but I&#x27;m okay with it so far.</li>
            <li> Like most of us who have dandruff (including me) we try everything to control it. The copper brush is just something else to go along with the handful of shampoos. The brush looks great! Everyone who&#x27;s seen it LOVES it but aren&#x27;t all that conviced that it works. I wasn&#x27;t so sure either but I needed a new brush so I thought why not. The brush feels great along my scalp and through my hair. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now it still feels great I believe the brush has helped my scalp to feel less ichy. It&#x27;s not supposed to cure dandruff but help keep it under control and I think with the brush and the different types of shampoo out there you can do a good job of maintaining that. I recommend giving it a try and I hope it works for you too.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for the seller and 4 for the brush. I asked my girlfriend what she thought and she wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> it really works buy one you will love it</li>
            <li> My wife has long blonde hair and is extremely pleased with the quality and ease of use of this product.  She specifically requested a copper-brissled brush like the one she had in Europe which has long since worn out.  This product was exactly what she wanted and is used several times each day with great results.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This brush padding is very firm. It doesn&#x27;t flex like other paddle brushes. I&#x27;m not quite sure if this is helping my scalp quite yet but I will leave a follow up review if I do note changes.</li>
            <li> Bought my third one. Believe or not it&#x27;s a great present too. My friends say thanks  ten times already for such gift. Love it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite paddle brushes. Very well made. This was my second time purchasing this item and will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush! I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores near me, so was excited to find it on Amazon. This is my third and I love it. It truly helps control my dandruff with my regular regimen. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is by far the most uncomfortable brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  The rigid copper bristles almost scratch my scalp and in my humble opinion the &amp;#34;therapy copper&amp;#34; is just a marketing gimmick.  I stopped using it after a few tries and would not recommend this brush unless you enjoy hurting yourself!</li>
            <li> I think this made my dandruff worse</li>
            <li> Though not sure whether this helps with dandruff reduction, but sitll is a quality product. Nicely built and study bristles to penetrate my thick hair. Will want to try other items from this brand in future.</li>
            <li> My son is &amp;#34;17&amp;#34; and he just loves this brush!!!!! He wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it.....we recommend this brush to everyone....</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because of the copper thing, but this brush has a weird plastic-y smell that somehow transfers to my hair and makes me head STINK. I&#x27;ve had to throw the brush out after only using it a couple of times because the smell is so bad. Would definitely not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has helped my dry scalp. I have purchased very expensive shampoo/conditioners and nothing has helped except this copper brush.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the styles of Goody copper brushes and prefer this one.  The narrower one loses its bristles easily as I brush.  I think this bigger size makes a huge difference in how well it lasts.  The copper wears off after a couple of months, but I don&#x27;t mind buying another because of how well it works.  I love how it makes my hair look.  I use it several times a day and I rarely have itching anymore.  When I do I just use this brush for a few minutes and poof it&#x27;s gone.  I think buying five or six of these brushes a year is more than worth it for the peace of not having an itchy head and how lovely my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I love this hair brush. This may sound crazy, but for someone who deals with an itchy scalp, using this brush is like heaven.</li>
            <li> feels like a massage in the scalp and the sensation is very very relaxing, wont regret to have one of this</li>
            <li> The styling brush is excellent. The copper bristles feel great on your scalp. The brush holds up well and the copper bristles do not bend. The brush lasts for years.</li>
            <li> I love this brush so much!!The little balls on the end cant fall off and the spiky things don&#x27;t bend or break off!!</li>
            <li> Great quality brush. I bought this to loosen dandruff before showering and so far it has been working.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for the last three years with dandruff. It came on mid-life from stress. I have tried every product on the market and some made it worse. I just quit trying to find a cure,  but the itch and the flakes very humiliating.  A few weeks ago my friend gave me this brush and told me what it was for. I tried it  and it immediately stopped the itch.  It also massaged my scalp without pain. I bought another one which I use every morning after I blow dry my long hair. It has substantially reduced the flakes and I don&#x27;t have the itch. The itch usually started about an hour or so of styling my hair. I am grateful for my friends recommendation and I recommend this to anyone suffering from itchy dry flaky scalp!</li>
            <li> Thank you for the great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I have ever owned.  I get the best scalp massage while brushing and because I have Asian hair it just brushes smoothly through my hair.  I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t find this again since I purchased it at some obscure store on the East Coast.  I was extremely happy and surprised to find it on line![[ASIN:B0019CU6T8 Goody Styling Therapy Copper Paddle Brush]]</li>
            <li> Bought this in a store years ago, and it was time to get a new one.  Couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere, so I turned to Amazon and there it was!  I love this brush.  I can&#x27;t say that this reduces dandruff, but it does provide relief for your scalp.  Use it on dry hair to gently massage your scalp when it&#x27;s dry and flaky.  You&#x27;ll be happy you did - it feels like you&#x27;re stimulating your circulation which relieves the pain that sometimes come with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The brush is designed to use copper to kill the underlying cause of dandruff, and the paddle-brish shape is great for coverage of the head in just a few strokes. Use this like it is a scalp massage! One warning, the package says not to be used for detangling. The reason why is that the copper bristles, while study for scalp massage, are not strong enough if you pull it through knots. Also, keep the same idea in mind when you clean the brush. It takes a gentle touch to get the hair out without just yanking on the pins.  My solution is two paddle brushes, the second one made for detangling. :)</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hair brush.  It has a large surface area which works well for people with thick hair.  It&#x27;s a sturdy brush and has those great little rubber tips.  They feel really fantastic on your scalp!</li>
            <li> if you are a masochist, look no further. it feels like pulling barbed wire through your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;did absolutely nothing to eliminate dandruff or stimulate hair growth.</li>
            <li> The copper brush lasts a long time, doesn&#x27;t seem to deteriorate, and feels great on the scalp (and back). I can no longer use any other brush.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent hairbrush.  We owned this model prior for several years before it recently degenerated and we required a new one.  I was 100% not cognizant of it&#x27;s scalp and/or dandruff claims at the time of original investment.  It has, however, worked wonders for my scalp (which I mostly attributed to stiff-bristle stimulation prior to searching for a replacement).  In that sense, we both represent &amp;#34;blind study&amp;#34; participants who are 100% satisfied.  Additional notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. This particular model is a large brush... ~ 8-9 inches or so.&lt;br /&gt;2. The paddle portion will come loose if dropped on a hard surface (personal experience), and without a full tang, can be tricky to repair.&lt;br /&gt;3. This model does NOT include any strange anti-dandruff additives (that seem to be inferred on other models from Goody).&lt;br /&gt;4. It has a thick handle that MAY be tricky for small hands.&lt;br /&gt;5. The first element to give out on this brush (in my direct experience) is the netted polymer material that holds the stiff bristles in place... but bear in mind that ours held up through regular use for many years.  The copper plating will also vanish sometime in that time-frame.(Wish I&#x27;d paid better attention).&lt;br /&gt;An excellent brush.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, I bought this brush a few years ago and it has been exactly what I needed. I have really thick hair and dandruff comes along with it. This brush scrapes your scalp which minimizes dandruff. I will probably forever buy this brush and I just bought it for the second time after having my first one for years due to it starting to fall apart.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for like 10 years and have only had to replace it once but I don&#x27;t remember why. I think I lost the first one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have psoriasis on my scalp and this satisfies that itch without irritating and scratching the skin.  It makes my hair incredibly soft and it&#x27;s fantastic for styling with a blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Instructions say not to use on wet or damp hair. That was a bummer, as that&#x27;s when I can brush my hair, 98% of the time.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product 3 times now because it does help with my dandruff problem.  However, I have had to buy it 3 times in about 2 years.  The bristle are coated with copper, therefore the coating wears off with use.  It also feels good on the scalp, like a mini massage.  I use it right after washing my hair and it detangles (I have long straight hair) and works itself through my hair gently.  Great product, just wish they made it with real copper bristles.  Of course, they do not do that due to price.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only had it for a week and I think it is working, I mean my head doesn&#x27;t itch anymore! My biggest complaint is that the paddle constantly pulls apart from the handle. I have mid-back length, SUPER THICK hair, and the brush works great except it keeps falling apart...</li>
            <li> My daughter and I suffer from dandruff and we both have extremely thick hair.  This brush gets all the way through the hair and down to the scalp and feels amazing when brushing your hair.  It can make your hair smell like pennies if it your hair is do for a washing.  All in all I have noticed a decrease in flakes.  I make sure to brush at least twice a day although I think the directions are three times.</li>
            <li> brought my mother and sister one and they love it . It feels good on your head and it makes you hair shine.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical this product would work when I bought this product for the first time.  However, it really does work.  Good bye smelly shampoos and home remedies, all I need is this copper brush.  The only downside to this product is that the pins are only coated in copper so it wares off after a couple months (daily use) but overall I would prefer to buy the brush every couple months than endure other treatments.</li>
            <li> Use this as a brush OR as a therapy paddle! Save money by buying them together. Go goody! Om Nom</li>
            <li> This is a very good, sturdy brush. The bristles don&#x27;t clear up all my dandruff, but I have seen some improvement. I do not use plastic bristle brushes, so this was a good purchase for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is the best. I have an incredibly bad scalp and nothing seems to help but this brush. I had one for years and it fell apart and I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere ! I got other brushes but they ripped my hair out and didn&#x27;t help my flakes. I recommend this brush to anyone with scalp issues or just want to maintain healthy hair</li>
            <li> I bought this for my,  now my sister want one..... Excelent product! my hair looks better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice enough brush, but hasn&#x27;t helped my dandruff as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this brush.  My scalp burns and itches all the time.  Great hair brush!</li>
            <li> Buy this brush! It works immediately! I like to dry brush my hair/scalp, shower, then use the brush to comb out my wet hair. Although the instructions do not suggest use on wet hair, I&#x27;ve had no problems. It untangles my naturally curly/knotty hair with ease and the bristles invigorate the scalp. It&#x27;s a shame Goody discontinued this excellent product yet I&#x27;m thrilled the brush is still available via Amazon. Many thanks to the seller, NY Discounts!</li>
            <li> Gentle on hair. Don&#x27;t use it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Had one before and had to have one again.  Love how it helps my scalp.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this brush and couldnt wait to try it, Little did i know I would spend most of the day smelling like a penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only dose this brush make your hair smell bad, its also really rough. Ive got a tender head so I was willing to over look that but I had a friend try it and she said the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not order this brush, its a waste of money and youll smell like a pouch of loose change.</li>
            <li> The other reviews of the copper wearing off and the slight odor are true, but it does not bother me in the least. It does not leave my hair smelling badly and only has a faint smell when I use simultaneously it with my blow dryer. It has been the perfect replacement of my old Avon metal bristle brush from 20 years ago. I don&#x27;t have dandruff but my husband does, and while I don&#x27;t know that the copper helped any it is a comfortable massage to help clear loose flake from the scalp.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush that really gets to your scalp - I have thick and curly hair that is difficult to manage, let alone get to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought for my dog, he did not like regular brush for dogs but he really loves to get brushed with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;(He does not have fleas but he has been very itchy everywhere. ) It makes him very calm.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush although one of the copper bristles fell out the second time I used it.  The only down side is the Amazon product description doesn&#x27;t mention it is not recommended for use on wet hair and you can&#x27;t use it with a blow dryer although these two facts are mentioned on the packaging that comes with the brush.  Since I ordered it to use when blow drying wet hair I had to order a different paddle brush, but will keep this one too because it feels so great on my scalp!</li>
            <li> Best brush made in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second brush I own of this, and I love it!  It actually helps get rid of dandruff which is great.  My one complaint is that you can&#x27;t use it for detangling your hair right away, you have to wait for it to tarnish a bit.</li>
            <li> I suffered from dandruff for a long long time, as far back as I can remember. I tried all kinds of shampoos to no avail until I ran into this life saving tool. this brush has changed my scalp completely and I can&#x27;t thank the creators of this enough.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I no longer will use dandruff shampoos. in a while, I will order many more of These brushes. People seem to have complained that the brush makes your hair smell, the problem solve for that is use a good smelling shampoo and conditioner. i&#x27;ll be sure to keep this post updated in the next few weeks to the next month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for bringing me this amazing tool.</li>
            <li> The most scalp stimulating brush heavier</li>
            <li> Be warned: very strong copper smell that stays in your hair even after you wash it. Also, the bristles are very firm</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush! Glad to have found it again my last one lasted me 5 years!</li>
            <li> Great one worth for the money,  I really didn&#x27;t see any visible difference in dandruff but the whole Brush is good.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter...she had this same brush for years and it sadly it had seen better days...I was so excited to find the same brush for her on Amazon...she was more tan excited !</li>
            <li> THis is a great hairbrush i love it. It massages the scalp well and i believe helps hold the dandruth down.</li>
            <li> Tried it and liked it.  My dog wants one too. Will have to order another soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works. I don&#x27;t really have a problem with dandruff, but I have a really sensitive scalp and it gets dry and flaky in parts. I use moisturizing conditioners and they don&#x27;t really work. The water where I live is beyond horrible. I thought this would help with the itchiness I get and some of the flakiness. It doesn&#x27;t work better than any other brush. Maybe if you have a fungal condition that is causing dandruff it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;It is a large size, but lightweight. DO NOT use this on wet hair. Water oxidizes copper. I made this mistake and this is now why every time I brush my hair my entire head smells like old pennies. Something I really don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> I had one of these brushes before and lost it so I decided to buy another. I can&#x27;t vouch with 100% that it helps with dandruff because I also use prescription shampoo, but it is not that expensive and it is a pretty sturdy brush that holds up to my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works well in tough/tangled hair. Tough to clean thoroughly. Bulk hair can be raked out by hand, but little dust rings are left over around each bristle and must be picked out one by one. There is a trick of dripping elmers glue over the brush, then dust rings slide right off - but then you have to wash glue out of your brush ;) If you are the type to clean/disinfect your brush regularly, this one can be a chore.</li>
            <li> This brush is a great styling tool. The copper bristles promote scalp health and feel great when you are brushing your hair! Cleaning the brush is a little bit of a hassle, since it needs to be cleaned with lemon juice, but other than that, I highly recommend this brush!</li>
            <li> Was exactly what we wanted. We have had the product before.</li>
            <li> This seems to be working well.  Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the brush is huge.  Next time I have to order I will probably look for a smaller version.</li>
            <li> I have a serious dandruff problem and it snows without using it after a week. Doing a re-purchase and getting multiples of it</li>
            <li> works amazingly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the smaller brush as well and this is better.  It covers more area and the bristles seem to hold up better&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use to get dandruff bad until i discovered these brushes.. and now i hardly get any with just brushing for 5 minutes every other day.</li>
            <li> This brush is a little more firm than I&#x27;m used to but I love it. It makes my hair so silky. I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple weeks so I haven&#x27;t noticed any benefits from the Copper. Honestly I only bought this brush because I liked the wide paddle and the price was right.  I am surprised I like the brush so much. :)</li>
            <li> Hard to find locally.  Great product</li>
            <li> This brush does a good job massaging the scalp and making your head feel good. I would not use it to detangle, as people have commented the bristles pull out easy (I have not noticed this problem). I cannot tell how good it helps with dandruff. I almost think just the pressure of the bristles loosens up the flakes, which in turn makes it seem like it is preventing or helping the problem. If you suffer from dandruff you&#x27;d definitely want to continue with any shampoo therapy. But my scalp did feel really good and is smoothed my hair and made it shiny.</li>
            <li> Overall, it makes my hair feel and look very silky after I brush it. However, the bristles can be a little harsh for my sensitive scalp. Also, sometimes it leaves this coppery smell on my hair when I brush it for the first time. Needless to say, I like this brush and the results.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find this in any local retail store.  So excited and it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this great product gives me a scalp massage and reduces static.  I love these products because I am hardly ever disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair brush I use!</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended a copper brush and I grabbed the first one I saw at a local pharmacy store.  When it came time to replace it, I could not find one.  I went to several pharmacy stores.  I was &amp;#34;amazed&amp;#34; to find one on Amazon.  Same brand but different style.  The paddle style makes it a little bit more difficult to style one&#x27;s hair, but if all you want to do is brush you hair and massage your scalp at the same time, this does the trick.  I&#x27;ve had this one, my current one, for less than a year now and the copper appears to be wearing off or discolored from constant brushing of wet hair.  It&#x27;s okay.  Now I know where I  can get a replacement!</li>
            <li> I wore out my original one of these brushes and just had to get a replacement. the new one seems better than I remember the old one being. It is an excellent brush. I think that I had the old one for at least 3 years, but I am not sure. It is easy to use and nice and firm.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the description of the brush which didn&#x27;t mention that the rubber surface holding all the bristles is made from latex.  In addition, the brush smells-- I assume that&#x27;s the copper; not only did the brush smell but it made my hair smell.  If you tend to have any sensitivities to odor or to latex, I would stay away from this brush.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use this with wet hair or a blow dryer. Completely defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for my frizzy, coarse and curly hair. I can use anything else so had to order online.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, I always make sure I have one, it really separates the hair providing more volume and messages the scalp.</li>
            <li> No scalp itch since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Does it reduce dandruff? Eh, I&#x27;m not so sure about this... I think just the fact your dragging something on your head is what helps that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the way the bristles actually reach my head.&lt;br /&gt;A calm scratch that doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re hurting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a great brush at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these. The copper on both wore off in about 2 weeks. Then they are just average paddle brushes. Will not buy in future.</li>
