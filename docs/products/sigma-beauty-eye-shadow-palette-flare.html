            <li>It&#x27;s a really nice quality brush set that you wouldn&#x27;t expect to come in a palette.</li>
            <li>The brush it comes with is a nice bonus too.</li>

            <li>I love this palette.</li>

            <li>Great colors, highly pigmented.</li>

            <li>The colors are amazing and pigmented it&#x27;s the thing that I don&#x27; find in the high end makeup products.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for the shipping upgrade :)</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the purchase for this set and the others.</li>
            <li>and right after you get the product.  </li>
            <li>Upon further inspection I smelled the palette and it had a very strong chemical smell one I cannot describe.  </li>
            <li>I loved this palette so much i just bought the other two.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was my mascara, so I decided to switn ch brands</li>
            <li>If it smells funny looks funny</li>
            <li>I love sigma&#x27;s products and this palet is no different than all thier products.</li>
            <li>The brush isn&#x27;t that great but not a big deal because I have other brushes.  </li>
            <li>I decided to compare my Urban Decay Palette and it does not have that strong chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant!  </li>
            <li>I really like the matte shades for older eyelids.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this mainly for the spring.</li>
            <li>The little dual-sided brush has to be my favorite aspect.</li>
            <li>The colors are extremely pigmented but easy to blend.</li>
            <li>reacts funny with anything send that sh**t back to the supplier.  </li>
            <li>On a side note another great makeup brand that is comparable if not better than MAC (in my humble opinion) is Make up Geek.</li>
            <li>Granted I do have other brushes to apply this with, but the Urban Decay double ended eye shadow brushes in their palette are made better.  </li>
            <li>Dare, Bare and Flare!</li>

            <li> I looked at the sleeve carefully that housed the palette and found that this is made in China (PRC).  </li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this palette.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> Makes me wonder where Sigma brushes are made from and charging customers outrageous money for the product.  </li>

            <li> *****UPDATE***** 6/29/2015  I have dropped the rating on this item from 3 stars to 1 star.  I have had this palette for a couple of weeks.  Every time I put this item on my eyes after a few of hours my eye lids would itch and even my eye lashes.  At first I thought it was my mascara, so I decided to switn ch brands etc my eyes still itched.  Upon further inspection I smelled the palette and it had a very strong chemical smell one I cannot describe.  I looked at the sleeve carefully that housed the palette and found that this is made in China (PRC).  Makes me wonder where Sigma brushes are made from and charging customers outrageous money for the product.  I have seen reviews where individuals thought they got fake sigma brushes from China, might as well have been at this rate.  I dont see where these brushes are made on the Sigma website.    I decided to compare my Urban Decay Palette and it does not have that strong chemical smell.  Needless to say I shipped this back right away to get my money back.  I will stick with Urban Decay, Bare Minerals, and any other cosmetics made in the USA. Will not be purchasing anything from sigma ever again  LESSON LEARNED: Do research well before and right after you get the product.  If it smells funny looks funny reacts funny with anything send that sh**t back to the supplier.  ***************************************************************************************************************************************************************** Ordered 6/12/2015  I did not purchase this product on Amazon but through the Sigma website.  The colors blend easily and are very nicely pigmented.  I gave this 3 stars because of the brush that was included in this palette.  The blending brush looks like a paint brush and when you wash it and try to reshape with your hand the hairs either fall out or fray out further. Granted I do have other brushes to apply this with, but the Urban Decay double ended eye shadow brushes in their palette are made better.  Even if this palette is on sale I do expect a lot of out of the products I pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for all of you makeup lovers.  The shadows are creamy, pigmented, and blendable.  I love this palette.</li>
            <li> Very nice palette of colors, intense but NOT overpowering. I really like the matte shades for older eyelids. I&#x27;m past the uber sparkle phase.</li>
            <li> Great palette! Great colors, highly pigmented. I use it everyday. I can&#x27;t say anything bad about this palette.&lt;br /&gt;Now I have all 3. Dare, Bare and Flare!</li>
            <li> muito satisfeita, amei</li>
            <li> what can I say? sigma have great palates and this one is beautifully done with great colors :) you must buy</li>
            <li> Excellent eye shadow palette for summer. Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> I love the Dare palette more because the colors are perfect for the summer. However, this palette is also very nice. I&#x27;m using this mainly for the spring. Thanks again for the shipping upgrade :)</li>
            <li> I love sigma&#x27;s products and this palet is no different than all thier products. The colors are amazing and pigmented it&#x27;s the thing that I don&#x27; find in the high end makeup products.</li>
