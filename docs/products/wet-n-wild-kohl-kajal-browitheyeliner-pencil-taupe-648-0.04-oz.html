            <li>: this one is great but makes my eyebrow hair stick to my face and it feels funny lol</li>
            <li>Everything else I own is either Mac or Dior, but seems like alot of brow pencils are either redish brown, or blackish brown.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice.</li>
            <li>I love it its just as describe nicely sharpen</li>
            <li>have very fair skin and very fair-colored eyebrows (Blond), so for a while I was finding myself look like the famous eyebrow-less Mona Lisa in a lot of pictures.</li>
            <li>Is so easy to blend and gives you a nice color on your eye brows</li>
            <li>This one is a much better price.</li>
            <li>AND it comes in a lighter shade than many others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I can find the wax based pencils at most drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed finding these online and the color is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This pencil in Taupe matches my hair perfectly without any red undertones.</li>
            <li>I like that one much better</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(tends to be more like this color on my bottom layers)</li>
            <li>and I am very cool toned in both hair and complexion, so</li>
            <li>This pencil is perfect to soften the look of my harder, darker brown eyeliner pencil.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;n&#x27; Wild for your great products and fabulous prices :)</li>
            <li>This eyebrow pencil is quite easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I easily get 15 hours of wear out of this provided I&#x27;m not swimming or something.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another plus: at this price, I can easily afford to have 4-5 of these on hand.</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and lightly which makes it easy to build color without looking severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I looked like a hooker or to light</li>
            <li>So cheap too, can&#x27;t beat it really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this is really this best Ive found, and at usually only a dollar a piece, you cannot beat it.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for years and loved it for blonde hair &amp; light complextion but buyer beware!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many brow pencils to try and get the correct color for my fair skin and blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I have the &#x27;original&#x27; (from the 1970&#x27;s)</li>
            <li>The original does not say that.  </li>
            <li>This is a true taupe color. . .</li>
            <li>It is a true taupe color.  </li>
            <li>My daughter with her blond eyebrows, finds that these give a very natural look and are very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but you need to have good pulse and make sure your putting in the right place because is a little bit like smooth.</li>
            <li>so my eyebrows are a dark blonde and this taupe color filled in perfectly.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend to anyone with light eyebrows.</li>
            <li>THIS one is very waxy in comparison to the original.  </li>
            <li>I suppose wax is fine, but when trying to get a natural fuller look when you have brows, Khol is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found and not too expensive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice dark brown fits good with my my black hair</li>
            <li>Just what I need it and it came pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>None of these work for me, as I am pretty light blonde.  </li>
            <li>My brows are full but they are naturally  white blonde and can&#x27;t be seen unless filled in(before I discovered brow pencils people would often ask me why I shave my eyebrows off!).  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it was much cheaper - like 5 pencils for about 6 bucks.  </li>
            <li>I love Wet</li>
            <li>At first, I found the darkness of my brows a little strange but the darkness really frames my face and just looks great overall.</li>
            <li>and it finally was the right color for me.  </li>
            <li>I buy a new one and toss the mini one in my bag or leave it at work</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I have tried many more expensive pencils when applied show some red tones.</li>
            <li>this was a color I have had trouble finding  in our area, small town, &amp; happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The only downside is it does go fast, as I like to sharpen for each eyebrow.</li>
            <li>I use a sealer on it, so it lasts all day - or at least most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Khol liners allow for natural soft blending to fill in and shape brows.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very oily skin and often have problems with my eyebrows fading or smudging throughout the day, this pencil does neither especially when set with a matching powder eyeshadow or a bit of hairspray applied with my fingertip.</li>
            <li>.. natural...</li>
            <li>&#x27;n&#x27; Wild&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>hair is naturally blond with lots of natural highlights.</li>
            <li>After many years they have changed the formula, too dark brown , too red, using the same number 648 and name Taupe.</li>
            <li>My brow game is forever strong thanks to this beauty.</li>
            <li>This is a really good quality brow pencil and lasts a long time when used just for brows, altho the color is a little darker than my previous taupe pencil.  </li>
            <li>It does cake a little sometimes, but I just use a spooly brush to smooth it out and tone it down.  </li>

            <li> this was a color I have had trouble finding  in our area, small town, &amp; happy to find it on Amazon. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is the only brow pencil I can use! Everything else I own is either Mac or Dior, but seems like alot of brow pencils are either redish brown, or blackish brown.  None of these work for me, as I am pretty light blonde.  I found one Estee Lauder pencil that had a similar color, but it was soo stiff and hard to apply, it actually was pulling off my eyebrows.

            <li> This eyebrow pencil is quite easy to use.  It does cake a little sometimes, but I just use a spooly brush to smooth it out and tone it down.  I use a sealer on it, so it lasts all day - or at least most of the day.  I alternate between this and \\&quot;Make Up For Ever\\&quot; eyebrow pencil.  This one is a much better price.</li>
            <li> This is really nice. Is so easy to blend and gives you a nice color on your eye brows but you need to have good pulse and make sure your putting in the right place because is a little bit like smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used many brands but find this one to be the best for me. AND it comes in a lighter shade than many others I&#x27;ve used so I don&#x27;t look like a painted lady when I wear it.</li>
            <li> great product, this is what I was looking for- it matches my brow color perfectly- and I can never seem to find it in stores</li>
            <li> I have the &#x27;original&#x27; (from the 1970&#x27;s) Khol Kajal.  There are two types of liners, one is a wax base and one is a khol base.  THIS one is very waxy in comparison to the original.  It is NOT what I wanted.  I can find the wax based pencils at most drug stores.  Khol liners allow for natural soft blending to fill in and shape brows.  If you have no brows I suppose wax is fine, but when trying to get a natural fuller look when you have brows, Khol is the way to go.  I noted that it says on the pencil it is manufactured in Mexico.  The original does not say that.  Perhaps this is the difference, hard to say.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed finding these online and the color is just what I wanted. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat a product that works and is inexpensive. My daughter with her blond eyebrows, finds that these give a very natural look and are very easy to apply. Great product.</li>
            <li> Yes the eye liner met my expectation I love it its just as describe nicely sharpen came on time as I was told</li>
            <li> This color is perfect to fill in sparse areas of light brown brows, and it lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dislike the harsh, unnatural look of liquid eyeliner. This pencil is perfect to soften the look of my harder, darker brown eyeliner pencil.  Since it&#x27;s a softer pencil, you may need some eyeliner reapplication during the day.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and loved it for blonde hair &amp; light complextion but buyer beware! After many years they have changed the formula, too dark brown , too red, using the same number 648 and name Taupe. If it says &amp;#34;coloricon&amp;#34; on the pencil don&#x27;t bother buying it.</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality brow pencil and lasts a long time when used just for brows, altho the color is a little darker than my previous taupe pencil.  Good bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of eyebrow products over the years but keep coming back to this one! My brows are full but they are naturally  white blonde and can&#x27;t be seen unless filled in(before I discovered brow pencils people would often ask me why I shave my eyebrows off!).  I have dark ash blonde hair and I am very cool toned in both hair and complexion, so my problems with eyebrow pencils are twofold: they are too dark, or they are too red. This pencil in Taupe matches my hair perfectly without any red undertones. I&#x27;ve got very oily skin and often have problems with my eyebrows fading or smudging throughout the day, this pencil does neither especially when set with a matching powder eyeshadow or a bit of hairspray applied with my fingertip. I easily get 15 hours of wear out of this provided I&#x27;m not swimming or something. It applies smoothly and lightly which makes it easy to build color without looking severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus: at this price, I can easily afford to have 4-5 of these on hand. One in my travel bag, one in each bathroom, one in my desk at work in case I get rained on. Once one of my pencils starts wearing down I buy a new one and toss the mini one in my bag or leave it at work so I am never without my favorite eyebrow pencil!</li>
            <li> This is a true taupe color. . . working well with silver/white/light grey/platinum hair.  I have tried many more expensive pencils when applied show some red tones.</li>
            <li> just not happy with it - but that is probably just me</li>
            <li> I use it for brunette brows.  It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve found and not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Very dark ,it does not work for me I have to buying lighter</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they stop making this pencil.  I&#x27;ve tried Channel, Christian Dior, etc etc and this is the best color for my light brown brows.  It coats the brow hairs well and stays put.  It looks very natural.  My only complaint is that last time I bought it it was much cheaper - like 5 pencils for about 6 bucks.  oh well</li>
            <li> I have spent over ten times the amount for this type of pencil that did not work, and last, like this one does.  This particular color is never available in the stores. It is a true taupe color.  I will definitely be ordering it again from this seller.</li>
            <li> my hair is salt and pepper.. and I found this shade to be the best for my hair color.. it&#x27;s not an over powering shade.. it keep the eyebrows looking great.. natural...</li>
            <li> Clumps up, breaks off, goes on very dark. A total waste of money. I threw it away immediately after testing it out.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many brow pencils to try and get the correct color for my fair skin and blonde hair.  WELL Ladies this is it!  It was either too dark and I looked like a hooker or to light and you had to keep penciling it in and it still wasn&#x27;t showing up!  ANYWHO...I love Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild&#x27;s products, so I thought I would try this one and it finally was the right color for me.  I color my hair blonde so my eyebrows are a dark blonde and this taupe color filled in perfectly. Looks very natural. Thank you Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild for your great products and fabulous prices :)</li>
            <li> Just what I need it and it came pretty fast.  It&#x27;s a nice dark brown fits good with my my black hair I use it for my eyebrows</li>
            <li> I used the nyx taupe pencil. I like that one much better but only has a little /: this one is great but makes my eyebrow hair stick to my face and it feels funny lol</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair skin and very fair-colored eyebrows (Blond), so for a while I was finding myself look like the famous eyebrow-less Mona Lisa in a lot of pictures. Whenever I found brown filler, it was still too dark (looked black).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product changed my life! My brow game is forever strong thanks to this beauty. So cheap too, can&#x27;t beat it really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is naturally blond with lots of natural highlights. (tends to be more like this color on my bottom layers) At first, I found the darkness of my brows a little strange but the darkness really frames my face and just looks great overall. Would absolutely recommend to anyone with light eyebrows.</li>
