            <li>I did have lil &amp;#34;spanx&amp;#34; shorts on and was able to cover the skinnies in order to make them stay.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old and it made me look and feel great.</li>
            <li>I wore my dress all day feeling confident and worry free.</li>

            <li>But it was worth it to have a smooth look under my dress!</li>
            <li>Thanks for this amazing  product , you must give them .</li>
            <li>I liked the result, but my inner thigh looked kind of puckered.  </li>

            <li>Thanks Skinnies!!!</li>

            <li>Thanks to this product I will enjoy my summer a lot more.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d use them every time I wear a dress, but for a special occasion they are worth it!</li>
            <li>So, I when they came in the mail I was eager to try them on for my special occasion.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for an amazing and much needed product!</li>
            <li>yes these are awesome, they weren&#x27;t too uncomfortable and they did exactly what they said they were going to do, my cellulite was gone and thighs looked amazing.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to wear shorts or skirts comfortably because Im super self conscious about my thighs.</li>
            <li>):) highly recommended</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitant to even buy them-- $20 for leg tape (not to mention, this was my very first problem-- price!)  </li>
            <li>I will say one positive about this product is that the shipping was extraordinary!  </li>
            <li>First,  they are only good if you plan on wearing longer shorts.</li>
            <li>The pro is they came off fairly easily without too much pain.</li>
            <li>Maybe if your legs are already slender, like on the picture on the front of the package, they would be comfortable, because the lifts aren&#x27;t putting much stress on your skin.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I bought them for special occasions when you dress up and want to feel a little more self confident...</li>
            <li>I did the same to my other leg and it was perfect.  </li>
            <li>If you or someone you know want a pair of these then you need to buy them right now</li>
            <li>So go ahead and buy these right now</li>
            <li>Right Off,</li>
            <li>I know they are many more of us gals who need a little \\&quot;lift\\&quot; for our confidence!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>First wore it around the house, then ran errands, then went to the park to play with the kids.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>One hot Texas summer day, I wore them all day and they lasted and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use several of the Skinnies products and I love them.</li>
            <li>The coolest thing is that no one knows ;).</li>
            <li>I had a big event coming up and wanted to wear a cute dress.  </li>
            <li>I love these and will definitely use again.  </li>
            <li>unfortunately not the solution to saggy thigh skin that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li>I Will Defiantly Be Back To Get More.</li>
            <li>Thanks Skinnie!</li>
            <li>When I first put them on I was like hell</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works as advertised, inexpensive, fast delivery, would definitely use again and again...</li>
            <li>I wore shorts this summer for the 1 st time in years thanks to this product.  </li>
            <li>These really worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>that well then it really is doing its job.</li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; so maybe it would work on a very tall person?</li>
            <li>very visible.  </li>
            <li>A real joke.</li>
            <li>This company is the real dealðŸ’ƒ</li>
            <li>This lifts work really well</li>
            <li>Its really humid where I live</li>
            <li>They last even during hot hot days.</li>
            <li>My dilemma is, I lost 77 lbs and at my age (48) my thigh/knee area makes me very self conscious in any clothing that shows that area.  </li>
            <li>I gave them two stars, because they do a good job of pulling up your leg flab; however, they were very uncomfortable and actually left bruises where they had been stuck to my leg (I do bruise pretty easily, but still...).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased a small quantity and the 20 dollars wasn&#x27;t a bust.</li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews but wanted to warn against buying these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got the body of a 20 year old again!</li>
            <li>I first applied one about 6&amp;#34; above my relaxed knee (while standing).</li>
            <li>So I used one on my inner thigh and placed it a bit higher.</li>
            <li>They are clear patch of tape approx 4x6.</li>
            <li>I am 29 years old and a mother of 3 children.</li>
            <li>I wore shorts for the first time in a long time</li>
            <li>I developed blood-shot hickey-like skin.</li>
            <li>When they arrived o read the directions and followed them to a T. I even went as far as cleaning my thigh area with hand sanitizer to ensure there was no soap or lotion residue.  </li>
            <li>I  just hop in the shower and apply some soap and water and it peels right off with minimal to no discomfort.</li>
            <li>I put on 5 inch shorts and the tapes had to be placed so high to not be seen that they were to my public bone.</li>
            <li>My legs actually have a natural tan again!</li>
            <li>Was not impressed nor satisfied AT ALL!</li>
            <li>Pressed on the lower half of the skinnie for about a minute and then lifted and adhered the top half.</li>
            <li>I have not worn shorts comfortably in public since I was 8 years old.</li>
            <li>If you have big arms DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li>I love how they make my legs look tight and firm again, can&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li>Super disappointed,  was very excited to try these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gained some weight last years and I&#x27;m very sad when I have to put myself in less comfortable elegant clothes or shorts.</li>

            <li> I usually never write reviews but wanted to warn against buying these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got the body of a 20 year old again!</li>
            <li> I first applied one about 6&amp;#34; above my relaxed knee (while standing).</li>
            <li> So I used one on my inner thigh and placed it a bit higher.</li>
            <li> They are clear patch of tape approx 4x6.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and a mother of 3 children.</li>
            <li> I wore shorts for the first time in a long time</li>
            <li> I developed blood-shot hickey-like skin.</li>
            <li> When they arrived o read the directions and followed them to a T. I even went as far as cleaning my thigh area with hand sanitizer to ensure there was no soap or lotion residue.  </li>
            <li> I  just hop in the shower and apply some soap and water and it peels right off with minimal to no discomfort.</li>
            <li> I put on 5 inch shorts and the tapes had to be placed so high to not be seen that they were to my public bone.</li>
            <li> My legs actually have a natural tan again!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed nor satisfied AT ALL!</li>
            <li> Pressed on the lower half of the skinnie for about a minute and then lifted and adhered the top half.</li>
            <li> I have not worn shorts comfortably in public since I was 8 years old.</li>
            <li> If you have big arms DO NOT waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love how they make my legs look tight and firm again, can&#x27;t be without them.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed,  was very excited to try these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gained some weight last years and I&#x27;m very sad when I have to put myself in less comfortable elegant clothes or shorts.</li>
            <li> These things are large in size and not easy to place.  </li>
            <li> and I mean right now.</li>
            <li> THE FIRST APPLICATION IT LOSES</li>
            <li> I wear them under very short shorts, and as long as they are applied correctly, they STAY.</li>
            <li> Also they left behind glue that was there for a few days despite trying many things to try and remove the glue.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years old, and even though I work in a gym and work out like crazy, there is still the light bit of cellulite.</li>
            <li> While theses theoretically work,  you need to be very careful how you apply them, and use several of them...</li>
            <li> they make them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t know what took so long for something like this to come along.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think due to all the mixed reviews.  </li>
            <li> just what I expected...</li>
            <li> I left the front ones on and they were super uncomfortable and could be seen a few times when I sat down.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and was a bit skeptical, but figured it was worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> I am thin, but at 49 years old, I have that little sagging above my knees.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how the other viewers got these to work for them</li>
            <li> The lifts held up in extreme heat (sweat) and never once budged.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this would work for those that have extreme cellulite.</li>
            <li> They left glue type marks that were hard to remove.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t sit down.</li>
            <li> and I wasted the rest of the package trying to get the corners to stick down to which they never did.  </li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t pull them so tight they make no difference.</li>
            <li> I had to play around a little bit to get it to work but after knowing where I should place the tapes on my legs</li>
            <li> I thank the creators for this little miracle and have just placed an order for another set.</li>
            <li> Tight firm looking thighs.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money people.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do a few test runs.</li>
            <li> TOO DIFFICULT TO PUT ON AND WAY TO UNCOMFORTABLE VERY STICKY AND BIG.</li>
            <li> I wasted $20 on these things.</li>
            <li> just wasted my money</li>
            <li> I am 62 yrs old, with just a little bit of a sag and these lifts erase that totally and give me confidence to no longer have to wear BURMUDA SHORTS!!, which I was sick of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In spite of advertising, they are not easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very little difference in skin appearance</li>
            <li> So I can say that they make an unbelievable difference, but I still don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I went to a wedding this past weekend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m small in size ,  but with age my skin has lost its elasticity.  </li>
            <li> I AM A SMALL WOMAN...</li>
            <li> and you have to reapply, it&#x27;s hard to adjust.</li>
            <li> They managed to last for the duration of the event however they were flapping like crazy when I pulled them off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone could not love these!  </li>
            <li> They do work as they say they will; however, not having used them outdoors, I am really afraid that one will come loose or will be seen below the edge of my shorts.  </li>
            <li> It became so bothersome that I finally went to the restroom and pulled them off, which was painful.</li>
            <li> Not to mention when I did peel them off there were raised red welts on my thighs that did eventually disappear but were ugly in the process.  </li>
            <li> not good at all.</li>
            <li> The adhesive left behind is very difficult to remove ðŸ˜–</li>
            <li> Well about an hour later I noticed the bottom started peeling off :(  </li>
            <li> No good!</li>
            <li> Taking them off is a little painful</li>
            <li> they look and feel horrible and there is only an extremely small difference in skin appearance!!</li>
            <li> I had a dress that I had been dying to wear but was always afraid to.</li>
            <li> so mad</li>
            <li> When you apply them, they wrinkle and are very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable as it pulls on your skin.</li>
            <li> Impossible to not have them wrinkle when you put them on and in those wrinkled</li>
            <li> Bad waist of money...</li>
            <li> TOO BAD</li>
            <li> I was shocked at the difference it made.</li>
            <li> But was so disappointed that they started to peel off.  </li>
            <li> stupid product....</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this product, went in the trash.</li>
            <li> This one works, but again, peeling the strips off was extremely painful!</li>
            <li> I read that taking the tape off is very painful.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> Worst product ever purchased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> This is an awful product.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not work do not buy not even for $5!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am thin, but at 49 years old, I have that little sagging above my knees. I purchased this product to try with an above the knee dress. Initially it worked &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, but mid-way through a dinner out each application started peeling away from my skin. It became so bothersome that I finally went to the restroom and pulled them off, which was painful. Also they left behind glue that was there for a few days despite trying many things to try and remove the glue. I would NOT purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I had purchased these instant lifts to wear with a rather short dress. At first, I was hesitant to even buy them-- $20 for leg tape (not to mention, this was my very first problem-- price!)  So, I when they came in the mail I was eager to try them on for my special occasion.  I followed all of the instructions to a &#x27;T&#x27; and the bottom corners of the tape on BOTH legs started to come undone shortly after applying them.  They managed to last for the duration of the event however they were flapping like crazy when I pulled them off.  I just assumed that maybe it was because something was rubbing on the tape that it would come undone so I didn&#x27;t disregard using it again...until I went to pull them off.  Youch!  Also, there was residue left on my legs that wouldn&#x27;t come off for anything.  Not to mention when I did peel them off there were raised red welts on my thighs that did eventually disappear but were ugly in the process.  Like a fool my motto was no pain, no gain, so I tried them out again and I wasted the rest of the package trying to get the corners to stick down to which they never did.  I will say one positive about this product is that the shipping was extraordinary!  It came within a couple of days.  However, all of my downfalls would never allow me to buy this product again, too much money for wasted tape.  I will say that maybe they should sell 1 packs to people to try it out so someone like me isn&#x27;t stuck wasting 20+ bucks on a product that wont work.  I never write reviews but this just had to be done for warning of others out there looking to get a thigh lift-- it wasn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for the fountain of youth and most likely had unrealistic exspectations.</li>
            <li> I love the instant arm lifts, looks great, arms look fabulous</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how the other viewers got these to work for them but for me didn&#x27;t stay on. I absolutely hate this product, went in the trash. don&#x27;t waste your money people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these all summer and they&#x27;re great! Its really humid where I live and I haven&#x27;t had any problem with them staying on. I bought them so I could wear shorts while playing golf. And they have worked beautifully. My legs actually have a natural tan again! I haven&#x27;t tried all of the products yet. But I definitely recommend the Thigh Lifts!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea in theory but in execution... not so much.  These things are large in size and not easy to place.  I wasn&#x27;t able to get them not to peek through the bottom of my shorts.They weren&#x27;t very comfortable either. I&#x27;m glad I purchased a small quantity and the 20 dollars wasn&#x27;t a bust. I may give them a try again since I have them.  I also purchased the swimmers version which I haven&#x27;t tried. They look the same as the regular set. I think the jury is still out for me on this product.</li>
            <li> I had hopes these would make me feel confident wearing shorts and swimsuits again.  I gave them two stars, because they do a good job of pulling up your leg flab; however, they were very uncomfortable and actually left bruises where they had been stuck to my leg (I do bruise pretty easily, but still...).  Maybe if your legs are already slender, like on the picture on the front of the package, they would be comfortable, because the lifts aren&#x27;t putting much stress on your skin.</li>
            <li> No good! Should have listen to the reviews of another buyer who said NOT to waist your money... But we girls will try anything if we have the slightest hope. Bad waist of money...</li>
            <li> Love these..I bought them for special occasions when you dress up and want to feel a little more self confident...just what I expected...Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> They do work as they say they will; however, not having used them outdoors, I am really afraid that one will come loose or will be seen below the edge of my shorts.  So I can say that they make an unbelievable difference, but I still don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I am 29 years old and a mother of 3 children. I have not worn shorts comfortably in public since I was 8 years old. I am THAT GIRL who you see walking around in jeans or leggings on a hote summer day. All I wished for was the look good in a pair of shorts. I came across this product because I was entertaining having a consultation with a plastic surgeon about my thighs. Thankfully I found SKINNIES! I purchased the 5 pack. I applied rubbing alcohol to my thighs to ensure there was no extra moisture that would cause the tape to not stick. While standing I applied and rubbed the tape for one minute. I was shocked at the difference it made. I wanted to do a few test runs. First wore it around the house, then ran errands, then went to the park to play with the kids. It has held strong through it all. I never once felt as if it would fall off. I did have to cut off some length though. But that was just my personal preference. I read that taking the tape off is very painful. I have not had a problem. I  just hop in the shower and apply some soap and water and it peels right off with minimal to no discomfort. Thanks to this product I will enjoy my summer a lot more. Thanks Skinnies!!! If you are look for a spokesperson I AM YOUR GIRL. ;)</li>
            <li> I love these things. They were MORE than I had hoped for! I am 62 yrs old, with just a little bit of a sag and these lifts erase that totally and give me confidence to no longer have to wear BURMUDA SHORTS!!, which I was sick of.&lt;br /&gt;They last all day...no irritation. They last even during hot hot days. One hot Texas summer day, I wore them all day and they lasted and lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Hope they make them for a long time to come. I know they are many more of us gals who need a little \\&quot;lift\\&quot; for our confidence!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks La Rosa&lt;br /&gt;Vicki Rogers</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE! Worst product ever purchased. If you have big arms DO NOT waste your money. This product is for Skinny arms..not fat arms. RIP OFF! Im so mad I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> I firsr saw these on Shark Tank and had to try them. I&#x27;ve never been able to wear shorts or skirts comfortably because Im super self conscious about my thighs. I thought these worked great. They&#x27;re perfect for summer dresses and skirts, and mine stay on all day until I take them off. Ive had great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gained some weight last years and I&#x27;m very sad when I have to put myself in less comfortable elegant clothes or shorts. My legs are too fat and my skin starts rubbing. It&#x27;s terrible! A friend suggested me this strips and I owe her a big favour! Now I can dress myself in shorts or skirt. Also in trousers I look better and thinner. It&#x27;s a great helper in the process of weight loss. I recommend it to everyone with similar troubles I had.</li>
            <li> I love the skinnies for my thighs! They work amazing, it sticks and stays hidden great :) lasts all day through work &amp; a gym workout ! And most important my cellulite, dimples &amp; sagging skin disappear ! I wore shorts this summer for the 1 st time in years thanks to this product.  A must have for the money :):) highly recommended</li>
            <li> It just works. These work really nice. If you or someone you know want a pair of these then you need to buy them right now and I mean right now. I had my doubts when ordering them but now that I know that they work I might get more. So go ahead and buy these right now</li>
            <li> I love the thigh lift.  I went to a wedding this past weekend and my legs looked fantastic.  I&#x27;m 60 years old and it made me look and feel great.</li>
            <li> THESE THINGS WORK! I wear them under very short shorts, and as long as they are applied correctly, they STAY. I am 48 years old, and even though I work in a gym and work out like crazy, there is still the light bit of cellulite. Not anymore however. I even sweat in them and they stay put&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a fantastic idea to a problem that almost 90% of women have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars without a doubt!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed nor satisfied AT ALL! I usually never write reviews but wanted to warn against buying these. They don&#x27;t stick as well as stated. Don&#x27;t lift as well as stated. You have to use 2-3 at once on one leg to get an even look so even if they did work you&#x27;d probably only get one use.</li>
            <li> This is an awful product.  In spite of advertising, they are not easy to use.  When you apply them, they wrinkle and are very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These really worked like a charm. The only thing is they left glue residue on my legs for 2 days. But it was worth it to have a smooth look under my dress!</li>
            <li> The adhesive left behind is very difficult to remove ðŸ˜–</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone could not love these!  I thought they were easy to use.  They lasted all day.  Got rid of the cellulite just like the said.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but watch when you take it off!  Ouch!!  I swam with this and everything. Don&#x27;t buy the waterproof ones, this is good in the water!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works as advertised, inexpensive, fast delivery, would definitely use again and again... couldn&#x60;t be happier! Don&#x60;t know what took so long for something like this to come along.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable as it pulls on your skin. Very little difference in skin appearance, so I just took it off and threw it in the trash. Save your money. Try duct tape 1st. If you like that, you might like &amp;#34;Skinnies.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product!  I was amazed at the results!  It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to wear shorts and shorter skirts again!&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the  skinnies to eliminate the muffin top, and it really worked!  Very smooth lines, too!</li>
            <li> I am in-between weights, in the process of losing weight and toning my body but this summer was a nightmare b/c of my legs looking well unattractive I was looking for something to help my legs look toned. A friend introduced me to this and it really works. I had to play around a little bit to get it to work but after knowing where I should place the tapes on my legs I wore shorts for the first time in a long time my legs looks great. I made sure to use rubbing alcohol to wipe around the area I am going to place the tape then it a standing position I place the tapes on my legs. Taking them off is a little painful but I just use soap and water or baby oil to get the tape off. I say if its stuck to my skin that well then it really is doing its job.</li>
            <li> This product works well if you know how to apply correctly. I have worn them with dresses and they last all night.</li>
            <li> This one works, but again, peeling the strips off was extremely painful!</li>
            <li> It feels like it&#x27;s pulling my skin and stretching it even more.  When I don&#x27;t pull them so tight they make no difference.</li>
            <li> I use several of the Skinnies products and I love them. The coolest thing is that no one knows ;). \\&quot;Yes, I have been working out ,)\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m small in size ,  but with age my skin has lost its elasticity.  This product is ideal for my circumstance.  I&#x27;ve got the body of a 20 year old again!</li>
            <li> I am experienced and savvy when it comes to these types of things but these fall short.  I&#x27;ve used all sorts of pull up tapes before but won&#x27;t be using these again.  First,  they are only good if you plan on wearing longer shorts. I put on 5 inch shorts and the tapes had to be placed so high to not be seen that they were to my public bone. I couldn&#x27;t even do the back thigh as the tape was literally on my rear and I couldn&#x27;t sit down. I am 5&#x27;4&amp;#34; so maybe it would work on a very tall person? I left the front ones on and they were super uncomfortable and could be seen a few times when I sat down. Impossible to not have them wrinkle when you put them on and in those wrinkled I developed blood-shot hickey-like skin. The pro is they came off fairly easily without too much pain. Super disappointed,  was very excited to try these.</li>
            <li> I heard about Skinnies from a friend when we were talking about dress shopping.  I had a big event coming up and wanted to wear a cute dress.  My dilemma is, I lost 77 lbs and at my age (48) my thigh/knee area makes me very self conscious in any clothing that shows that area.  I read other reviews and was a bit skeptical, but figured it was worth a shot.  When they arrived o read the directions and followed them to a T. I even went as far as cleaning my thigh area with hand sanitizer to ensure there was no soap or lotion residue.  I first applied one about 6&amp;#34; above my relaxed knee (while standing). Pressed on the lower half of the skinnie for about a minute and then lifted and adhered the top half. I liked the result, but my inner thigh looked kind of puckered.  So I used one on my inner thigh and placed it a bit higher. I did the same to my other leg and it was perfect.  The night of event I felt much more confident and had no issues with them falling off. I love these and will definitely use again.  Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d use them every time I wear a dress, but for a special occasion they are worth it! Oh and as a side note, I had an issue with shipping and had to call La Rosa Innovations customer service.  They were great and resolved my shipping issue immediately.</li>
            <li> excellent product.....very impressed</li>
            <li> TOO DIFFICULT TO PUT ON AND WAY TO UNCOMFORTABLE VERY STICKY AND BIG. I AM A SMALL WOMAN... ALSO IF YOU BLOW IT THE FIRST APPLICATION IT LOSES IT&#x27;S GLUE.... TOO BAD</li>
            <li> I, like most women have an issue with cellulite. I have tried everything to get rid of the unsightly lumps..JILLIAN MICHAELS/P90X/INSANITY. .NOTHING WORKED FOR ME.. I&#x27;ve always stayed away from shorts and/or short dresses out of embarrassment...UNTIL.. I discovered Skinnies. I placed order thinking this was just another gimmick, but I would try them out just to see. When they arrived I immediately tried them out. I had a dress that I had been dying to wear but was always afraid to. I followed the directions and literally counted and rubbed for 60seconds. To my amazement there were no lumps in sight. I wore my dress all day feeling confident and worry free. The lifts held up in extreme heat (sweat) and never once budged. I thank the creators for this little miracle and have just placed an order for another set.</li>
            <li> not good at all. I wasted $20 on these things. Don&#x27;t buy them. they look and feel horrible and there is only an extremely small difference in skin appearance!!</li>
            <li> didnt work.  very visible.  not recommended</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy these. They are clear patch of tape approx 4x6. A real joke. You can eat Mother Nature anyway.</li>
            <li> Yes they work and I love them. This is my fifth order. If you follow the directions you will be very happy with the results. I play tennis and this was the answer to my problem. I run and workout but can&#x27;t get my thighs like I like them. This was my answer to lipo for me. They do what I need them to do. Tight firm looking thighs. Thanks Jenny for your patients and excellent customer service as always!  This company is the real dealðŸ’ƒ</li>
            <li> I love these! I always keep these on hand for those short dress wearing days to hide my cellulite on my thigh area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well these work.  Finally, freedom to wear shorts and a skirt again.  My legs look terrific! The best thing about it is that nobody knows I am wearing them.  Thanks for an amazing and much needed product! Customer for life.</li>
            <li> While theses theoretically work,  you need to be very careful how you apply them, and use several of them...unfortunately not the solution to saggy thigh skin that I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> This lifts work really well and they make your legs look really smooth and nice. The instructions are very easy to follow , you place the adhesive where you need it and putting it in different locations give different looks for your legs, pick what you think is best and leave it. Your shorts or clothing you wear hide the adhesive strip but your legs look amazing. I think this product is very helpful for those who want their legs to look nice and smooth for a wedding or a date and it works instantly.</li>
            <li> They left glue type marks that were hard to remove.</li>
            <li> love this! you have to make sure you place it appropriately because if you don&#x27;t and you have to reapply, it&#x27;s hard to adjust. I don&#x27;t think this would work for those that have extreme cellulite.</li>
            <li> I Used The Instant Arm Lifts And They Worked Perfect, It Was Just As Advertised. When I Left The Party They Came Right Off, No Big Deal. I Will Defiantly Be Back To Get More. Thanks Skinnie!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to think due to all the mixed reviews.  So here&#x27;s my experience.  I had just gotten out of the shower and made sure not to put any lotions or oils on.  I followed the directions to a T.  When I first put them on I was like hell yes these are awesome, they weren&#x27;t too uncomfortable and they did exactly what they said they were going to do, my cellulite was gone and thighs looked amazing.  Well about an hour later I noticed the bottom started peeling off :(  I did have lil &amp;#34;spanx&amp;#34; shorts on and was able to cover the skinnies in order to make them stay.  But was so disappointed that they started to peel off.  I was sweating a bit so don&#x27;t know if that made them peel or not.  But all in all they do the intended job if you have lil shorts to keep them in place.</li>
            <li> stupid product....just wasted my money</li>
            <li> Did not wor at all!  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are the greatest invention! I love how they make my legs look tight and firm again, can&#x27;t be without them. Thanks for this amazing  product , you must give them .</li>
            <li> Great product! Received as a gift, will definitely purchase myself!</li>
