            <li>This is an excellent product and value.</li>
            <li>, this is the best ever and at around 20.00 a jar, I use it every day after applying my glycolic product at night and around my eyes and lips before my makeup in am.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>However, putting it on at bedtime is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best to just let it seep into your skin through the night.</li>
            <li>, this is the best ever and at around 20.00 a jar, I use it every day after applying my glycolic product at night and around my eyes and lips before my makeup in am.</li>

            <li>I have tried about all of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s skin products and this is by far the best one..thick, creamy and smells great.</li>
            <li>purchased it with Loreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Serum which I love.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very light and pleasant (not over-powering).</li>
            <li>: You don&#x27;t need a lot to make the magic of this happen!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>After the first night I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>I found the aroma pleasant and the fact that it is thicker, more like a butter texture than creamy, not to be a problem.  </li>
            <li>Very rich moisturizer!</li>
            <li>The difference in the tops of my hands is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If I finish the jar and see amazing results I&#x27;ll update my review</li>
            <li>Great light scent.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion.</li>
            <li>My skin had a nice hydrated feel to it</li>
            <li>I love this product - the subscription delivery is always surprising, welcomed</li>
            <li>It feels nice.</li>
            <li>I was not in the market for another cream, but I got a sample in a magazine, tried it, loved it, and went out and bought some more.  </li>
            <li>I suppose on the face, it&#x27;s nice to not have any scent but</li>
            <li>I bought this after trying the eye cream and loving that.</li>
            <li>At my age -70- I am thrilled for all the help I can get.</li>
            <li>Face feels really good after application and wake up with skin looking better than when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>The fragrence is so nice.  </li>
            <li>The product seems to be nice.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and the balm smooths over like butter.</li>
            <li>this is absolutely the best!!  </li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal products and use them all the time, so it has to be good.</li>
            <li>Nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>but they look nice and cared for.</li>
            <li>even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li>Smells great, absorbs nicely, is rich but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t go anywhere without being carded mainly because of family genes and the fact that I always protect my skin the best way I can and no tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a older lady, with temperamental skin....this cream is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very strong and cloying.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong and stays with you.  </li>
            <li>What may work fantastic for some, may not do as good a job on others.  </li>
            <li>what it does for my 64 year old skin is just awesome!  </li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and looks great!</li>
            <li>This actually is perfect for sensitive skin and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>and it provides the perfect hydration for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>the serum is pretty good, it is not as good as the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Good rich cream for normal/dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure, there must be more effective neck cream in market</li>
            <li>Make up goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love how the cream makes my skin feel and look.  </li>
            <li>And it makes my neck and jawline look so much better.  </li>
            <li>and I find that I don&#x27;t keep dipping in the jar for more.</li>
            <li>I put this on my crepey neck at night, trying to keep the sheets from touching it.</li>
            <li>: Noticed my face start to tighten more, My face was felt hydrated and</li>
            <li>Make sure you wash your face before applying this on.</li>
            <li>It helps to absorb in the skin better and helps the skin stay better hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>SO GLAD AMAZON.COM</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>One of my most favorite creams to put on day and night.</li>
            <li>I am a bit more liberal with it on my neck and chest since I more often than not neglect those parts.</li>
            <li>so I notice it more than most.</li>
            <li>its ok as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I Love This Stuff, I mix it with my BB Cream.</li>
            <li>Leaves her face soft and smooth and no, she still looks like my mom, lol, but she loves it!</li>
            <li>This is the next best thing to Lancome (since they are sister companies).</li>

            <li>I love this product and will continue to use it c</li>

            <li>will be posting a follow up review 4-weeks after use for more details.</li>
            <li>This neck/face cream rivals those that cost three times more.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I did like the eye cream and may still use it at night, but the cleanser and balm, while making my wrinkles better, caused marks on my skin that look like they will leave scars.  </li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>will need more time to see results.  </li>
            <li>So, glad I can purchase it online.</li>
            <li>Now I would like to know if Youth Code did not work because I used this product on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I truthfully cannot say I was impressed by either product, especially considering their cost.</li>
            <li>Please let the appropriate people know my comments.</li>
            <li>My redness in my cheeks was better and my chest appeared softer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>

            <li>and your skin turns crispy FAST!!!!  </li>
            <li>I has hoped this would have been a very rich peptide cream</li>
            <li>The price is good, it&#x27;s highly cost effective.</li>
            <li>I got this because I know someone who truely believes in this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>First moisturizing product I have truly loved.</li>
            <li>Lasts about 10 hours, perfect for the work day or long nights out.</li>
            <li>Perfect creme for my dry</li>
            <li>and wow, the results are great.  </li>

            <li>great price,like it,I am sixty years old.</li>

            <li>The new product in the line , the Serum is also wonderful, I use it on my chest and neck and my skin is as soft as silk , the sun damange , spots and fine lines is gone!</li>
            <li>I had tried other brands but for me and my skin this was the best combination.</li>
            <li>I love the rich creamy texture, the scent and the feel of this cream</li>
            <li>My husband and I have come to love the golden balm!  </li>
            <li>this is the best ever, the Golden Balm actually does redensify your skin, as it ages</li>
            <li>this is the best ever, the Golden Balm actually does redensify your skin, as it ages</li>
            <li>Way too strong of a perfume smell.</li>
            <li>also has a strong scent</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I originally started using it because I got a free sample from More Magazine years ago.</li>
            <li>I can not figure out exactly what this creme smelled like, kind of like carrots?</li>
            <li>- perhaps it would work better if I were more consistent.</li>
            <li>but this is fine for now.</li>
            <li>so perhaps I would see more improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture with more consistent use</li>
            <li>Super deal!  </li>
            <li>The stores selll out of this product quickly, so online, I order more than one.</li>
            <li>but it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>my guess is correct or not, I am totally in love with Golden Balm.</li>
            <li>But, Glycerin is the 2nd ingredient which is great for attracting moisture to the skin.  </li>
            <li>in fact the cream just absorbs and leaves your skin so smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li>It is light and creamy.</li>
            <li>And just FYI, I use Revitalift products for night cream and my eyes, and find these products fabulous.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, I should of done a before and after</li>
            <li>keep seeing the commercials and it looks so light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This feels great on my skin, and it definitely moisturizes.</li>
            <li>I am fortuante, my coplexion is smooth but this just helps keep it that way.  </li>
            <li>At 60, I was looking for something to use on a few stubborn wrinkles and decided to try Loreal Age Perfect.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth but has a texture to it.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH AND SMELLS</li>
            <li>I use one product from each, for specific needs, and each one does a great job.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and</li>
            <li>I have worn it a couple times overnight, and it still feels greasy in the a.m. I have to question whether any of it is getting absorbed into the skin or if it just sits on top of the skin forever until you wash it off with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I am delighted to have discovered this facial product many years ago</li>
            <li>I love this product; it does as it promises and the difference can be seen right of way.</li>
            <li>and I think maybe a more oil-based cream would be better for where I live.  </li>
            <li>Two thousand sweet oblivious old ladies stewing in their own eye-wateringly strong cheap, rancid perfume.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a sample of it and have been using that.  </li>
            <li>It is a unique cream.  </li>
            <li>The wetness helps the rich balm spread out on the skin surface</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the first time that this was the culprit,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about this skin cream.  </li>
            <li>Really, really rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This product is indeed rich and comforting as the description says.</li>
            <li>The texture is rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Now I make my own stuff out of REAL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is rich and luxurious, yet absorbs into the skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li>I find it to be great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>i am going back to old age perfect</li>
            <li>It turns out these products clogged my pores and the cleanser was too greasy to actually clean my skin thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old, so am looking to make my skin healthy looking, I&#x27;m not expecting magic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m under 30 years old, but I love it!  </li>
            <li>Ok so I wasn&#x27;t going to post the review until I was 100% certain it will work</li>
            <li>: First thing I noticed about it that it goes on smooth, really smooth.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled to find something I really like that is not horribly expensive.</li>
            <li>I love scented products so long as the scent is nice.</li>
            <li>I am preparing to purchase a full jar from Amazon now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can tell it will be a good moisturizer, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Week 6: My face has a nice natural glow to it</li>
            <li>The best I really hope for is to not become leathery, and to retain as much softness as possible.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hydrated and looks healthy now.</li>
            <li>It works, and it really has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li>Leaves a gritty texture on your skin, but smells good.</li>
            <li>I adore Loreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Serum, and I was hoping this product would be like that, only a little more substantial.</li>
            <li>However, if you use it on damp skin, or dampen your fingers first, it will go on easily.  </li>
            <li>I do feel that it is better for older women.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say the quality of the creme and texture of itself felt really good, so might be worth a try , especially as it worked so well for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As indicated on it&#x27;s label, I used my daily moisturizer, which is Age Perfect over Youth Code (received both orders on the same day and used for 4 weeks as directed).</li>
            <li>she loves it as most woman do and she will be getting more, Says it makes her years younger and her skin smoother also,</li>
            <li>This product is good if you are looking for a nice thick moisturizer for your neck, etc.  </li>
            <li>Although this balm is a good moisturizer with a very nice smell and texture it hasn&#x27;t really done much for me as far as actually improving the quality of the skin on my chest and neck which was the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li>This Golden Balm is specially for 40+ skins.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to all women who are looking for a good skin product to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li>This is a super moisturizing product, it is quickly absorbed and does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizes well and within a week, lines are diminished but the smell is so strong</li>
            <li>good for very dry skin for women ages 40 +</li>
            <li>Having only used it nightly for 2 weeks it&#x27;s done amazing things to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Works great at night, as it is a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li>If you apply it on above your eye then it makes it a lot easier to put on eye shadow and get a nice smoky eye look.</li>
            <li>If you apply it on above your eye then it makes it a lot easier to put on eye shadow and get a nice smoky eye look.</li>
            <li>or so it is all absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li>I may not be able to tolerate it around my face and have to just use in far away from my nose.</li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and look (I would love to say 30 but ) 50.  </li>
            <li>When I am going to wear foundation makeup I also use golden balm as a face primer.</li>
            <li>It contains 10 precious oils, combined with skin strengthening calcium to attract and maintain moisture in mature skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a maroon colored glass container with a golden colored lid.</li>
            <li>Love this product, use this every day makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice... a bit thick but goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have used their makeup for years and liked it, but had not used this specific line before.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after I got the regular kind.  </li>
            <li>; my skin feels velvety once it&#x27;s completely absorbed.</li>
            <li>My skin feels lovely and smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin and this product was the best yet for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if there is any long term effect or if my skin just feels softer because it has a cream on it, but I really like this and will buy more once my jar runs out.</li>
            <li>although it appears to be rich I find it very greasy.</li>
            <li>The price is right on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for women of a certain age with dry skin.  </li>
            <li>strongly scented and irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even more so, now that I have 40-something year old skin, I really must moisturize.</li>
            <li>Actually I liked the cream and it felt good on my skin, but it was such a tiny amount that it lasted only two weeks.</li>
            <li>Funny, I don&#x27;t remember ordering this, but I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>Or if the day gets hot, it is like my skin is sweating this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>spring I put on sunscreen and, for the first time in my life, had a sever reaction to it.</li>
            <li>upon first use I immediately started to feel it tighten my face after 15 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1</li>
            <li>but If you wear makeup regularly then I recommend you use this as a night cream instead before bed because it helps better.</li>
            <li>Apply this on first before putting your makeup on.</li>
            <li>Try it once a day first</li>
            <li>but If you wear makeup regularly then I recommend you use this as a night cream instead before bed because it helps better.</li>
            <li>Apply this on first before putting your makeup on.</li>
            <li>Try it once a day first</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have used this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I was needing, and is truly a soothing balm for my neck.  </li>
            <li>It has no weird fragrance.  </li>
            <li>At this point, I know better than to believe that any cream is going to turn back or stop the clock...  </li>
            <li>You really should try it!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin when I first apply it, and it absorbs it in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This product is thick and provides great moisture, but does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>In case you are interested,  a jar lasts almost three months.</li>
            <li>Personally speaking, I love and recommend it.</li>
            <li>bought first jar in texas in the summer.loved it</li>
            <li>I only got this because it was a better deal on amazon</li>
            <li>Love this facial cream, can no longer find it, in my cosmetic Store, wonder why?</li>
            <li>Pretty jar</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE THIS CREAM!</li>
            <li>I first used this about a year ago and after just 1 night I noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very greasy, but if used at night, it&#x27;s completely absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  </li>
            <li>Before I had been purchasing it from local stores, but found it better priced by purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thick and smells great.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Not greasy like many creams I&#x27;ve recently tried.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good that I have to use it everyday night.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>but I will probably continue buying the balm regardless because it&#x27;s a decent enough moisturizer and a reasonable price for this kind of product.</li>
            <li>As this stuff is made for more mature skin, I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t spread easier.</li>
            <li>It has a balm like texture and gets absorbed super fast into the skin, leaving it hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than in my country, and my mother also like it very much.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell that it has done anything positive for my skin.  </li>
            <li>, my face feels smooth, non greasy or glossy, I have had people at work ask me what my secret is and assumed I got professional cosmetic work done lol.</li>
            <li>However, this stuff does not spread easily, it&#x27;s pretty tacky and very greasy which i can deal with if you get results.</li>
            <li>and I added True Skin Natural Vitamins C and E syrum to use with it.</li>
            <li>This new L&#x27;Oreal golden balm is a winner for me.</li>
            <li>I did not start to loyally use face &amp; neck moisturizer until almost 60 years old.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I bought a few shades too dark of the BB Cream &amp; it mixes perfectly with the Butter Cream Color.</li>
            <li>Dry skin during winter, thought I would explore some better quality creams.</li>
            <li>That would be pure heaven.</li>
            <li>and it certainly helps hydrate my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>Just wish it came in a large quantity.  </li>
            <li>My skin is already different, it is very soft and it looks much better.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working well at reducing fine lines, especially around my neck area</li>
            <li>: The price is decent but I recommend you try one jar first before you do a impulse buy and wind up with a 6 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: The price is decent but I recommend you try one jar first before you do a impulse buy and wind up with a 6 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Age Perfecting Face and Neck Balm really seemed to make a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems to be very greasy when it is put on but within and hour</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li>very cute&amp;nice,</li>
            <li>Should have read ingredients, &#x27;parfume fragrance&#x27; is at the very end.  </li>
            <li>compete for fragrance and try to get fragrance free products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li>THANKS  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend that much money for something might not work.</li>
            <li>really like the way it make my face look</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>my mother very like it</li>
            <li>I really like the way the product feels on my skin and how it works.</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal products and have always used them.</li>
            <li>If you have oily or combination skin, it may be too much for you to use under makeup.</li>
            <li>works so fast</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t really seen no differents??</li>
            <li>Very hydrating.</li>
            <li>But I will continue to get it as it&#x27;s really made my skin feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I like the results and the scent of this product and received it fast.</li>
            <li>Much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li>This skin cream leaves your face very hydrated but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Fast Ship.</li>
            <li>This is not greasy and applied am and pm has worked for me very well.</li>
            <li>and I found it was too much moisture.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>THIS IS ESPECIALLY GREAT FOR SKIN DURING COLD WEATHER WINTER...</li>
            <li>Makes my face look, and feel very hydrated.</li>
            <li>This really is non greasy but provides moisture when you need it</li>
            <li>Really keeps skin hydrated</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful for L&#x27;Oreal Paris, Neutragena and Olay.</li>
            <li>works very well for me, I would recommend to anyone over 50.</li>
            <li>This one is very chemical.  </li>
            <li>One person wrote that the cream is greasy,  you need to really work the cream into your skin, hence the name balm.</li>
            <li>for me I wish they would make this product in a bigger size for the entire body in a nice buttercream scent.  </li>
            <li>This product is definitely for the more mature person--</li>
            <li>I am a 55 year old woman, and have the kind of skin that sags more than most.  :(  </li>
            <li>Read my other reviews for a greater product</li>
            <li>I have used many of their products and continue to do so due to the price and the quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just 42 but wanted serious face care and loved product after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I have also found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfecting Face and Neck Balm the best cuticle cream I have ever used on my very thick dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>The same is true with this product.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ve never used a balm and was surprised at how the balm \\&quot;drags\\&quot; on your freshly-washed face when applying.</li>
            <li>This cream is nice but is very heavy.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to worry about if I will have a coupon for this when I am ready to purchase a new bottle.</li>
            <li>My lines on my chest are less noticeable and my neck looks better too.  </li>
            <li>Slight, refreshing citrus scent is a bonus.</li>
            <li>I am sure all products work different on different people.  </li>
            <li>and my hands were looking older.  </li>
            <li>My face feels more tightened, hydrated, and overall younger.</li>
            <li>However I have not tried it on my chest mainly because my problem area is my face</li>
            <li>However I have not tried it on my chest mainly because my problem area is my face</li>
            <li>This seems to be a heavier facial cream and does not absorb so quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li>The balm is rich and creamy but smells really strange.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase and highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly suggest using it at any age.</li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money looking for a really good skin cream, but even the most expensive ones did not hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li>This works as well as expensive department store moisturizers, great stuff.</li>
            <li>Sometimes hours later it will still not be absorbed.</li>
            <li>think the Golden Balm is similar to Genefique, made for drugstore price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I tend not to be able to use heavy creams like this in the morning since my skin gets oily through the day.  </li>
            <li>Many of them dried my skin.</li>
            <li>Wish I could say the same about the \\&quot;golden balm.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The Golden Balm is the only one that I&#x27;ve used that showed results.  </li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer.... lends a subtle golden tone to skin which comes off as a little glow.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, I am just not fussy enough to pay for small jars, even for a modest cost.</li>
            <li>I live in the mountains of Colorado where there is NO HUMIDITY</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want these new issues to change my youthful look.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  </li>
            <li>and yes this golden balm works , it turns back the clock, I even had one of my adult daughters</li>
            <li>and yes this golden balm works , it turns back the clock, I even had one of my adult daughters</li>
            <li>Second, through the night and when I wake up, my face has this tight feeling that every woman knows when her facial cream is not doing a good job.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it if you have mature skin which is in dire need of hydration and care.</li>
            <li>I have a very young face</li>
            <li>Run far away from this cream!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feather on my face like other rich cremes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many face creams and have been unsatisfied and usually ended up tossing the product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as consistent as I should be about applying it twice daily</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; moisturizing, &amp; a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>I can see a difference in the texture of my skin and it seems to help with the little fine lines .  </li>
            <li>Very thick and creamy but goes on delightfully smooth and my skin absorbs it rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Not sure about the whole anti-aging part yet because I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times so far, but sure does make your face soft!</li>
            <li>I purchased this a little while back and have to say, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more of this when I get low, but that should be awhile, because it goes a very long way.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be trying the eye cream next.</li>
            <li>I started using this great moisturizer last January during the extremely cold winter we were experiencing in the Chicago area, which positively inflamed my face.</li>
            <li>I developed several large blemishes on my chin and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>(everyone wants to look younger and this product hits that nail on the head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the wrinkles completely</li>
            <li>It looks alive.  </li>
            <li>It is a health hazard for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to have mature, thinning skin to use this product.  </li>
            <li>Age doesn&#x27;t have to mature your skin, the sun will take care of that.  </li>
            <li>Think of this lush moisturizer as preventive medicine.    </li>
            <li>These are areas that women often forget about and the next thing you know, they&#x27;ve acquired the 20/50 or 30/60 look, where the face may look somewhat youthful, but one look at the neck and the whole story is revealed.    </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need to add a lot but every face is different so.</li>
            <li>and I can even see some natural color balance out in my face.&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised it didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li>and I am 49 years old now</li>
            <li>My dÃ©colletÃ© area is so soft.  </li>
            <li>My husband noticed how soft my dÃ©colletÃ© area was</li>
            <li>and so now I want to use this across my shoulders as well, especially over the summer months when one wants to be softer in that area.  </li>
            <li>once I the sweat stops pouring out of my face, and if I use it as a night cream, I wake up with soft skin.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look natural again.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and find that L&#x27;Oreal products do not irritate it.</li>
            <li>This product is meant for people with thinning, mature skin.</li>
            <li>(it goes along with having naturally curly hair.)</li>
            <li>In addition to that, my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>although a younger person might find this very hydrating.</li>
            <li>I am very dissapointed with this product, it left my forehead shiny and caused my skin to break out.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin and nose cannot stand it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves a bit of dewiness as it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, but I was looking toe that.  </li>
            <li>i have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so much had extra sent from usa to uk.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old jar of this product that was ordered from Amazon but putting on my face make me think of my grandmother when she once told me they just used lard as a face cream.  </li>
            <li>Use this cream faithfully and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>So far I like it.  </li>
            <li>4wks of application so far</li>
            <li>A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, LIFE HAPPENED AND BEING IN A HURRY AND BUSY  </li>
            <li>I can all ready see my neck wrinkles disappear, same with cleavage</li>
            <li>This balm makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and clear.  </li>
            <li>directly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;ve really noticed about it is the perfume -</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li>As good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>The way that I keep from using too much and end up feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;, is that I use it right after my shower while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my once oily skin is now dryer, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I have subscribed and saved this product to my Amazon list and it is crucial to my older skin regimen.  </li>
            <li>saw immense change in my mom&#x27;s skin particularly her neck area.</li>
            <li>and it seems my experience is not typical.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it and would purchase this same product again.</li>
            <li>Good moisturizer for dry skin and thin skin.</li>
            <li>I bought three jars of it to give it a long trial, so we will see just how well it works, and then I&#x27;ll really let you know.  </li>
            <li>As the skin on my poor old neck continues to do its aging thing, it has become more sensitive to topicals.  </li>
            <li>It seems too thick for my face (with very sensitive skin), but I am thrilled with it for my neck and chest, especially during dry weather.</li>
            <li>I live in the high desert and it is very dry here.  </li>
            <li>I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Golden Balm becaused it promised to reduce the symptoms of skin-thinning and make my skin more resiliant to the winter&#x27;s cold and dryness.</li>
            <li>Got a sample in a magazine and found it&#x27;s consistency very soothing and dry skin quenching.</li>
            <li>REally adds moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li>It is also very greasy, but for me overall it was the smell that I could not deal with when I went to sleep at night and on my face, it was simply to oily for</li>
            <li>Thick and heavy, but if you rub it in, it makes a good night cream.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my forehead which used to appear tired is soft looking and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>Thick consistency but easy to massage unto face.</li>
            <li>My wife uses this cream all the time, she feels that it is better than other more expensive brands!</li>
            <li>It goes on a little greasy but is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li>The balm itself is very thick, a nice golden color, and seems to sink into my skin slowly, leaving a rather mask-like feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I slowly documented each step by step to assure accurate</li>
            <li>It smells like Eau de Old Lady, times a thousand (no, double that).</li>
            <li>I only use it at night and my skin is soft and dewy like never before.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li>If you decide to use these products, watch for clogging or use something stronger to completely remove the product on a daily basis to prevent break outs.</li>
            <li>I am a 57 year old former &amp;#34;sun worshiper&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a connoisseur of facial cream since I was 16 years old</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Golden Balm for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Not perfect but just as good as the more expensive creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>The only negative thing about this product is that it rather think and doesn&#x27;t spread easily.  </li>
            <li>Despite the fact that it goes on creamy, I was expecting it to be really oily and leave the skin oily like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is worth the little extra effort.</li>
            <li>I have chosen to only use this at night because my makeup does not go on smoothly for at least an hour after I have applied it.  </li>
            <li>but my skin is definitely not as dry.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin so super soft and supple but I can&#x27;t handle the strong scent. :(</li>
            <li>, I have to say you get used to the smell, and as i put it on rather thick I have to say I maybe actually did see a deminishment of fine lines on my neck but especially in the chest area in the morning .</li>
            <li>Does not spread easily... too thick!</li>
            <li>Excellent product - have used this brand for several years and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li>I tried various other cremes meanwhile and the thick texture of this balm is better then</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this is right for you; perhaps it can be used every now and then.</li>
            <li>Super thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>any other, only think is that I tried it on my face again and I felt totally greased up, even as I used only very little&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have normal skin, and use a hydro oil serum from Dr. Denese before my moisturizer, and this has never happened with any other product.  </li>
            <li>but oddly it didn&#x27;t break my face out like most thick creams.  </li>
            <li>I really like this however its a little greasy</li>
            <li>Very slight and pleasant scent, but it moisturizes like I&#x27;ve never experienced!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> However, putting it on at bedtime is perfect.  </li>

            <li> Good value for the price.</li>

            <li> Lovely scent and very nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried about all of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s skin products and this is by far the best one..thick, creamy and smells great.</li>
            <li> purchased it with Loreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Serum which I love.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very light and pleasant (not over-powering).</li>
            <li> : You don&#x27;t need a lot to make the magic of this happen!</li>
            <li> : You don&#x27;t need a lot to make the magic of this happen!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> Love It!</li>
            <li> I love the product!</li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> After the first night I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> I found the aroma pleasant and the fact that it is thicker, more like a butter texture than creamy, not to be a problem.  </li>
            <li> Very rich moisturizer!</li>
            <li> The difference in the tops of my hands is amazing.  </li>
            <li> If I finish the jar and see amazing results I&#x27;ll update my review</li>
            <li> Great light scent.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion.</li>
            <li> My skin had a nice hydrated feel to it</li>
            <li> I love this product - the subscription delivery is always surprising, welcomed</li>
            <li> It feels nice.</li>
            <li> I was not in the market for another cream, but I got a sample in a magazine, tried it, loved it, and went out and bought some more.  </li>
            <li> I suppose on the face, it&#x27;s nice to not have any scent but</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying the eye cream and loving that.</li>
            <li> At my age -70- I am thrilled for all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> Face feels really good after application and wake up with skin looking better than when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> The fragrence is so nice.  </li>
            <li> The product seems to be nice.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, and the balm smooths over like butter.</li>
            <li> this is absolutely the best!!  </li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal products and use them all the time, so it has to be good.</li>
            <li> Nice to the touch.</li>
            <li> but they look nice and cared for.</li>
            <li> even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> Smells great, absorbs nicely, is rich but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t go anywhere without being carded mainly because of family genes and the fact that I always protect my skin the best way I can and no tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a older lady, with temperamental skin....this cream is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very strong and cloying.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong and stays with you.  </li>
            <li> What may work fantastic for some, may not do as good a job on others.  </li>

            <li> Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> the serum is pretty good, it is not as good as the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Good rich cream for normal/dry skin</li>

            <li> and I find that I don&#x27;t keep dipping in the jar for more.</li>
            <li> I put this on my crepey neck at night, trying to keep the sheets from touching it.</li>

            <li> This neck/face cream rivals those that cost three times more.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I did like the eye cream and may still use it at night, but the cleanser and balm, while making my wrinkles better, caused marks on my skin that look like they will leave scars.  </li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> will need more time to see results.  </li>
            <li> So, glad I can purchase it online.</li>
            <li> Now I would like to know if Youth Code did not work because I used this product on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I truthfully cannot say I was impressed by either product, especially considering their cost.</li>
            <li> Please let the appropriate people know my comments.</li>
            <li> My redness in my cheeks was better and my chest appeared softer.  </li>

            <li> Love this cream and will purchase again.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic Winter-time day/night moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this and will keep re-stocking until Spring.</li>
            <li> I think my neck looks better, firmer, and</li>
            <li> some of the lines on my face seem better, too.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it feels on my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, better than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and your skin turns crispy FAST!!!!  </li>
            <li> I has hoped this would have been a very rich peptide cream</li>
            <li> The price is good, it&#x27;s highly cost effective.</li>
            <li> I got this because I know someone who truely believes in this kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> First moisturizing product I have truly loved.</li>
            <li> Lasts about 10 hours, perfect for the work day or long nights out.</li>
            <li> Perfect creme for my dry</li>
            <li> and wow, the results are great.  </li>
            <li> I am 43 years old and have always taken great care of my skin.  </li>
            <li> great price,like it,I am sixty years old.</li>
            <li> the matching eye cream is as good as shiseido&#x27;s which costs 2.5 times as much.</li>
            <li> The new product in the line , the Serum is also wonderful, I use it on my chest and neck and my skin is as soft as silk , the sun damange , spots and fine lines is gone!</li>
            <li> The new product in the line , the Serum is also wonderful, I use it on my chest and neck and my skin is as soft as silk , the sun damange , spots and fine lines is gone!</li>
            <li> I had tried other brands but for me and my skin this was the best combination.</li>
            <li> I love the rich creamy texture, the scent and the feel of this cream</li>
            <li> My husband and I have come to love the golden balm!  </li>
            <li> this is the best ever, the Golden Balm actually does redensify your skin, as it ages</li>
            <li> this is the best ever, the Golden Balm actually does redensify your skin, as it ages</li>
            <li> Way too strong of a perfume smell.</li>
            <li> also has a strong scent</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I originally started using it because I got a free sample from More Magazine years ago.</li>
            <li> I can not figure out exactly what this creme smelled like, kind of like carrots?</li>
            <li> - perhaps it would work better if I were more consistent.</li>
            <li> but this is fine for now.</li>
            <li> so perhaps I would see more improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture with more consistent use</li>
            <li> Super deal!  </li>
            <li> The stores selll out of this product quickly, so online, I order more than one.</li>
            <li> but it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> my guess is correct or not, I am totally in love with Golden Balm.</li>
            <li> But, Glycerin is the 2nd ingredient which is great for attracting moisture to the skin.  </li>
            <li> in fact the cream just absorbs and leaves your skin so smooth and supple.  </li>
            <li> It is light and creamy.</li>
            <li> And just FYI, I use Revitalift products for night cream and my eyes, and find these products fabulous.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth, I should of done a before and after</li>
            <li> keep seeing the commercials and it looks so light and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin, and it definitely moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I am fortuante, my coplexion is smooth but this just helps keep it that way.  </li>
            <li> At 60, I was looking for something to use on a few stubborn wrinkles and decided to try Loreal Age Perfect.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth but has a texture to it.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH AND SMELLS</li>
            <li> I use one product from each, for specific needs, and each one does a great job.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and</li>
            <li> I have worn it a couple times overnight, and it still feels greasy in the a.m. I have to question whether any of it is getting absorbed into the skin or if it just sits on top of the skin forever until you wash it off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> I am delighted to have discovered this facial product many years ago</li>
            <li> I love this product; it does as it promises and the difference can be seen right of way.</li>
            <li> and I think maybe a more oil-based cream would be better for where I live.  </li>
            <li> Two thousand sweet oblivious old ladies stewing in their own eye-wateringly strong cheap, rancid perfume.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a sample of it and have been using that.  </li>
            <li> It is a unique cream.  </li>
            <li> The wetness helps the rich balm spread out on the skin surface</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the first time that this was the culprit,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this skin cream.  </li>
            <li> Really, really rich moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This product is indeed rich and comforting as the description says.</li>
            <li> The texture is rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Now I make my own stuff out of REAL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It is rich and luxurious, yet absorbs into the skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I find it to be great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> i am going back to old age perfect</li>
            <li> It turns out these products clogged my pores and the cleanser was too greasy to actually clean my skin thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old, so am looking to make my skin healthy looking, I&#x27;m not expecting magic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m under 30 years old, but I love it!  </li>
            <li> Ok so I wasn&#x27;t going to post the review until I was 100% certain it will work</li>
            <li> : First thing I noticed about it that it goes on smooth, really smooth.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled to find something I really like that is not horribly expensive.</li>
            <li> I love scented products so long as the scent is nice.</li>
            <li> I am preparing to purchase a full jar from Amazon now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can tell it will be a good moisturizer, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Week 6: My face has a nice natural glow to it</li>
            <li> The best I really hope for is to not become leathery, and to retain as much softness as possible.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hydrated and looks healthy now.</li>
            <li> It works, and it really has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Leaves a gritty texture on your skin, but smells good.</li>
            <li> I adore Loreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Serum, and I was hoping this product would be like that, only a little more substantial.</li>
            <li> However, if you use it on damp skin, or dampen your fingers first, it will go on easily.  </li>
            <li> I do feel that it is better for older women.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say the quality of the creme and texture of itself felt really good, so might be worth a try , especially as it worked so well for others.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As indicated on it&#x27;s label, I used my daily moisturizer, which is Age Perfect over Youth Code (received both orders on the same day and used for 4 weeks as directed).</li>
            <li> she loves it as most woman do and she will be getting more, Says it makes her years younger and her skin smoother also,</li>
            <li> This product is good if you are looking for a nice thick moisturizer for your neck, etc.  </li>
            <li> Although this balm is a good moisturizer with a very nice smell and texture it hasn&#x27;t really done much for me as far as actually improving the quality of the skin on my chest and neck which was the reason I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This Golden Balm is specially for 40+ skins.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to all women who are looking for a good skin product to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li> This is a super moisturizing product, it is quickly absorbed and does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It really moisturizes well and within a week, lines are diminished but the smell is so strong</li>
            <li> good for very dry skin for women ages 40 +</li>
            <li> Having only used it nightly for 2 weeks it&#x27;s done amazing things to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Works great at night, as it is a heavy cream.  </li>
            <li> If you apply it on above your eye then it makes it a lot easier to put on eye shadow and get a nice smoky eye look.</li>
            <li> If you apply it on above your eye then it makes it a lot easier to put on eye shadow and get a nice smoky eye look.</li>
            <li> or so it is all absorbed into your skin.  </li>
            <li> I may not be able to tolerate it around my face and have to just use in far away from my nose.</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and look (I would love to say 30 but ) 50.  </li>
            <li> When I am going to wear foundation makeup I also use golden balm as a face primer.</li>
            <li> It contains 10 precious oils, combined with skin strengthening calcium to attract and maintain moisture in mature skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes in a maroon colored glass container with a golden colored lid.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use this every day makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Nice... a bit thick but goes on nicely.  </li>
            <li> I have used their makeup for years and liked it, but had not used this specific line before.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after I got the regular kind.  </li>
            <li> ; my skin feels velvety once it&#x27;s completely absorbed.</li>
            <li> My skin feels lovely and smooth the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product was the best yet for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if there is any long term effect or if my skin just feels softer because it has a cream on it, but I really like this and will buy more once my jar runs out.</li>
            <li> although it appears to be rich I find it very greasy.</li>
            <li> The price is right on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for women of a certain age with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> strongly scented and irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even more so, now that I have 40-something year old skin, I really must moisturize.</li>
            <li> Actually I liked the cream and it felt good on my skin, but it was such a tiny amount that it lasted only two weeks.</li>
            <li> Funny, I don&#x27;t remember ordering this, but I like it very much.  </li>
            <li> Or if the day gets hot, it is like my skin is sweating this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> spring I put on sunscreen and, for the first time in my life, had a sever reaction to it.</li>
            <li> upon first use I immediately started to feel it tighten my face after 15 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1</li>
            <li> but If you wear makeup regularly then I recommend you use this as a night cream instead before bed because it helps better.</li>
            <li> Apply this on first before putting your makeup on.</li>
            <li> Try it once a day first</li>
            <li> but If you wear makeup regularly then I recommend you use this as a night cream instead before bed because it helps better.</li>
            <li> Apply this on first before putting your makeup on.</li>
            <li> Try it once a day first</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I was needing, and is truly a soothing balm for my neck.  </li>
            <li> It has no weird fragrance.  </li>
            <li> At this point, I know better than to believe that any cream is going to turn back or stop the clock...  </li>
            <li> You really should try it!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin when I first apply it, and it absorbs it in about 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This product is thick and provides great moisture, but does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> In case you are interested,  a jar lasts almost three months.</li>
            <li> Personally speaking, I love and recommend it.</li>
            <li> bought first jar in texas in the summer.loved it</li>
            <li> I only got this because it was a better deal on amazon</li>
            <li> Love this facial cream, can no longer find it, in my cosmetic Store, wonder why?</li>
            <li> Pretty jar</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS CREAM!</li>
            <li> I first used this about a year ago and after just 1 night I noticed a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy, but if used at night, it&#x27;s completely absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  </li>
            <li> Before I had been purchasing it from local stores, but found it better priced by purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thick and smells great.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Not greasy like many creams I&#x27;ve recently tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good that I have to use it everyday night.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> but I will probably continue buying the balm regardless because it&#x27;s a decent enough moisturizer and a reasonable price for this kind of product.</li>
            <li> As this stuff is made for more mature skin, I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t spread easier.</li>
            <li> It has a balm like texture and gets absorbed super fast into the skin, leaving it hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than in my country, and my mother also like it very much.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell that it has done anything positive for my skin.  </li>
            <li> , my face feels smooth, non greasy or glossy, I have had people at work ask me what my secret is and assumed I got professional cosmetic work done lol.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff does not spread easily, it&#x27;s pretty tacky and very greasy which i can deal with if you get results.</li>
            <li> and I added True Skin Natural Vitamins C and E syrum to use with it.</li>
            <li> This new L&#x27;Oreal golden balm is a winner for me.</li>
            <li> I did not start to loyally use face &amp; neck moisturizer until almost 60 years old.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I bought a few shades too dark of the BB Cream &amp; it mixes perfectly with the Butter Cream Color.</li>
            <li> Dry skin during winter, thought I would explore some better quality creams.</li>
            <li> That would be pure heaven.</li>
            <li> and it certainly helps hydrate my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> Just wish it came in a large quantity.  </li>
            <li> My skin is already different, it is very soft and it looks much better.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well at reducing fine lines, especially around my neck area</li>
            <li> : The price is decent but I recommend you try one jar first before you do a impulse buy and wind up with a 6 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Age Perfecting Face and Neck Balm really seemed to make a difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very greasy when it is put on but within and hour</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very sticky.</li>
            <li> very cute&amp;nice,</li>
            <li> Should have read ingredients, &#x27;parfume fragrance&#x27; is at the very end.  </li>
            <li> compete for fragrance and try to get fragrance free products whenever possible.  </li>
            <li> THANKS  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend that much money for something might not work.</li>
            <li> really like the way it make my face look</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> my mother very like it</li>
            <li> I really like the way the product feels on my skin and how it works.</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal products and have always used them.</li>
            <li> If you have oily or combination skin, it may be too much for you to use under makeup.</li>
            <li> works so fast</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t really seen no differents??</li>
            <li> Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> But I will continue to get it as it&#x27;s really made my skin feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I like the results and the scent of this product and received it fast.</li>
            <li> Much smoother and softer.  </li>
            <li> This skin cream leaves your face very hydrated but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Fast Ship.</li>
            <li> This is not greasy and applied am and pm has worked for me very well.</li>
            <li> and I found it was too much moisture.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> THIS IS ESPECIALLY GREAT FOR SKIN DURING COLD WEATHER WINTER...</li>
            <li> Makes my face look, and feel very hydrated.</li>
            <li> This really is non greasy but provides moisture when you need it</li>
            <li> Really keeps skin hydrated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful for L&#x27;Oreal Paris, Neutragena and Olay.</li>
            <li> works very well for me, I would recommend to anyone over 50.</li>
            <li> This one is very chemical.  </li>
            <li> One person wrote that the cream is greasy,  you need to really work the cream into your skin, hence the name balm.</li>
            <li> for me I wish they would make this product in a bigger size for the entire body in a nice buttercream scent.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely for the more mature person--</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old woman, and have the kind of skin that sags more than most.  :(  </li>
            <li> Read my other reviews for a greater product</li>
            <li> I have used many of their products and continue to do so due to the price and the quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just 42 but wanted serious face care and loved product after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have also found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfecting Face and Neck Balm the best cuticle cream I have ever used on my very thick dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> The same is true with this product.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve never used a balm and was surprised at how the balm \\&quot;drags\\&quot; on your freshly-washed face when applying.</li>
            <li> This cream is nice but is very heavy.  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about if I will have a coupon for this when I am ready to purchase a new bottle.</li>
            <li> My lines on my chest are less noticeable and my neck looks better too.  </li>
            <li> Slight, refreshing citrus scent is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I am sure all products work different on different people.  </li>
            <li> and my hands were looking older.  </li>
            <li> My face feels more tightened, hydrated, and overall younger.</li>
            <li> However I have not tried it on my chest mainly because my problem area is my face</li>
            <li> However I have not tried it on my chest mainly because my problem area is my face</li>
            <li> This seems to be a heavier facial cream and does not absorb so quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> The balm is rich and creamy but smells really strange.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase and highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend</li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly suggest using it at any age.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money looking for a really good skin cream, but even the most expensive ones did not hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> This works as well as expensive department store moisturizers, great stuff.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hours later it will still not be absorbed.</li>
            <li> think the Golden Balm is similar to Genefique, made for drugstore price.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I tend not to be able to use heavy creams like this in the morning since my skin gets oily through the day.  </li>
            <li> Many of them dried my skin.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say the same about the \\&quot;golden balm.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The Golden Balm is the only one that I&#x27;ve used that showed results.  </li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.... lends a subtle golden tone to skin which comes off as a little glow.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, I am just not fussy enough to pay for small jars, even for a modest cost.</li>
            <li> I live in the mountains of Colorado where there is NO HUMIDITY</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want these new issues to change my youthful look.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  </li>
            <li> and yes this golden balm works , it turns back the clock, I even had one of my adult daughters</li>
            <li> and yes this golden balm works , it turns back the clock, I even had one of my adult daughters</li>
            <li> Second, through the night and when I wake up, my face has this tight feeling that every woman knows when her facial cream is not doing a good job.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you have mature skin which is in dire need of hydration and care.</li>
            <li> I have a very young face</li>
            <li> Run far away from this cream!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feather on my face like other rich cremes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many face creams and have been unsatisfied and usually ended up tossing the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as consistent as I should be about applying it twice daily</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; moisturizing, &amp; a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I can see a difference in the texture of my skin and it seems to help with the little fine lines .  </li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy but goes on delightfully smooth and my skin absorbs it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whole anti-aging part yet because I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times so far, but sure does make your face soft!</li>
            <li> I purchased this a little while back and have to say, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more of this when I get low, but that should be awhile, because it goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be trying the eye cream next.</li>
            <li> I started using this great moisturizer last January during the extremely cold winter we were experiencing in the Chicago area, which positively inflamed my face.</li>
            <li> I developed several large blemishes on my chin and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> (everyone wants to look younger and this product hits that nail on the head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the wrinkles completely</li>
            <li> It looks alive.  </li>
            <li> It is a health hazard for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to have mature, thinning skin to use this product.  </li>
            <li> Age doesn&#x27;t have to mature your skin, the sun will take care of that.  </li>
            <li> Think of this lush moisturizer as preventive medicine.    </li>
            <li> These are areas that women often forget about and the next thing you know, they&#x27;ve acquired the 20/50 or 30/60 look, where the face may look somewhat youthful, but one look at the neck and the whole story is revealed.    </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need to add a lot but every face is different so.</li>
            <li> and I can even see some natural color balance out in my face.&lt;br /&gt;Week</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised it didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> and I am 49 years old now</li>
            <li> My dÃ©colletÃ© area is so soft.  </li>
            <li> My husband noticed how soft my dÃ©colletÃ© area was</li>
            <li> and so now I want to use this across my shoulders as well, especially over the summer months when one wants to be softer in that area.  </li>
            <li> once I the sweat stops pouring out of my face, and if I use it as a night cream, I wake up with soft skin.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin look natural again.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and find that L&#x27;Oreal products do not irritate it.</li>
            <li> This product is meant for people with thinning, mature skin.</li>
            <li> (it goes along with having naturally curly hair.)</li>
            <li> In addition to that, my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> although a younger person might find this very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed with this product, it left my forehead shiny and caused my skin to break out.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin and nose cannot stand it.  </li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of dewiness as it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, but I was looking toe that.  </li>
            <li> i have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so much had extra sent from usa to uk.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old jar of this product that was ordered from Amazon but putting on my face make me think of my grandmother when she once told me they just used lard as a face cream.  </li>
            <li> Use this cream faithfully and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> So far I like it.  </li>
            <li> 4wks of application so far</li>
            <li> A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, LIFE HAPPENED AND BEING IN A HURRY AND BUSY  </li>
            <li> I can all ready see my neck wrinkles disappear, same with cleavage</li>
            <li> This balm makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and clear.  </li>
            <li> directly.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve really noticed about it is the perfume -</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s thick</li>
            <li> As good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> The way that I keep from using too much and end up feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;, is that I use it right after my shower while my skin is still moist.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my once oily skin is now dryer, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have subscribed and saved this product to my Amazon list and it is crucial to my older skin regimen.  </li>
            <li> saw immense change in my mom&#x27;s skin particularly her neck area.</li>
            <li> and it seems my experience is not typical.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it and would purchase this same product again.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin and thin skin.</li>
            <li> I bought three jars of it to give it a long trial, so we will see just how well it works, and then I&#x27;ll really let you know.  </li>
            <li> As the skin on my poor old neck continues to do its aging thing, it has become more sensitive to topicals.  </li>
            <li> It seems too thick for my face (with very sensitive skin), but I am thrilled with it for my neck and chest, especially during dry weather.</li>
            <li> I live in the high desert and it is very dry here.  </li>
            <li> I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Golden Balm becaused it promised to reduce the symptoms of skin-thinning and make my skin more resiliant to the winter&#x27;s cold and dryness.</li>
            <li> Got a sample in a magazine and found it&#x27;s consistency very soothing and dry skin quenching.</li>
            <li> REally adds moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li> It is also very greasy, but for me overall it was the smell that I could not deal with when I went to sleep at night and on my face, it was simply to oily for</li>
            <li> Thick and heavy, but if you rub it in, it makes a good night cream.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my forehead which used to appear tired is soft looking and more radiant.  </li>
            <li> Thick consistency but easy to massage unto face.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cream all the time, she feels that it is better than other more expensive brands!</li>
            <li> It goes on a little greasy but is quickly absorbed.  </li>
            <li> The balm itself is very thick, a nice golden color, and seems to sink into my skin slowly, leaving a rather mask-like feeling to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I slowly documented each step by step to assure accurate</li>
            <li> It smells like Eau de Old Lady, times a thousand (no, double that).</li>
            <li> I only use it at night and my skin is soft and dewy like never before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li> If you decide to use these products, watch for clogging or use something stronger to completely remove the product on a daily basis to prevent break outs.</li>
            <li> I am a 57 year old former &amp;#34;sun worshiper&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a connoisseur of facial cream since I was 16 years old</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Golden Balm for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect but just as good as the more expensive creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing about this product is that it rather think and doesn&#x27;t spread easily.  </li>
            <li> Despite the fact that it goes on creamy, I was expecting it to be really oily and leave the skin oily like other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> It is worth the little extra effort.</li>
            <li> I have chosen to only use this at night because my makeup does not go on smoothly for at least an hour after I have applied it.  </li>
            <li> but my skin is definitely not as dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin so super soft and supple but I can&#x27;t handle the strong scent. :(</li>
            <li> , I have to say you get used to the smell, and as i put it on rather thick I have to say I maybe actually did see a deminishment of fine lines on my neck but especially in the chest area in the morning .</li>
            <li> Does not spread easily... too thick!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - have used this brand for several years and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> I tried various other cremes meanwhile and the thick texture of this balm is better then</li>
            <li> If you have oily skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this is right for you; perhaps it can be used every now and then.</li>
            <li> Super thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> any other, only think is that I tried it on my face again and I felt totally greased up, even as I used only very little&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have normal skin, and use a hydro oil serum from Dr. Denese before my moisturizer, and this has never happened with any other product.  </li>
            <li> but oddly it didn&#x27;t break my face out like most thick creams.  </li>
            <li> I really like this however its a little greasy</li>
            <li> Very slight and pleasant scent, but it moisturizes like I&#x27;ve never experienced!  </li>
            <li> may not sound like much, but this creme will last me a very long time.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> but, as long as the formula remains the same, I shall continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> To give a visual, I have caucasian dry skin</li>
            <li> This cream keeps my face moist, soft,  with less wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is it is a little heavy and does not absorb really well .  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long for me to use up the jar.</li>
            <li> I also have minor redness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have used some of the most expensive treatments and creams on the market and hands down</li>
            <li> , I have used some of the most expensive treatments and creams on the market and hands down</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried many things from most expensive to least expensive and perscription strength moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> The texture of this product reminds me of a rich, expensive, luxurious department store brand.   </li>
            <li> same  problem as the other one  </li>
            <li> (my forehead was dry as cement....</li>
            <li> I had a lot of bumpy dry skin at the bottom of my throat.</li>
            <li> I was having some dry skin issues</li>
            <li> the only things wish it had less of a fragance.</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my very dry skin while my skin is still moist after washing.  </li>
            <li> also a zillion tiny wrinkles around my mouth &amp; nose)Had to buy over the counter brands because my&lt;br /&gt;budget is tight.</li>
            <li> and you need to use so little of it that this 1.7 ounce jar will last for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M BACK WITH THESE LITTLE JEWELS...</li>
            <li> Very thick, but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after a month.  </li>
            <li> have used this for a couple of years as I have aged.  </li>
            <li> NOT REALLY GIVING IT ANY THOUGHT .</li>
            <li> It caked up and was not very spreadable eirher.  </li>
            <li> Thats it, money NOT well spent</li>
            <li> This is really is a heavy cream, so I am only using it for my neck area.</li>
            <li> My skin is 82 yrs old, fragile,  and thin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific - one of the few face cream moisturizers that does not contain retinol, or some other face peeling chemical, so all it does is moisturize, and that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I took the sample out of a magazine, usually I throw them in a drawer and toss them months later</li>
            <li> but I know some other people have used it up to 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> but I know some other people have used it up to 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I was getting very red, irritated, burny, stingy reactions on my neck when using my usual stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually firming my skin</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a little difficult to be absorbed by skin.</li>
            <li> , it was hard and I was even unable to smooth it on my face without water.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s loud and not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have been having trouble finding moisturizers, heavy enough for me.</li>
            <li> Since this is so inexpensive (I spent $12), I generously applied on my neck every night and after about a week, I&#x27;d noticed the line become less visible.</li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s hardly noticeable, but remember I religiously use this cream in the morning and before I go to bed.  </li>
            <li> Try this product , use if faithfully , daily at least and use it on your neck chest and face...</li>
            <li> This balm is not readily absorbed and leaves my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I used Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector which did not work at all.  </li>
            <li> Does L&#x27;Oreal make another dark spot corrector that I could try?  </li>
            <li> GOOD GRIEF!!</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing product during our cold and dry winter.</li>
            <li> In doing so, maybe I&#x27;m slowing down the wrinkling just a bit.</li>
            <li> (It is not a genie in a bottle) but it does help them look a lot less noticeable.</li>
            <li> it also has a slight tint that helps when you just want to wear a touch of makeup in this heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT big on lotions and creams, usually because they don&#x27;t work well, and usually have a perfume smell I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;BUT</li>
            <li> are less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> but It&#x27;s been less than a month</li>
            <li> My dark circles continued to look less noticeable and it even diminished a little bit of the puffy look people so often asked about.</li>
            <li> : I started to notice my dark circles get lighter and my neck felt a little</li>
            <li> other products failed my hands and they became unhealthily dry, this facial product saved them!</li>
            <li> A LITTLE LESS NOTICEABLE.</li>
            <li> : My neck felt a little firmer and my face started to look a little less droopy.</li>
            <li> did not work with me, will stick with my argan oil and the L;oreal collagen night creme .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, as I had a little letft and decided to use it</li>
            <li> This is a little to heavy for my face.</li>
            <li> It makes getting older~~Suck, just a little bit less!  </li>
            <li> It did noticably firm my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the heavy fragrance or the ingredients, but it gives me a raging case of contact dermatitis when I use it.  </li>
            <li> because it takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin, when it does, my skin feels moist and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Just add a few dabs around your face and neck and blend it in.</li>
            <li> Just add a few dabs around your face and neck and blend it in.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just too heavy feeling for that.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream since it was released a few years ago.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes my skin look drier with worse texture.</li>
            <li> i been using this product for few years, and they are helping.</li>
            <li> Cream is heavily scented.  </li>
            <li> I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> but instead it is a heavy duty moisturizer that sometimes absorbs and sometimes does not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything except feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase it again and will look for another product that does not leave dried product on parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply it a few times a day &amp; it seems to make my lines disappear for a bit.</li>
            <li> It feels sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> However, it is heavy, greasy and impossible to wear during the day without being aware of it glopping up my face.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is a cream/golden colored one and has very slight shimmery appearance.</li>
            <li> Woman of a particular age desperately need moisture for their necks and chest area.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and have a few small lines by my eyes that drive me nuts when I notice them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use high end skin care &amp; my skin showed it, I tried this since it was less expensive, but I started to see a change in my skin that I was not happy about.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this balm because I live in a cold winter region and wanted a heavier night cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it five stars if it was just a lilies less thick to make application easier.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is when it is applied on my neck, I will get bits of the cream that dries and forms little pieces on any creases.  </li>
            <li> However, it is thick and a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just too lazy to put it on after a shower in the morning and then wait the hour to put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to apply makeup during the day because I&#x27;m not sure you would want to apply a foundation over the balm.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep my usual skin care.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can tell a difference on my neck with respect to winkles and drapy skin, but I do like the cream.  </li>
            <li> I always find myself coming back to this neck whenever it looks like my neck is getting creepy lines.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very heavy and is greasy but soaks in.  </li>
            <li> Impossible to rub completely in!</li>
            <li> It is very thick and creamy, and I was afraid that it would go on too thick, but it spreads very well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I am allergic to fragrance and this hardly has any.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done anything negative.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to use an unscented product on my skin, or at least one that doesn&#x27;t have an offensive odor.  </li>
            <li> Some people complained of an offensive odor and others said it was too thick.  </li>
            <li> The color of it is like a golden buttercreme and when I smoothed it on, it felt like I was putting a thin, protective base on my face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and creamy without being at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> Like the glow, is a bit thick for my face, but it keeps me hydrated.</li>
            <li> I wear it at night but its&#x27; too thick and greasy to wear under makeup.  </li>
            <li> It is rather thick</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is thick so it does not take a lot.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is really thick.  </li>
            <li> Thick, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Thick orange texture.</li>
            <li> I mean beads of sweat not just moist.  </li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how unbelievable this product is!</li>
            <li> If there is any, it is subtle.   </li>
            <li> It is very thick, creamy and moisturizing to say the least.</li>
            <li> There definitely is a scent to it; while others have complaints about that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too bad.</li>
            <li> I mean you don&#x27;t want to be tugging at your skin making it worse.</li>
            <li> This product on my skin surpasses some really expensive creams that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> find that it is very hard to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, and after applying it it peels off.</li>
            <li> It was very thick</li>
            <li> This is  very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> this crÃ¨me is very thick and stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Very thick and does not absorb well.</li>
            <li> I hate when various creams, deodorants, perfumes, etc.</li>
            <li> Nothing I tried helped to relieve my poor face; in fact, I think some of the products I used made it worse.</li>
            <li> I apply it once a day usually, but if it is particularly cold, I will apply it before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> bad not original product.</li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> IT WENT TO THE WRONG</li>
            <li> NEEDLESS TO SAY</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of moisturizers ... expensive and OTC...</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this did not absorb on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li> It stinks - literally.  </li>
            <li> I have started to &amp;#34;stockpile&amp;#34; this stuff because I am so afraid that L&#x27;Oreal will decide to discontinue it at some point.  </li>
            <li> The cream leaves the greasy face and also yellowing dirty clothes in the neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also wondering if it has nano particles in it, which are supposed to be bad for you.  </li>
            <li> it seems to keep face moist and wrinkles don&#x27;t show so bad.</li>
            <li> The worst part of my problem seemed to be the thinning of my skin, which was always on the thin side, thus the loss of my skin&#x27;s resiliance to the onslaugt of the environment.</li>
            <li> About a couple month ago, I noticed an ugly line on my neck.</li>
            <li> No ingredient information was listed on product page and upon delivery, I was disappointed to read that Mineral oil and paraffin are listed.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> so stupid me...</li>
            <li> On Friday morning, I got up---looked in my bathroom mirror and was SHOCKED!!!  </li>
            <li> The smell of this product is horrific.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> strongly scented and irritated my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Item is as described.  Arrived on time.  Recommend this seller.l</li>
            <li> I guess it moisturizes ok but the smell is very strong!  I will probably only use it at night before going to bed and buy something else for daytime.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing g product. Use it daily on my d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.</li>
            <li> Great, creamy and decadent neck and chest creme. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells so good that I have to use it everyday night.&lt;br /&gt;Like the color. Feels so goldern.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it works well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I look any younger but my skin is definitely not as dry.  Some people complained of an offensive odor and others said it was too thick.  I found the aroma pleasant and the fact that it is thicker, more like a butter texture than creamy, not to be a problem.  I do feel that it is better for older women.  I have tried more expensive cream and can definitely say that I prefer this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for longer than 6 months. It did noticably firm my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I find that it is very hard to absorb into the skin. Sometimes hours later it will still not be absorbed. Or if the day gets hot, it is like my skin is sweating this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spring I put on sunscreen and, for the first time in my life, had a sever reaction to it. Last weekend I was out in the sun and did not use sunscreen and my neck and chest area (where I use this cream)reacted and became itchy. The only places affected are where I use this cream. I am wondering if this product can cause skin sensitivity. Any one else have this happen?</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Golden Balm for a few weeks.  I originally purchased a sample of it and have been using that.  I am preparing to purchase a full jar from Amazon now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried the serum in a sample as well.&lt;br /&gt;While the serum is pretty good, it is not as good as the cream.&lt;br /&gt;I love how the cream makes my skin feel and look.  It looks alive.  And it makes my neck and jawline look so much better.  Even the wrinkles.  Though I does not make that claim, I just notice it does lessens the appearance of them on me.  I am sure all products work different on different people.  What may work fantastic for some, may not do as good a job on others.  We are all different.&lt;br /&gt;Loreal is made by the company that makes Lancome.  I have noticed that some of their products overlap each other.&lt;br /&gt;I think the Golden Balm is similar to Genefique, made for drugstore price.&lt;br /&gt;This is just my guess because they are suppose to do the same things.&lt;br /&gt;Whether my guess is correct or not, I am totally in love with Golden Balm.</li>
            <li> Yuck. Using for my feet instead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this balm for over a month now and I can&#x27;t tell that it has done anything positive for my skin.  I live in the high desert and it is very dry here.  This product seems to be oil-free and I think maybe a more oil-based cream would be better for where I live.  It hasn&#x27;t done anything negative.  I just don&#x27;t feel moisturized with this.  It is a unique cream.  Unlike any moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m also wondering if it has nano particles in it, which are supposed to be bad for you.  Can&#x27;t find that information.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.... lends a subtle golden tone to skin which comes off as a little glow.</li>
            <li> Nice lotion. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a little to heavy for my face.</li>
            <li> This cream is nice but is very heavy.  I only use it on my neck since it just doesn&#x27;t soak into my skin the way it should.</li>
            <li> No ingredient information was listed on product page and upon delivery, I was disappointed to read that Mineral oil and paraffin are listed. But, Glycerin is the 2nd ingredient which is great for attracting moisture to the skin.  I bought this product to use in tandem with the &#x27;eye balm&#x27; but I read the ingredients and they are so similar that I now use just this product. The way that I keep from using too much and end up feeling &#x27;heavy&#x27;, is that I use it right after my shower while my skin is still moist. The wetness helps the rich balm spread out on the skin surface and I find that I don&#x27;t keep dipping in the jar for more. This product has definitely helped to &#x27;soften&#x27; the deep wrinkles in the lower neck-upper chest area caused by sunburns. And, I like the fragrance since I don&#x27;t use any colognes.</li>
            <li> I am so torn about this product. It works. Whoever said it was unscented was using a different product, though. It smells like Eau de Old Lady, times a thousand (no, double that). Two thousand sweet oblivious old ladies stewing in their own eye-wateringly strong cheap, rancid perfume. I put this on my crepey neck at night, trying to keep the sheets from touching it. I also slather it on my ancient withered hands before retiring, and cover them with cotton gloves, to keep the smell off the cat. Age Perfecting Face and Neck Balm really seemed to make a difference in the texture of my skin. But damn - the smell! I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love this product; it does as it promises and the difference can be seen right of way. We will use the product again as well as the seller.</li>
            <li> Run far away from this cream!  I don&#x27;t know if it is the heavy fragrance or the ingredients, but it gives me a raging case of contact dermatitis when I use it.  I wasn&#x27;t sure the first time that this was the culprit, so stupid me...I tried it again.  3 weeks of rash and peeling face.  It is a health hazard for those with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about this skin cream.  The color of it is like a golden buttercreme and when I smoothed it on, it felt like I was putting a thin, protective base on my face.  It didn&#x27;t feather on my face like other rich cremes I&#x27;ve tried.  I consider this a night creme because it takes a few minutes to absorb into my skin, when it does, my skin feels moist and hydrated.  It is quite concentrated, so 1.7 oz. may not sound like much, but this creme will last me a very long time.    Don&#x27;t let the words on the box scare you.  You don&#x27;t have to have mature, thinning skin to use this product.  My advice is to use it before your skin reaches those levels.  Age doesn&#x27;t have to mature your skin, the sun will take care of that.  Think of this lush moisturizer as preventive medicine.    The texture of this product reminds me of a rich, expensive, luxurious department store brand.   I felt like I was pampering my face and the cheat is that this product is so inexpensive!  Upon wakening in the morning, my face feels moisturized.  I apply it to my neck and chest as well.  These are areas that women often forget about and the next thing you know, they&#x27;ve acquired the 20/50 or 30/60 look, where the face may look somewhat youthful, but one look at the neck and the whole story is revealed.    I will purchase this again.  Next on my list is the eye cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, and after applying it it peels off.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for dry skin and thin skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the whole anti-aging part yet because I&#x27;ve only used it about 3 times so far, but sure does make your face soft! I can tell it will be a good moisturizer, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Very rich moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I took the sample out of a magazine, usually I throw them in a drawer and toss them months later but for some reason I opened it and rubbed it on my face.  It was very thick but oddly it didn&#x27;t break my face out like most thick creams.  This was a Tuesday.  I forgot about it.  On Friday morning, I got up---looked in my bathroom mirror and was SHOCKED!!!  My skin tightened up like I was 10 years younger, the blotchy spots, roseacia looking stuff on my chin, GONE!!    I ran to the store thinking it was going to cost $35+ but no, it was only $17.    Everyone said my skin looks amazing-I told 5 friends and they all are using it now.  I have even started putting on the back on my hands, I am 51 and my hands were looking older.  One friend thinks it is making her skin oily so I bought her jar from her. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Good just around the eyes.  Makes me break out on my cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> Ok so I wasn&#x27;t going to post the review until I was 100% certain it will work and I can give a proper review on it. I have had this product for 6 weeks now and I can say I like the results. I slowly documented each step by step to assure accurate results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: First thing I noticed about it that it goes on smooth, really smooth. You really don&#x27;t need to add a lot but every face is different so. upon first use I immediately started to feel it tighten my face after 15 mins of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week 1: Noticed my face start to tighten more, My face was felt hydrated and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;Week 2: I started to notice my dark circles get lighter and my neck felt a little tighter.&lt;br /&gt;Week 3: Started to notice my wrinkles getting lighter, especially around my eyes. My dark circles continued to look less noticeable and it even diminished a little bit of the puffy look people so often asked about. My skin had a nice hydrated feel to it and I can even see some natural color balance out in my face.&lt;br /&gt;Week 4: My neck felt a little firmer and my face started to look a little less droopy. I was getting compliments at work.&lt;br /&gt;Week 5: I didn&#x27;t use it at all for a week because I was on vacation and forgot to pack it.&lt;br /&gt;Week 6: My face has a nice natural glow to it, my face feels smooth, non greasy or glossy, I have had people at work ask me what my secret is and assumed I got professional cosmetic work done lol. My face feels more tightened, hydrated, and overall younger. (everyone wants to look younger and this product hits that nail on the head.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it doesn&#x27;t get rid of the wrinkles completely (It is not a genie in a bottle) but it does help them look a lot less noticeable. Your skin will thank you. Despite the fact that it goes on creamy, I was expecting it to be really oily and leave the skin oily like other products I have tried. I am pleasantly surprised it didn&#x27;t do that. This jar is 1.7 oz and it will last you for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice:&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t expect the results to happen instantly or even overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. This product can be used in the morning and/or at night but If you wear makeup regularly then I recommend you use this as a night cream instead before bed because it helps better. However if your someone that wears makeup on a regular basis then I recommend this trick. Apply this on first before putting your makeup on. It acts as a primer and it helps the makeup not to settle deeply into the lines and wrinkles. If you apply it on above your eye then it makes it a lot easier to put on eye shadow and get a nice smoky eye look. It makes the eye shadow blend in better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Make sure you wash your face before applying this on. It helps to absorb in the skin better and helps the skin stay better hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A lot of people asked me if they can use this as a replacement for sunscreen. There is nothing on the box or jar saying it is SPF protected. So please don&#x27;t risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. You can use this product for your face, neck and chest (as it says) However I have not tried it on my chest mainly because my problem area is my face mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6: The price is decent but I recommend you try one jar first before you do a impulse buy and wind up with a 6 month supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7: You don&#x27;t need a lot to make the magic of this happen! Just add a few dabs around your face and neck and blend it in. I apply it only once a day in the morning but I know some other people have used it up to 2-3 times a day. Try it once a day first so you can see the results. Every face is different so.&lt;br /&gt;1. Don&#x27;t expect the results to happen instantly or even overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.

            <li> I love this product - the subscription delivery is always surprising, welcomed</li>
            <li> Did not see any benefits, will nit rebuy</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have used this product.  I find it to be great for dry skin.  It seems to be very greasy when it is put on but within and hour or so it is all absorbed into your skin.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Way too strong of a perfume smell. Threw out.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my mother,it&#x27;s very nice~</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well at reducing fine lines, especially around my neck area but it&#x27;s very sticky. I tried using it under my makeup during the day but it&#x27;s just too heavy feeling for that. I just use it at night.</li>
            <li> Super thick and greasy. I used two containers of this over several months and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.  It might work well for others, but didn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product was the best yet for dry skin. I would highly recommend it and would purchase this same product again.</li>
            <li> This luscious product looks and feels like creamy butter and what it does for my 64 year old skin is just awesome!  I have always taken good care of my skin, using good quality products, but since retirement, have had to pay more attention to pricing!  I must say this makes my skin feel as good as the over $100 products I have used. I will certainly be trying the eye cream next.</li>
            <li> Have used this cream since it was released a few years ago. It is the only cream that my skin tolerates. I use mostly all L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> I like Loresl products and this one is good.  I can see a difference in the texture of my skin and it seems to help with the little fine lines .  Only thing is it is a little heavy and does not absorb really well .  Especially on the neck- the cream &amp;#34;sits&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; in the neck creases without any absorption at all .  Makes a good night cream.</li>
            <li> Got a sample in a magazine and found it&#x27;s consistency very soothing and dry skin quenching. I have been having trouble finding moisturizers, heavy enough for me. This is an excellent product and value.</li>
            <li> I am a 55 year old woman, and have the kind of skin that sags more than most.  :(  My neck can no longer handle the retinol and hydroxies that I use on my face and chest.  As the skin on my poor old neck continues to do its aging thing, it has become more sensitive to topicals.  I was getting very red, irritated, burny, stingy reactions on my neck when using my usual stuff.  I did a search here for \\&quot;soothing neck balm\\&quot; and discovered this.  It&#x27;s exactly what I was needing, and is truly a soothing balm for my neck.  It&#x27;s thick and creamy without being at all greasy.  It has no weird fragrance.  At this point, I know better than to believe that any cream is going to turn back or stop the clock...  The best I really hope for is to not become leathery, and to retain as much softness as possible.  In doing so, maybe I&#x27;m slowing down the wrinkling just a bit.</li>
            <li> I have used some of the most expensive treatments and creams on the market and hands down this is the best ever, the Golden Balm actually does redensify your skin, as it ages it thins especially under the eyes and yes this golden balm works , it turns back the clock, I even had one of my adult daughters ask me if I had had laser work done! The new product in the line , the Serum is also wonderful, I use it on my chest and neck and my skin is as soft as silk , the sun damange , spots and fine lines is gone! I am not kidding you ladies, this is the best ever and at around 20.00 a jar, I use it every day after applying my glycolic product at night and around my eyes and lips before my makeup in am.</li>
            <li> bought it for my mumï¼Œhope she loves it</li>
            <li> very cute&amp;nice,i&#x27;d love itvery cute&amp;nice,i&#x27;d love it</li>
            <li> I used this product several nights in a row. It definitely makes my skin look drier with worse texture. Will not continue use or buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Back to Revitalift night.</li>
            <li> I do not have an opinion of how well this product works yet as I have only used it for 2 hours. The scent is very strong and cloying.  I may not be able to tolerate it around my face and have to just use in far away from my nose. It feels nice. Should have read ingredients, &#x27;parfume fragrance&#x27; is at the very end.  Should have remembered I have thrown out L&#x27;Oreal products before because of the scent.  Don&#x27;t trust others&#x27; opinions that there is no scent!</li>
            <li> Very thick and creamy but goes on delightfully smooth and my skin absorbs it rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  Read my other reviews for a greater product</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. I bought it at my local drugstore. My skin is a combo of oily/dry and I have rosacea and some wrinkles.  I am over 55.  I use this product at night . It does not have a smell and I do not find it too greasy- in fact the cream just absorbs and leaves your skin so smooth and supple.  It is not breaking my skin out like so many creams do.  I recommend this product .</li>
            <li> I was not in the market for another cream, but I got a sample in a magazine, tried it, loved it, and went out and bought some more.  This is  very thick and creamy. It seems too thick for my face (with very sensitive skin), but I am thrilled with it for my neck and chest, especially during dry weather. I like that it is not scented.  I hate when various creams, deodorants, perfumes, etc. compete for fragrance and try to get fragrance free products whenever possible.  This cream comes out looking gold, but I don&#x27;t notice any color on my skin. If there is any, it is subtle.   I have been using this every morning and evening.  I can&#x27;t say for sure if there is any long term effect or if my skin just feels softer because it has a cream on it, but I really like this and will buy more once my jar runs out. I am thrilled to find something I really like that is not horribly expensive. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a little while back and have to say, my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good in a very long time.  I apply it morning and night time and Buy with confidence, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.  I am 66 years old and look (I would love to say 30 but ) 50.  Love it!  Enjoy Ladies!</li>
            <li> IM IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT AND I AM SO GLAD AMAZON.COM HAD IT  I AM SO HOOKED ON THIS FOR MY FACE AND NECK AND I WONT BE WITHOUT IT EVER PLEASE KEEP IN STOCK  THANKS  GREAT DEAL TOO</li>
            <li> I tend not to be able to use heavy creams like this in the morning since my skin gets oily through the day.  The same is true with this product.  However, putting it on at bedtime is perfect.  I think it&#x27;s best to just let it seep into your skin through the night. I have yet to wake up with an \\&quot;oily\\&quot; feeling on my face.  Additionally, this product has a great smell.</li>
            <li> I finally found the perfect moisturer for my face and neck. Never greasy, but always moist from morning to night. Love It!</li>
            <li> It is light and creamy. it also has a slight tint that helps when you just want to wear a touch of makeup in this heat.</li>
            <li> I have never bothered to review a skin care product before and have been taking care of my skin since I was a teenager and I am 49 years old now, I have used some of the most expensive treatments and creams on the market and hands down this is the best ever, the Golden Balm actually does redensify your skin, as it ages it thins especially under the eyes and yes this golden balm works , it turns back the clock, I even had one of my adult daughters ask me if I had had laser work done! The new product in the line , the Serum is also wonderful, I use it on my chest and neck and my skin is as soft as silk , the sun damange , spots and fine lines is gone! I am not kidding you ladies, this is the best ever and at around 20.00 a jar, I use it every day after applying my glycolic product at night and around my eyes and lips before my makeup in am. Try this product , use if faithfully , daily at least and use it on your neck chest and face...you will be rewarded !</li>
            <li> Like the glow, is a bit thick for my face, but it keeps me hydrated.</li>
            <li> I started using this great moisturizer last January during the extremely cold winter we were experiencing in the Chicago area, which positively inflamed my face. Nothing I tried helped to relieve my poor face; in fact, I think some of the products I used made it worse. So at the age of 65 I was looking for relief. The worst part of my problem seemed to be the thinning of my skin, which was always on the thin side, thus the loss of my skin&#x27;s resiliance to the onslaugt of the environment. My lips were constantly peeling in spite of various manifestations of chapstick I used. I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Golden Balm becaused it promised to reduce the symptoms of skin-thinning and make my skin more resiliant to the winter&#x27;s cold and dryness. I was concerned about possible breakouts. However they haven&#x27;t happened since I began using this product in January 2013. I apply it liberally to my face and neck in the morning and to my lips and around my mouth several times a day as needed. I have also found L&#x27;Oreal Paris Age Perfecting Face and Neck Balm the best cuticle cream I have ever used on my very thick dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> About a couple month ago, I noticed an ugly line on my neck. I went to Sephora and got recommended a neck cream that cost over $100. I wasn&#x27;t ready to spend that much money for something might not work. So I researched &amp;#34;the best neck cream&amp;#34; and hit this product. Since this is so inexpensive (I spent $12), I generously applied on my neck every night and after about a week, I&#x27;d noticed the line become less visible. I&#x27;m sure, there must be more effective neck cream in market but I can say before spend $$$, try this cream. It doesn&#x27;t hurt your wallet.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of have one product for day and night. Also one product for face, neck and chest.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way it make my face look ðŸ˜Š It&#x27;s not grease, it doesn&#x27;t take a lot of cream to apply each time.</li>
            <li> I did not start to loyally use face &amp; neck moisturizer until almost 60 years old. (my forehead was dry as cement....also a zillion tiny wrinkles around my mouth &amp; nose)Had to buy over the counter brands because my&lt;br /&gt;budget is tight. It&#x27;s been a year now and I have tried several brands......have not found one to stick to&lt;br /&gt;until recently. This new L&#x27;Oreal golden balm is a winner for me. Does it erase wrinkles? no....and it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;say it will. But it does everything it does say it will do. I have used this in the face and the eye golden&lt;br /&gt;balm cream twice a day for over a month now. It has made my skin a bit more subtle(less droopy)..with the look of&lt;br /&gt;wrinkles softened. When I am going to wear foundation makeup I also use golden balm as a face primer. This is&lt;br /&gt;working great. It helps the makeup not to settle deeply into the lines and wrinkles. Notice I didn&#x27;t say it&lt;br /&gt;almost makes the wrinkles vanish...LOL....that is wishful thinking. I like it enough that I now have subscribed to automatic shipping once a month for these creams. You really should try it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I hesitated to try it but now I&#x27;m so glad that I did. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks now. I only use it at night and my skin is soft and dewy like never before. I love that it&#x27;s thick and you need to use so little of it that this 1.7 ounce jar will last for quite some time.  I have chosen to only use this at night because my makeup does not go on smoothly for at least an hour after I have applied it.  I&#x27;m just too lazy to put it on after a shower in the morning and then wait the hour to put on my makeup.  Having only used it nightly for 2 weeks it&#x27;s done amazing things to my skin.  My dÃ©colletÃ© area is so soft.  My husband noticed how soft my dÃ©colletÃ© area was and so now I want to use this across my shoulders as well, especially over the summer months when one wants to be softer in that area.  This product has no scent.  I love scented products so long as the scent is nice. I suppose on the face, it&#x27;s nice to not have any scent but for me I wish they would make this product in a bigger size for the entire body in a nice buttercream scent.  That would be pure heaven.</li>
            <li> too greasy for me.  I wear it at night but its&#x27; too thick and greasy to wear under makeup.  also has a strong scent</li>
            <li> This would be an excellent product if it weren&#x27;t for the smell.  It&#x27;s very strong and stays with you.  I put it on yesterday morning and could still smell it on my skin when I went to bed.</li>
            <li> I love the product! My skin feels soft and looks great! I highly recommend it to all women who are looking for a good skin product to keep your skin looking young.</li>
            <li> The balm is rich and creamy but smells really strange. This Golden Balm is specially for 40+ skins. Hope it will work.</li>
            <li> I oder this product cause I have I seen it on TV alot. Well I have been useing it now for about a month or so and all my freinds see a different in my face and neck, they say my face seems too be more tone and my neck is more tighter and I look younger too.Yes I will alwayes buy this product...mic from Ca</li>
            <li> Really great cream for Senior ladies.... helps put a glow to your skin when you use it under makeup, or put it on after cleaning even if you don&#x27;t put on makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I am using the correct term or not, but after applying it, this cream makes my face sweat for an hour afterwards.  It absorbs into my skin when I first apply it, and it absorbs it in about 5 minutes.  But then for an hour afterwards, I have to dab my upper lip, chin and forehead with a paper towel to get all the sweat off...I mean beads of sweat not just moist.  I have never had any product do this before.  I have normal skin, and use a hydro oil serum from Dr. Denese before my moisturizer, and this has never happened with any other product.  It does make my skin feel great once I the sweat stops pouring out of my face, and if I use it as a night cream, I wake up with soft skin.  But I bought it as a day cream, and it just won&#x27;t work for anyone who hasn&#x27;t got a ton of time in the morning.  And just FYI, I use Revitalift products for night cream and my eyes, and find these products fabulous.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fantastic!!!!  I live in the mountains of Colorado where there is NO HUMIDITY and your skin turns crispy FAST!!!!  This product is comparable to department store moisturizers for 1/3 the cost.....I LUV THIS STUFF!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent my wife loves</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about one month now, and I have to say I am very pleased.  It is very thick and creamy, and I was afraid that it would go on too thick, but it spreads very well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I will definitely be ordering more of this when I get low, but that should be awhile, because it goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> This balm is not readily absorbed and leaves my skin feeling greasy. It may be find for some people but I don&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is terrific - one of the few face cream moisturizers that does not contain retinol, or some other face peeling chemical, so all it does is moisturize, and that&#x27;s what I wanted. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This stuff should just say GOLD! My throat was wrinkled now it&#x27;s smooth, I should of done a before and after, that&#x27;s how unbelievable this product is! Remember to put it on the back of your hands as well I swear my hands look ten years younger!! TRUTH!! Love L&#x27;Oreal even more now!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m NOT big on lotions and creams, usually because they don&#x27;t work well, and usually have a perfume smell I don&#x27;t care for.&lt;br /&gt;BUT THIS STUFF IS GREAT!  Very slight and pleasant scent, but it moisturizes like I&#x27;ve never experienced!  I&#x27;m getting more!!!</li>
            <li> I use this cream on my very dry skin while my skin is still moist after washing.  It makes my skin look natural again.It is rather thick so you have to work it into your skin but it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li> feels good on my face I love this stuff it seems to keep face moist and wrinkles don&#x27;t show so bad.</li>
            <li> Feels great, smells divine. I am using this on my neck and decollete only. Very moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Perfect hydration for winter months. It absorbs quickly and leaves skin soft and supple. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> it came in good shape and on time. looks good, i have not try it yet. i been using this product for few years, and they are helping.</li>
            <li> same  problem as the other one  i am going back to old age perfect</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my once oily skin is now dryer, especially in the winter. My regular moisturizer just wasn&#x27;t enough.  This product is thick and provides great moisture, but does not leave my skin feeling greasy.  I also have sensitive skin and find that L&#x27;Oreal products do not irritate it.</li>
            <li> have used this for a couple of years as I have aged.  Not greasy, but hydrating</li>
            <li> just as good as the moisturizers that cost a fortune.  the matching eye cream is as good as shiseido&#x27;s which costs 2.5 times as much.</li>
            <li> One of my most favorite creams to put on day and night. I have oily skin. This product is a tad bit greasy but if you use it sparingly, you will be delighted with it&#x27;s results. I am a bit more liberal with it on my neck and chest since I more often than not neglect those parts. You can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, shipped quickly, well packaged.  Cannot go wrong this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> The texture of the lotion is thick so it does not take a lot.  I like the hydration it provides.  If I had a choice, I would buy it without the perfumed smell. I can pick up on it for hours after using it.  But, I do not wear perfumed products so I notice it more than most.</li>
            <li> my mother very like it</li>
            <li> its ok as a moisturizer.  Very thick, but didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after a month.  Trying something else</li>
            <li> Super deal!  and no traffic to go to the store!</li>
            <li> This product feels somewhat gooey and makes my skin itch. I will keep using it for a while to see if it works to reduce the lines in my neck.</li>
            <li> I Love This Stuff, I mix it with my BB Cream. I bought a few shades too dark of the BB Cream &amp; it mixes perfectly with the Butter Cream Color. It makes getting older~~Suck, just a little bit less!  I&#x27;d buy again, and I have, several times!</li>
            <li> Really, really rich moisturizer.  Makes my skin feel so silky.  Leaves a bit of a film&lt;br /&gt;that will eventually sink in. I use it on my face, neck and upper chest area.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I originally started using it because I got a free sample from More Magazine years ago. I have been using it every since.  I use it every morning with my sunscreen and every night by itself. I can find it a Wal-Mart and CVS, however it seems like the price keeps going up and up. I was really happy to find it on here with auto shipments. I get to choose the shipment time frame (I chose every 3 months) and keep the same price. I no longer have to worry about if I will have a coupon for this when I am ready to purchase a new bottle. It just arrives at my door! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the way the product feels on my skin and how it works. I would recommend this product to anyone that needs to Hydrate their skin. I really like L&#x27;Oreal products and have always used them.</li>
            <li> I use this balm daily on my face and on the tops of my hands.  The difference in the tops of my hands is amazing.  The skin is softer and smoother and doesn&#x27;t look quite as &amp;#34;aged&amp;#34; as it did before using it.  I also put the balm on the tops of my lower arms and it feels so good.  It leaves a silky feel on my skin and I feel protected.  I have tried many face creams and have been unsatisfied and usually ended up tossing the product.  It would be best if you use this product at night to get the protection during the night.  I am retired so I don&#x27;t have to apply makeup during the day because I&#x27;m not sure you would want to apply a foundation over the balm.  I have subscribed and saved this product to my Amazon list and it is crucial to my older skin regimen.  5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 35 and got this for my neck. I have a line/ring in the middle of it that bothers me a lot. I used this last night and saw somewhat of a difference this morning. However, this stuff does not spread easily, it&#x27;s pretty tacky and very greasy which i can deal with if you get results. As this stuff is made for more mature skin, I&#x27;m surprised it doesn&#x27;t spread easier. I mean you don&#x27;t want to be tugging at your skin making it worse. All in all it&#x27;s &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; for now. If I finish the jar and see amazing results I&#x27;ll update my review</li>
            <li> From day one my mom saw a change in her face, neck and chest.  It is not greasy at all. Leaves her face soft and smooth and no, she still looks like my mom, lol, but she loves it! In case you are interested,  a jar lasts almost three months.</li>
            <li> this crÃ¨me is very thick and stings my eyes.</li>
            <li> All of loreal is really good.  I have used many of their products and continue to do so due to the price and the quality</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom. This balm is for the face, neck and chest. It contains 10 precious oils, combined with skin strengthening calcium to attract and maintain moisture in mature skin. This product is meant for people with thinning, mature skin. So, I would say itâ€™s perfect for people who are 35+.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a maroon colored glass container with a golden colored lid. It contains 48 gms. The moisturizer is a cream/golden colored one and has very slight shimmery appearance. It has a balm like texture and gets absorbed super fast into the skin, leaving it hydrated and soft. The smell, Oh god, is just deliciously beautiful. I couldnâ€™t stop smelling it once I tried it on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw immense change in my mom&#x27;s skin particularly her neck area. It&#x27;s really hydrated and looks healthy now. I highly recommend it if you have mature skin which is in dire need of hydration and care.</li>
            <li> Works great at night, as it is a heavy cream.  My skin likes it.</li>
            <li> This is the next best thing to Lancome (since they are sister companies). It is very thick, creamy and moisturizing to say the least. The scent is very light and pleasant (not over-powering). To give a visual, I have caucasian dry skin (it goes along with having naturally curly hair.) In addition to that, my skin is extremely sensitive. Even more so, now that I have 40-something year old skin, I really must moisturize. I use it before I go to sleep. If you have oily skin, I&#x27;m not sure if this is right for you; perhaps it can be used every now and then. Personally speaking, I love and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, use this every day makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect and it certainly helps hydrate my aging skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My skin is already different, it is very soft and it looks much better. I love this product and I recommend to everyone!!!</li>
            <li> This is so perfect.  I have truly noticed that my skin is firmer</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m only 32 but I like the way it feels on my skin. And it does help with sleep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I used the entire jar of this product and did not notice any improvement.  I used it twice a day, every day.  I was hoping to see some improvement in my neck and the lines around my mouth, but I do not notice any difference.  I am over 50.</li>
            <li> Not impressed. although it appears to be rich I find it very greasy. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months and cannot say I have obtained any of the promised result.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely for the more mature person-- although a younger person might find this very hydrating. I love this product and will continue to use it c</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed with this product, it left my forehead shiny and caused my skin to break out.  I threw it away</li>
            <li> Cream is heavily scented.  My sensitive skin and nose cannot stand it.  Irritant.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product. My wife loved it! I am happy to recommend it to anyone looking for this type of night cream as a gift for his wife.</li>
            <li> I changed from another neck and decollate cream to this product.  I haven&#x27;t seen any change as yet, but it feels creamy and appears to soak it well.</li>
            <li> Does not spread easily... too thick!</li>
            <li> This is great for &amp;#34;more mature&amp;#34;skin.  I use a lot of L&#x27;Oreal products and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying the eye cream and loving that. This product is indeed rich and comforting as the description says. It feels great - very hydrating and nourishing. However, it is thick and a little greasy. If you have oily or combination skin, it may be too much for you to use under makeup. That&#x27;s the case for me. I like using it at night, though. I slather it on my face and neck, and my skin definitely feels \\&quot;nourished\\&quot; after using it.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff! I have spent a lot of money looking for a really good skin cream, but even the most expensive ones did not hydrate my skin. Many of them dried my skin. This one was the exception. It works, and it really has made my skin look better. I just reordered it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50s so I needed something stronger but I don&#x27;t like the additives that peel you face as it leaves my skin red.  This stuff is really thick.  A little goes a very long way. It leaves a bit of dewiness as it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely, but I was looking toe that.  It is moist but not oily looking.  It has a bit of a floral scent, but I don&#x27;t mind it.  I&#x27;d give it five stars if it was just a lilies less thick to make application easier.</li>
            <li> I get this for my mom every year and she swears by it.  good for very dry skin for women ages 40 +</li>
            <li> Actually I liked the cream and it felt good on my skin, but it was such a tiny amount that it lasted only two weeks. How can you tell if it works in only two weeks.</li>
            <li> Leaves a gritty texture on your skin, but smells good.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff! works so fast , you&#x27;ll see a result after a short while. I think L&#x27;oreal is awesome brand.</li>
            <li> I have been useing  this  product since I got it and I haven&#x27;t really seen no differents??</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing product during our cold and dry winter. It kept my skin well hydrated over night.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I give it 4 stars only because I just received it and still working on seeing results</li>
            <li> This actually is perfect for sensitive skin and moisturizes well.  The only negative thing about this product is that it rather think and doesn&#x27;t spread easily.  However, if you use it on damp skin, or dampen your fingers first, it will go on easily.  It is worth the little extra effort.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I&#x27;m 60+ and it provides the perfect hydration for mature skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for women of a certain age with dry skin.  A great night cream.  As good as the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> i have extremely sensitive skin.  this works. and well.  and i&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my neck/lines on my face are less pronounced.  has plumped the skin on my neck to look younger.  definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE! Keeps my skin moisturized and is a great base for applying foundation and powder.</li>
            <li> This cream keeps my face moist, soft,  with less wrinkles.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years, and love it.</li>
            <li> I can not figure out exactly what this creme smelled like, kind of like carrots? It is also very greasy, but for me overall it was the smell that I could not deal with when I went to sleep at night and on my face, it was simply to oily for me.&lt;br /&gt;But I do have to say the quality of the creme and texture of itself felt really good, so might be worth a try , especially as it worked so well for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just did not work with me, will stick with my argan oil and the L;oreal collagen night creme .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update, as I had a little letft and decided to use it , I have to say you get used to the smell, and as i put it on rather thick I have to say I maybe actually did see a deminishment of fine lines on my neck but especially in the chest area in the morning . I might have to give it another try. I would say go for it, Amazons return policy is awesome . I tried various other cremes meanwhile and the thick texture of this balm is better then any other, only think is that I tried it on my face again and I felt totally greased up, even as I used only very little&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helped</li>
            <li> This is the only brand (age perfect) of lotion that works for my skin. I&#x27;m under 30 years old, but I love it!  I can instantly feel the hydration and even in the morning I still feel it working.</li>
            <li> Excellent product - have used this brand for several years and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> bought first jar in texas in the summer.loved it so much had extra sent from usa to uk.This product on my skin surpasses some really expensive creams that I have bought in the past.</li>
            <li> The price is good, it&#x27;s highly cost effective. However, it&#x27;s a little difficult to be absorbed by skin. So affter apply it, a while of massage is needed.</li>
            <li> Firms up skin under eyes. I love it!</li>
            <li> Had a t problem with this one.. made my face red,so gave it to a friend who likes it.</li>
            <li> I really like this however its a little greasy</li>
            <li> I JUST LEFT WORD THAT I HAD NOT RECEIVED MY PACKAGE AS YET AND I JUST FOUND OUT IT WENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  ALSO, THE PERSON WHO GOT MY PACKAGE SENT IT BACK!!!!! GOOD GRIEF!!</li>
            <li> I got this because I know someone who truely believes in this kind of stuff. Whether they work or not is a different story. I only got this because it was a better deal on amazon and I dont reget it since i got good feedback from the person I got it for. Especially now I think people have just come to depend on brands and its all about the placebo effects on what outcome you get.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got an old jar of this product that was ordered from Amazon but putting on my face make me think of my grandmother when she once told me they just used lard as a face cream.  That is just what it felt like to dip into the jar, it was hard and I was even unable to smooth it on my face without water.  I used it for a month and finally just threw the rest of the jar out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep seeing the commercials and it looks so light and smooth.  Watching them  brought me back to read the reviews here and it seems my experience is not typical.  I wish cosmetics came with expiration dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it with Loreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Serum which I love.  Wish I could say the same about the \\&quot;golden balm.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great but I love me some coconut oil the best</li>
            <li> Ordered it for my mother she loves this product and has experienced glow n freshness in her skin.</li>
            <li> second time purchase for me. Very hydrating.</li>
            <li> I really LOVE how my skin feels with this product. It didn&#x27;t take long for me to use up the jar. But I will continue to get it as it&#x27;s really made my skin feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I have almost used one jar of this balm and I have seen a noticeable difference in my neck area. I had a lot of bumpy dry skin at the bottom of my throat. I apply it once a day usually, but if it is particularly cold, I will apply it before I leave the house. I look in a 10X mirror while I am putting it on and I am delighted to say I have seen the bumps recede a bit. At my age -70- I am thrilled for all the help I can get.</li>
            <li> Nice... a bit thick but goes on nicely.  Face feels really good after application and wake up with skin looking better than when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> Use this cream faithfully and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> df grg t ytb g jr g u gyu fgh jtrh y ujerw yt yrt  uijywrt  uyrt r htu  h</li>
            <li> Thick and heavy, but if you rub it in, it makes a good night cream.</li>
            <li> I like the results and the scent of this product and received it fast. I will be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I am 50 this month. I was having some dry skin issues And this totally took care of them. I have had friends who didn&#x27;t know I was using it comment on the difference they saw in my face. It is way better than any moisturizer.i have used before. It does not leave my skin oily either. I will continue to use this product. I have even subscribed to getting it every three months automatically from Amazon. The price on Amazon is $3 cheaper than in the store and then I get a 5% discount for signing up for the auto delivery.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, a bit pricey, but not greasy at all.  First moisturizing product I have truly loved.</li>
            <li> Love it. Feels wonderul.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped, but it&#x27;s an OK product. That&#x27;s all I have to say. Bye.</li>
            <li> This feels great on my skin, and it definitely moisturizes. There definitely is a scent to it; while others have complaints about that I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too bad. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s actually firming my skin but I have to admit I sometimes forget to use it - perhaps it would work better if I were more consistent.</li>
            <li> Dry skin during winter, thought I would explore some better quality creams. Have gone back to an overall body cream. This is a good product, I am just not fussy enough to pay for small jars, even for a modest cost.</li>
            <li> Product was as pictured, delivered as promised. Doesn&#x27;t absorb as fast as I expected.</li>
            <li> It stinks - literally.  I cannot use it. Why does it need to have a scent? I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> YES, IT DOES MAKE MY FACE FEEL GREAT.  I am fortuante, my coplexion is smooth but this just helps keep it that way.  The stores selll out of this product quickly, so online, I order more than one.</li>
            <li> quality cream fo a good price</li>
            <li> I like how it feels will be posting a follow up review 4-weeks after use for more details. I like the cream tho..the only things wish it had less of a fragance.</li>
            <li> This works as well as expensive department store moisturizers, great stuff.</li>
            <li> I has hoped this would have been a very rich peptide cream but instead it is a heavy duty moisturizer that sometimes absorbs and sometimes does not. I&#x27;ll use the rest but won&#x27;t be buying it again. Great for knees and elbows though.</li>
            <li> This neck/face cream rivals those that cost three times more.  The fragrence is so nice.  The texture is rich and creamy.  I love, love, love this product.  My skin looks and feels wonderful.  Much smoother and softer.  I will continue to purchase and highly recommend this product.  Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy and I don&#x27;t see results like lots of people said on their reviews so I&#x27;ll not buy again.</li>
            <li> Funny, I don&#x27;t remember ordering this, but I like it very much.  I was just about to order a different L&#x27;Oreal product (moisturizer) but this is fine for now.</li>
            <li> This skin cream leaves your face very hydrated but not greasy. Make up goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! REally adds moisture to dry skin</li>
            <li> I have always taken good care of my skin and have been blessed with good genes. My mother, age 80, still has beautiful skin.  At 60, I was looking for something to use on a few stubborn wrinkles and decided to try Loreal Age Perfect.  I have used their makeup for years and liked it, but had not used this specific line before.  After about a week of using the cleanser, balm, and eye cream I developed several large blemishes on my chin and eyebrows.  I stopped using the products and stopped breaking out, but the blemishes were so deep that I still have them a month later.  It turns out these products clogged my pores and the cleanser was too greasy to actually clean my skin thoroughly.  I did like the eye cream and may still use it at night, but the cleanser and balm, while making my wrinkles better, caused marks on my skin that look like they will leave scars.  I am very fair and this is distressing.  If you decide to use these products, watch for clogging or use something stronger to completely remove the product on a daily basis to prevent break outs.</li>
            <li> Thick, but not greasy. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Creamy and hydrating without being greasy. Lasts about 10 hours, perfect for the work day or long nights out.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it is what I wanted because of Ad reviews.  So far I like it.  will need more time to see results.  Fast Ship.</li>
            <li> Love this facial cream, can no longer find it, in my cosmetic Store, wonder why? So, glad I can purchase it online.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and very nice moisturizer.  4wks of application so far and i feel the softness each day smoothless. Great value and I would recommend for the price and improvement of skin appearance.</li>
            <li> I used Youth Code Dark Spot Serum Corrector which did not work at all.  As indicated on it&#x27;s label, I used my daily moisturizer, which is Age Perfect over Youth Code (received both orders on the same day and used for 4 weeks as directed). Now I would like to know if Youth Code did not work because I used this product on top of it.  Also, maybe using Youth Code under Age Perfect interfered with Age Perfect promised results.  I truthfully cannot say I was impressed by either product, especially considering their cost. Does L&#x27;Oreal make another dark spot corrector that I could try?  Please let the appropriate people know my comments.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 6 weeks and and found a difference in my skin.This is not greasy and applied am and pm has worked for me very well. There have been comments that I even look younger!! Recommend this to all!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet. but it does seem soothing and silky. I use it on my neck along with olive oil. People think Im 20 years younger. One people thought I was my daughters sister. LOL</li>
            <li> Tightened my neck up in  just a couple of days. did not work on my chest. Just now trying it on my face, so we will see. I am allergic to fragrance and this hardly has any. Goes on smooth but has a texture to it. Even if it doesn&#x27;t work for my face, or chest, the way it works on my neck is amazing, so will buy again if just for that!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I noticed lines on my chest after sleeping on my side and I also noticed the skin around my neck was looking thinner.  I also have minor redness on my cheeks.  I have a very young face and I can&#x27;t go anywhere without being carded mainly because of family genes and the fact that I always protect my skin the best way I can and no tanning beds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want these new issues to change my youthful look. After the first night I was impressed.  My redness in my cheeks was better and my chest appeared softer.  I tried to use it during the day and I found it was too much moisture.  I kept using it as a cream at night and wow, the results are great.  My lines on my chest are less noticeable and my neck looks better too.  I also noticed that my forehead which used to appear tired is soft looking and more radiant.  I&#x27;m so glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer for sensitive skin.  Love these L&#x27;Oreal products.</li>
            <li> Pretty jar and that&#x27;s about it. Didn&#x27;t do anything except feel heavy. Now I make my own stuff out of REAL natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> This is one of several products my dermatologist recommended for me to try as my regular nighttime skin care cream. It is rich and luxurious, yet absorbs into the skin without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS CREAM! SMOOTH AND SMELLS SO GOOD! I BOUGHT SEVERAL JARS  AND USED ALL OF IT. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> Although this balm is a good moisturizer with a very nice smell and texture it hasn&#x27;t really done much for me as far as actually improving the quality of the skin on my chest and neck which was the reason I purchased it. I&#x27;m not as consistent as I should be about applying it twice daily so perhaps I would see more improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture with more consistent use but I will probably continue buying the balm regardless because it&#x27;s a decent enough moisturizer and a reasonable price for this kind of product.</li>
            <li> This product is good if you are looking for a nice thick moisturizer for your neck, etc.  It won&#x27;t help with wrinkles or sagging skin or anything, but it&#x27;s good as just an add on to your nightly treatment or regimen.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, I believe that I will buy again.After goods let me use my skin is better.</li>
            <li> Good rich cream for normal/dry skin</li>
            <li> I love this.  Use it morning and night.  It goes on a little greasy but is quickly absorbed.  I think it has reduced the appearance of my wrinkles noticeably.  I am now using my second jar and have a third already purchased.</li>
            <li> This is a super moisturizing product, it is quickly absorbed and does not leave a greasy feeling.  Great light scent.</li>
            <li> MY THIRSTY SKIN IS FINALLY QUENCHED. THIS IS ESPECIALLY GREAT FOR SKIN DURING COLD WEATHER WINTER...THAT IS IF WE GET A WINTER THIS YEAR.  LOOKING FOR &amp;#34;OVER 50 SKINCARE?&amp;#34; AFTER TRYING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING, THIS IS WHAT I STAYED WITH...THESE NIGHT TIME AND DAYTIME MOISTURIZERS HAVE QUENCHED MY THIRSTY SKIN MAKING ALL THE IMPERFECTIONS A LITTLE LESS NOTICEABLE. I HAVE USED THEM FOR OVER A YEAR AND AM SO PLEASED. A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, LIFE HAPPENED AND BEING IN A HURRY AND BUSY  I PICKED UP  ANOTHER MOISTURIZER AND USED IT FOR A MONTH...NOT REALLY GIVING IT ANY THOUGHT . ONE MORNING TAKING A WRINKLE SURVEY I COULDN&#x27;T BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF LINES THAT THAT POPPED OUT IN JUST A MONTH!!! OH HORRORS...NEEDLESS TO SAY I&#x27;M BACK WITH THESE LITTLE JEWELS...BACK TO STAY.</li>
            <li> i use these age perfect products and feel they are good.</li>
            <li> I use high end skin care &amp; my skin showed it, I tried this since it was less expensive, but I started to see a change in my skin that I was not happy about. I&#x27;ll keep my usual skin care.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this balm because I live in a cold winter region and wanted a heavier night cream. I have used the balm for 4 days, and find that this is not the heavier protection cream for me. First, I&#x27;ve never used a balm and was surprised at how the balm \\&quot;drags\\&quot; on your freshly-washed face when applying. I don&#x27;t think a woman who is looking for an anti-aging face cream should have to apply such pressure to fragile facial skin. Second, through the night and when I wake up, my face has this tight feeling that every woman knows when her facial cream is not doing a good job. I&#x27;ll stick with my faithful Olay anti-aging products and maybe try this on my hands.</li>
            <li> Makes my face look, and feel very hydrated. This is my second jar, and I notice a big difference in the way my face looks, and feels. I&#x27;m 60 years old, so am looking to make my skin healthy looking, I&#x27;m not expecting magic.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a heavier facial cream and does not absorb so quickly into my skin.  My one complaint is when it is applied on my neck, I will get bits of the cream that dries and forms little pieces on any creases.  I will not purchase it again and will look for another product that does not leave dried product on parts of my skin.</li>
            <li> This really is non greasy but provides moisture when you need it and you can definitely feel it working.  I thought the price was great.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried about all of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s skin products and this is by far the best one..thick, creamy and smells great.</li>
            <li> Really keeps skin hydrated</li>
            <li> Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be nice. It smells nice, and the balm smooths over like butter. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference but It&#x27;s been less than a month so I may write another review.</li>
            <li> I love this night cream.  I am 43 years old and have always taken great care of my skin.  Over the years I have tried many things from most expensive to least expensive and perscription strength moisturizers.  I first used this about a year ago and after just 1 night I noticed a difference in my skin.  After a year my skin is firmer, my age spots have diminished, my under eyes look great and my skin glows.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very good for the skin around the eyes. Excellent product from L&#x27;Oreal.</li>
            <li> she loves it as most woman do and she will be getting more, Says it makes her years younger and her skin smoother also,</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I will continue to buy this product.  Works great on smoothing wrinkles and smells great!  Just wish it came in a large quantity.  I recommend all women to buy this product, it works.</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer! Impossible to rub completely in! It&#x27;s very greasy, but if used at night, it&#x27;s completely absorbed by morning.</li>
            <li> GREAT! I spend many consecutive months in the Mojave Desert. I am outside daily in a very arid climate and it takes a heavy toll on hair, nails and skin. I am delighted to have discovered this facial product many years ago and I still use it almost daily.&lt;br /&gt;When other products failed my hands and they became unhealthily dry, this facial product saved them! I&#x27;m very grateful for L&#x27;Oreal Paris, Neutragena and Olay. I use one product from each, for specific needs, and each one does a great job.</li>
            <li> I am a 57 year old former &amp;#34;sun worshiper&amp;#34;.  I have used all kinds of moisturizers ... expensive and OTC... this is absolutely the best!!  My husband even noticed the difference after I applied it one morning.  I have started to &amp;#34;stockpile&amp;#34; this stuff because I am so afraid that L&#x27;Oreal will decide to discontinue it at some point.  Try it!  You will love it!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can tell a difference on my neck with respect to winkles and drapy skin, but I do like the cream.  Very thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I can all ready see my neck wrinkles disappear, same with cleavage this is a great product. I highly recomend</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this did not absorb on my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin.  It caked up and was not very spreadable eirher.  Smells like citronella, so not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;Returned it.</li>
            <li> This is a great face and neck cream</li>
            <li> bad not original product.</li>
            <li> I bought this after I got the regular kind.  This balm makes my skin feel so soft.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I use it 2x a day.  It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. Not perfect but just as good as the more expensive creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than in my country, and my mother also like it very much. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so super soft and supple but I can&#x27;t handle the strong scent. :(</li>
            <li> works very well for me, I would recommend to anyone over 50. If you have never used Loreal face cream, you should.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried this product.  I bought three jars of it to give it a long trial, so we will see just how well it works, and then I&#x27;ll really let you know.  I love L&#x27;Oreal products and use them all the time, so it has to be good.</li>
            <li> My skin is 82 yrs old, fragile,  and thin. This is my second jar and I added True Skin Natural Vitamins C and E syrum to use with it. In 45 days my skin has become moisturized and plumper. Nice to the touch. I will reorder both again. When finished it rubbed the palms on the tops of my hands and their conditions have improved. Still lots of sun damage, freckles and bruises from steroids but they look nice and cared for. I had tried other brands but for me and my skin this was the best combination.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now.  Before I had been purchasing it from local stores, but found it better priced by purchasing through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for over a month now and I do not see a difference, and I apply it at night, after I shower, and sometimes in the morning too. It just leaves a build up of residue. Thats it, money NOT well spent</li>
            <li> Love this cream and will purchase again.  Thick and smells great. Have begun to notice a difference in texture of my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the brand is also very good.</li>
            <li> The cream leaves the greasy face and also yellowing dirty clothes in the neck. Can not be used with makeup because it stays pasty skin and does not absorb .</li>
            <li> I always find myself coming back to this neck whenever it looks like my neck is getting creepy lines. It really moisturizes well and within a week, lines are diminished but the smell is so strong, I can only wear at night.</li>
            <li> As a older lady, with temperamental skin....this cream is wonderful.  Nice &amp; moisturizing, &amp; a little goes a long way!  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Perfect creme for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery on time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll order it again.</li>
            <li> I love this cream.  A little bit goes a long way.  It smells so wonderful when I smooth it onto my face and neck.  I think I&#x27;ve finally figured out what the scent is...orange julius.  The vanilla and orange scent is lucious.</li>
            <li> I apply it a few times a day &amp; it seems to make my lines disappear for a bit. I&#x27;m 39 and have a few small lines by my eyes that drive me nuts when I notice them.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.  It helps.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is horrific. I like oranges but not on my skin! I used it once and won&#x27;t use it again as the scent was stalking me all day. Yuck!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this cream all the time, she feels that it is better than other more expensive brands! The price is right on Amazon. Thanks!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  It goes on so smoothly and even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Winter-time day/night moisturizer! I&#x27;m just 42 but wanted serious face care and loved product after 2 weeks. Thick consistency but easy to massage unto face. Slight, refreshing citrus scent is a bonus. Absorbs into skin quite rapidly: within 7-10mins.; my skin feels velvety once it&#x27;s completely absorbed. My skin feels lovely and smooth the next morning. Not greasy like many creams I&#x27;ve recently tried. I love this and will keep re-stocking until Spring.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about 10 days, and am very happy with the results.  I think my neck looks better, firmer, and some of the lines on my face seem better, too.  I should have had this 10 years ago.  Great price, great product, better than other creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and love it.  My skin is soft and clear.  I would highly suggest using it at any age.</li>
            <li> a gift for my mon,it&#x27;s very good</li>
            <li> I keep questing for the perfect face cream - at the right price but I always come back to this one. I love the rich creamy texture, the scent and the feel of this cream and, yes, the results! I cannot promise not to be enticed away by miraculous youth and beauty claims elsewhere but, as long as the formula remains the same, I shall continue to purchase this product. Great vendor, too!</li>
            <li> I adore Loreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Advanced Skin Repair Serum, and I was hoping this product would be like that, only a little more substantial. However, it is heavy, greasy and impossible to wear during the day without being aware of it glopping up my face. I have worn it a couple times overnight, and it still feels greasy in the a.m. I have to question whether any of it is getting absorbed into the skin or if it just sits on top of the skin forever until you wash it off with soap and water.</li>
            <li> great price,like it,I am sixty years old.</li>
            <li> good .25% off. like it .mailed directly. go on.</li>
            <li> Thick orange texture. I guess for aging prevention, thicker formular is needed, but not so found of the color agent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every neck cream from Mirenesse to Dior and back.  The Golden Balm is the only one that I&#x27;ve used that showed results.  It&#x27;s very heavy and is greasy but soaks in.  It would be perfect but the rose scent kills me.  I thought I read it was available in unscented, which would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product in the last week, so can&#x27;t report in on its longterm benefits.  The only thing I&#x27;ve really noticed about it is the perfume - it&#x27;s loud and not pleasant.  I would prefer to use an unscented product on my skin, or at least one that doesn&#x27;t have an offensive odor.  This one is very chemical.  The balm itself is very thick, a nice golden color, and seems to sink into my skin slowly, leaving a rather mask-like feeling to my skin.  I will have to wait to see if I develop any issues with it such as rashes, breakouts, etc. or if it improves the clarity of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is really is a heavy cream, so I am only using it for my neck area.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  I think it will take some time to tell the total results.  I love the way it feels on my face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a connoisseur of facial cream since I was 16 years old and now I&#x27;m over 50.  This cream is excellent for the money.  Woman of a particular age desperately need moisture for their necks and chest area.  One person wrote that the cream is greasy,  you need to really work the cream into your skin, hence the name balm. I had a deep wrinkle between my eye brows and now it&#x27;s hardly noticeable, but remember I religiously use this cream in the morning and before I go to bed.  I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Very thick and does not absorb well. Sits on my skin and rubs off on my clothes. It feels sticky and heavy.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase, good product</li>
            <li> My husband and I have come to love the golden balm!  It&#x27;s simply a wonderful, luxurious cream (I use it at night).  Smells great, absorbs nicely, is rich but not greasy.  L&#x27;Oreal owns Lancome so I figured their products had to be on par with Lancome and I believe that to be the case.</li>
