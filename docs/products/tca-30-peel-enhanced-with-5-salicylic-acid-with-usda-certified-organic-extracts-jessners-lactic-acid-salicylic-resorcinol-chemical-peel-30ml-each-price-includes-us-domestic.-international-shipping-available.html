            <li>My skin is looking pretty flawless.</li>
            <li>,i was surprised!coz my skin starts to peel off,it felt amazing coz</li>
            <li>Amazing product but must b carefull when using and keep sking well moisturised after peel  </li>
            <li>i liked this product</li>
            <li>I peeled nicely and my skin healed well.</li>
            <li>I bought almost every kind of acid peel you can buy</li>
            <li>still dont think the jessner is very strong peel.  </li>
            <li>do.&lt;br /&gt;love it  very strong peel.</li>
            <li>Easy to follow directions!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommended it!</li>
            <li>This peel is WAY to strong!  </li>
            <li>IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM..</li>
            <li>I paid $80+ for a very light peel in a salon.</li>
            <li>If you are confident about applying the product, follow instructions exactly - very important.</li>
            <li>i found this product.:-)</li>
            <li>It was more like a fruit peel than a medium peel.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to look better</li>
            <li>I will start washing my face nightly and making sure to use the gycolic prep each night to prepare the skin.  </li>
            <li>The day of the peel I will make sure to wash my face, rinse it and wipe it with alcohol to remove ALL residue.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid $95 for these types of peels &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten a better result from this product doing it myself.</li>
            <li>It frosted although it wasn&#x27;t even on my skin for more than 3 seconds; it looked &#x27;paper-like&#x27; that evening and then peeled off without incident, although it took about 4-5 days</li>
            <li>My skin once again clear, smooth, bright and looks very healthy.</li>
            <li>I have had professional peels before and they have been great.  </li>
            <li>lips peeling, to strong for under eyes.  </li>
            <li>just makes your skin feel kind of hot but its bearable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a jessner peel before from amazon from a different seller and was really  happy with</li>
            <li>The first time I stayed within the safe times recommended on the instructions and NOTHING.</li>
            <li>Just started incorportating the TCA peel, which has significantly amped up the effectiveness of the products.  </li>
            <li>overall good product..</li>
            <li>I used the product on my face once for 1 minute and rinsed with cool water.</li>
            <li>The product has to be used carefully but it will be a very good peeling without much difficulty and pain.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be bright red right after</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is a safe peel for the layperson (and I am a skincare professional).  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, I have fine lines &amp; acne scars along with brownish age spots.</li>
            <li>your skin will be very sensitive to the sun and too much exposure could lead to more hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>I have  used chemical peels at home in the past and this one works great.</li>
            <li>And dont freak about the texture - even though I applied all kinds of cream etc, the area that I had used the peel on felt super dry/ crackly until it peeled revealing super soft radiant skin...</li>
            <li>this product I saw results with the first application / peel.  </li>
            <li>I would make sure you set aside the ten minutes</li>
            <li>i used  it for the first time i didnt experience all the things im supposed to feel or see it was like nothing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using a 15% solution first.  </li>
            <li>I experienced difficulty using a fan brush to apply the acid evenly fast enough, with a 60 second leave on period.  </li>
            <li>This means forhead first.  </li>
            <li>A couple days later, my skin started peeling lightly, but did not look anything like the photos I saw of &amp;#34;deep peeling&amp;#34; after a &amp;#34;30% TCA peel&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>so people that are not use to two layers of TCA should probably not try that if it will be the first time you have had a TCA or Jessner.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I think i did it for 1 minute</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting out with anything longer, you can go longer the more you use it though.</li>
            <li>My chin was the last area that the peel was applied, and it peeled the first day in spots, that are bright red areas that sting when lotion is applied.  </li>
            <li>Read my other reviews I am not the easiest person to please and am honest.</li>
            <li>This peel was just as good as deep peels I have had in medical spa&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It has really cleared it up and has left fresh smooth skin after three treatments.  </li>
            <li>MUAC works really well compared to this jessner&#x27;s peel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But get online and find out how this really works.</li>
            <li>Buy a real brush to apply this with do not use cotton swabs.</li>
            <li>Your skin will be very tender after so be gentle with it, i didn&#x27;t wash my face until two days after</li>
            <li>My skin started to darken about two days after and it got really wrinkly.</li>
            <li>This seems a better method to me since the acid takes effect before I can finish the other sections, and I can focus on one section at a time.  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen is a must daily.is seems a better method to me since the acid takes effect before I can finish the other sections, and I can focus on one section at a time.  </li>
            <li>and I was less oily after using, and there was very light peeling.</li>
            <li>Then the second time I kept it on for a full 4 minutes with the TCA put on after 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; as the peel can be pretty intense if you use both solutions, but I love it.</li>
            <li>The skin turns pink and frosts for a while, so it is easy to see the sections.  </li>
            <li>The skin turns pink and frosts for a while, so it is easy to see the sections.  </li>
            <li>I also bought MUAC 18% from the main website.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Still have a little bit of hyperpigmentation to deal with, my skin is definitely more even-toned.</li>
            <li>I looked like an old lady that tanned too much.</li>
            <li>Immediately after the peel I will use a cool compress for a few minutes, to help calm the skin and then use Neosporin and later aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>Immediately after the peel I will use a cool compress for a few minutes, to help calm the skin and then use Neosporin and later aloe vera.  </li>
            <li>On the third to fourth day it started peeling and coming off in long strips, don&#x27;t pull because that can cause more scarring ( although i couldn&#x27;t resist and pulled some off with no side effects.)</li>
            <li>but now the hyper-pigmentation is nearly gone and the results I wanted with</li>
            <li>I have used the treatment for my back and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>The 2nd time I used it as the 2nd layer, I left only about 2 mins, and I did have more peeling.</li>
            <li>Although the peeling isn&#x27;t as much as I was used to getting when I went to my estetician, it was still enough for me to acknowledge that the peel was doing it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you place vaseline like ointment under your eyes, on your lips and any sensitive areas of your skin prior to application</li>
            <li>My main concern now are the patches around my mouth and chin that are still red, hoping they are not scars.  </li>
            <li>then as skin gets ready to peel over the next several days, the hyper-pigmentation may actually appear darker, but when your skin peels like as if you got a sunburn, it will be much lighter...</li>
            <li>Use sunscreen and avoid direct sunlight as much as possible ( another thing contributing to my old lady appearance, i was always swaddled up with a scarf around my head to avoid the sun.)</li>
            <li>do not freak out - the peel itself will originally frost/show white patches but that fades in a few minutes after you wash the peel solution off...</li>
            <li>I had tried other products with higher concentration and they had not really done much..</li>
            <li>For reference, I do peels regularly, even TCA 15%, and I have oily, acne-prone not too sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with scarring and hyperpigmentation, pass it by if you have sensitive skin or a lowpain threshold.</li>
            <li>I look for more results with confused use.</li>
            <li>My face peeled for about three to four days and the new skin underneath was pink and sensitive.</li>
            <li>After using other acids for years and increasing acid strengths superficial peels, I felt ready for TCA.  </li>
            <li>The Jessner peel needs to go on first for a few minutes</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want at least a week off to do this for full recovery time.</li>
            <li>Like I said, the other acids, even in high concentrations did not affect my skin negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe its my skin, but the previous peel I tried a few years back frosted and seem much strong than the jessner</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> I had tried other products with higher concentration and they had not really done much..if anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product I saw results with the first application / peel.  I had some SEVERE hyper-pigmentation on my face due to application of a tattoo to cover a dark coffee stain birthmark. The hyper-pigmentation was worse than my original birthmark ... but now the hyper-pigmentation is nearly gone and the results I wanted with the tattoo/micropigmentation cover up are coming through. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO READ THE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW THEM.. THIS IS NOT A LOW LEVEL PEEL.. I would make sure you set aside the ten minutes or so do do the procedure with no interruptions or distractions so you have time to read the instructions, have everything prepared and then apply the peel.  If you follow the instructions it will work and give you great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also FYI for folks using this for hyper-pigmentation removal... do not freak out - the peel itself will originally frost/show white patches but that fades in a few minutes after you wash the peel solution off... then as skin gets ready to peel over the next several days, the hyper-pigmentation may actually appear darker, but when your skin peels like as if you got a sunburn, it will be much lighter... And dont freak about the texture - even though I applied all kinds of cream etc, the area that I had used the peel on felt super dry/ crackly until it peeled revealing super soft radiant skin... its like what happens when you get a sunburn... anyhoo hope this helps</li>
            <li> i liked this product a lot.when i used  it for the first time i didnt experience all the things im supposed to feel or see it was like nothing. but  after  a week i applied it on my skin,i was surprised!coz my skin starts to peel off,it felt amazing coz ive seen the results i wanted.i just hope that the supplier stays honest.ur doin a good job.money is nothing compared to trust.so lets all beware of those scams.ive been a victim before.thanks i found this product.:-)</li>
            <li> The seller was extremely responsive, i.e. I lost instructions for peel and upon my request immediately received a 2nd copy of instructions. I have had professional peels before and they have been great.  Highly recommend you place vaseline like ointment under your eyes, on your lips and any sensitive areas of your skin prior to application so you avoid adverse reaction, ie. lips peeling, to strong for under eyes.  The only issue is the price - little pricey yet extremely inexpensive compared to professional peels. If you are confident about applying the product, follow instructions exactly - very important. The aftercare is also pertinent for good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a jessner peel before from amazon from a different seller and was really  happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jessner peel was like water and the TCA could not have been even close to a 30% solution. No peeling, nothing, just little burning sensation like when you use rubbing alcohol on your skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its been 3 days now since second try. I used The Jessner (3 coats) with TCA ( 1 coat for @ 10 seconds). My skin is a little red but no sign of peeling or the darkening like the jessner I bought from a different seller. I will update in a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Update: @ 6 weeks later&lt;br /&gt;I did peel from the previous try. It was more like a fruit peel than a medium peel. However I was happy with the results . My skin seems to look better each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did another peel with jessner 1 layer for 1 minute, and then followed up with TCA for 2-3 minutes and my face frosted. I peeled in 3 days and the results were great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still dont think the jessner is very strong peel.  Maybe its my skin, but the previous peel I tried a few years back frosted and seem much strong than the jessner + TCA combination sold here. Even so I am happy with my results with the TCA combination, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product but must b carefull when using and keep sking well moisturised after peel  i had very big dark horrible freekles on my shoulders that have bpthered me for years what a difference after one peel</li>
            <li> After using other acids for years and increasing acid strengths superficial peels, I felt ready for TCA.  I would recommend using a 15% solution first.  However, this was the kit I choose.  I washed my face and use Cellbone&#x27;s glycolic acid prep with took any remaining oil and residue off my face.  Past peels had not caused any frosting or peeling and were tollerated for extended periods of time.  This peel was being applied to my cheeks and chin by the time my forhead was burning and frosting.  I experienced difficulty using a fan brush to apply the acid evenly fast enough, with a 60 second leave on period.  My chin was the last area that the peel was applied, and it peeled the first day in spots, that are bright red areas that sting when lotion is applied.  From that point Neosporin was used.  It will be used until the peeling stops and the pink skin and red areas heel.  It is day four and the cheeks, chin and mouth area are peeling.  There were some dark areas that developed and concerned me until they started peeling off.  Whew...  My main concern now are the patches around my mouth and chin that are still red, hoping they are not scars.  Like I said, the other acids, even in high concentrations did not affect my skin negatively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this turns out well, I have a few changes I will make in three to six months, when I do it again.  Two weeks before I do that peel I will start washing my face nightly and making sure to use the gycolic prep each night to prepare the skin.  I always wear sunscreen, so that it covered.  The day of the peel I will make sure to wash my face, rinse it and wipe it with alcohol to remove ALL residue.  After that I will the glycolic prep and rinse and dry my face.  I will use either medical gauze squares or small cotton balls evenly saturated, but not dripping, with the TCA to apply it to one section at a time.  This means forhead first.  Rinse, neutralize (Cellbone), rinse and pat dry.  Then the cheeks.  ...  Then the chin...  This seems a better method to me since the acid takes effect before I can finish the other sections, and I can focus on one section at a time.  The skin turns pink and frosts for a while, so it is easy to see the sections.  Immediately after the peel I will use a cool compress for a few minutes, to help calm the skin and then use Neosporin and later aloe vera.  Make-up will not be applied until after the skin is over half peeled, the forhead is usually the last to peel.  Sunscreen is a must daily.is seems a better method to me since the acid takes effect before I can finish the other sections, and I can focus on one section at a time.

            <li> I have used the treatment for my back and it works very well.  I have darker skin and this product was recommended.  Make sure to follow the instructions to get a great peel.  It has really cleared it up and has left fresh smooth skin after three treatments.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This did not work on a tat that was only a few weeks old. Perhaps I used it wrong but it did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Loved it!! My skin has a glow and looks fantastic!! I strongly recommended it!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my little sister. The product isn&#x27;t look as same as in the pictures. A little scratch on the cover. The initial letters were adjusted \\&quot;TCA 30% peel\\&quot;. I also bought MUAC 18% from the main website. MUAC works really well compared to this jessner&#x27;s peel.&lt;br /&gt;I think this seller is trying to trick people into buying fake TCA peel products. How come Jessner&#x27;s peel 30% didn&#x27;t burn or didn&#x27;t peel as well as MUAC 18%. This is ridiculous. Don&#x27;t trust these reviews. They are liars. No burning, no frosting, no peeling at all. They are like water.I sent Jessner&#x27;s peel 30% and MUAC 18% to my little sister in Vietnam. It&#x27;s hard to ask for a refund since we have to send back the product to the USA. Lost 41.95 USD!!!! Just buy products fullfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Always works well. I will never stray form this brand again.  It does what is says it will do.&lt;br /&gt;love it  very strong peel.</li>
            <li> Good quality, the instructions could have been clearer but overall good product.. I would recommend it but just use it carefully.</li>
            <li> The product has to be used carefully but it will be a very good peeling without much difficulty and pain.</li>
            <li> I used 2 layers of Jessner&#x27;s, followed by 2 layers of the TCA peel on my legs and knew immediately it wasn&#x27;t working. It didn&#x27;t burn or sting as reviews said it would, nor did my skin &amp;#34;frost&amp;#34;, at all.  A couple days later, my skin started peeling lightly, but did not look anything like the photos I saw of &amp;#34;deep peeling&amp;#34; after a &amp;#34;30% TCA peel&amp;#34;! Very dissapointing and a waste of not just money, but time as well because now I have to do it all over again...but not from this company!</li>
            <li> If you are not a pro, this can burn your face off-literally. Excellent spot treatment for cystic acne and leftover scars.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the tee twice and have had no peeling. I am disappointed! The first time I stayed within the safe times recommended on the instructions and NOTHING. Then the second time I kept it on for a full 4 minutes with the TCA put on after 60 seconds. NOTHING.</li>
            <li> I have  used chemical peels at home in the past and this one works great. Not sure if it is for the &amp;#34;beginner&amp;#34; as the peel can be pretty intense if you use both solutions, but I love it. Compared to the price of having a peel done in a salon (which I have also done) it cannot be beat. I paid $80+ for a very light peel in a salon. Easy to follow directions!</li>
            <li> Love! I&#x27;ve paid $95 for these types of peels &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten a better result from this product doing it myself. I highly recommend it, I have fine lines &amp; acne scars along with brownish age spots. It&#x27;s workin miracles for me</li>
            <li> The product worked as expected along with the Jensen peel. I used the product on my face once for 1 minute and rinsed with cool water. Peeling began day 3-5 with noticeable difference in skin tone and texture, wrinkles lessened. I look for more results with confused use. I plan on using the product once per month for 4 months.</li>
            <li> This peel is WAY to strong!  As soon as I applied it to my chin, it felt like a severe burn and I had to immediately had to start neutralizing it which took a few minutes while I panicked that my skin was going to be ruined!  It frosted although it wasn&#x27;t even on my skin for more than 3 seconds; it looked &#x27;paper-like&#x27; that evening and then peeled off without incident, although it took about 4-5 days (thank goodness)!!!  I don&#x27;t think this is a safe peel for the layperson (and I am a skincare professional).  For reference, I do peels regularly, even TCA 15%, and I have oily, acne-prone not too sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This peel was just as good as deep peels I have had in medical spa&#x27;s. I did one layer of Jessner and two layers of the TCA. I peeled nicely and my skin healed well. My skin once again clear, smooth, bright and looks very healthy. I have thick oily skin so people that are not use to two layers of TCA should probably not try that if it will be the first time you have had a TCA or Jessner. Over the next 6-8 weeks I will do a series of Lactic and Salicylic peels and then do another Jessner and TCA. Great product! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I ordered this some time ago, and never used it. Well I started using it approximately 4 mos ago, and initially used the Jessner&#x27;s peel alone. Just started incorportating the TCA peel, which has significantly amped up the effectiveness of the products.  The Jessner&#x27;s alone was great. What I noticed was that my pores were much smaller and I was less oily after using, and there was very light peeling. I used this peel alone about once every 3 wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I incorporated the TCA as the 2nd layer, the first time the stinging was so bad I think I left it on for about a minute.  The 2nd time I used it as the 2nd layer, I left only about 2 mins, and I did have more peeling. Although the peeling isn&#x27;t as much as I was used to getting when I went to my estetician, it was still enough for me to acknowledge that the peel was doing it&#x27;s job. My skin is looking pretty flawless. Still have a little bit of hyperpigmentation to deal with, my skin is definitely more even-toned. For about $45, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Read my other reviews I am not the easiest person to please and am honest. I bought almost every kind of acid peel you can buy and I&#x27;m talking the real acids like this one not over-the-counter store stuff, serious professional acids. This is the best one of all.  But get online and find out how this really works. The Jessner peel needs to go on first for a few minutes and then the TCA for a few minutes and you should probably do it at least twice a year.  You have to neutralize with baking soda and water after you do any sort of acid peel.  I have TCA scars from other TCA acid but not this one. Buy a real brush to apply this with do not use cotton swabs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a while and used it about three times now. You have to wait a few months in between applications and with work its hard sometimes to get one in. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed an improvement in my skin tone. I have bad acne scarring from years of horrible teenage acne. I wish i had the forethought to take pictures to document the change but it didn&#x27;t occur to me and as an acne ridden person i hate having my picture taken. It hurts like heck when you put it on, the Jessner peel just makes your skin feel kind of hot but its bearable. But once you get the TCA on, holy moly. The first time I used it I think i did it for 1 minute each ( its been a while so I&#x27;m not entirely sure.) I wouldn&#x27;t recommend starting out with anything longer, you can go longer the more you use it though. Your skin will be bright red right after and sometimes it turns white, which is called frosting i think, don&#x27;t be alarmed, it goes away in a few seconds to a minute. Your skin will be very tender after so be gentle with it, i didn&#x27;t wash my face until two days after and  I only used Cetaphil. My skin started to darken about two days after and it got really wrinkly. I looked like an old lady that tanned too much. On the third to fourth day it started peeling and coming off in long strips, don&#x27;t pull because that can cause more scarring ( although i couldn&#x27;t resist and pulled some off with no side effects.) My face peeled for about three to four days and the new skin underneath was pink and sensitive. Use sunscreen and avoid direct sunlight as much as possible ( another thing contributing to my old lady appearance, i was always swaddled up with a scarf around my head to avoid the sun.) your skin will be very sensitive to the sun and too much exposure could lead to more hyperpigmentation. You&#x27;ll want at least a week off to do this for full recovery time. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with scarring and hyperpigmentation, pass it by if you have sensitive skin or a lowpain threshold. Its a good alternative to the dermatologist, its not a miracle product but it has definitely improved my skin. I will keep purchasing and using and with any luck my scars will be almost nonexistent. Good luck.</li>
