            <li>Have you every emptied a full nail polish bottle?</li>
            <li>I love these colors in the bottles, not so much on my nails.</li>
            <li>I love these new spring colors!</li>
            <li>They are very pretty.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift, colors are very pretty.</li>
            <li>exotic new colors are here.</li>
