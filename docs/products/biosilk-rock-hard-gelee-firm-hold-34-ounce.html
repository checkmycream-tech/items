            <li>THIS HOLDS THE WHOLE ENCHILADA IN GREAT STYLE:-)</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find it in a super-large size.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments since I&#x27;ve started using this product.</li>
            <li>And it smells quite lovely too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 5 years and it has never disappointed me!</li>
            <li>After literally hundreds of dollars and bottle upon bottle of unusable gels and such, I ordered the GREAT BIG BOTTLES of this awesome stuff.  </li>
            <li>Also, it does not cause any build up and washes out of the hair easily.</li>
            <li>The consistency is thinner as well, and the product easily pours from the bottle.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best hair gel ever!</li>
            <li>I had the benefit of knowing exactly what I was looking for as I have used this gel for many many years.</li>
            <li>It is free of glycerin so it won’t fade your color</li>
            <li>IT IS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT</li>
            <li>(original review in Dec 2009).</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and remains clean on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee is an integral part of the “cocktail” of ingredients I use to achieve picture perfect Type 2B/3A curls.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good purchase--</li>
            <li>I will be back to get more :)</li>
            <li>believe BRHG has been discontinued, and I was so excited to see this large size available.</li>
            <li>Really the best gel for hard hold.</li>
            <li>Finally, its easy to use, just re-wet to reset and washes out easily.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s exact place all day.</li>
            <li>Real BRHG is completely clear and lightly fragranced.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It holds your hair in place for the entire day, and yet washes out easily.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a large amount of gel to achieve the effect I want.  </li>
            <li>The product is good because it sets my really thick hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee is my favorite gel for all of the reasons listed above, and the fact that I can get it in the hard-to-find 34 ounce size at such a reasonable price here on Amazon sweetens the pot even more.</li>
            <li>Anyone familiar with the actual Biosilk product knows that this stuff is THICK and wouldn&#x27;t easily pour.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When applying, it has a seemingly strong scent reminiscent of cologne, however once the hair is dry, the scent fades.</li>
            <li>It was such a positive experience that I will return to shop at CB Select just because their customer service is so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping &amp;receiving went just as expected no problems at all, the problem does not appear to be genuine as it is a different color than normal.</li>
            <li>Finally got smart and bought it online in bulk for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Obviously less excited now.</li>
            <li>LOVE Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair which takes on the shape of whatever is near it (hat hair, etc.).  </li>
            <li>It is a firm hold gel and is closely comparable to Biolage Gelee and Chi Infra Gel without the flaking of Biolage or the lack of deals available with either of those two.</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair once a week (for those of you with straight hair, you may gasp)</li>
            <li>I am an African-American with natural, unpermed hair and my texture</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft to the touch and</li>
            <li>yet it holds your style naturally.  </li>
            <li>it washes completely out.  </li>
            <li>Product they delivered has a completely different, very strong perfume and is cloudy with a slight pink tinge.  </li>
            <li>Bought the large bottle to have enough to last.  </li>
            <li>It does dry to a crunchy state, but then I just scrunch the curls and they turn soft but stay in place with no frizz.</li>
            <li>IF YOU LIKE ROCK HARD &amp; LIVE IN A HIGH WIND AREA</li>

            <li> IF YOU LIKE ROCK HARD &amp; LIVE IN A HIGH WIND AREA</li>
            <li> , it is easy to “Scrunch Out The Crunch”, giving your curls a modern, frizz-free look.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a very thick gel and not much is needed to achieve the desired amount of hold, it does not weigh the hair down or stretch out the curl pattern.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel and not gummy as other hair control products are.</li>
            <li> Large bottle, last for a long time at 1/2 the price of the small 10oz bottles.</li>
            <li> So it lasted me 1.3 years (although my hair is only about an inch long).</li>
            <li> I just wash my hair in the morning, towel dry it and add the gel creating spikes in my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Only disadvantage is that the large bottle is difficult to manage--squeezing the large bottle with one hand while holding the other hand out to catch the gel.  </li>
            <li> This product when put on my wet hair and scrunched, keeps the curl in my hair until the next time I wash it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a long time...</li>
            <li> I have long dry curly hair</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend for other to buy thissize and refill it with a samll tube.  </li>
            <li> I use this product on a daily basis and I&#x27;ve been buying the little 6 oz bottles.</li>
            <li> If you want to refresh, just wet your hands and run it through your hair....</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands, and they have all failed to have the holding power of Biosilk&#x27;s Rock Hard Gelee.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an extra firm hold, this is your product!  </li>
            <li> Just a little in your hair after shampoo, gives it fullness and body after you blow dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and finding hair gels that work is almost impossible!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only hair gel I&#x27;ve found that spikes my thin hair and keeps holding all day long.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not flake if you mess your hair</li>
            <li> On towel dried hair I put just a little product and run it through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never had a gel hold my hair as firmly as this one does.  </li>
            <li> Rain, snow, sleet, wind nor hail storm can mess up your hair after using this gel!</li>
            <li> I have tried over the years to find some product that comes even close to Biosilk&#x27;s Rock Hard Gelee.  </li>
            <li> Is difficult to find in our area.</li>
            <li> Beware of counterfeit products people. :(</li>
            <li> HATE counterfeit products.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a way to recommend a vendor, so I&#x27;ll do it here.  CB Select replaced a defective product, no questions asked, no hassle to me.  It was such a positive experience that I will return to shop at CB Select just because their customer service is so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also love this product.  I have naturally wavy hair which takes on the shape of whatever is near it (hat hair, etc.).  This product when put on my wet hair and scrunched, keeps the curl in my hair until the next time I wash it.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Been buying it at the salon for years. Finally got smart and bought it online in bulk for a fraction of the price. The product is good because it sets my really thick hair. Nothing else but wax will do that. Also, it does not flake if you mess your hair (I pull on my hair all day). Finally, its easy to use, just re-wet to reset and washes out easily.  And I&#x27;m buying another one in March 2011 (original review in Dec 2009). So it lasted me 1.3 years (although my hair is only about an inch long).</li>
            <li> I have tried over the years to find some product that comes even close to Biosilk&#x27;s Rock Hard Gelee.  After literally hundreds of dollars and bottle upon bottle of unusable gels and such, I ordered the GREAT BIG BOTTLES of this awesome stuff.  The company who carried it locally (still an hour away from my home) has gone out of business.  Thank goodness I found this on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST GEL that I&#x27;ve used (and I&#x27;ve tried MANY).  I just wash my hair in the morning, towel dry it and add the gel creating spikes in my short hair.  It lasts all day and adds a nice shine to my hair. Even my husband loves to use it as well!!</li>
            <li> The Gel is great.  Bought the large bottle to have enough to last.  Only disadvantage is that the large bottle is difficult to manage--squeezing the large bottle with one hand while holding the other hand out to catch the gel.  Would be nice with a pump.  Overall, it&#x27;s a good purchase--save $ by buying the larger size.</li>
            <li> Definitely holds well with no flaking. Perfect for short hair styles.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and finding hair gels that work is almost impossible!  Just a little in your hair after shampoo, gives it fullness and body after you blow dry.</li>
            <li> Was excited about finding this !!  Is difficult to find in our area.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for a long time...couldn&#x27;t find it around here anymore...yae for internet shopping!! I will be back to get more :)</li>
            <li> The shipping &amp;receiving went just as expected no problems at all, the problem does not appear to be genuine as it is a different color than normal.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I had the benefit of knowing exactly what I was looking for as I have used this gel for many many years. I need a gel that will hold my hair in it&#x27;s exact place all day. The company that shipped me the product also was great by delivering the product to me 5 days ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> Really the best gel for hard hold.</li>
            <li> Hands down the best hair gel ever!</li>
            <li> Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee is an integral part of the “cocktail” of ingredients I use to achieve picture perfect Type 2B/3A curls. It is a firm hold gel and is closely comparable to Biolage Gelee and Chi Infra Gel without the flaking of Biolage or the lack of deals available with either of those two. When applying, it has a seemingly strong scent reminiscent of cologne, however once the hair is dry, the scent fades. If used alone, it would probably impart quite a bit of crunch in curly hair, however when combined with a curl cream like AG Re:Coil Curl Activator or Curly Hair Solutions Curl Keeper, it is easy to “Scrunch Out The Crunch”, giving your curls a modern, frizz-free look.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a very thick gel and not much is needed to achieve the desired amount of hold, it does not weigh the hair down or stretch out the curl pattern. Also, it does not cause any build up and washes out of the hair easily. I only wash my hair once a week (for those of you with straight hair, you may gasp) yet it never dries my hair out, causes a stinky scalp nor gets stringy. It is free of glycerin so it won’t fade your color and it has no silicones so it is safe for those employing the “Curly Girl” method.&lt;br /&gt;Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee is my favorite gel for all of the reasons listed above, and the fact that I can get it in the hard-to-find 34 ounce size at such a reasonable price here on Amazon sweetens the pot even more.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Goes on clean and remains clean on your hair.  My hair is white and this product does not discolor it.  My hairstyle is spike - my hair is spiked throughout the day and I don&#x27;t have to use a large amount of gel to achieve the effect I want.  It&#x27;s a clear gel and not gummy as other hair control products are. I&#x27;m sold on this hair product.</li>
            <li> Good quality and service was quick</li>
            <li> this is the only hair gel my husband used.  He Loved it!  would definitely recommend for other to buy thissize and refill it with a samll tube.  It is more cost effective</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an extra firm hold, this is your product!  I have never had a gel hold my hair as firmly as this one does.  The hold lasts all day, even up to ~80/85% in the summertime!  I am an African-American with natural, unpermed hair and my texture is &#x27;Oprah-like&#x27; this stuff is good!</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! Can&#x27;t do my hair without it!!!</li>
            <li> IF YOU LIKE ROCK HARD &amp; LIVE IN A HIGH WIND AREA THIS HOLDS THE WHOLE ENCHILADA IN GREAT STYLE:-)</li>
            <li> Great price for a product I really love.  I was so glad to find it in a super-large size.  It&#x27;s the only hair gel I&#x27;ve found that spikes my thin hair and keeps holding all day long.</li>
            <li> Good price. Good shipping. Would buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair to help keep my frizzy curls under control. I love it! Hope the keep making it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and absolutely love it.  There is nothing on the market currently that compares.  On towel dried hair I put just a little product and run it through my hair.  In moments, it is perfect and lasts all day.  It does not dry your hair, there are no flakes from product, and it is an EXCELLENT VALUE.  It leaves your hair soft to the touch and yet it holds your style naturally.  What more could you ask for.  If you want to refresh, just wet your hands and run it through your hair....perfect!  AND when you wash your hair, there is no residue...it washes completely out.  I am a forever customer of this product and recommend it 100%  I hope they NEVER discontinue this product!!!</li>
            <li> Rain, snow, sleet, wind nor hail storm can mess up your hair after using this gel! I have tried many other brands, and they have all failed to have the holding power of Biosilk&#x27;s Rock Hard Gelee. I have been using this product for over 5 years and it has never disappointed me! It holds your hair in place for the entire day, and yet washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Love this for strong hold!</li>
            <li> Great product which leaves no residue in your hair, yet gives it body.</li>
            <li> IT IS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I have long dry curly hair and this is the only gel I have come across that keeps my curls in line.  After I wash my hair in the evening, I put some leave-in conditioner with this gel, wrap my hair with the Curlease hair towel and I wake up to the most beautiful shiny curls that are not crunchy. I get so many compliments since I&#x27;ve started using this product. And it smells quite lovely too. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This gel is great for my super curly hair. It does dry to a crunchy state, but then I just scrunch the curls and they turn soft but stay in place with no frizz. I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE Biosilk Rock Hard Gelee. HATE counterfeit products. DO NOT purchase from  BEAUTY SPOT. Product they delivered has a completely different, very strong perfume and is cloudy with a slight pink tinge.  Real BRHG is completely clear and lightly fragranced. The consistency is thinner as well, and the product easily pours from the bottle. Anyone familiar with the actual Biosilk product knows that this stuff is THICK and wouldn&#x27;t easily pour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe BRHG has been discontinued, and I was so excited to see this large size available. Obviously less excited now. Beware of counterfeit products people. :(</li>
            <li> best hair gel ever for my super curly hair.  Controls the frizz and keeps the shape without looking like my hair is crunchy.</li>
            <li> Large bottle, last for a long time at 1/2 the price of the small 10oz bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking around for just this. I use this product on a daily basis and I&#x27;ve been buying the little 6 oz bottles. Those 6 oz bottle cost anywhere from 15 to 20 dollars locally. So I decided to see what I could find on Amazon. I saw this 34 oz bottle and decided to purchase it. It&#x27;s a great price and I won&#x27;t have to purchase the 6 oz anymore. Great to be able to save money and time.</li>
            <li> She  loves this product, know that she doesn&#x27;t have to go shopping to look for it, makes me very happy, happy, happy!!!</li>
