    <ol>
            <li>I have heard a lot of good things about horse chestnut one of the ingredients in this cream.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really delighted.</li>
            <li>but I believe this is way better for my skin, and works well for me.</li>
            <li>I experienced intense pain on my temples where I rubbed in the cream.  </li>
            <li>Need to order more than one jar.</li>
            <li>Still waiting for better results</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure so would the Derma e folks as my guess is they would not like me to be a one and done customer.  </li>
            <li>I have varicose veins on my legs and my legs bruise easily.  </li>
            <li>This is well worth the money for me.</li>
            <li>Obviously I would love it to work</li>
            <li>I applied the cream just once and already the bruised feeling is gone and the bruise marks on one large place are fading.</li>
            <li>Smells yummy and is very cooling.</li>
            <li>This really does work--but you need to use it diligently.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because its too early to give 5</li>
            <li>I put it on about 4 times a day so far</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, maybe its just covering my veins up, I dont really care as long as I dont see them anymore.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 days and already notice a difference in  the tiny spider veins on my face. They appear to be much less noticeable. I&#x27;d buy this again and refer to a friend. I gave it 4 stars because its too early to give 5</li>
            <li> I got this item because of the noticeable spider veins under my eyes. So far, they are wayyyy less noticeable. This is well worth the money for me. I was about to start wearing make-up to cover the spider veins on my face but I believe this is way better for my skin, and works well for me. I put it on about 4 times a day so far, I plan to slow down once these veins disappear completely. I dont know how it works, maybe its just covering my veins up, I dont really care as long as I dont see them anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried this product.  I have heard a lot of good things about horse chestnut one of the ingredients in this cream.  However, I only used the cream once on the veins on my forehead and within hours I had to wash off the cream.  I experienced intense pain on my temples where I rubbed in the cream.  I have sensitive skin.  This product was not a good choice for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Did lighten my veins a little. Used it twice a day. Need to order more than one jar. They are little &amp; don&#x27;t last long. I ran out in like 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Still waiting for better results</li>
            <li> complete waste of money. it only irritated my skin and i saw no improvement at all. do not buy</li>
            <li> Not sure on this one. Noticed nothing in regards to spider veins, however, have not had a bruise to try it on yet</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream twice daily for approx 1 month and my red veins in my legs have Lightened up a lot but have not went away. I am still working on them.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and is very cooling.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT MEETS EXPECTATIONS</li>
            <li> This really does work--but you need to use it diligently.  No slacking.  When I use it all the time, I do notice a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have varicose veins on my legs and my legs bruise easily.  I have a bunch of dark marks on my legs and the bruises never seem to  heal.  I applied the cream just once and already the bruised feeling is gone and the bruise marks on one large place are fading. I&#x27;m really delighted.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked yet. Still using</li>
            <li> I was hoping that it will work for spider veins on legs, but I guess the formulation is designed for very tiny facial spider veins.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks and I love it. It does really well on deminishing bruises and is slowly removing the red veins on my face.</li>
            <li> The 3 stars I&#x27;m giving is based on the shipment only. I cannot give a review on product results as I&#x27;ve only been using it for not quite 3 weeks. Perhaps negativity oozes negativity but I do not expect it to help whatsoever with facial spider veins. And I do not have any information on how this is even biologically possible. Obviously I would love it to work and I&#x27;m sure so would the Derma e folks as my guess is they would not like me to be a one and done customer.  So far, the little spidery *astards look the same.</li>
            <li> Product is cheaper on vita cost.com</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it for very long but I do see a slight change.</li>
            <li> I had some bad bruises after surgery that I estimated would take a month to disappear.  They were still looking bad when my Vein creme arrived.  It has been 10 days since surgery and they are almost gone after just two applications of this Vein Creme.</li>
