            <li>so u can practice outlining with ur tattoo machine but overall its great.</li>
            <li>wow, you need so many words cool nice</li>
            <li>i am okay with the 9rs but they are not what i was expecting exactly.  </li>
            <li>your fast shipping was great my son was already using used needles on himself luckily only on himself</li>
            <li>Just wished I had the right size</li>
            <li>I bought these for my son because he does tattoos and he likes this very much.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping buy</li>
            <li>and he would recommend them all for anyone who does tattoos and he will be back to get more.</li>
            <li>I really have no complaints here !</li>
            <li>These needles are great for the smaller tattoos and even work decent on somewhat larger tattoos!</li>
            <li>i wish it had more single neddles</li>
            <li>Coverage is decent!</li>
            <li>now I gotta wait for new ones</li>
            <li>but as i am new to the arts i am still learning.  </li>
            <li>For those of you new to tattooing, take this piece of advice seriously:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the new box, ALL 50 needles were barred and dinged.</li>
            <li>sent them pictures and found out a week later that they reimbursed me(I wasn&#x27;t even aware.</li>
            <li>i ordered some before from a different seller and although these are fine i prefer to return to the other seller.  </li>
            <li>Very shady.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the deal is good, but putting out an extra $10 for quality needles at a place like Superior is way worth it rather than injuring a client, loosing future business, creating bad tattoos, and having a horrible rep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and as i said i am new, so this made it a bit harder setting up my gun.  </li>

            <li> Was very happy with these. price was very appealing as well. I will not be pay high prices anymore, these were awesome. The packaging as great as well. I have purchased the majority of my needles thru painful pleasures and the needles were twice as much and not as well packaged, causing them to open and break seal. But not with these babies!</li>
            <li> i wish it had more single neddles so u can practice outlining with ur tattoo machine but overall its great.</li>
            <li> Came as described ! üëçüèΩ</li>
            <li> Ordered 9RS and was sent 9RL. I didn&#x27;t need line needles of that size, needed the shade needles in 9R</li>
            <li> They gave me wrong size needles although they did ship fairly fast. Just wished I had the right size now I gotta wait for new ones</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son because he does tattoos and he likes this very much. Says they work well and he would recommend them all for anyone who does tattoos and he will be back to get more.</li>
            <li> Would rate less if I could. There was a recall because of contamination. So I threw them away.  Poor</li>
            <li> great item at a great price</li>
            <li> good, nice, big, awesome,cool, sweet, will make some one happy on x-mas. wow, you need so many words cool nice</li>
            <li> I liked these needles I was worried about them because they were so cheap but they have worked great and I would recommend them to anyone. They shipped quickly and the packaging was in good condition and everything seemed very sterile but I always re-sterilize my needles.</li>
            <li> your fast shipping was great my son was already using used needles on himself luckily only on himself i&#x27;m still waiting for my power supply and pedal so i can get started i&#x27;ll have some catching up to do!</li>
            <li> i am okay with the 9rs but they are not what i was expecting exactly.  i ordered some before from a different seller and although these are fine i prefer to return to the other seller.  i wish i knew before purchase how packed or spread apart the needles are but as i am new to the arts i am still learning.  also,  i am not sure if the loop that hooks to the gun and the area where the needle is tacked together should line up but some aren&#x27;t and as i said i am new, so this made it a bit harder setting up my gun.  all the other needles i have purchased seem to be in sync so i am unsure if that&#x27;s standard or not.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping buy I ordered 9rl and got 9rs</li>
            <li> I really have no complaints here ! These needles are great for the smaller tattoos and even work decent on somewhat larger tattoos! Coverage is decent! Great price and shipped fast ! All in all a great purchase! Wont be ordering these anywhere else!</li>
            <li> These are needed for tattoos and I found these for a great price on here so glad we could run across these</li>
            <li> For those of you new to tattooing, take this piece of advice seriously:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy yourself a magnifying glass and inspect EVERY needle you receive regardless of how tedious it may seem. Your clients health is at stake and so is your reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each shader needle MUST be in a perfect circle. If it is not, even by a little bit, you risk snagging the customers skin and inflicting extra pain AND poor quality tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one box of 50 9RS. All but four were barred, dinged, and in horrible condition. Even some if the packaging did not look sanitary. I complained and they sent me a new box within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the new box, ALL 50 needles were barred and dinged. Also, one of the needles was not fully constructed. Just the rod and loop, but no 9 needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent them pictures and found out a week later that they reimbursed me(I wasn&#x27;t even aware. They have poor communication with their customers and simply just didn&#x27;t write back to me at all. Very shady.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that the deal is good, but putting out an extra $10 for quality needles at a place like Superior is way worth it rather than injuring a client, loosing future business, creating bad tattoos, and having a horrible rep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INSPECT EVERY NEEDLE WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS AND MAKE SURE IT IS A PERFECT CIRCLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT settle for less.</li>
            <li> this is a great product it works great and its what i wanted will be ordering lots more in time to come</li>
            <li> Good for shadeing n color also</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift. great value</li>
