            <li> Conditioner ran out so much quicker than shampoo which I know happens frequently but was still disappointing in spite of conserving it as best I could. But overall great product. I might like Suddz better.</li>
            <li> The shampoo inside the Surface bottle was NOT Bassu. I took it to my local salon and compared it to theirs and it was a totally different shampoo. Wish I could get a refund, but lesson learned.</li>
            <li> These products are winners! The shampoo and conditioner are well worth the price. Very satisfied with my purchase and will probably order it again.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say I loved it however it was just OK. I would not buy again</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My hair was shiny, silky and bouncing and behaving!  I also thought the cost was very reasonable.</li>

            <li> Your shampoo is a watered down soap.  I just used it and it is fake I am going to request a refund for the shampoo.  Conditioner was okay but wonder if it was also a fake.</li>

            <li> My hairstylist used this and I fell in love with it.  The fragrance is clean and fresh and the product is very moisturizing.  I saved money by ordering it on Amazon.  This is a great price purchasing both at the same time.  I believe I saved over $12 from what the salon was charging.</li>
            <li> Good results and no poo ingredients</li>
