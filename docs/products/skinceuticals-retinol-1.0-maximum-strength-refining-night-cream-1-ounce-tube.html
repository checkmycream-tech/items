            <li>Great anti aging cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d sure like to try it!!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been looking for a potent retinol treatment, here it is!!  </li>
            <li>One would expect to be able to use this wonderful product without being compelled to use pliers, needles or knives.  </li>
            <li>She says that this is the best retinol product she has been able to find over the counter.  </li>
            <li>SkinCeuticals is  a good company</li>
            <li>The product itself is good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to another competitive product which works as well and the packaging is good.</li>
            <li>This product was on Dr. OZ show and I believe the doctor was giving good advice</li>
            <li>Good, improves skin texture.</li>
            <li>The research I did online said Retinol is a good product for smoother skin.</li>
            <li>My skin looks good, plus with blush, lipstick and eye makeup, I don&#x27;t think the remaining imperfections are that obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is good stuff....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had  good results from both, but I thought I would try this to see what it would do.</li>
            <li>SkinCeuticals is definitely a good brand name.</li>
            <li>Good quality products .</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>However, if you use lightly and sparingly, it is great.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was amazing and handled a refund immediately for me.</li>
            <li>Amazing product-</li>
            <li>Amazon was so nice about replacing #1...</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture, and you can put it on, wait a 1/2 hour, and then use moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a good moisturizer with it at night, I like argan oil.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a GOOD exfoliant because you&#x27;re going to need it.  </li>
            <li>This is the best OTC retinol product, and much cheaper than prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>Love to when I saw good result after 2 weeks .</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is an effective product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a SIGNIFICANT improvement in my skin texture, pore size and wrinkles!!  </li>
            <li>Great for a quick discoloration scaring spot.</li>
            <li>this one is good and  strong.  </li>
            <li>Please note this cream is very very strong.</li>
            <li>It is good on fine lines, but don&#x27;t expect miraculous results on deeper life lines.</li>
            <li>the best for staying young</li>
            <li>This is by far the best over-the-counter retinol product that I have found!  </li>
            <li>this top cream has a comparable competitor and their pumps and their product work nicely.</li>
            <li>WOW his skin looks great!</li>
            <li>If you can afford dermatologist and prescription strength they are more effective and faster.  </li>
            <li>This product is strong, so use sparingly (or you&#x27;ll end up with a peeling face)!  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for strong OTC retinol, this is it!</li>
            <li>To me that means that&#x27;s it&#x27;s working, although I&#x27;m experienced enough with the obagi system that getting &amp; keeping great skin doesn&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li>I experienced skin irritation at first, but I read skinceutical reviews that warned me about the discomfort I would experience.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever experienced anything like that before.</li>
            <li>At first I experienced some sensitivity, but got used to the product within a week.</li>
            <li>I see a huge difference in my forehead and eyes!</li>
            <li>Despite the many complaints about the pump.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.     </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>My skin looked brighter and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>I think one should reasonably expect a reputable company with a great product, that is not inexpensive, to package that product for sale in a container that does not have to be beaten against objects; pins inserted into the spray nozzle; pliers used to pry off the top; or a hacksaw used to cut off the top.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>But love the feel.</li>
            <li>many people have already complain.  </li>
            <li>Ive tried many products on the market and this one has done the trick.</li>
            <li>The pump wouldn&#x27;t work so my husband used a hammer to break the top.  </li>
            <li>Yes there can be pealing (especially when combined with chemical exfoliants), and the skin can sometimes feel sore and tender, but the over-all changes in my skin are incredible!!</li>
            <li>Investing in this product (which lasts a while, by the way) and using it every day, has been an excellent, and ultimately money-saving decision.</li>
            <li>I cut the top off with a knife just to get to it</li>
            <li>Like MANY others, the pump on my bottle didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li>ForeverBeauty was able to provide instructions on how to keep the pump flowing on this product.  </li>
            <li>but I had to break the top off to get to it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>I have tried many retinol products over the years.</li>
            <li>I have noticed many 1 star reviews but note that people are upset with the packaging.</li>
            <li>i have used this product for many years</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that skinceuticals changed the package, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now/</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using it on my face, neck, and the top part of my chest that gets some sun.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Make sure your skin is accustomed to retinol before using this strength.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>I notice a better texture to my skin tone and a softness since using it.</li>
            <li>It is more like a chemical peel than anything else.</li>
            <li>So many products out there -- this one seemed to have a lot of fans.  </li>
            <li>I have used many kinds of products containing retinol...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay retinol cream, it is not greasy and did not break me out.  </li>
            <li>I am fairly pleased.</li>
            <li>I absolutely  love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides all that, I can say my skin is in much better condition using this product than not using it.  </li>
            <li>and I will continue to use it until something better comes along...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hurry and mix with vitamin C :)</li>
            <li>Love it, and $25 cheaper than the Dr. office.  </li>
            <li>I love the &amp;#34;OIL</li>
            <li>Love SkinCeuticals products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>She said it cleared up her acne much better than the prescription she had been using.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Do not think after 1 application that this does not work and apply more.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it really works.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the nozzle and tube design.</li>
            <li>However, I must caution you...if you get this, it is potent.  </li>
            <li>Crows feet, ok, but underneath...</li>
            <li>I use this product according to the directions and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better for you to start at a lower dose.  </li>
            <li>So I would suggest a person does NOT go nutty with spreading this all over his or her face, especially as first.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside that matters although I understand others frustrations about not being able to get the product out of its container.</li>
            <li>and it is true that if you don&#x27;t buy from an authorized dealer, you are not guaranteed the product is safe and/or effective.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful stuff and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my 30s and have pretty good skin</li>
            <li>Love the product--been using for about 5 years and my skin looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Top brand, surely this could not be true.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, the complexion is refined and in my mirror I nearly lost some years;) Just an awesome product.</li>
            <li>So far this is very nice.</li>
            <li>This product was advertised on a TV program as having the best and highest concentration of retinol than any other product in its price range.  </li>
            <li>First I must say, I love this product!</li>
            <li>It mixes easily.    </li>
            <li>Easy to use -</li>
            <li>Easy to apply out of tube.  </li>
            <li>The solution is easily applicable.</li>
            <li>It is definitely strong.</li>
            <li>FYI, I&#x27;m 40 with fair skin in decent shape.</li>
            <li>I have been using 0.3% for a couple years, and the 1% is strong for me.</li>
            <li>It seems to boost the strength of the milder product without being too strong.</li>
            <li>this is strong and will make you peel</li>
            <li>For me, 1% is too strong for the eye area.  </li>
            <li>This can be a bit strong</li>
            <li>strongly recommend this production.</li>
            <li>The product does seem to be pretty effective.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, and I am noticing reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>But if you are a bargain hunter this is probably the best for less.</li>
            <li>I am using for both the benefits for acne and fine lines.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product, it does what Retinols are supposed to do, which is reverse surface wrinkles and prevent further aging (but it works slowly as most genuine, non-hyped solutions do).    </li>
            <li>its also important to exfoliate when using retinol, so I do that about twice a week.  </li>
            <li>They need to redesign and have a cheap container that works to eject all the product.</li>
            <li>for me it is a great product and I will continue to use it daily as a nighttime</li>
            <li>is Skinceuticals being cheap with their packaging.</li>
            <li>I believe this is the highest percentage readily available.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can get the same results out of a product over the counter as if it was a prescription one-makes me extremely happy.</li>
            <li>fantastic for price.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth though.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I try so many product to see how it works for me and this one really works and my skin is getting better.  </li>
            <li>year old daughter (who was using a retin A product thru a dermatologist) tried this and liked it MUCH better.  </li>
            <li>Love it as much as the line of Obagi products I used to use and loved so much.  </li>
            <li>This product does nothing more than any good facial moisturizer will do!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 43 year old AA woman with genetically good skin.</li>
            <li>again, it is super strong.  </li>
            <li>This is super strong retinol cream.</li>
            <li>I only apply it 1x/week and can&#x27;t say I notice any remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old,this product has made a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>i originally contacted amazon because i could not access the creme through  the tubing.  </li>
            <li>If you have not used a retinol product then you will have more peeling at first</li>
            <li>Made a significant difference in my four head wrinkles and worked wonders on my acne.</li>
            <li>it is well worth it!</li>
            <li>I would have liked a bigger tube with more product for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the holy grail of clean pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use anything else and no longer need to buy special makeup foundations to hide my acne &amp; scars.</li>
            <li>but I think using it slowly over time is the best way.</li>
            <li>This stuff really is full strength.</li>
            <li>What everyone is writing is 100% true about the pump.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it, many thanks</li>
            <li>It works to keep skin fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.</li>
            <li>so cannot say for sure which is responsible</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I would drive 45 minutes to the nearest spa to buy it.</li>
            <li>If you are, you&#x27;re not being reasonable nor healthy with your skin to shed/change/transform.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read where some people like the .5% because it&#x27;s not as strong, but I think I can handle the higher dose 2x per week.</li>
            <li>Love the new packaging!  </li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>I feel lucky to get the recommended pea-size amount after 10 pumps.  </li>
            <li>I have always had un even skin tone mild acne.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do what I did and jump in too quickly.</li>
            <li>You see results quickly.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t expect a quick fix with this product.</li>
            <li>I have used different over the counter Retinol products and this Skinceuticals product is by far the absolute best.  </li>
            <li>no negative side effects so I immediately was able to use nightly with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Super strong, really smooths out wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The texture is very soft, smooth, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So much better than the old pump!</li>
            <li>True retinol works slowly, but surely with good results.</li>
            <li>It has helped reduce the fine lines, I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the deeper wrinkles</li>
            <li>This really clears my skin and help with the light scars, making a smoother even skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.   </li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on how clear my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>This product, however, is a keeper and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many retinol products over the years but this one far exceeds them.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the problem for the results, and</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am able to use this product.</li>
            <li>use)&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasts a long time so the price is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>Indeed do not use more frequently than once a week.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed gel-like consistency.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for fine lines on the forehead and smile lines on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Cleans you right up.</li>
            <li>They were right.  </li>
            <li>This product is very strong and made my skin red and peeling.   </li>
            <li>It may be too strong for some with sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m looking for a product that works and</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received didn&#x27;t pump, but the supplier said SkinCeuticals was familiar with the problem, and I was sent a new bottle upon return of the defective one.  </li>
            <li>I have returned multiple bottles due to defective pumps, but keep buying more/replacing it with a new bottle because when you can get the product out of the bottle, it works great!  </li>
            <li>I understand that retinols must be kept in a certain type of container or their effectiveness is destroyed - but the pump is iffy at best and does mean that you have to shred it open to get the full product out of the container.  </li>
            <li>In the beginning, it did exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>Most think I&#x27;m 10 years younger.</li>
            <li>After getting through the first stage I started to see the benefits.</li>
            <li>The first time, the pump did not work properly, but I was able to eventually get the lotion to dispense, although with effort.  </li>
            <li>I like the product but causes your skin to flake when first using it.</li>
            <li>I broke out at first, but I am also doing IPL treatments, which might be why I broke out.    </li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t pump out you can&#x27;t open the top and get to the cream.</li>
            <li>Very offending!  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works at peeling skin!  </li>
            <li>I also use it on the top of my hands and my upper chest.  </li>
            <li>The process the dr. gave me is to use it each night for the first two nights.</li>
            <li>The pores across my cheeks appear smaller and my skin is smoother and more even.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my 3rd SkinCeauticals product and is my favorite.</li>
            <li>start with the .5 first..</li>
            <li>My skin looks clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The first night I attempted to use the cream, I could not get any product out of the container.</li>
            <li>First and foremost, DO NOT start off with the 1%.  </li>
            <li>, you&#x27;re going to burn your face up, which isn&#x27;t pretty for anyone.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My first purchase from the salon</li>
            <li>Very string!</li>
            <li>For those using any retinol based product ..... this product should be used sparingly for the first two weeks, then every night for 4 nights in a row, three nights off.  </li>
            <li>You MUST use it consistently and experience the peeling.  </li>
            <li>With the tube, I feel better control on daily use and more ability to get that last drop.</li>
            <li>However, there was a tingling sensation first time usage</li>
            <li>Your skin will be irritated at first and lotion may seem to sting.</li>
            <li>Next morning, my skin was okay.</li>
            <li>it is strong, so one has to use a moisturizing product either over it (after waiting 30 minutes for the retinol to be absorbed) or the next day.  </li>
            <li>It is true that you need to go easy with this product, at first, otherwise you will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn sunscreen for 20 years pretty consistently but have some sun spots, plus marks from acne and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love this stuff, it&#x27;s the only thing that will slough off the dead stuff revealing nice smooth soft skin below!  </li>
            <li>Did I really end up with two lemons or more likely,</li>
            <li>Fifty-five years old and my first time using a full strengh retinol.</li>
            <li>Not fake or wannabe retinol, the real deal here.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is supposed to happen, so maybe 3 stars isn&#x27;t fair.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk, you are tossing money down the drain.</li>
            <li>This IS a strong treatment, and I would imagine is designated only for resilient skin which has been conditioned for hard-core retinol treatments.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one to cure the acen for long time, it is the only one I can tell the difference on my face.</li>
            <li>also, as I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have mentioned, don&#x27;t use it every night at first, as,</li>
            <li>but that I should try running it under warm water, turning it upside down and banging it on the floor!</li>
            <li>I did this for about 2 months, as well as microdermabrasion, until I was ready for my Glycolic peel.    </li>
            <li>I have a whole regimen that I follow</li>
            <li>The retinol 1.0 works really well, but the pump is a clunker that the company needs to change immediately.  </li>
            <li>and I find this much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal.</li>
            <li>There really ought to be a zero rating.</li>
            <li>fast service.</li>
            <li>I had researched Retinol products and by all accounts SkinSeuticals Retinol 1.0 was a very favorable product.</li>
            <li>soft and fresh skin is revealed.  </li>
            <li>I like this product so much</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have the time to try and return it and go through that whole process.  </li>
            <li>I really want to keep using it, so I contacted customer service on the Skinceuticals website to tell them about my experiences and ask if they were revamping the product dispenser.  </li>
            <li>however the manufacturer says it should be pumped gently which I do</li>
            <li>it was gentle and no irritation like some products.  </li>
            <li>I went to the derm to ask about retin-A, as I have gotten as much as I thought I could get from OTC products.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the 1% lightly once every 3rd day</li>
            <li>It really did not do a thing</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my sun damage</li>
            <li>I really do like this.</li>
            <li>They shipped in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend both the product and seller!</li>
            <li>Really works.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much.  </li>
            <li>I paid so much at one time going to a dermatologist she gave me a retinol product which was stonger than this but cost way to much.  </li>
            <li>but she would say things like is too much peeling and burning and blah blah.</li>
            <li>At that price, am I really supposed to shrug my shoulders when they set it up so that I have to throw some of it away?</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li>it works very well.</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>anyway my face seems to be adjusting to the retinol because its not peeling as much .</li>
            <li>Maximum Strength works very well.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you will have a really sore, itchy face.  </li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>This product works really well with the CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference to my skin with this product.</li>
            <li>But still a good product in the tube it loses it freshness quicker.</li>
            <li>I will not buy from this company again as I am not certain I will be able to use the product.  </li>
            <li>I only apply the 1% once a week as this is very powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>Having extremely oily skin, I used many AHA/ BHA products.</li>
            <li>it is very strong and if you start out using it everyday you will peel and skin</li>
            <li>It appears that my skin tone is a little better and a large wrinkle across my forehead seems to be reduced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 and used to have oily, tough skin, but now it&#x27;s much drier, and I do have some wrinkles, but always use good sunscreen living in FL.</li>
            <li>I read many customer reviews and one typical comment</li>
            <li>careful with this product, it&#x27;s strong, but it works</li>
            <li>I switched to Skin Medica&#x27;s Tri Retinol Complex and love it!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product along with A.G.E for the eyes.</li>
            <li>Though this product may well be one of the best over-the-counter retinol products available, this one comes in a small, metal pump bottle; so even if the pump worked - which it didn&#x27;t - there would certainly be at least a few day&#x27;s worth of cream</li>
            <li>stop using it for the recommended time before I have a facial or brow waxing - this is very important, so always check with your skin care professional before any facial treatment.</li>
            <li>I have to use it every other day because it is so strong</li>
            <li>It works fast if you need clear skin asap.</li>
            <li>This worked really well on my adult acne skin...</li>
            <li>While using the retinol, I rarely use foundation unless I just want that extra &amp;#34;oompH&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>is this normal?</li>
            <li>It really works, I am happy thus far, cannot use it everyday as your skin takes some time to get use to it, there is some peeling and slight burning</li>
            <li>This, along with the fact that many others have been complaining of the same problem for a long period of time leads me to believe that they don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li>I feel that it has help prevent fine lines, I am 72 and have very few fine lines &amp; wrinkles; because of that people who don&#x27;t know my age think I am younger.</li>
            <li>Future consumers make sure your skin has been tempered with less  intense retinol formulas...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a skin-care fanatic and have used may good products recommended by professionals such as Paula Begoun, the Cosmetics Cop.</li>
            <li>Just smooth, clear, pink skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li>Also, makes your skin very sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I love the fresh new look of the new skin, and if I have to feel a little ugly before I finally feel beautiful again, then so be it.  </li>
            <li>while I don&#x27;t let my skin age enough to get the dramatic results anymore, I still see that it keeps my skin young and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I came across this past review of mine, not realizing that Skinceuticals had changed its packaging--which I have been enjoying, along with this product.</li>
            <li>I have only used this for a week, but noticed no redness, flaking or sensitivity, and I have used it 4 times the first week,</li>
            <li>even though it is only 1% retinol, it worked better for me than two other products that were 2% retinol.  </li>
            <li>More is not better in this Product.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m at the end of the first week (day 9) and my skin is starting to adjust.</li>
            <li>am not sure why all the reviews say it&#x27;s extremely potent and to use with caution.  </li>
            <li>and wow, did I peel!  </li>
            <li>I have been using retinol products for several years now but this is better than all the other over the counter items that contain retinol.</li>
            <li>and I used it pretty much daily.</li>
            <li>No redness, no irritation, no excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and still don&#x27;t have wrinkles, either!</li>
            <li>After all, you&#x27;re supposed to shed the old skin before the new skin surfaces.</li>
            <li>I have had some slight peeling the day after using at night, but that&#x27;s part of what it should do to help create smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Its not the hard to pry off the top though.</li>
            <li>Like it so far.  </li>
            <li>Came with a completely non functioning pump.</li>
            <li>Still though, I had somewhat \\&quot;congested skin\\&quot; as far as clogged pores that those treatments could not fix.</li>
            <li>also, no problem with the pump, I really like it, actually.</li>
            <li>Skinceuticals 1% retinol makes my pores look much smaller and my skin looks much smoother and nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>You will notice layers of old skin coming off within a week.  </li>
            <li>So I was a bit surprised.</li>
            <li>and I have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li>My skin is markedly softer too.  </li>
            <li>54 yrs old suffer</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use a 1% strength.  </li>
            <li>I have already purchased my 3rd tube and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Seems to start working and is quite soft on the skin, not as irritant as these products could be.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles across my neck and next to my mouth are practically invisible, and the ones across my neck were really pronounced.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for peeling action, since that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been reading about</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of going directly to the 1.0</li>
            <li>This is early, and I will update as I use it.</li>
            <li>I have not had any problems with the product so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as this provider.</li>
            <li>now up to the 1.0 makes skin  soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a difference in my 54 year old skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Probably defective because it was old product????</li>
            <li>After 5 weeks my sundamages are completely.</li>
            <li>Stay away from anywhere near your eyes.  </li>
            <li>No wasted product.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working to tighten, but too early to see results just yet.</li>
            <li>I use this product when I get back to Oregon and out of the intense sun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;And now for this order, since I didn&#x27;t want to revert to going to a doctor to refill the tretinoin prescription, which was about $95, I researched for a natural alternative and came across this product.</li>
            <li>Next morning, I woke with really nothing noticeable.</li>
            <li>I pump once onto each fingertip on my left hand and then place my right fingertips on my left and mix them.</li>
            <li>I used a full 1/4 inch dot and used less of the obagi blender.</li>
            <li>and my face does look  better after serious moisturizing in between uses.</li>
            <li>My skin glows with an even tone, the fines lines are even more subtle.</li>
            <li>It has been said that your daily skin care routine is far more important than any micoderm treatments, facials or chemical peals (which are expensive and have only short-term results).</li>
            <li>Use sparingly, especially when first starting.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I first bought it because it appeared there was something wrong with the pump -</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li>Been using a .5 for a long time, I really do see the diff in this.</li>
            <li>I did start with a new Wexler night cream at the same time</li>
            <li>I should have listened to other reviews that said use the .5 strength first .</li>
            <li>My skin simply glows and is very smooth and subtle.</li>
            <li>It really works and I hae seen dramatic results quickly!</li>
            <li>A little burning when putting on moisturizer but beauty is worth the pain.</li>
            <li>So my skin generally doesn&#x27;t exhibit irritation to this strength.  </li>
            <li>The only stuff that ever keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>And just to be clear, I&#x27;ve only applied this at night before sleep and washed off in the morning.</li>
            <li>Be careful though, it really will burn your skin if you aren&#x27;t used to it.</li>
            <li>left at the bottom of the bottle which you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to because the pump - which didn&#x27;t work - doesn&#x27;t come off of the bottle; and this stuff is too expensive to leave even one pea-sized drop - which happens to be exactly the amount the directions say to use daily.  </li>
            <li>but apparently they like having their product returned unused.  </li>
            <li>The dispenser pump barely works.</li>
            <li>It acts like there&#x27;s barely any lotion in it.</li>
            <li>I expected so much judging from these reviews.  </li>
            <li>The reality of Retinols is that, when in working strength, they are somewhat irritating to virgin skin and they can cause peeling if the strength/frequency of use is more than your skin has built up a tolerance to.  </li>
            <li>With this higher strength, however, you need to use other lotion or alternate use from night to night.</li>
            <li>The actual product is high quality, and I definitely notice a difference when using retinol on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>But other than that I&#x27;m really liking it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth paying a little extra.</li>
            <li>First, I want to start by acknowledging the pump is a little temperamental.</li>
            <li>She said to just use a very gentle cleanser and a heavy moisturizer while that happens.</li>
            <li>After reading about people peeling, flaking after using this product (which meant to me that it contained some power to remove the dead skin), I hoped this product was potent enough to remove the dead skin cells on me.</li>
            <li>I use this every other night or so mixed into my regular moisturizer and it really does increase cell turnover.</li>
            <li>it was used, not new, and completely used up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Too much your face will be a peely mess.  </li>
            <li>It continues to remove the dead skin from my face to show off a smooth and less noticeable wrinkle around my jawline.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s helped keep crows feet away, and kept my fine lines under my eyes from getting worse</li>
            <li>The 1% is a little much for my skin and makes me peel every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that there was only this little tiny bit of product for that much money.  </li>
            <li>However, if the product cannot be used it is as good as being a bad product.</li>

            <li> Should have purchased the .5% but think it is a great product and doing the job it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Works great for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great  product.</li>
            <li> Great thing is retinol helps with wrinkles as well.  </li>
            <li> So for over the counter this is a great product, you must stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bottle this product shows in the picture was great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am so happy to have found this product.</li>
            <li> great.</li>
            <li> Works great as a starter retinol.</li>
            <li> I was extremely happy about the results and the strengh of the product.  </li>
            <li> Great anti aging cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d sure like to try it!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking for a potent retinol treatment, here it is!!  </li>
            <li> One would expect to be able to use this wonderful product without being compelled to use pliers, needles or knives.  </li>
            <li> She says that this is the best retinol product she has been able to find over the counter.  </li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals is  a good company</li>
            <li> The product itself is good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to another competitive product which works as well and the packaging is good.</li>
            <li> This product was on Dr. OZ show and I believe the doctor was giving good advice</li>
            <li> Good, improves skin texture.</li>
            <li> The research I did online said Retinol is a good product for smoother skin.</li>
            <li> My skin looks good, plus with blush, lipstick and eye makeup, I don&#x27;t think the remaining imperfections are that obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is good stuff....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had  good results from both, but I thought I would try this to see what it would do.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals is definitely a good brand name.</li>
            <li> Good quality products .</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> However, if you use lightly and sparingly, it is great.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was amazing and handled a refund immediately for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product-</li>
            <li> Amazon was so nice about replacing #1...</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture, and you can put it on, wait a 1/2 hour, and then use moisturizer over it.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use a good moisturizer with it at night, I like argan oil.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a GOOD exfoliant because you&#x27;re going to need it.  </li>
            <li> This is the best OTC retinol product, and much cheaper than prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> Love to when I saw good result after 2 weeks .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is an effective product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen a SIGNIFICANT improvement in my skin texture, pore size and wrinkles!!  </li>
            <li> Great for a quick discoloration scaring spot.</li>
            <li> this one is good and  strong.  </li>
            <li> Please note this cream is very very strong.</li>
            <li> It is good on fine lines, but don&#x27;t expect miraculous results on deeper life lines.</li>
            <li> the best for staying young</li>
            <li> This is by far the best over-the-counter retinol product that I have found!  </li>
            <li> this top cream has a comparable competitor and their pumps and their product work nicely.</li>
            <li> WOW his skin looks great!</li>
            <li> If you can afford dermatologist and prescription strength they are more effective and faster.  </li>
            <li> This product is strong, so use sparingly (or you&#x27;ll end up with a peeling face)!  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for strong OTC retinol, this is it!</li>
            <li> To me that means that&#x27;s it&#x27;s working, although I&#x27;m experienced enough with the obagi system that getting &amp; keeping great skin doesn&#x27;t happen over night.</li>
            <li> I experienced skin irritation at first, but I read skinceutical reviews that warned me about the discomfort I would experience.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever experienced anything like that before.</li>
            <li> At first I experienced some sensitivity, but got used to the product within a week.</li>
            <li> I see a huge difference in my forehead and eyes!</li>
            <li> Despite the many complaints about the pump.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.     </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin looked brighter and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I think one should reasonably expect a reputable company with a great product, that is not inexpensive, to package that product for sale in a container that does not have to be beaten against objects; pins inserted into the spray nozzle; pliers used to pry off the top; or a hacksaw used to cut off the top.  </li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> But love the feel.</li>
            <li> many people have already complain.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried many products on the market and this one has done the trick.</li>
            <li> The pump wouldn&#x27;t work so my husband used a hammer to break the top.  </li>
            <li> Yes there can be pealing (especially when combined with chemical exfoliants), and the skin can sometimes feel sore and tender, but the over-all changes in my skin are incredible!!</li>
            <li> Investing in this product (which lasts a while, by the way) and using it every day, has been an excellent, and ultimately money-saving decision.</li>
            <li> I cut the top off with a knife just to get to it</li>
            <li> Like MANY others, the pump on my bottle didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> ForeverBeauty was able to provide instructions on how to keep the pump flowing on this product.  </li>
            <li> but I had to break the top off to get to it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I have tried many retinol products over the years.</li>
            <li> I have noticed many 1 star reviews but note that people are upset with the packaging.</li>
            <li> i have used this product for many years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that skinceuticals changed the package, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now/</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m using it on my face, neck, and the top part of my chest that gets some sun.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Make sure your skin is accustomed to retinol before using this strength.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> I notice a better texture to my skin tone and a softness since using it.</li>
            <li> It is more like a chemical peel than anything else.</li>
            <li> So many products out there -- this one seemed to have a lot of fans.  </li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of products containing retinol...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay retinol cream, it is not greasy and did not break me out.  </li>
            <li> I am fairly pleased.</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides all that, I can say my skin is in much better condition using this product than not using it.  </li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it until something better comes along...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hurry and mix with vitamin C :)</li>
            <li> Love it, and $25 cheaper than the Dr. office.  </li>
            <li> I love the &amp;#34;OIL</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> She said it cleared up her acne much better than the prescription she had been using.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Do not think after 1 application that this does not work and apply more.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it really works.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the nozzle and tube design.</li>
            <li> However, I must caution you...if you get this, it is potent.  </li>
            <li> Crows feet, ok, but underneath...</li>
            <li> I use this product according to the directions and I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better for you to start at a lower dose.  </li>
            <li> So I would suggest a person does NOT go nutty with spreading this all over his or her face, especially as first.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside that matters although I understand others frustrations about not being able to get the product out of its container.</li>
            <li> and it is true that if you don&#x27;t buy from an authorized dealer, you are not guaranteed the product is safe and/or effective.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful stuff and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 30s and have pretty good skin</li>
            <li> Love the product--been using for about 5 years and my skin looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Top brand, surely this could not be true.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, the complexion is refined and in my mirror I nearly lost some years;) Just an awesome product.</li>
            <li> So far this is very nice.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised on a TV program as having the best and highest concentration of retinol than any other product in its price range.  </li>
            <li> First I must say, I love this product!</li>
            <li> It mixes easily.    </li>
            <li> Easy to use -</li>
            <li> Easy to apply out of tube.  </li>
            <li> The solution is easily applicable.</li>
            <li> It is definitely strong.</li>
            <li> FYI, I&#x27;m 40 with fair skin in decent shape.</li>
            <li> I have been using 0.3% for a couple years, and the 1% is strong for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to boost the strength of the milder product without being too strong.</li>
            <li> this is strong and will make you peel</li>
            <li> For me, 1% is too strong for the eye area.  </li>
            <li> This can be a bit strong</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this production.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to be pretty effective.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, and I am noticing reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> But if you are a bargain hunter this is probably the best for less.</li>
            <li> I am using for both the benefits for acne and fine lines.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good product, it does what Retinols are supposed to do, which is reverse surface wrinkles and prevent further aging (but it works slowly as most genuine, non-hyped solutions do).    </li>
            <li> its also important to exfoliate when using retinol, so I do that about twice a week.  </li>
            <li> They need to redesign and have a cheap container that works to eject all the product.</li>
            <li> for me it is a great product and I will continue to use it daily as a nighttime</li>
            <li> is Skinceuticals being cheap with their packaging.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the highest percentage readily available.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can get the same results out of a product over the counter as if it was a prescription one-makes me extremely happy.</li>
            <li> fantastic for price.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth though.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I try so many product to see how it works for me and this one really works and my skin is getting better.  </li>
            <li> year old daughter (who was using a retin A product thru a dermatologist) tried this and liked it MUCH better.  </li>
            <li> Love it as much as the line of Obagi products I used to use and loved so much.  </li>
            <li> This product does nothing more than any good facial moisturizer will do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old AA woman with genetically good skin.</li>
            <li> again, it is super strong.  </li>
            <li> This is super strong retinol cream.</li>
            <li> I only apply it 1x/week and can&#x27;t say I notice any remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old,this product has made a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> i originally contacted amazon because i could not access the creme through  the tubing.  </li>
            <li> If you have not used a retinol product then you will have more peeling at first</li>
            <li> Made a significant difference in my four head wrinkles and worked wonders on my acne.</li>
            <li> it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> I would have liked a bigger tube with more product for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the holy grail of clean pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use anything else and no longer need to buy special makeup foundations to hide my acne &amp; scars.</li>
            <li> but I think using it slowly over time is the best way.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is full strength.</li>
            <li> What everyone is writing is 100% true about the pump.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it, many thanks</li>
            <li> It works to keep skin fresh and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.</li>
            <li> so cannot say for sure which is responsible</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I would drive 45 minutes to the nearest spa to buy it.</li>
            <li> If you are, you&#x27;re not being reasonable nor healthy with your skin to shed/change/transform.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read where some people like the .5% because it&#x27;s not as strong, but I think I can handle the higher dose 2x per week.</li>
            <li> Love the new packaging!  </li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> I feel lucky to get the recommended pea-size amount after 10 pumps.  </li>
            <li> I have always had un even skin tone mild acne.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do what I did and jump in too quickly.</li>
            <li> You see results quickly.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect a quick fix with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used different over the counter Retinol products and this Skinceuticals product is by far the absolute best.  </li>
            <li> no negative side effects so I immediately was able to use nightly with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Super strong, really smooths out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The texture is very soft, smooth, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So much better than the old pump!</li>
            <li> True retinol works slowly, but surely with good results.</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce the fine lines, I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the deeper wrinkles</li>
            <li> This really clears my skin and help with the light scars, making a smoother even skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.   </li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on how clear my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> This product, however, is a keeper and well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many retinol products over the years but this one far exceeds them.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the problem for the results, and</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am able to use this product.</li>
            <li> use)&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasts a long time so the price is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> Indeed do not use more frequently than once a week.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed gel-like consistency.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for fine lines on the forehead and smile lines on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Cleans you right up.</li>
            <li> They were right.  </li>
            <li> This product is very strong and made my skin red and peeling.   </li>
            <li> It may be too strong for some with sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m looking for a product that works and</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received didn&#x27;t pump, but the supplier said SkinCeuticals was familiar with the problem, and I was sent a new bottle upon return of the defective one.  </li>
            <li> I have returned multiple bottles due to defective pumps, but keep buying more/replacing it with a new bottle because when you can get the product out of the bottle, it works great!  </li>
            <li> I understand that retinols must be kept in a certain type of container or their effectiveness is destroyed - but the pump is iffy at best and does mean that you have to shred it open to get the full product out of the container.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning, it did exactly what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Most think I&#x27;m 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> After getting through the first stage I started to see the benefits.</li>
            <li> The first time, the pump did not work properly, but I was able to eventually get the lotion to dispense, although with effort.  </li>
            <li> I like the product but causes your skin to flake when first using it.</li>
            <li> I broke out at first, but I am also doing IPL treatments, which might be why I broke out.    </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t pump out you can&#x27;t open the top and get to the cream.</li>
            <li> Very offending!  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works at peeling skin!  </li>
            <li> I also use it on the top of my hands and my upper chest.  </li>
            <li> The process the dr. gave me is to use it each night for the first two nights.</li>
            <li> The pores across my cheeks appear smaller and my skin is smoother and more even.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my 3rd SkinCeauticals product and is my favorite.</li>
            <li> start with the .5 first..</li>
            <li> My skin looks clear and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The first night I attempted to use the cream, I could not get any product out of the container.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, DO NOT start off with the 1%.  </li>
            <li> , you&#x27;re going to burn your face up, which isn&#x27;t pretty for anyone.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My first purchase from the salon</li>
            <li> Very string!</li>
            <li> For those using any retinol based product ..... this product should be used sparingly for the first two weeks, then every night for 4 nights in a row, three nights off.  </li>
            <li> You MUST use it consistently and experience the peeling.  </li>
            <li> With the tube, I feel better control on daily use and more ability to get that last drop.</li>
            <li> However, there was a tingling sensation first time usage</li>
            <li> Your skin will be irritated at first and lotion may seem to sting.</li>
            <li> Next morning, my skin was okay.</li>
            <li> it is strong, so one has to use a moisturizing product either over it (after waiting 30 minutes for the retinol to be absorbed) or the next day.  </li>
            <li> It is true that you need to go easy with this product, at first, otherwise you will dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn sunscreen for 20 years pretty consistently but have some sun spots, plus marks from acne and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do love this stuff, it&#x27;s the only thing that will slough off the dead stuff revealing nice smooth soft skin below!  </li>
            <li> Did I really end up with two lemons or more likely,</li>
            <li> Fifty-five years old and my first time using a full strengh retinol.</li>
            <li> Not fake or wannabe retinol, the real deal here.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is supposed to happen, so maybe 3 stars isn&#x27;t fair.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk, you are tossing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> This IS a strong treatment, and I would imagine is designated only for resilient skin which has been conditioned for hard-core retinol treatments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one to cure the acen for long time, it is the only one I can tell the difference on my face.</li>
            <li> also, as I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have mentioned, don&#x27;t use it every night at first, as,</li>
            <li> but that I should try running it under warm water, turning it upside down and banging it on the floor!</li>
            <li> I did this for about 2 months, as well as microdermabrasion, until I was ready for my Glycolic peel.    </li>
            <li> I have a whole regimen that I follow</li>
            <li> The retinol 1.0 works really well, but the pump is a clunker that the company needs to change immediately.  </li>
            <li> and I find this much easier on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal.</li>
            <li> There really ought to be a zero rating.</li>
            <li> fast service.</li>
            <li> I had researched Retinol products and by all accounts SkinSeuticals Retinol 1.0 was a very favorable product.</li>
            <li> soft and fresh skin is revealed.  </li>
            <li> I like this product so much</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have the time to try and return it and go through that whole process.  </li>
            <li> I really want to keep using it, so I contacted customer service on the Skinceuticals website to tell them about my experiences and ask if they were revamping the product dispenser.  </li>
            <li> however the manufacturer says it should be pumped gently which I do</li>
            <li> it was gentle and no irritation like some products.  </li>
            <li> I went to the derm to ask about retin-A, as I have gotten as much as I thought I could get from OTC products.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the 1% lightly once every 3rd day</li>
            <li> It really did not do a thing</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my sun damage</li>
            <li> I really do like this.</li>
            <li> They shipped in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend both the product and seller!</li>
            <li> Really works.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much.  </li>
            <li> I paid so much at one time going to a dermatologist she gave me a retinol product which was stonger than this but cost way to much.  </li>
            <li> but she would say things like is too much peeling and burning and blah blah.</li>
            <li> At that price, am I really supposed to shrug my shoulders when they set it up so that I have to throw some of it away?</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li> it works very well.</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> anyway my face seems to be adjusting to the retinol because its not peeling as much .</li>
            <li> Maximum Strength works very well.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you will have a really sore, itchy face.  </li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> This product works really well with the CE Ferulic.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference to my skin with this product.</li>
            <li> But still a good product in the tube it loses it freshness quicker.</li>
            <li> I will not buy from this company again as I am not certain I will be able to use the product.  </li>
            <li> I only apply the 1% once a week as this is very powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> Having extremely oily skin, I used many AHA/ BHA products.</li>
            <li> it is very strong and if you start out using it everyday you will peel and skin</li>
            <li> It appears that my skin tone is a little better and a large wrinkle across my forehead seems to be reduced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and used to have oily, tough skin, but now it&#x27;s much drier, and I do have some wrinkles, but always use good sunscreen living in FL.</li>
            <li> I read many customer reviews and one typical comment</li>
            <li> careful with this product, it&#x27;s strong, but it works</li>
            <li> I switched to Skin Medica&#x27;s Tri Retinol Complex and love it!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product along with A.G.E for the eyes.</li>
            <li> Though this product may well be one of the best over-the-counter retinol products available, this one comes in a small, metal pump bottle; so even if the pump worked - which it didn&#x27;t - there would certainly be at least a few day&#x27;s worth of cream</li>
            <li> stop using it for the recommended time before I have a facial or brow waxing - this is very important, so always check with your skin care professional before any facial treatment.</li>
            <li> I have to use it every other day because it is so strong</li>
            <li> It works fast if you need clear skin asap.</li>
            <li> This worked really well on my adult acne skin...</li>
            <li> While using the retinol, I rarely use foundation unless I just want that extra &amp;#34;oompH&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> is this normal?</li>
            <li> It really works, I am happy thus far, cannot use it everyday as your skin takes some time to get use to it, there is some peeling and slight burning</li>
            <li> This, along with the fact that many others have been complaining of the same problem for a long period of time leads me to believe that they don&#x27;t care!</li>
            <li> I feel that it has help prevent fine lines, I am 72 and have very few fine lines &amp; wrinkles; because of that people who don&#x27;t know my age think I am younger.</li>
            <li> Future consumers make sure your skin has been tempered with less  intense retinol formulas...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a skin-care fanatic and have used may good products recommended by professionals such as Paula Begoun, the Cosmetics Cop.</li>
            <li> Just smooth, clear, pink skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Also, makes your skin very sensitive to the sun</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I love the fresh new look of the new skin, and if I have to feel a little ugly before I finally feel beautiful again, then so be it.  </li>
            <li> while I don&#x27;t let my skin age enough to get the dramatic results anymore, I still see that it keeps my skin young and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I came across this past review of mine, not realizing that Skinceuticals had changed its packaging--which I have been enjoying, along with this product.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week, but noticed no redness, flaking or sensitivity, and I have used it 4 times the first week,</li>
            <li> even though it is only 1% retinol, it worked better for me than two other products that were 2% retinol.  </li>
            <li> More is not better in this Product.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m at the end of the first week (day 9) and my skin is starting to adjust.</li>
            <li> am not sure why all the reviews say it&#x27;s extremely potent and to use with caution.  </li>
            <li> and wow, did I peel!  </li>
            <li> I have been using retinol products for several years now but this is better than all the other over the counter items that contain retinol.</li>
            <li> and I used it pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> No redness, no irritation, no excessive dryness.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and still don&#x27;t have wrinkles, either!</li>
            <li> After all, you&#x27;re supposed to shed the old skin before the new skin surfaces.</li>
            <li> I have had some slight peeling the day after using at night, but that&#x27;s part of what it should do to help create smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Its not the hard to pry off the top though.</li>
            <li> Like it so far.  </li>
            <li> Came with a completely non functioning pump.</li>
            <li> Still though, I had somewhat \\&quot;congested skin\\&quot; as far as clogged pores that those treatments could not fix.</li>
            <li> also, no problem with the pump, I really like it, actually.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals 1% retinol makes my pores look much smaller and my skin looks much smoother and nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> You will notice layers of old skin coming off within a week.  </li>
            <li> So I was a bit surprised.</li>
            <li> and I have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> My skin is markedly softer too.  </li>
            <li> 54 yrs old suffer</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use a 1% strength.  </li>
            <li> I have already purchased my 3rd tube and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to start working and is quite soft on the skin, not as irritant as these products could be.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles across my neck and next to my mouth are practically invisible, and the ones across my neck were really pronounced.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for peeling action, since that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been reading about</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of going directly to the 1.0</li>
            <li> This is early, and I will update as I use it.</li>
            <li> I have not had any problems with the product so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as this provider.</li>
            <li> now up to the 1.0 makes skin  soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in my 54 year old skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Probably defective because it was old product????</li>
            <li> After 5 weeks my sundamages are completely.</li>
            <li> Stay away from anywhere near your eyes.  </li>
            <li> No wasted product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working to tighten, but too early to see results just yet.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I get back to Oregon and out of the intense sun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And now for this order, since I didn&#x27;t want to revert to going to a doctor to refill the tretinoin prescription, which was about $95, I researched for a natural alternative and came across this product.</li>
            <li> Next morning, I woke with really nothing noticeable.</li>
            <li> I pump once onto each fingertip on my left hand and then place my right fingertips on my left and mix them.</li>
            <li> I used a full 1/4 inch dot and used less of the obagi blender.</li>
            <li> and my face does look  better after serious moisturizing in between uses.</li>
            <li> My skin glows with an even tone, the fines lines are even more subtle.</li>
            <li> It has been said that your daily skin care routine is far more important than any micoderm treatments, facials or chemical peals (which are expensive and have only short-term results).</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, especially when first starting.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I first bought it because it appeared there was something wrong with the pump -</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.  </li>
            <li> Been using a .5 for a long time, I really do see the diff in this.</li>
            <li> I did start with a new Wexler night cream at the same time</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviews that said use the .5 strength first .</li>
            <li> My skin simply glows and is very smooth and subtle.</li>
            <li> It really works and I hae seen dramatic results quickly!</li>
            <li> A little burning when putting on moisturizer but beauty is worth the pain.</li>
            <li> So my skin generally doesn&#x27;t exhibit irritation to this strength.  </li>
            <li> The only stuff that ever keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> And just to be clear, I&#x27;ve only applied this at night before sleep and washed off in the morning.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, it really will burn your skin if you aren&#x27;t used to it.</li>
            <li> left at the bottom of the bottle which you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to because the pump - which didn&#x27;t work - doesn&#x27;t come off of the bottle; and this stuff is too expensive to leave even one pea-sized drop - which happens to be exactly the amount the directions say to use daily.  </li>
            <li> but apparently they like having their product returned unused.  </li>
            <li> The dispenser pump barely works.</li>
            <li> It acts like there&#x27;s barely any lotion in it.</li>
            <li> I expected so much judging from these reviews.  </li>
            <li> The reality of Retinols is that, when in working strength, they are somewhat irritating to virgin skin and they can cause peeling if the strength/frequency of use is more than your skin has built up a tolerance to.  </li>
            <li> With this higher strength, however, you need to use other lotion or alternate use from night to night.</li>
            <li> The actual product is high quality, and I definitely notice a difference when using retinol on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> But other than that I&#x27;m really liking it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth paying a little extra.</li>
            <li> First, I want to start by acknowledging the pump is a little temperamental.</li>
            <li> She said to just use a very gentle cleanser and a heavy moisturizer while that happens.</li>
            <li> After reading about people peeling, flaking after using this product (which meant to me that it contained some power to remove the dead skin), I hoped this product was potent enough to remove the dead skin cells on me.</li>
            <li> I use this every other night or so mixed into my regular moisturizer and it really does increase cell turnover.</li>
            <li> it was used, not new, and completely used up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too much your face will be a peely mess.  </li>
            <li> It continues to remove the dead skin from my face to show off a smooth and less noticeable wrinkle around my jawline.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helped keep crows feet away, and kept my fine lines under my eyes from getting worse</li>
            <li> The 1% is a little much for my skin and makes me peel every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe that there was only this little tiny bit of product for that much money.  </li>
            <li> However, if the product cannot be used it is as good as being a bad product.</li>
            <li> About a week for blemishes or new dark marks to fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going without makeup the past few days comfortably.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any previous experience with any other comparative products but this does seem to be doing what it was intended to do.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Retinol and they always left my face red and burning for several days after.  </li>
            <li> retin A causes peeling flacking red dry skin but helps reduce the appreance of wrinkles  acne scars.  </li>
            <li> It does leave dry patches from time to time but nothing that doesn&#x27;t go away in a short amount of time.    </li>
            <li> After using less frequently the problem resolved.</li>
            <li> It really works, and you must start slowly or your skin will really be red and peel.  </li>
            <li> ok it will be a little painful at first .</li>
            <li> I think I am seeing a slight improvement in sun damage and skin tone, but this product makes my skin peel, so I am not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This one is better, but still stinks.  </li>
            <li> It took several tries before any cream would come out.  </li>
            <li> A long time user of Retin A Rx strength.  </li>
            <li> therefore, it was a complete waste of time and money to buy this product.  </li>
            <li> Next order, I&#x27;ll back it down to the .50.  </li>
            <li> This page has reviews with the same complaint - that are over three years old!  </li>
            <li> I still only use it every other day.</li>
            <li> but once it starts to peel use Eucerin or other oil-based product to keep your skin moist and the white skin flakes will be kept at a minimum.  </li>
            <li> The Retinol 1.0 cream worked just as well, and not nearly as costly!  </li>
            <li> which is probably not going to be for a very long time.</li>
            <li> If I use it every day my skin gets really dry around my eyes, mouth and forehead.  </li>
            <li> Caused my skin to dry and peel, exposing newer, fresher skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been here sine 2005 without a single reason to worry.</li>
            <li> I too felt the pump problem was likely resolved long ago and decided to ignore previous reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll back down to using it once or twice per week.  </li>
            <li> A very tiny amount is dispensed, and a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> little goes a LONG way and you definitely need a moisturizer and sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Since only a little is used in each application, the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It is so irritating to be unable to simply push the pump to get the product out, but I kept trying thinking that maybe the next one would be better.  </li>
            <li> I just pump, wait half a second, pump again, etc.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several, starting with .5 strength and for the past 2 years using 1.0 maximum strength.  </li>
            <li> (actually makes them even less noticeable).</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a smaller version from my dermatologist for twice the amount.  </li>
            <li> Lightens dark marks, clear pores and gets rid of dead surface cells  </li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a few years now every once in a while I stray to try a new retinol product that without fail is not the real stuff</li>
            <li> I saw dramatic results in the first week.</li>
            <li> I am returning it which seems a shame because I know that the cream is just inside that little bottle - if only I could get to it.    </li>
            <li> The next morning, my skin was a little pink but throughout the day, I could actually feel just a little tightness in my face.</li>
            <li> Be careful using it.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> If you get red and irritated...just wait a few days and start again.</li>
            <li> and I noticed absolutely no difference.  </li>
            <li> The only problem for me was that it dried out my neck and caused itching.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> It is only after a few days that the flaking starts.</li>
            <li> Next morning my skin was a tiny bit pink in the cheek area but too slow for me.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed to get an email that said simply that they had received my email and that I would receive further correspondence if they felt that  my concern was worth addressing.  </li>
            <li> Very very red and raw.</li>
            <li> my major complaint is that the company does not address this issue with its product, and furthermore the pump does not continue to work.i would never rebuy nor recommend this product</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers on here, but no, I took the gamble and lost.</li>
            <li> Will still use my other SkinCeuticals products, but not the retinol.</li>
            <li> but, after using it for a while, I realized it was designed to only dispense a small amount at a time.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I use it every other night.</li>
            <li> it saves time on the other days because I just have to cleanse &amp; moisturize.  </li>
            <li> I did follow recommendation and am using every other night until my skin gets used to it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allowed to mention other brands in this rating but check out my other reviews and look for the gel exfoliant that starts with &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; and read that review.</li>
            <li> Have not ever used any other retinol product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy other SkinCeucals product</li>
            <li> It does cause peeeling, so start every other day, or every two days to see how your skin will react.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried other retinols and this is like pharmaceutical grade retinol</li>
            <li> so be careful!</li>
            <li> but seems like I break out every other day</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews about the container, it didnt deter me from ordering the product.</li>
            <li> it was a little expensive but is worth it.</li>
            <li> so you have to be very careful</li>
            <li> Tried this 1% retinol product after a few days noticed my skin responding to this retinol without the same harsh effects.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a big improvement of my skin since using this for the past year and a half</li>
            <li> I had previously read other reviews saying that there was a problem with the pump.  </li>
            <li> No I&#x27;m not going to potentially injure myself trying to pry the lid off or any of the other ridiculous suggestions listed in other reviews.</li>
            <li> During those three weeks, I broke out, my skin looked dull, and my target areas that I treat with the skinceuticals retinol, were starting to be noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how long this product has been on the market, but I can&#x27;t believe the packaging has not been updated.  </li>
            <li> Pumping slowly, as the instructions suggest, simply doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> After my skin has calmed down, I&#x27;ll try once a week and slowly build up to several days a week.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs down.</li>
            <li> I have to push the pump down and wait for it to re-set itself before I pump it again.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s about half the price) and moving up to this after a couple of bottles of that.  </li>
            <li> I was a previous Retin A user</li>
            <li> On third use my skin looked like I had poured acid on it with blisters and serious irritation.</li>
            <li> You can get a peel for much less money and less damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> The results can be seen in a week or less.</li>
            <li> My complexion seems to be improving and scars are less visible.</li>
            <li> Almost half the price that my dermatologist wanted for it in his skin care store.</li>
            <li> I did not have any of the packaging issues previous reviews mentioned.</li>
            <li> I previously used tretinoin with the Obagi line, which is what I&#x27;m using now, Obagi.</li>
            <li> Previously, I immediately saw results, or evidence it was active/working with the tretinoin &amp; even &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; results on my face.</li>
            <li> So I used less and that was resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even Amazon let me down a little on this.</li>
            <li> People have said they have noticed DRAMATIC results, and in a few weeks no less.  </li>
            <li> and now there are little metal pieces in the cream.    </li>
            <li> seems that air gets caught in the pump thus the product just needs to be redistributed with a little tap or two.</li>
            <li> I bought and returned one of these because it wouldn&#x27;t dispense out of the little container.  </li>
            <li> a little of the product dries out before you can use it.  </li>
            <li> I use a little under my eyes and they seem smoother also.</li>
            <li> She does not really like the tube, because it is hard to get all of the product out when you get to the end, but that does not detract from her 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> The retinol doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh.  </li>
            <li> This product was the missing element.</li>
            <li> Just needed to tap a few times on the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I am 22 and it also dried my skin out to the point that I was developing wrinkles, which have with lots of moisture disappeared.</li>
            <li> It takes out all the impurities and dead skin, so underneath is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone without foundation a few days</li>
            <li> BIG SURPRISE... BROKEN BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> but this cream does not cause redness, just some flaking of the skin after a few days, which it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just the product getting rid of the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> LESS OIL/ SQUALANE&amp;#34; by Peter Thomas Roth!</li>
            <li> It even smoothed out my skin from previous acne scars!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a painful process at first</li>
            <li> I find that it helps to decrease the appearance of small wrinkles and combat uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely cautious combining a very small amount, like a dot</li>
            <li> This experience left me disappointed in not only Skinceuticals but a little bit in Amazon.</li>
            <li> The recommendation is that if you have not used a retinal product, that you take it slow, at least every other day or twice a week, and I have done this.</li>
            <li> The cream removes dead skin cells that dull your complexion.</li>
            <li> How can a company turn a blind eye to such a QC issue??</li>
            <li> At this price, I wasn&#x27;t going to let it go to waste!  </li>
            <li> I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time!  </li>
            <li> Not sure how I will get all of the product out at this time.</li>
            <li> It worked no better than any cream that you buy in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> It is difficult to compare percentages of retinol that various companies may put into their product.</li>
            <li> Silly me, thinking this product would actually work!  </li>
            <li> This is one of the very few products that has made it&#x27;s way as a staple in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> With so many bad reviews (which I ignored - my stupidity) all over the internet concerning the pump for this product, you would think that SkinCeuticals would bother to replace it</li>
            <li> Can cause irritation so start out slow with small amounts and work up as your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time getting the pump to work.  </li>
            <li> this worked for 2-3 times and then no matter how hard i tried</li>
            <li> I tried so hard to convience my dermatologist  to prescribe me retinal</li>
            <li> The strongest stuff you can find on the market - or at least what I can find.</li>
            <li> Loses its potency if you hold on to this product after six months.</li>
            <li> It appears this is a common problem for this product.</li>
            <li> but I did expect that I could at least get to try this product.</li>
            <li> My refund was so late</li>
            <li> Yes the pump absolutely sucks and does not work.</li>
            <li> Duh.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use around your delicate eye area.  </li>
            <li> But then I use it as a slow working exfoliator</li>
            <li> so start slowly and work your way up</li>
            <li> I was going to start slow, which I did, but</li>
            <li> If I could give 0 stars I would - what a waste of time and money!!</li>
            <li> and because I knew that \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; would mean that the product was working.  </li>
            <li> The last two was just impossible and my husband had to split the tops with an exacto knife then pry the tops off with a pair of pliers.  </li>
            <li> The pump is a serious problem though.  </li>
            <li> I went from feeling self-conscious of my dull, aging skin to feeling like I could skip the foundation and just stick with power!</li>
            <li> My skin was very dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
            <li> Frustrating to have to keep trying to get the cream out of the container.</li>
            <li> but I notice a difference after approximately 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;hey, how bad could it be?\\&quot; no,the pump doesn&#x27;t work at all, not even a little bit..</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s working because sometimes my skin will peel a little - which is annoying</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use the item since the pump did not dispense so</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Sorry ladies, but this is not a winner in my book.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to pry the lid off of this one too, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> you will be sorry if you put it here thinking it will slough off and leave no wrinkles in this area.  </li>
            <li> so I randomly chose three for now.</li>
            <li> VERY inconvenient and ridiculous,</li>
            <li> Needless to say I told them that those suggestions were not an option!</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> After all the criticism about the lame pump, they still haven&#x27;t changed their packaging!  </li>
            <li> the impossible dispensing doesn&#x27;t happen with every purchase.</li>
            <li> Too bad.  </li>
            <li> Frustrated and disappointed, I returned it.</li>
            <li> How very disappointing that a company like Skinceuticals would allow this well-documented problem to persist.</li>
            <li> The pump is worthless.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I went to use the product and discovered that indeed the delivery system did not work.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell that I used to be a terrible picker.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Like it so far.  I use it every other day.  If I use it every day my skin gets really dry around my eyes, mouth and forehead.  I know it&#x27;s supposed to shed layers of skin but I think using it slowly over time is the best way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what is supposed to happen, so maybe 3 stars isn&#x27;t fair. I have used this several times, sparingly as it burns a bit once its on. I only apply it 1x/week and can&#x27;t say I notice any remarkable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Just received last week.  The retinol doesn&#x27;t seem too harsh.  Happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> So much better than the old pump! This is the best retinol product that you can get without a prescription! And I know this because one of the OBGYN doctors group I work with sell this in their office. I have noticed a big improvement of my skin since using this for the past year and a half</li>
            <li> I think I am seeing a slight improvement in sun damage and skin tone, but this product makes my skin peel, so I am not sure if it&#x27;s worth it. My makeup covers a lot of my sun damage, but the peeling shows through makeup. I doubt I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Pump on product does not work.  Ordered one and it had a defective pump.  Ordered a replacement and same problem.  Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Retin-A since I was 13 (they prescribe it for breakouts as well as wrinkle reversal).  So my skin generally doesn&#x27;t exhibit irritation to this strength.  I can vouch for the fact that it has similar results/effects when compared to the prescription variety.  The reality of Retinols is that, when in working strength, they are somewhat irritating to virgin skin and they can cause peeling if the strength/frequency of use is more than your skin has built up a tolerance to.  I wouldn&#x27;t recomment this to someone who hadn&#x27;t been using Rx-strength Retinols - I&#x27;d recommend starting with the 0.5 strength (SkinCeuticals makes this as well and it&#x27;s about half the price) and moving up to this after a couple of bottles of that.  It does work, it&#x27;s a good product, it does what Retinols are supposed to do, which is reverse surface wrinkles and prevent further aging (but it works slowly as most genuine, non-hyped solutions do).    I second another reviewer&#x27;s suggestion that the pump be done away with.  I understand that retinols must be kept in a certain type of container or their effectiveness is destroyed - but the pump is iffy at best and does mean that you have to shred it open to get the full product out of the container.  It&#x27;s frustrating.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals is  a good company but I couldn&#x27;t get to its Retinol 1.0 Night Cream.  There was no pressure in the pump and no matter how I worked it, not a drop came out.  Frustrated and disappointed, I returned it.</li>
            <li> Came with a completely non functioning pump. I should have listened to the other reviewers on here, but no, I took the gamble and lost. I guess i figured, \\&quot;hey, how bad could it be?\\&quot; no,the pump doesn&#x27;t work at all, not even a little bit.. No product comes out. Time to go take out my frustrations with a hammer.</li>
            <li> It works. Be careful though, it really will burn your skin if you aren&#x27;t used to it. But yeah. it works.</li>
            <li> the best for staying young</li>
            <li> EDITED MY REVIEW: 4/10/17 I came across this past review of mine, not realizing that Skinceuticals had changed its packaging--which I have been enjoying, along with this product. Sometimes low-tech (e.g., &#x27;squeeze&#x27;) is the answer. GREAT product.  ORIGINAL REVIEW I had been SO looking forward to trying this product...Despite the many complaints about the pump. (&amp;#34;How often can that happen?&amp;#34; I asked myself.) So for those of you who are wondering, I&#x27;ll answer you. IT WILL HAPPEN. Two purchases in a row had a defective pump. Amazon was so nice about replacing #1...I won&#x27;t be asking for a replacement on defective pump #2. How very disappointing that a company like Skinceuticals would allow this well-documented problem to persist. Talk about a BRAND BASHER! Two thumbs down. DON&#x27;T BOTHER!</li>
            <li> First, I want to start by acknowledging the pump is a little temperamental. I have to push the pump down and wait for it to re-set itself before I pump it again. Not a big deal to me. I just pump, wait half a second, pump again, etc. I pump once onto each fingertip on my left hand and then place my right fingertips on my left and mix them. Then, I dot the Retinol on my face from my forehead, to my cheeks and ending on my chin. Then, I mix it in. It mixes easily.    In the beginning, it did exactly what it is supposed to do. Caused my skin to dry and peel, exposing newer, fresher skin. I literally glowed! People saw the difference. I went from feeling self-conscious of my dull, aging skin to feeling like I could skip the foundation and just stick with power! It was great.    I did this for about 2 months, as well as microdermabrasion, until I was ready for my Glycolic peel.    I still use this between peels and, while I don&#x27;t let my skin age enough to get the dramatic results anymore, I still see that it keeps my skin young and beautiful. I&#x27;m extremely satisfied.     Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m 38 and I get told, by stangers, bartenders, cashiers, etc, that I do not look my age AT ALL. Most think I&#x27;m 10 years younger. Is it all because of this product. No. I have a whole regimen that I follow but I do think this product is a BIG part of my end results.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have been using it for years. Great for a quick discoloration scaring spot. Cleans you right up.</li>
            <li> I try so many product to see how it works for me and this one really works and my skin is getting better.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The photo shows a pump, but the description says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;tube.\\&quot; We&#x27;ll see what comes in the mail.  The actual product is high quality, and I definitely notice a difference when using retinol on a regular basis.  With this higher strength, however, you need to use other lotion or alternate use from night to night.</li>
            <li> Excellent formulation for an over the counter cream. Be warned you will experience tingling and flaking. You have to stay the course and wait it out. I experienced skin irritation at first, but I read skinceutical reviews that warned me about the discomfort I would experience. After getting through the first stage I started to see the benefits. The cream removes dead skin cells that dull your complexion. My skin looked brighter and more hydrated. I received lots of comments about my skin so I knew it wasn&#x27;t just me. The improvement continues after using for 6 months. Great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> The product itself is good and I would continue using it if the defective packaging were corrected. I ordered the product two times.  The first time, the pump did not work properly, but I was able to eventually get the lotion to dispense, although with effort.  This second time I had to return the product because the lotion would not dispense at all.  I&#x27;ve switched to another competitive product which works as well and the packaging is good.</li>
            <li> Buyer Beware!! Ordered this product in spite of reviews complaining about the pump. Boy was that a mistake! Like many,many others my pump didn&#x27;t work on this product. If I could give 0 stars I would - what a waste of time and money!! How can a company turn a blind eye to such a QC issue??</li>
            <li> This product is very strong and made my skin red and peeling.   Was a mistake to use every day.  After my skin has calmed down, I&#x27;ll try once a week and slowly build up to several days a week.</li>
            <li> I am 75 and have been using Skinceuticals for some time.  The retinol 1.0 works really well, but the pump is a clunker that the company needs to change immediately.  I&#x27;ve had three pumps and none of them ever worked well.  The last two was just impossible and my husband had to split the tops with an exacto knife then pry the tops off with a pair of pliers.  I think one should reasonably expect a reputable company with a great product, that is not inexpensive, to package that product for sale in a container that does not have to be beaten against objects; pins inserted into the spray nozzle; pliers used to pry off the top; or a hacksaw used to cut off the top.  Pumping slowly, as the instructions suggest, simply doesn&#x27;t work.  One would expect to be able to use this wonderful product without being compelled to use pliers, needles or knives.  This country did put a man on the moon after all!</li>
            <li> Love. Years younger? But love the feel.</li>
            <li> I like the product but causes your skin to flake when first using it. I also had a hard time getting the pump to work.  It took several tries before any cream would come out.  The developer of the container should use a different type of pump or none at all.</li>
            <li> This product was advertised on a TV program as having the best and highest concentration of retinol than any other product in its price range.  The problem is that you cannot dispense the cream. The spray can is defective and it is a known problem as I went to their website and many people have already complain.  My recommendation, do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old,this product has made a significant improvement. Ive tried many products on the market and this one has done the trick. This product was on Dr. OZ show and I believe the doctor was giving good advice so I purchased it.</li>
            <li> i originally contacted amazon because i could not access the creme through  the tubing.  i was then told how to release it by banging it on a table.  this worked for 2-3 times and then no matter how hard i tried, i could not get the air pump to work.  my major complaint is that the company does not address this issue with its product, and furthermore the pump does not continue to work.i would never rebuy nor recommend this product</li>
            <li> This pump doesn&#x27;t work.  Had to use pliers to break into the product on the SkinCeuticals Retinol 1.0 Night Refining Cream.</li>
            <li> Though this product may well be one of the best over-the-counter retinol products available, this one comes in a small, metal pump bottle; so even if the pump worked - which it didn&#x27;t - there would certainly be at least a few day&#x27;s worth of cream left at the bottom of the bottle which you wouldn&#x27;t be able to get to because the pump - which didn&#x27;t work - doesn&#x27;t come off of the bottle; and this stuff is too expensive to leave even one pea-sized drop - which happens to be exactly the amount the directions say to use daily.  I am returning it which seems a shame because I know that the cream is just inside that little bottle - if only I could get to it.    SkinCeuticals needs to package this in a tube.</li>
            <li> This retinol is the best you can buy without a prescription! It really works and I hae seen dramatic results quickly!</li>
            <li> however, I do like the product and how it is making my skin look.  The pump wouldn&#x27;t work so my husband used a hammer to break the top.  At this price, I wasn&#x27;t going to let it go to waste!  Fix the pump and I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now and the results are amazing. My skin is softer and my sun spots have noticibly lightened. I was a previous Retin A user and I find this much easier on my skin. I have NOT had problems with the pump.</li>
            <li> I saw all the complaints about this product&#x27;s dispenser, and bought it anyway. And guess what? I received a squeeze tube!! All Amazon has to do now is change the product image.  This IS a strong treatment, and I would imagine is designated only for resilient skin which has been conditioned for hard-core retinol treatments. I&#x27;m a skin-care fanatic and have used may good products recommended by professionals such as Paula Begoun, the Cosmetics Cop. Having extremely oily skin, I used many AHA/ BHA products. Still though, I had somewhat \\&quot;congested skin\\&quot; as far as clogged pores that those treatments could not fix. This product was the missing element. Yes there can be pealing (especially when combined with chemical exfoliants), and the skin can sometimes feel sore and tender, but the over-all changes in my skin are incredible!! It has been said that your daily skin care routine is far more important than any micoderm treatments, facials or chemical peals (which are expensive and have only short-term results). Investing in this product (which lasts a while, by the way) and using it every day, has been an excellent, and ultimately money-saving decision. Thank you to SkinCeuticals for listening to its customers regarding the pump!</li>
            <li> I have been using the 0.5 Retinol version, for 1 month, easing into it. Now I use it every night. I have very sensitive skin, but have had no problems with this product. (It has hyaluronic acid in the formula, which prevents dryness associated with retinol use.) I broke out at first, but I am also doing IPL treatments, which might be why I broke out.    I recommend starting with 0.5 (thats what my dermatologist said). I will next purchase the 1.0 version and update my review. The texture is very soft, smooth, easy to apply. It even feels like a moisturizer.    *also, no problem with the pump, I really like it, actually. It only dispenses a tiny amount with each \\&quot;pump\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe you can&#x27;t find Retinol cream in stores. This is the real deal. The strongest stuff you can find on the market - or at least what I can find. I know it&#x27;s working because sometimes my skin will peel a little - which is annoying but it&#x27;s the price of beauty. I&#x27;m giving this to my mom for her birthday.</li>
            <li> This product did meet my expectation</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was unable to use the item since the pump did not dispense so I cannot testify to the actual product. However, if the product cannot be used it is as good as being a bad product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and the pump didn&#x27;t work.  I let them know and never received a response.  I cut the top off with a knife just to get to it and now there are little metal pieces in the cream.    And like I said, I never heard back from them so that I could return it or anything!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s baffling that a faulty dispenser still happens with this product, given the perennial complaints about this.</li>
            <li> I cannot attest to the quality of the product since I can&#x27;t get it out of the bottle.  Like MANY others, the pump on my bottle didn&#x27;t work at all.  With so many bad reviews (which I ignored - my stupidity) all over the internet concerning the pump for this product, you would think that SkinCeuticals would bother to replace it but apparently they like having their product returned unused.  There really ought to be a zero rating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 4 months.  Follow the directions b/c it is very strong and if you start out using it everyday you will peel and skin will be irritated.  However, if you use lightly and sparingly, it is great.  I use it every 2 nights along with ROC night cream and my skin looks great!!!</li>
            <li> ForeverBeauty was able to provide instructions on how to keep the pump flowing on this product.  Just needed to tap a few times on the palm of my hand.  seems that air gets caught in the pump thus the product just needs to be redistributed with a little tap or two.</li>
            <li> Great product but the pump bottle just doesnt work very good. I have bought this item two times and both pump bottles just dont work. For the price you would hope to get the product out but I had to break the top off to get to it.</li>
            <li> great product. I feel it works. it was a little expensive but is worth it. fast service. thank you.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week, but noticed no redness, flaking or sensitivity, and I have used it 4 times the first week, Hmmm, is it expired, or is it something else. Jury still out on this one.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best over-the-counter retinol product that I have found!  It seems to work just as well as the Retin-A (prescription) I have used in the past.  The first bottle I received didn&#x27;t pump, but the supplier said SkinCeuticals was familiar with the problem, and I was sent a new bottle upon return of the defective one.  This product is strong, so use sparingly (or you&#x27;ll end up with a peeling face)!  Great product when used correctly!  I will continue to use this cream.</li>
            <li> I have used different over the counter Retinol products and this Skinceuticals product is by far the absolute best.  even though it is only 1% retinol, it worked better for me than two other products that were 2% retinol.  it is also cheaper than they were.  it is strong, so one has to use a moisturizing product either over it (after waiting 30 minutes for the retinol to be absorbed) or the next day.  also, as I&#x27;m sure other reviewers have mentioned, don&#x27;t use it every night at first, as, again, it is super strong.  to moisturize, I have used Bel Essence All-Natural Anti-Wrinkle Treatment, and ACURE Day Cream Gotu Kola Stem Cell + 1% Collagen Growth Factor.  I like them both.  its also important to exfoliate when using retinol, so I do that about twice a week.  Skinceuticals 1% retinol makes my pores look much smaller and my skin looks much smoother and nicer than anything else I&#x27;ve used.  I recommend it highly.  I&#x27;m on my third tube.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money and time!  I FINALLY gave up hoping anything would come out of this joke of a pump.  I even did the priming as the company instructs and still nothing.  I am not sure how long this product has been on the market, but I can&#x27;t believe the packaging has not been updated.  I switched to Skin Medica&#x27;s Tri Retinol Complex and love it!  Will still use my other SkinCeuticals products, but not the retinol.</li>
            <li> I had researched Retinol products and by all accounts SkinSeuticals Retinol 1.0 was a very favorable product. I read many customer reviews and one typical comment was that the delivery system for the product didn&#x27;t work well. I opted to purchase the product anyway. I purchased it through the Amazon website and it arrived within 2 days. I was very disappointed when I went to use the product and discovered that indeed the delivery system did not work. It is a pump spray in a sealed container. If it doesn&#x27;t pump out you can&#x27;t open the top and get to the cream. I contacted the company and they told me they knew about the design flaw of the pump but that I should try running it under warm water, turning it upside down and banging it on the floor! Needless to say I told them that those suggestions were not an option! Amazon was amazing and handled a refund immediately for me. Gotta love Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works fast if you need clear skin asap. About a week for blemishes or new dark marks to fade. Loses its potency if you hold on to this product after six months. But then I use it as a slow working exfoliator</li>
            <li> Super strong, really smooths out wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It causes cystic acne for me. This is the first time I have ever experienced anything like that before. I am 22 and it also dried my skin out to the point that I was developing wrinkles, which have with lots of moisture disappeared. THANK GOD.</li>
            <li> The pump on this product does not work.  Frustrating to have to keep trying to get the cream out of the container. They need to redesign and have a cheap container that works to eject all the product.</li>
            <li> I have used prescription retin A and this works just as well. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but be cautious around the eyes as it will burn the skin. Use sparingly, especially when first starting.</li>
            <li> Did what it said it did and I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product when I first bought it because it appeared there was something wrong with the pump - but, after using it for a while, I realized it was designed to only dispense a small amount at a time.  A very tiny amount is dispensed, and a little does go a long way.  You will notice layers of old skin coming off within a week.  I love the fresh new look of the new skin, and if I have to feel a little ugly before I finally feel beautiful again, then so be it.  It takes out all the impurities and dead skin, so underneath is soft and fresh skin is revealed.  I like this product so much, I bought another one!  Be patient, and watch the miracles take place.</li>
            <li> Product arrived 13 days after ordering. Product had a big dent in the aluminum bottle. The dispenser pump barely works. It acts like there&#x27;s barely any lotion in it. Can&#x27;t review the product because I can&#x27;t get enough of it out to try it.</li>
            <li> Defective pump, can&#x27;t get product out of can. It appears this is a common problem for this product. For $60 I didn&#x27;t expect it to work miracles for my skin but I did expect that I could at least get to try this product. Lucky for me this top cream has a comparable competitor and their pumps and their product work nicely. Even Amazon let me down a little on this. My refund was so late I thought it was never coming so I filed a dispute with my bank. This experience left me disappointed in not only Skinceuticals but a little bit in Amazon. I&#x27;ve been here sine 2005 without a single reason to worry. So I was a bit surprised. Think twice about ordering this product.</li>
            <li> First I must say, I love this product! BUT...I have purchased several with pump problems.  It is so irritating to be unable to simply push the pump to get the product out, but I kept trying thinking that maybe the next one would be better.  In the meantime I had used a screwdriver to pry up the cap and use it.  What a pain! VERY inconvenient and ridiculous, but I don&#x27;t have the time to try and return it and go through that whole process.  I really want to keep using it, so I contacted customer service on the Skinceuticals website to tell them about my experiences and ask if they were revamping the product dispenser.  I was extremely disappointed to get an email that said simply that they had received my email and that I would receive further correspondence if they felt that  my concern was worth addressing.  Did I receive that follow-up email? NO!  This, along with the fact that many others have been complaining of the same problem for a long period of time leads me to believe that they don&#x27;t care! Very offending!  The 3 stars I give are for the actual product only.  The packaging would get a 0 if I could give it, along with a 0 for the offensive customer service of this company.</li>
            <li> This stuff really is full strength. Be careful using it. Wear it at night and wear sunscreen during the day. It is wonderful stuff and lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Have used it nightly for years by prescription (retin A). Easier now because I don&#x27;t need a prscription!</li>
            <li> Great results, just do not use it around the eye area. I will use it always and keep your face out of the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Katherine</li>
            <li> My wife is 53 and loves this stuff.  This is her second time purchasing it.  It really works, and you must start slowly or your skin will really be red and peel.  It has a nice texture, and you can put it on, wait a 1/2 hour, and then use moisturizer over it.  She says that this is the best retinol product she has been able to find over the counter.  She does not really like the tube, because it is hard to get all of the product out when you get to the end, but that does not detract from her 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> Good, improves skin texture. But I haven&#x27;t seen changes in the brown spots yet. Hope will also help to improve skin firmness</li>
            <li> I have tried many retinol products over the years. This one is the best. I have noticed many 1 star reviews but note that people are upset with the packaging. I don&#x27;t know why this problem is not being addressed by the manufacturer.  The cream is excellent. I use it mainly for fine lines on the forehead and smile lines on my cheeks. The lines on my forehead have been visibly reduced. They were not deep lines but I notice a difference after approximately 2 months of use.I am seriously impressed. Please note this cream is very very strong. I still only use it every other day. If you haven&#x27;t used retinol products before I would recommend starting with the .5 strength and work up to the 1.0 I wish I had done that.Well worth the money.   The pump is an issue however the manufacturer says it should be pumped gently which I do and I have had no problems so far.</li>
            <li> Yes the pump absolutely sucks and does not work. What everyone is writing is 100% true about the pump. Its not the hard to pry off the top though. Not sure how I will get all of the product out at this time. It is definitely strong. I don&#x27;t think my skin can take nightly use. Definitely feel it working.</li>
            <li> rentil 1 works great for me. i have used this product for many years and i would recoment to all you beautis out there,.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while back and was looking for it again.  It has changed the packaging but works just a well.</li>
            <li> careful with this product, it&#x27;s strong, but it works</li>
            <li> Not fake or wannabe retinol, the real deal here.  Use real retinol too often or too heavily and you will know it, it will burn your skin, flake, and go red on you, and even severely wrinkle you (temporarily until you shed).  I have been using this brand for a few years now every once in a while I stray to try a new retinol product that without fail is not the real stuff and I have to go back to this.  Be sure to use a good moisturizer with it at night, I like argan oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works at peeling skin!  It takes a day or two before the peeling begins but once it starts to peel use Eucerin or other oil-based product to keep your skin moist and the white skin flakes will be kept at a minimum.  I also use it on the top of my hands and my upper chest.  My skin is markedly softer too.  It can become addictive so start slowly and work your way up or you will be peeling and flaking for weeks!  I have gotten many compliments on how clear my skin looks.  Will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals makes the best products in the skin care industry, and their Retin-A does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Great product, great price, great delivery time, happy with everything. I would suggest however, you consult a skin care nurse (not a tech) on proper use and application of Retin-A. This is not an OTC fluff-and-puff facial.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several, starting with .5 strength and for the past 2 years using 1.0 maximum strength.  I feel that it has help prevent fine lines, I am 72 and have very few fine lines &amp; wrinkles; because of that people who don&#x27;t know my age think I am younger. It helps keep my skin revitalized. for me it is a great product and I will continue to use it daily as a nighttime cream.&lt;br /&gt;I stop using it for the recommended time before I have a facial or brow waxing - this is very important, so always check with your skin care professional before any facial treatment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been about 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve seen a SIGNIFICANT improvement in my skin texture, pore size and wrinkles!!  Can&#x27;t wait to see how my skin will look after several months.</li>
            <li> Saw nearly instant results</li>
            <li> would not re-order....see no visible facial difference for the money</li>
            <li> A long time user of Retin A Rx strength.  54 yrs old suffer grom sun damage acne scars RX strength retin A causes peeling flacking red dry skin but helps reduce the appreance of wrinkles  acne scars.  Have tried used all over counter products with retinal.  Tried this 1% retinol product after a few days noticed my skin responding to this retinol without the same harsh effects.  It is after all a over the counter 1% retinol, so you are not going to get the same result a tube of rx retin A runs well over a $100 dollars,  will re buy.  FYI if you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t use a 1% strength.  It will cause skin to be red, sore.  More is not better in this Product.</li>
            <li> This worked really well on my adult acne skin... it was gentle and no irritation like some products.  I would have liked a bigger tube with more product for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t rate this when i got it.  it was used, not new, and completely used up.&lt;br /&gt;I will NEVER buy this again off Amazon.com</li>
            <li> This night cream does a great job of resurfacing. If you get red and irritated...just wait a few days and start again. My skin got used to it. I now have smoother younger looking skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and I believe in it. A little goes a long way. If you have not used a retinol product then you will have more peeling at first but that is just the product working.</li>
            <li> works well without irritation, and moisturizes. Sometimes, I use it every other night. I will keep using it, many thanks</li>
            <li> I have already purchased my 3rd tube and it works very well. I will continue  to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Shame on SkinCeuticals and Amazon for carrying a product that cannot be dispensed from the bottle.   I too felt the pump problem was likely resolved long ago and decided to ignore previous reviews.  Wrong! Please fix the pump!  Too soon to know if the actual product works.   I&#x27;d sure like to try it!!</li>
            <li> I had previously read other reviews saying that there was a problem with the pump.  This time, I bought two containers, and both had defective pumps, so no product came out.  It was not a problem to return them, but I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> SkinCeuticals Retinol 1.0 Maximum Strength Refining Night Cream, 1-Ounce...: This is one of the 2 products that has changed my skin forever! I&#x27;m glad that skinceuticals changed the package, I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 years now/</li>
            <li> Seems to start working and is quite soft on the skin, not as irritant as these products could be.</li>
            <li> Should have purchased the .5% but think it is a great product and doing the job it is supposed to.  The 1% is a little much for my skin and makes me peel every time I use it.</li>
            <li> I bought and returned one of these because it wouldn&#x27;t dispense out of the little container.  This one is better, but still stinks.  I feel lucky to get the recommended pea-size amount after 10 pumps.  Did I really end up with two lemons or more likely, is Skinceuticals being cheap with their packaging.</li>
            <li> My skin does appear to be smoother &amp; the product also clears up any pimples that pop up. I&#x27;m in my 30s and have pretty good skin but I have noticed signs of aging. It does leave dry patches from time to time but nothing that doesn&#x27;t go away in a short amount of time.    The research I did online said Retinol is a good product for smoother skin. I would purchase this again or even try to get a stronger Retinol prescription from a doctor.</li>
            <li> I went to the derm to ask about retin-A, as I have gotten as much as I thought I could get from OTC products. She suggested this instead. I was skeptical but she said I could return it and get a prescription if I didn&#x27;t like it. I gave it a try and was amazed. I saw dramatic results in the first week. FYI, I&#x27;m 40 with fair skin in decent shape. I&#x27;ve worn sunscreen for 20 years pretty consistently but have some sun spots, plus marks from acne and large pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a LONG way and you definitely need a moisturizer and sunscreen. The process the dr. gave me is to use it each night for the first two nights. She said I would probably peel by then, and I did. She said to just use a very gentle cleanser and a heavy moisturizer while that happens. I peeled for 2 days. She said to then use it twice per week going forward. Well, I&#x27;m at the end of the first week (day 9) and my skin is starting to adjust. I can&#x27;t believe the difference. The wrinkles across my neck and next to my mouth are practically invisible, and the ones across my neck were really pronounced. The pores across my cheeks appear smaller and my skin is smoother and more even. Two red spots on my jaw line from the last time I broke out (5-6 months ago) are almost invisible.  Now, without foundation, I look like I did when I wore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep using the 1% twice per week. I&#x27;ve read where some people like the .5% because it&#x27;s not as strong, but I think I can handle the higher dose 2x per week. Plus I like that it saves time on the other days because I just have to cleanse &amp; moisturize.  I also like the time savings in the morning. I&#x27;ve gone without foundation a few days and I think I may keep doing that. My skin looks good, plus with blush, lipstick and eye makeup, I don&#x27;t think the remaining imperfections are that obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my 3rd SkinCeauticals product and is my favorite. I was using a serum and sunscreen but found a combo product so I switched to save timeand money. This product, however, is a keeper and well worth the price. I think at 2x per week, the tube is going to last for months and I&#x27;m using it on my face, neck, and the top part of my chest that gets some sun.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Don&#x27;t expect miracles, but it definitely will make your skin&#x27;s cells turn over faster. It&#x27;s helped keep crows feet away, and kept my fine lines under my eyes from getting worse (actually makes them even less noticeable).</li>
            <li> If you are looking for strong OTC retinol, this is it! Make sure your skin is accustomed to retinol before using this strength. I have been using 0.3% for a couple years, and the 1% is strong for me. Sometimes I use the 1% lightly once every 3rd day or I mix it with a milder retinol product. It seems to boost the strength of the milder product without being too strong.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied. Great!</li>
            <li> start with the .5 first..this is good stuff....I notice a better texture to my skin tone and a softness since using it.</li>
            <li> I have used retinol .05 and .1. both require a prescription from a Dr. I&#x27;ve had  good results from both, but I thought I would try this to see what it would do. It is more like a chemical peel than anything else. On third use my skin looked like I had poured acid on it with blisters and serious irritation. Very very red and raw. I doubt this has any retinol of any amount or it would require a prescription. True retinol works slowly, but surely with good results. If you want a 3rd degree burn, this is your product. By the way I did follow instructions. You can get a peel for much less money and less damage to your skin.</li>
            <li> Came on time. Works great for my husband.  He had acne, pops up once in a while.  Helped hie skin!  We were not looking to reduce wrinkles.  WOW his skin looks great!</li>
            <li> Not an authorized dealer of Skinceuticals.  This working for me, in that I have peeling and redness.  I will finish it, but won&#x27;t buy from Amazon again.  I did some research and it is true that if you don&#x27;t buy from an authorized dealer, you are not guaranteed the product is safe and/or effective.  It&#x27;s worth paying a little extra.</li>
            <li> Sorry ladies, but this is not a winner in my book.  I expected so much judging from these reviews.  I was hoping for peeling action, since that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been reading about and because I knew that \\&quot;peeling\\&quot; would mean that the product was working.  Too bad.  I had such high hopes.  It really did not do a thing and I noticed absolutely no difference.  Nothing at all.  Bummer!&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure why all the reviews say it&#x27;s extremely potent and to use with caution.  I did not feel any stinging, pinkish skin, etc.  I was going to start slow, which I did, but no negative side effects so I immediately was able to use nightly with no problems.  People have said they have noticed DRAMATIC results, and in a few weeks no less.  I don&#x27;t get it.  This was soooo not the case with me.  The product just felt that cream...that&#x27;s it!  It worked no better than any cream that you buy in the drugstore.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  I am happy it worked for those of you who claimed it did, but for me, IT DID NOT!</li>
            <li> It really works, I am happy thus far, cannot use it everyday as your skin takes some time to get use to it, there is some peeling and slight burning but that&#x27;s part of the process.  My skin simply glows and is very smooth and subtle.</li>
            <li> Made a significant difference in my four head wrinkles and worked wonders on my acne. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> So many products out there -- this one seemed to have a lot of fans.  And I have joined their ranks.  My skin looks clear and smooth.  Easy to use - and I use it every day.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I had an obvious improvement within one week. I have tried so many retinol products over the years but this one far exceeds them. The only problem for me was that it dried out my neck and caused itching. After using less frequently the problem resolved.</li>
            <li> Works and will continue to buy t.</li>
            <li> I have used many kinds of products containing retinol...this one is good and  strong.  I&#x27;m 63 and used to have oily, tough skin, but now it&#x27;s much drier, and I do have some wrinkles, but always use good sunscreen living in FL. and have taken care of my skin.  I did follow recommendation and am using every other night until my skin gets used to it.  I have had some slight peeling the day after using at night, but that&#x27;s part of what it should do to help create smooth skin.  It may be too strong for some with sensitive skin, but I&#x27;m looking for a product that works and this is it for me.</li>
            <li> Fifty-five years old and my first time using a full strengh retinol. I was concerned about what I had read about the packaging but mine came in a tube.  I made the mistake of going directly to the 1.0 and wow, did I peel!  I&#x27;ll back down to using it once or twice per week.  Next order, I&#x27;ll back it down to the .50.  My pores and skintone look marveous under the peeling.  Haven&#x27;t seen much improvement on my sun damage but I&#x27;ve heard that comes in time.  I would definately recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay retinol cream, it is not greasy and did not break me out.  But now that 2.5% is sellable in the United States, and a lot of companies have jumped in on the market, it is WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li> The product does not last.</li>
            <li> Best Retional, won&#x27;t hurt your skin, I have used Retin A and all kinds of Retional and this from Skin Ceuticals is the best and well priced.</li>
            <li> I really do like this. I have been using retinol products for several years now but this is better than all the other over the counter items that contain retinol. It is difficult to compare percentages of retinol that various companies may put into their product. I believe this is the highest percentage readily available. I reordered it and will continue to use it. The one tube lasted 2 months and I used it pretty much daily.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews on this product and had hoped that the manufacturer/company would take this to heart and improve- so I went ahead and purchased it. The first night I attempted to use the cream, I could not get any product out of the container. The pump is worthless. So back to Amazon it goes. I will not buy from this company again as I am not certain I will be able to use the product.  My money will go to another.</li>
            <li> I am writing this on Day 2 of use. This is early, and I will update as I use it. I have not had any problems with the product so far. The recommendation is that if you have not used a retinal product, that you take it slow, at least every other day or twice a week, and I have done this. I have not had any burning or redness. I know that it will take time to see improvement and I will keep you informed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as this provider. I am fairly pleased. They shipped in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered on a Saturday and received 8 days later. The only problem I had is that I had to go to the post office to pick it up. The post office did not leave it at my office (and you know what a hassle going to the post office is!). People have had complaints that the pump does not work, but you have to prime the pump by pressing the pump about 20 times. The product is pricey, but you save about $5 by ordering from this retailer.</li>
            <li> Love the product--been using for about 5 years and my skin looks fantastic.  The pump is a serious problem though.  I have returned multiple bottles due to defective pumps, but keep buying more/replacing it with a new bottle because when you can get the product out of the bottle, it works great!  I&#x27;m going to pry the lid off of this one too, unfortunately.  Definitely worth the problem for the results, and the impossible dispensing doesn&#x27;t happen with every purchase.</li>
            <li> I thought the reviewers were exaggerating regarding the difficulties with the pump.  Top brand, surely this could not be true.  They were right.  I am now researching how to break in and get the retinal out because my pump does not work.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend both the product and seller!</li>
            <li> The results can be seen in a week or less. Efficient and efective!</li>
            <li> I absolutely  love this product.  I started with a. 3 finished it moved to a. 5 and now up to the 1.0 makes skin  soft and silky.  No breakouts.  I use it at night time after washing my face with philosophy face wash. Great  product.</li>
            <li> Really works.  I have to use it every other day because it is so strong</li>
            <li> Amazing product- you have to be patient and give it a chance</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have always had un even skin tone mild acne.  This product is the highest grade of retinol on the market with out a prescription.  It does not take much.  This really clears my skin and help with the light scars, making a smoother even skin tone.  Great thing is retinol helps with wrinkles as well.  I paid so much at one time going to a dermatologist she gave me a retinol product which was stonger than this but cost way to much.  And she told me using retinol on a daily bases when I am 40 my skin will not look it.  So for over the counter this is a great product, you must stick with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle this product shows in the picture was great it last longer stays fresher when I got the product it was in a tube!  Not like the picture shows.  But still a good product in the tube it loses it freshness quicker.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a smaller version from my dermatologist for twice the amount.  This is dermatologist quality.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m am so happy to have found this product. I tried so hard to convience my dermatologist  to prescribe me retinal but she would say things like is too much peeling and burning and blah blah. The fact that I can get the same results out of a product over the counter as if it was a prescription one-makes me extremely happy. I have being obsess with retinal ever since I found out what it can do for your skin. Yes! it&#x27;s a painful process at first but the results will make you forget it all. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been looking for a potent retinol treatment, here it is!!  First and foremost, DO NOT start off with the 1%.  Start out with the .5% and work your way up to the 1% solution otherwise, you&#x27;re going to burn your face up, which isn&#x27;t pretty for anyone.  I will say that once I started with the 1%, I used it twice a week and then worked my way up to where I am now which is 4 times a week.  I STILL peel a lot and I&#x27;ve been using the 1% for over a year.  Make sure you have a GOOD exfoliant because you&#x27;re going to need it.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m allowed to mention other brands in this rating but check out my other reviews and look for the gel exfoliant that starts with &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; and read that review. ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides all that, I can say my skin is in much better condition using this product than not using it.  I went without for 3 weeks because I ran out and had to wait.  During those three weeks, I broke out, my skin looked dull, and my target areas that I treat with the skinceuticals retinol, were starting to be noticeable.  I actually had to wear foundation.  While using the retinol, I rarely use foundation unless I just want that extra &amp;#34;oompH&amp;#34;.  This is one of the very few products that has made it&#x27;s way as a staple in my bathroom.  I will not go without it again and I will continue to use it until something better comes along...which is probably not going to be for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The advert says Tube and it actually came in a pump and the pump does NOT WORK at all.....therefore, it was a complete waste of time and money to buy this product.  After all the criticism about the lame pump, they still haven&#x27;t changed their packaging!  Duh.</li>
            <li> The product does seem to be pretty effective. However their pumps STILL do not work.  This page has reviews with the same complaint - that are over three years old!  \\&quot;What&#x27;s the big deal?\\&quot; you say.  \\&quot;So a little of the product dries out before you can use it.  It&#x27;s still effective.\\&quot;  Well...have you stopped to think that, once you include shipping, customers are paying about $2,000 for a quart of this stuff?  At that price, am I really supposed to shrug my shoulders when they set it up so that I have to throw some of it away?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any previous experience with any other comparative products but this does seem to be doing what it was intended to do. My complexion seems to be improving and scars are less visible. Almost half the price that my dermatologist wanted for it in his skin care store. So very happy about that.</li>
            <li> It works. Just give it time. Don&#x27;t hurry and mix with vitamin C :)</li>
            <li> great. fantastic for price.  Easy to apply out of tube.  will definitely cause one to peel.</li>
            <li> Love it, and $25 cheaper than the Dr. office.  Works great as a starter retinol.</li>
            <li> This product does its job.  It continues to remove the dead skin from my face to show off a smooth and less noticeable wrinkle around my jawline.</li>
            <li> Silly me, thinking this product would actually work!  Buy at your own risk, you are tossing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but I wasn&#x27;t prepared for the drying effects!  Future consumers make sure your skin has been tempered with less  intense retinol formulas... .025 or .05 before launching into the 1.0!  In combination with this product I would recommend using a moisture retaining buffer.  I love the &amp;#34;OIL LESS OIL/ SQUALANE&amp;#34; by Peter Thomas Roth!</li>
            <li> Have used this Retinol product for a number of years.  It works to keep skin fresh and smooth.  Since only a little is used in each application, the product lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference while using this product. Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like it has no strengh. I have purchased this product before (from a salon) and I am also an esthetician. I used it for 5 days in a row thinking that I should feel some sensitivity and peeling but nothing. My first purchase from the salon I was extremely happy about the results and the strengh of the product.  I also checked expiration date and it was not expired. Seems like I got a dud....</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, and I am noticing reduction in fine wrinkles. At first I experienced some sensitivity, but got used to the product within a week.</li>
            <li> Definitely an add-on into the nightly regimen! I see a huge difference in my forehead and eyes!</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands of Retinol and they always left my face red and burning for several days after.  My face still gets red but doesn&#x27;t burn yet it works very well.</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals products. Very happy with Retinol. Started out with the 0.5 strength and now use 1.0. I have sensitive skin and am able to use this product.</li>
            <li> BIG SURPRISE... BROKEN BOTTLE. No I&#x27;m not going to potentially injure myself trying to pry the lid off or any of the other ridiculous suggestions listed in other reviews. What you do rate a product that you can&#x27;t even use? 1/5. Last time I buy SkinCeuticals.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really does work. For anyone who had problems with the pump dispenser[I did&#x27;nt] it is now in a squeeze tube.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviews that said use the .5 strength first . this is strong and will make you peel so I could only use 1 time a week. well its 6 weeks and my face does look  better after serious moisturizing in between uses. my skin seems to have a smoother texture and my pores are actually smaller. I use a little under my eyes and they seem smoother also. ok it will be a little painful at first . A little burning when putting on moisturizer but beauty is worth the pain. anyway my face seems to be adjusting to the retinol because its not peeling as much . I recommend but you need to stick to it.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this cream.  At 40+ years of age, retinol is now part of my daily regime.  I find that it helps to decrease the appearance of small wrinkles and combat uneven skin tone.  I only apply the 1% once a week as this is very powerful stuff.Too much your face will be a peely mess.  I keep to the forehead, cheeks, nose and mouth area.  For me, 1% is too strong for the eye area.  (i have another .5% cream for daily use)&lt;br /&gt;One tube lasts a long time so the price is a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for a while now and definitely feel a difference in my skin.  Can cause irritation so start out slow with small amounts and work up as your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> This can be a bit strong so you have to be very careful but it definitely works I have noticed my skin has improved it is well worth it!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  Noticed a difference in my 54 year old skin almost immediately.  LOVE this product.  No redness, no irritation, no excessive dryness.  Just smooth, clear, pink skin.  Even my&lt;br /&gt;14 year old daughter (who was using a retin A product thru a dermatologist) tried this and liked it MUCH better.  She said it cleared up her acne much better than the prescription she had been using.  I don&#x27;t want to be without this stuff.  Love it as much as the line of Obagi products I used to use and loved so much.  Definitely recommend!  10 stars!!!!😀</li>
            <li> I  have been using for about 3 weeks.  Have not ever used any other retinol product so have nothing to compare to.  It appears that my skin tone is a little better and a large wrinkle across my forehead seems to be reduced.  I did start with a new Wexler night cream at the same time so cannot say for sure which is responsible but I do think it is making some difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of this as compared to the Skinmedica retinol product, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Very string! Dried my skin out too much. I prefer the .5 strength.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing more than any good facial moisturizer will do! Did not see any difference from the inexpensive products I&#x27;ve been using. Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 5 years now and it is the only product that works. I&#x27;ve tried them all to help me with acne and it has stopped my breakouts. I would pop a pimple and then put this on and no redness or scar would appear. It even smoothed out my skin from previous acne scars! You can&#x27;t tell that I used to be a terrible picker. Now I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and still don&#x27;t have wrinkles, either! I love this product so much that I would drive 45 minutes to the nearest spa to buy it. I hope this product gives all of its users the same effect as it has on me. I don&#x27;t use anything else and no longer need to buy special makeup foundations to hide my acne &amp; scars. In fact, I don&#x27;t use any foundation at all!</li>
            <li> This is the best anti aging product out there!!!!!!!! I am 37 everybody thinks I&#x27;m 23. Love it I wish I had a case of it!</li>
            <li> strongly recommend this production. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good one to cure the acen for long time, it is the only one I can tell the difference on my face. I&#x27;ll buy other SkinCeucals product</li>
            <li> For those using any retinol based product ..... this product should be used sparingly for the first two weeks, then every night for 4 nights in a row, three nights off.  During the three days off, you SHOULD have a &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; of your face.  If your face doesn&#x27;t peel, you aren&#x27;t doing it correctly.  For those who say they don&#x27;t like the peel and only use it once or twice a week - you are wasting your money.  You MUST use it consistently and experience the peeling.  I have been using retinol for 20 years and this is the way it&#x27;s to be used.  And my plastic surgeon told me so.  Also, makes your skin very sensitive to the sun and you won&#x27;t &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; like you used to.  Be careful.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy, thin applicator that allows targeting, no scent. All dermatologists recommend Retinol products, it is a basic in my routine. I have sensitive skin but this cream does not cause redness, just some flaking of the skin after a few days, which it is supposed to do. Do not think after 1 application that this does not work and apply more. It is only after a few days that the flaking starts. Indeed do not use more frequently than once a week. Great anti aging cream.</li>
            <li> The container only released about 3-4 days of product and then never worked.  I couldn&#x27;t believe that there was only this little tiny bit of product for that much money.  I took it outside today and hit it with a hammer and \\&quot;wow\\&quot; all the product squirted all over.  Should have returned it...I was robbed.  Probably defective because it was old product????</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it really works. After 5 weeks my sundamages are completely. My skin feels smoother, the complexion is refined and in my mirror I nearly lost some years;) Just an awesome product. I love it.</li>
            <li> It works! Very happy with my transaction</li>
            <li> It has helped reduce the fine lines, I haven&#x27;t seen much difference in the deeper wrinkles but I will keep using it to see if I see improvement.  It does cause peeeling, so start every other day, or every two days to see how your skin will react.</li>
            <li> This is the best OTC retinol product, and much cheaper than prescriptions.  If you can afford dermatologist and prescription strength they are more effective and faster.  But if you are a bargain hunter this is probably the best for less.</li>
            <li> Maximum Strength works very well.  Will buy it again when I run out.  SkinCeuticals is definitely a good brand name.</li>
            <li> greatest thing you can do for your skin besides sunscreen. I love the nozzle and tube design. I will repurchase</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for several years, but with the pump container.  At the price of the product, I wanted to squeeze the last drop but couldn&#x27;t.  With the tube, I feel better control on daily use and more ability to get that last drop.</li>
            <li> Love to when I saw good result after 2 weeks . Good quality products . I will order again when it finished.</li>
            <li> Lightens dark marks, clear pores and gets rid of dead surface cells  i&#x27;ve tried other retinols and this is like pharmaceutical grade retinol</li>
            <li> I do love this stuff, it&#x27;s the only thing that will slough off the dead stuff revealing nice smooth soft skin below!  However, I must caution you...if you get this, it is potent.  DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT use around your delicate eye area.  Stay away from anywhere near your eyes.  Crows feet, ok, but underneath...you will be sorry if you put it here thinking it will slough off and leave no wrinkles in this area.  Trust me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43 year old AA woman with genetically good skin. I purchased this product without building up to it. There has been some peeling but no burning. However, there was a tingling sensation first time usage but I believe that&#x27;s because I used a towel to cleanse my skin prior to putting on the product(now I just use my finger tips/hands). I use this product according to the directions and I&#x27;m pleased with the results. My skin glows with an even tone, the fines lines are even more subtle. I&#x27;ve been going without makeup the past few days comfortably. I highly recommend this product along with A.G.E for the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is just great cream!  I&#x27;ve used Retin-A by Obagi for years and it was getting too pricey.  The Retinol 1.0 cream worked just as well, and not nearly as costly!  If you have used a Retin-A or Retinol product before,  then please don&#x27;t start with the 1.0 strength!  Try the product in a lower dose strength to get starteed.  Otherwise you will have a really sore, itchy face.  It&#x27;s much better for you to start at a lower dose.  Even with the Retinol 1.0, I try to skip a night now and then.</li>
            <li> Use as directed on package. Your skin will be irritated at first and lotion may seem to sting. So I would suggest a person does NOT go nutty with spreading this all over his or her face, especially as first.  It is good on fine lines, but don&#x27;t expect miraculous results on deeper life lines.</li>
            <li> This is the best retinol you can buy online without a prescription. Easily absorbed gel-like consistency. Yes, I would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and excellent product. Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Love the new packaging!  No wasted product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Works really well</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions! Don&#x27;t do what I did and jump in too quickly. The product is wonderful. I did not have any of the packaging issues previous reviews mentioned. The solution is easily applicable. A little bit goes a long way. You see results quickly. I am using for both the benefits for acne and fine lines.</li>
            <li> It is true that you need to go easy with this product, at first, otherwise you will dry out your skin. Seems to be working to tighten, but too early to see results just yet.</li>
            <li> Been using a .5 for a long time, I really do see the diff in this. Have not had any redness nor peeling....</li>
            <li> This product works really well with the CE Ferulic. My skin was very dull. Expect peeling. That&#x27;s just the product getting rid of the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much difference to my skin with this product. I may have to try a stronger % of retinol product, which I&#x27;ve seen at Sephora.  Leaves skin smooth though.  Haven&#x27;t seen any difference in acne flareups.</li>
            <li> This is the second time that I purchased this product.  Works,wonders, my skin looks 10 years younger</li>
            <li> This is super strong retinol cream. I use this every other night or so mixed into my regular moisturizer and it really does increase cell turnover. I have very sensitive skin and if I use it too often my skin gets irritated so be careful!</li>
            <li> This is an effective product. Follow the intstructions so you do not have flaky skin. I get a brown spot after swimming each day when I stay in Hawaii. I use this product when I get back to Oregon and out of the intense sun. the brown spot virtually disappears. Just wish I had something that worked to keep it from coming back.</li>
            <li> The only stuff that ever keeps my skin clear. It&#x27;s the holy grail of clean pores.</li>
            <li> Use on wrinkles or blemishes.</li>
            <li> So far this is very nice. Do not notice a change in my skin yet.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week now ... but seems like I break out every other day is this normal? But other than that I&#x27;m really liking it</li>
            <li> Great product for being nonprescription! Love it</li>
            <li> I cannot give this item one star or five stars yet so I randomly chose three for now. I&#x27;ve only used this item 5 nights so to post a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; review would require me to actually have been on this product longer than five days. After reading other reviews about the container, it didnt deter me from ordering the product. It&#x27;s what&#x27;s inside that matters although I understand others frustrations about not being able to get the product out of its container. In short, I don&#x27;t care about what type of container, whether a pump or a tube so I received the tube version. No problem. I previously used tretinoin with the Obagi line, which is what I&#x27;m using now, Obagi. Previously, I immediately saw results, or evidence it was active/working with the tretinoin &amp; even &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; results on my face. I overused the amount of tretinoin and could feel the dryness &amp; tightness in the creases of my nose and chin the very next morning. So I used less and that was resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now for this order, since I didn&#x27;t want to revert to going to a doctor to refill the tretinoin prescription, which was about $95, I researched for a natural alternative and came across this product. After reading about people peeling, flaking after using this product (which meant to me that it contained some power to remove the dead skin), I hoped this product was potent enough to remove the dead skin cells on me. After all, you&#x27;re supposed to shed the old skin before the new skin surfaces. I was extremely cautious combining a very small amount, like a dot the size of an 1/8 of an inch, of this retinol, on night 1, with the Obagi step 5 (blender). Next morning, my skin was okay. Nothing noticeable. So night 2, I used like 2 dots of retinol. Next morning, I woke with really nothing noticeable. Night 3 i used like 4 dots which was ALMOST about the size of a 1/4 inch. Next morning my skin was a tiny bit pink in the cheek area but too slow for me. Night 4 I used a full 1/4 inch dot and used less of the obagi blender. And just to be clear, I&#x27;ve only applied this at night before sleep and washed off in the morning. The next morning, my skin was a little pink but throughout the day, I could actually feel just a little tightness in my face. To me that means that&#x27;s it&#x27;s working, although I&#x27;m experienced enough with the obagi system that getting &amp; keeping great skin doesn&#x27;t happen over night. So don&#x27;t expect a quick fix with this product. If you are, you&#x27;re not being reasonable nor healthy with your skin to shed/change/transform. Be patient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review as time passes, if I can get back into this, that is. -------------</li>
