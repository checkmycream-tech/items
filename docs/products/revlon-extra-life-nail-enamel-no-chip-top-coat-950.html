            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I just wanted a top coat that is better than nothing, and gives the nail a shine.</li>
            <li>I love Revlon products as well as their nail polishes</li>
            <li>With that said, it is an okay product for its affordable price.</li>
            <li>Ok so they still chip</li>
            <li>I have used it on top of any enamel.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly and gives a nice shiny coat to an at-home manicure.</li>
            <li>its easy for this to &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; on</li>
            <li>it should say EASY CHIP.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one together with OPI top coat, just wanted to compare because I wasn&#x27;t very sure after I read too many reviews saying one was better than the other.</li>
            <li>but ive seen it as cheap as 4.50.</li>
            <li>This has become my new go to top coat!</li>
            <li>This is one great product for keeping your polish looking shinny and fresh for a long time.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am asking too much for a top coat that won&#x27;t chip with the all the work I do.</li>
            <li>I love the high sheen!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quickly, though it is not advertised to do so.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly, though it is not advertised to do so.</li>
            <li>It makes the polish look super shiny</li>
            <li>It applied smoothly and the shine it left was spectacular.</li>
            <li>, its not gonna make your polish last for weeks, but if you have realistic expectations you should be very satisfied :)</li>
            <li>i really recommend this product to people that have soft nail and nail chip real easy..</li>
            <li>this product really make your nail stronger and smooth looking .....</li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought the product 3 days ago and each day a different nail has chipped....</li>
            <li>By far my favorite clear top coat ever.</li>
            <li>Keeps polish looking fresh.</li>
            <li>Pretty crazy how this has so many good reviews!!!!!!</li>
            <li>So I bought 2 bottles right away.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not hard on my nails at all!!!</li>
            <li>This is a simple top coat that goes on easy and dries reasonably fast.</li>
            <li>Revlon Extra Life Top Coat lasts way longer than most other brands who offer top coats.</li>
            <li>This product did not last more than 6 hours.  </li>
            <li>With sand-finish polish I applied three coats of OPI and still saw almost no shine , shine appeared only when I applied Revlon Top Coat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually I do more than a regular paint job, I prefer to add a layer of Shatter, some glitter polish, some Konad stamps and that sort of thing.  </li>
            <li>The first time they said I received the product - it was not in the box with the hair dryer I purchased.  </li>
            <li>This product is exactly as described and arrived intact.</li>
            <li>However, I have found a different brand that I like better.</li>
            <li>I bite my nails from time to time, so I tend to still bite my nails here and there, therefore, I cannot tell if this really protects the enamel from chipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially the week in between manicures - when I just want to spiff up the look.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon Extra Life Top Coat is sturdy and luminous.</li>
            <li>I used this on top of a nail polish that normally chips the next day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original consistency from the first use to the last.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original consistency from the first use to the last.</li>
            <li>How much cheaper than that does it really get?</li>
            <li>So this really holds up well.</li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very chip resistant.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t have much expectations for it, but</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>Chipping is going to happen and fast.</li>
            <li>So for those people who are active with their hands this may not be the magic bullet you were looking for, for me it certainly wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>(I was usually lucky to get even a full day with the other stuff).</li>
            <li>I keep this on auto ship because it&#x27;s my secret to beautiful nails-acrylic and natural.</li>
            <li>the bottle is only 1/2 full and the brush looked as though the liquid hardened on it.  </li>
            <li>Well, I have now compared them using different finishes under the top coat (sand or regular) and</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It is the only top coat that I have trusted in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last much longer than my other nail polish top coat by OPI.</li>
            <li>It is hard for me to find a top coat that I really like.</li>
            <li>Nicole by OPI High Shine top coat on the other (in combination with white Maybelline nail polish)</li>
            <li>This clear coat lasts for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Spending five bucks for something that lasts several months (about a half a year for me and my nails are never not painted) is a steal in my book, especially if the product is good.</li>
            <li>With OPI top coat I have to say, shine was not very strong, in fact it fade away on the second day, you know it&#x27;s there</li>
            <li>Easy application and doesn&#x27;t make a mess!</li>
            <li>I am both unhappy, and happy with the product.</li>
            <li>mean, do not expect it to be like a polyurethane coat (as many people expect)</li>
            <li>and I get extra compliments because of the high shine.</li>
            <li>The formula is thin and not goopy, which I love.</li>

            <li> The formula is thin and not goopy, which I love.</li>
            <li> It also makes your nails super shiny and the polish lasts at least twice as long.</li>
            <li> I have used a wide range of polishes with it from OPI to Wet N Wild with the same result.</li>
            <li> Your nails will dry faster with this last step than with out.</li>
            <li> My hand will dry out and even crack around my fingertips while this nail polish just looks about the same with some minor chipping after a week or so.</li>
            <li> and just two little parts are missing, no peeling or cracking and no scratching, my nails shine like the first day</li>
            <li> Grabbed this on a whim at the drugstore one night when I was in desperate need of a top coat to apply after I had just painted my nails and realized that I didn&#x27;t have my trusty Seche Vite with me.  </li>
            <li> and I can get a manicure to last a week if I&#x27;m careful.  </li>
            <li> it does take a long time to fully dry.</li>
            <li> I do crafts, painting and other artsy related activities and expect to have mangled nails</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on the nails very long at all...........</li>
            <li> And, it lasts a long time too!!</li>
            <li> A few minutes later, your nails are done!</li>
            <li> This really is no chip and delivers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on day 4 of my manicure, and there are absolutely NO chips on any of my nails.</li>
            <li> In less than 24 hours, I had 2 nails with it still intact!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but this tends to get a little bubbly.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is wait a few minutes after your polish is on then use this.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have used 1.5 bottles of this product in the past year.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything out of the ordinary.</li>

            <li> This clear coat lasts for a decent amount of time. Great quality,</li>
            <li> This product did not last more than 6 hours.  It didn&#x27;t chip, but it did peel off.  Just putting my hands in my pockets caused it to lift off.  In less than 24 hours, I had 2 nails with it still intact!&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product again ever.&lt;br /&gt;Gwen</li>
            <li> I keep this on auto ship because it&#x27;s my secret to beautiful nails-acrylic and natural. All you have to do is wait a few minutes after your polish is on then use this. A few minutes later, your nails are done! Your nails will dry faster with this last step than with out. It doesn&#x27;t make sense, but I&#x27;ve used it for years because I&#x27;m a repeat smudger. It also makes your nails super shiny and the polish lasts at least twice as long. It&#x27;s one of my favorite beauty products EVER.</li>
            <li> I bought this one together with OPI top coat, just wanted to compare because I wasn&#x27;t very sure after I read too many reviews saying one was better than the other. Well, I have now compared them using different finishes under the top coat (sand or regular) and for me this one is better, lasts more, shine is amazing!! and the texture when you apply it looks more reliable than OPI&#x27;s, (thicker consistency)&lt;br /&gt;I mean, do not expect it to be like a polyurethane coat (as many people expect) but I have worn it for a week (working, home, gardening...) and just two little parts are missing, no peeling or cracking and no scratching, my nails shine like the first day I applied it. With OPI top coat I have to say, shine was not very strong, in fact it fade away on the second day, you know it&#x27;s there, it lasts but starts to disappear someway...With sand-finish polish I applied three coats of OPI and still saw almost no shine , shine appeared only when I applied Revlon Top Coat.&lt;br /&gt;So having compared both I will say I&#x27;ll buy another bottle of Revlon for my hands one and leave OPI for my feet only..</li>
            <li> I have used 1.5 bottles of this product in the past year.  It is the only top coat that I have trusted in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The best feature is that my polish looks really ALIVE with this top coat and I get extra compliments because of the high shine. It makes good polish look GREAT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I do more than a regular paint job, I prefer to add a layer of Shatter, some glitter polish, some Konad stamps and that sort of thing.  These things need a topcoat to protect and seal them to the nail. When I add this Revlon top coat I never have any worry about it smearing or streaking the Shatter or Konad images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly, though it is not advertised to do so. I have 100% confidence in it&#x27;s finish after 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it reduces the chips and extends the life of my polish, however I do only keep polish on for 3-4 days anyhow.  Although not a miracle product, it does a very good job and also keeps it&#x27;s original consistency from the first use to the last.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Revlon top coat. I purchase it all the time.  It works perfectly, and I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> i really recommend this product to people that have soft nail and nail chip real easy..this product really make your nail stronger and smooth looking .....</li>
            <li> I used this on top of a nail polish that normally chips the next day. This time it lasted almost a week. I love it.</li>
            <li> this is ok. it might help that your nails dont start chipping for an extra day or two. it does take a long time to fully dry. its easy for this to &amp;#34;glob&amp;#34; on</li>
            <li> Pretty crazy how this has so many good reviews!!!!!! So I bought 2 bottles right away. They suck they chipped the very next day. By day 5..... 7 out of 10 of my nails looked horrible... and I&#x27;m not hard on my nails at all!!!</li>
            <li> This top coat is way over-priced.  It should be given away.  It does chip and I was very unhappy with it&#x27;s performance.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on the nails very long at all...........IT DOES CHIP!</li>
            <li> This Revlon nail top coat product serves just as described. As a person who does lots of work with her hands, this is just what I need to protect my manicure/acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> Good seller and good product.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever. Makes my nails last a week. I then put another coat of polish and Extra Life on. Lasts another week. Who needs gel nails!</li>
            <li> Love my favorite top coat!</li>
            <li> This is my go to top coat, ive tried several others including OPI and Sally Hansen and this is still about the best in the price range. One of the reviews on here complained about it being too expensive which i dont understand, i paid about 6 bucks for it but ive seen it as cheap as 4.50. How much cheaper than that does it really get? Spending five bucks for something that lasts several months (about a half a year for me and my nails are never not painted) is a steal in my book, especially if the product is good. I do a lot of gardening so my polish definitely chips and this product helps prevent that. It also makes my nails look nice and shiny. Today i put the Revlon one on one hand and Nicole by OPI High Shine top coat on the other (in combination with white Maybelline nail polish) and i can tell you the Revlon one is Way more shiny than the OPI so you get the chipping help and the shine as well with this one. Obviously it is not a miracle, its not gonna make your polish last for weeks, but if you have realistic expectations you should be very satisfied :)</li>
            <li> Best top coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Go Revlon.</li>
            <li> The bottle says NO CHIP.... it should say EASY CHIP.  Honestly, I bought the product 3 days ago and each day a different nail has chipped.... and I basically type all day, no gardening, no housecleaning since I&#x27;ve bought it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find a top coat that I really like. Revlon Extra Life Top Coat lasts way longer than most other brands who offer top coats. Easy application and doesn&#x27;t make a mess! Love it! Great price</li>
            <li> It dries quickly, though it is not advertised to do so. I have 100% confidence in it&#x27;s finish after 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Over all, it reduces the chips and extends the life of my polish. Although not a miracle product, it does a very good job and also keeps it&#x27;s original consistency from the first use to the last.</li>
            <li> I purchase from Amazon all the time but was very, very disappointed with this purchase.  The first time they said I received the product - it was not in the box with the hair dryer I purchased.  So, Amazon sent me another bottle.  Last night I finally went to use it and I was shocked - the bottle is only 1/2 full and the brush looked as though the liquid hardened on it.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Brush isn&#x27;t the best, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> I am a nail design enthusiast, so I like to get every nail polish color that exists and having well manicured nails or acrylic. This is one the best top coats I have ever used. I cannot remember one that was so shiny and lasting. This really is no chip and delivers. I am a mom to a son, so I wash my hands a lot when it comes to cleaning messes and my kid is like I believe the messiest kid I know. So this really holds up well. My hand will dry out and even crack around my fingertips while this nail polish just looks about the same with some minor chipping after a week or so.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as described and arrived intact. It works well. And, I am quite pleased with the quality.</li>
            <li> This is a simple top coat that goes on easy and dries reasonably fast. I have no complaints and would buy this brand of nail polish again.</li>
            <li> Great product...actually works and keeps my manicure in tact for longer than another product of this type that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite clear top coat ever. Super shiny and a great price. Makes nails stronger when they are painted with this and gives nails a gorgeous shine</li>
            <li> I use my hands a lot cleaning and gardening. I have problems with chipped nail polish. I got this hoping it would make the cut. It didn&#x27;t last much longer than my other nail polish top coat by OPI. It chipped later the same day I applied it.Maybe I am asking too much for a top coat that won&#x27;t chip with the all the work I do. But, it may work for women who don&#x27;t do manual labor around the house.</li>
            <li> This is one great product for keeping your polish looking shinny and fresh for a long time.  I get better than two weeks from a polish change using this as my top coat. The only reason I remove and change polish is because the nail has grown out.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim and i am so happy i did. I love it. It definitely makes my manicure last longer.</li>
            <li> I love the high sheen!  And, it lasts a long time too!!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t anything out of the ordinary. I am both unhappy, and happy with the product. I buy topcoats to keep it from not chipping, but it won&#x27;t ruin my day if it does. I just wanted a top coat that is better than nothing, and gives the nail a shine. This does just that! I do not think it is the best out there, nor do I think it is the worst. It is just good.</li>
            <li> Excellent top coat. Keeps polish looking fresh. Dries fast. Prevents chips. I do a lot of housework and like to keep my nails looking manicured. This works</li>
            <li> I love Revlon products as well as their nail polishes but this tends to get a little bubbly. With that said, it is an okay product for its affordable price. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, wouldn&#x27;t repurchase though.</li>
            <li> It works. However, I have found a different brand that I like better.</li>
            <li> One of the best top coats I have ever used. Dries quickly and gives a nice shiny coat to an at-home manicure.</li>
            <li> Ok so they still chip</li>
            <li> I have used it on top of any enamel. It does seem to give an extra shine. I bite my nails from time to time, so I tend to still bite my nails here and there, therefore, I cannot tell if this really protects the enamel from chipping! Sorry!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I used to use seche vite but I think this won me over. It&#x27;s very chip resistant. It kept the polish on my toes for two weeks, including a week of work in heels and a week in the sand on a beach. And it kept polish on my nails from chipping for 3 days. (I was usually lucky to get even a full day with the other stuff). Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Revlon Extra Life topcoat for years and I love it.  It makes the polish look super shiny and I can get a manicure to last a week if I&#x27;m careful.  It won&#x27;t hold up to gardening, working on the car or splitting firewood, but if there&#x27;s a topcoat out there than can, I&#x27;d love to hear about it!</li>
            <li> My all time fav for adding a coat of lustre to my nails.&lt;br /&gt;Especially the week in between manicures - when I just want to spiff up the look.&lt;br /&gt;Revlon Extra Life Top Coat is sturdy and luminous. I keep coming back to it because it works.</li>
            <li> Grabbed this on a whim at the drugstore one night when I was in desperate need of a top coat to apply after I had just painted my nails and realized that I didn&#x27;t have my trusty Seche Vite with me.  I really didn&#x27;t have much expectations for it, but WOW I was pleasantly shocked! The formula is thin and not goopy, which I love. It applied smoothly and the shine it left was spectacular. I&#x27;m now on day 4 of my manicure, and there are absolutely NO chips on any of my nails. Plus the shine is still there. This has become my new go to top coat! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews that it was amazing as a no chip top coat. I have used this on three different manicures and it chips in minutes. I do crafts, painting and other artsy related activities and expect to have mangled nails but this was billed as practically indestructible even when gardening. Not so much. Chipped immediately. I have used a wide range of polishes with it from OPI to Wet N Wild with the same result. Chipping is going to happen and fast. So for those people who are active with their hands this may not be the magic bullet you were looking for, for me it certainly wasn&#x27;t. So the search continues for a no chip top coat!</li>
