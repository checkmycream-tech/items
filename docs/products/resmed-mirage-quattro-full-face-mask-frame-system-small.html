            <li>Great Product Brand New Great Price</li>
            <li>I also ordered a cushion not knowing it came with one, and a strap assembly which I will adjust better to try and stop the leaky air.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mask...</li>
            <li>I think the manufacturer should use a more durable gasket material, but then I guess they wouldn&#x27;t sell as many, would they?  </li>

            <li>The face cushion/gasket and forehead cushion are easy to remove and replace for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I would like to see them made to fit a bit more securely in the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It helps to make sure your face is completely clean each night before wearing it and to clean the cushion/gasket once a week, but they still stretch out very quickly.  </li>

            <li>Also, while the forehead cushion pops out quite easily to clean, it eventually starts to pop out too easily when adjusting the mask.  </li>
            <li>Also, while the forehead cushion pops out quite easily to clean, it eventually starts to pop out too easily when adjusting the mask.  </li>
            <li>This replaced my original mask, which broke at the forehead piece.</li>
            <li>The small one fits me best with the lower part resting in the crease between my lower lip and my chin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a number of different CPAP face masks, and so far this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>The full mask allows for mouth breathing if needed.  </li>
            <li>My doctor said I had to do another sleep study just to get a new mask which is just a way to make more money.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and easy transaction.</li>
            <li>It works and feels exactly like the original.</li>
            <li>A great seal without having to cinch the headgear really tight.</li>
            <li>The packaging size was about right</li>
            <li>If the manufacturer would make a more durable and lasting gasket, I would have given it 5 stars.it wears out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>After you adjust the velcro at the four locations, you can further adjust the mask for a good seal with a large plastic \\&quot;screw\\&quot; located near the forehead.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unless you&#x27;re getting a replacement for a known item, I&#x27;d buy something like this in person first to make sure it fits properly.</li>
            <li>I received this on time and used it the first night.</li>
            <li>your insurance does not cover your CPAP mask, then my recommendation if you aren&#x27;t sure which size to buy is to stop by a medical supply store and ask them to measure you for the correct size mask.  </li>

            <li>If the manufacturer would make a more durable and lasting gasket, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This fit my face (large and round) better than any mask.  </li>
            <li>The fit is comfortable and is adjusted with two velcro straps, one around the upper part of my head and one near the level of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>Although not once in the past 1.5 years have I loved wearing a CPAP mask, it gets 5 stars.</li>
            <li>and it was easy to open.  </li>
            <li>Too much leakage of air.</li>
            <li>Wow!!!  </li>
            <li>My wife said I was not rolling around like normal and it didnt leak at all!</li>
            <li>The head straps that fit this mask will wear out long before the mask itself.  </li>
            <li>This one is a little better, but my mouth is still dry in the morning and it doesn&#x27;t fit really well.</li>
            <li>Once that happens, you need to buy new straps or they won&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>Plan on buying new straps about once a year.  </li>
            <li>Medium would probably be fine for the average size man.  </li>
            <li>As soon as it becomes too soft or stretched, it no longer makes an adequate seal.  </li>
            <li>As soon as it becomes too soft or stretched, it no longer makes an adequate seal.  </li>
            <li>no leaks doesn&#x27;t ride clear up to my eyes like</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t afford my supplies,was much cheaper than getting my supplies through the doctor who uses medical equipment suppliers.</li>
            <li>It provided much needed improvement in my sleep and my energy the next day.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again when time for new supplies!</li>
            <li>It is the only one that fits well, is comfortable and I don&#x27;t feel like ripping off the minute I lie down.</li>
            <li>The swivel hose attachment works very well and is sturdy enough to last through years of pulling, tugging, and sleeping on without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I have found that the gasket material is so thin that it wears out pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other styles of masks that had much thicker material that did not wear out like these do, but I didn&#x27;t prefer the mask itself.  </li>

            <li>I have an average size woman&#x27;s face, so unless you are a woman with a pretty large face, small will probably do.  </li>

            <li> I absolutely love this mask...I have tried four others and always come back to the Mirage Quattro. It is the only one that fits well, is comfortable and I don&#x27;t feel like ripping off the minute I lie down.</li>
            <li> Works great. Just what i wanted.</li>
            <li> works great no leaks doesn&#x27;t ride clear up to my eyes like the medium one did fits perfect will diffently order again</li>
            <li> I am so thankful you can buy these online. My doctor said I had to do another sleep study just to get a new mask which is just a way to make more money. I received this on time and used it the first night. It provided much needed improvement in my sleep and my energy the next day. My wife said I was not rolling around like normal and it didnt leak at all! What a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of different CPAP face masks, and so far this one works the best for me.  The small one fits me best with the lower part resting in the crease between my lower lip and my chin.  I have an average size woman&#x27;s face, so unless you are a woman with a pretty large face, small will probably do.  Medium would probably be fine for the average size man.  The fit is comfortable and is adjusted with two velcro straps, one around the upper part of my head and one near the level of my mouth.  After you adjust the velcro at the four locations, you can further adjust the mask for a good seal with a large plastic \\&quot;screw\\&quot; located near the forehead.  The air hose attaches onto a swiveling attachment that allows you to toss and turn in bed while allowing the seal to remain firmly in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The head straps that fit this mask will wear out long before the mask itself.  I guess the night-after-night pulling on the straps stretches them out, and the velcro becomes unusable.  Once that happens, you need to buy new straps or they won&#x27;t stay on.  Plan on buying new straps about once a year.  This mask does not come with the straps, but they are available here on Amazon as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  I&#x27;ve used this mask for about 3 years.  It is very sturdy and unlikely to wear out for a long time.  It covers my entire nose and mouth which I prefer, because the partial masks that only cover your nose do not allow you to breath if you have a cold or are \\&quot;stuffed up\\&quot; due to allergies, etc.  The full mask allows for mouth breathing if needed.  The face cushion/gasket and forehead cushion are easy to remove and replace for cleaning.  The swivel hose attachment works very well and is sturdy enough to last through years of pulling, tugging, and sleeping on without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Although I like this mask and will continue to use it, I have to voice my complaint about the face cushion/gasket made for it.  I have found that the gasket material is so thin that it wears out pretty quickly.  As soon as it becomes too soft or stretched, it no longer makes an adequate seal.  I have to buy a replacement cushion about every 3 months.  It helps to make sure your face is completely clean each night before wearing it and to clean the cushion/gasket once a week, but they still stretch out very quickly.  I&#x27;ve used other styles of masks that had much thicker material that did not wear out like these do, but I didn&#x27;t prefer the mask itself.  I think the manufacturer should use a more durable gasket material, but then I guess they wouldn&#x27;t sell as many, would they?  Also, while the forehead cushion pops out quite easily to clean, it eventually starts to pop out too easily when adjusting the mask.  I would like to see them made to fit a bit more securely in the mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your insurance does not cover your CPAP mask, then my recommendation if you aren&#x27;t sure which size to buy is to stop by a medical supply store and ask them to measure you for the correct size mask.  It&#x27;s just a little plastic thing they hold up to your face and use as a gauge.  Then do your shopping here online. My medical supply store charges $190 for this same mask that is selling here on Amazon for $90, and they charge $55 for the same head strap that you can get here on Amazon for $28.  So save yourself $127 and buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would have to say the mask itself is well made and fits well.  If the manufacturer would make a more durable and lasting gasket, I would have given it 5 stars.it wears out pretty quickly.

It&#x27;s just a little plastic thing they hold up to your face and use as a gauge.  Then do your shopping here online. My medical supply store charges $190 for this same mask that is selling here on Amazon for $90, and they charge $55 for the same head strap that you can get here on Amazon for $28.  So save yourself $127 and buy it on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I would have to say the mask itself is well made and fits well.  If the manufacturer would make a more durable and lasting gasket, I would have given it 5 stars.</li>
