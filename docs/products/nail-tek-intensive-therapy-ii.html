            <li>so i have to make sure</li>
            <li>My favorite nail-strengthened...</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t use it more than recommended or</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it for friends, and they love it.</li>
            <li>I love my NAIL</li>
            <li>Have been using this for more than 10 years ..</li>
            <li>my nails get better and better every time I use this stuff..</li>
            <li>The product arrive in a very timely manner and it is a great product to strengthen nails without having to remove polish to apply it.</li>
            <li>I JUST WISHED IT STAYED ON MORE THAN ONE OR TWO DAYS.</li>
            <li>It has strengthened and conditioned my nails better than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love that this was a 4 pack...</li>
            <li>My wife love this product.  </li>
            <li>To avoid biting I would apply polish or conditioner, and then peel it off -- which destroyed the top layer of my nails.  </li>
            <li>And miraculously better.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to grow out my nail since I had acrylic nails 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is great for soft and peeling nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as strong as some</li>
            <li>This is fairly strong stuff</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years (recommended and sold by a nail salon owner) and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Since I have used nailtek, they no longer peel and I have beautiful long nails!</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you get the product that is right for your nail type for it to work.</li>
            <li>it is worth the money !</li>
            <li>I have had to file them to keep them at the correct length -- a real first for me.  </li>
            <li>so I still get occasional breakage but still, the best one I&#x27;ve tried by far</li>
            <li>but it drys quickly.  </li>
            <li>My nails actually look good for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>In an economical 4-pack.</li>
            <li>I use this product religiously under my nail polish on my own nails.  </li>
            <li>I know this sounds like a commercial, but it is my honest experience.</li>
            <li>Within a week of use, I could tell a difference, &amp; now my nails are healthy, strong, plus grow long without peeling or breaking.</li>
            <li>This one is right of me</li>
            <li>oh BTW the price is right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m re-ordering and highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>so it really helps!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I use the Foundation II first and then 2 coats of the Nail Tek II and reapply a coat each night.</li>
            <li>My daughter saw a difference while on the first bottle.</li>
            <li>My nails are no longer a &amp;#34;problem.&amp;#34;  For the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Long and strong!</li>
            <li>It also fails to harden nails and give them the beautiful shine the original product gives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had peeling, chipping nails for many years and have tried many products, from expensive to cheap.</li>
            <li>I try to use this product constantly to keep my nails strong.</li>
            <li>My nails were damaged &amp; weak from acrylic nail manicures &amp; fills and they are now great.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get 4 bottles of nailtex way too much</li>
            <li>Delivery time was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>I have been a nail bite,r off and on, my whole life.  </li>
            <li>The ridges are much reduced.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works I had really brittle nails</li>
            <li>I have 2 more bottles and will continue to finish it, but then I will have to go back to the nail salon and get them done professionally.</li>
            <li>occurred!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with soft, peeling nails should try NAIL TEK II!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Excellent for weak nails, they grow stronger, less prone to break.  </li>
            <li>Only nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t just peel right off my nails after 2-3 coats.  </li>
            <li>I normally have thin and splitting nails, but when I am faithfully using NailTek, my nail grow quickly and are strong and chip-proof.  </li>
            <li>They recommend a fresh coat daily, but if I get more than 5 or so, it gets too thick and comes off.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years and this is not the Nailtek I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I have recommended it to many people in the past</li>
            <li>They are still soft, and they are not growing.</li>
            <li>Someone recommended Nail Tek brand after a salon used it on her, and at such a reasonable price, I figured I had nothing to lose.</li>
            <li>I have soft brittle nails.</li>
            <li>look professional.</li>
            <li>The duo can be purchased together, but you eventually will need more of the Therapy II clear polish as you use more of it than the base coat.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my nails strong and hard when used as directed.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different base coats but this is definitely my favorite...</li>
            <li>Unlike the usual formulation, this product is sticky and does not dry quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other nail products claiming to strengthen and repair brittle nails, but this one really works.</li>
            <li>The salon recommended using a coat of the clear once a day for about a week after the initial coats, then removing all polish and starting the process over.</li>

            <li> My nails now are pink with  white tips, that is, they look &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> My nails were splitting down the middle and constantly breaking.  </li>
            <li> it seems dry</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful which formula you choose.</li>
            <li> Initially, after I had the nails removed, my natural nails were paper thin and were a mess for a long while.</li>
            <li> may-be every other day.  </li>
            <li> You must use both the ridge-filling base coat of Foundation II (which dries cloudy but will look clear after applying the clear Therapy II) followed by about three coats of Intensive Therapy II (clear).</li>
            <li> They developed vertical ridges and were weak and looked damaged.  </li>
            <li> I have soft and thin nails.</li>
            <li> All in all, the two-part base and clear products work very well together.</li>
            <li> My nails chip and break less often.</li>
            <li> nails are stronger and and less peeling has</li>
            <li> The Nail Tek colors were also hard to find in single bottles online (couldn&#x27;t find any on Amazon).</li>
            <li> It makes painting your nails easier if you wear it as a base and let it go out of the nail because you can easily peel the excess paint from your skin at the end without having to rub acetone.</li>
            <li> your nail bed May get a little sore.</li>
            <li> I have used this products for quite a few years</li>
            <li> My nails were thin and peeling, now after about a month, they are thicker,harder and finally long.  </li>
            <li> I was never able to grow out my nails until I used this.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone with trouble nails!</li>
            <li> No more pealing, cracking and chipping of my nails.  </li>
            <li> It dries to a hard shiny overcoat and won&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Nail Tek polish for at least 8 years now.</li>
            <li> they all did nothing or worse.  </li>
            <li> Im getting that I made a mistake and got the wrong one because i didnt pay attention to the bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I ordered 4 bottles.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of one bad thing to say about it.  </li>
            <li> My nails were in very bad shape.  </li>

            <li> The best if you want your nails to grow. but you have to be careful which formula you choose. I have soft and thin nails. so i have to make sure Im getting that I made a mistake and got the wrong one because i didnt pay attention to the bottle.</li>
            <li> Item arrive promptly well packaged and I love it!  My nails are no longer splitting, and they look great!</li>
            <li> My favorite nail-strengthened... In an economical 4-pack.</li>
            <li> This is great for soft and peeling nails.</li>
            <li> Only nail polish I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t just peel right off my nails after 2-3 coats.  They recommend a fresh coat daily, but if I get more than 5 or so, it gets too thick and comes off.  It&#x27;s not quite as strong as some so I still get occasional breakage but still, the best one I&#x27;ve tried by far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a month and my nails are beautiful for the first time!!  Understand you have to be faithful with daily application but it drys quickly.  I also used the Nail Tek Foundation II which lasts much longer because you don&#x27;t use it everyday. I&#x27;m re-ordering and highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I have using this for 2 months, I don&#x27;t see any difference in my nails. They are still soft, and they are not growing. I would not recommend this. I have 2 more bottles and will continue to finish it, but then I will have to go back to the nail salon and get them done professionally. I&#x27;m sorry that I ordered 4 bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had peeling, chipping nails for many years and have tried many products, from expensive to cheap. Someone recommended Nail Tek brand after a salon used it on her, and at such a reasonable price, I figured I had nothing to lose. You must use both the ridge-filling base coat of Foundation II (which dries cloudy but will look clear after applying the clear Therapy II) followed by about three coats of Intensive Therapy II (clear). The duo can be purchased together, but you eventually will need more of the Therapy II clear polish as you use more of it than the base coat.  The salon recommended using a coat of the clear once a day for about a week after the initial coats, then removing all polish and starting the process over. I have also tried a Nail Tek color in between these coats, but found using a color still chipped somewhat (probably my nails, not the polish). The Nail Tek colors were also hard to find in single bottles online (couldn&#x27;t find any on Amazon). All in all, the two-part base and clear products work very well together. My nails chip and break less often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff on and off for years and it&#x27;s a good product. Helps to strengthen my nails and keep my polish on. You have to make sure you get the product that is right for your nail type for it to work. This one is right of me but I recommend you read the various descriptions before buying. This is fairly strong stuff so don&#x27;t use it more than recommended or your nail bed May get a little sore.</li>
            <li> l Iove this product, and I have used it for years to help to strengthen and protect my nails. I have soft brittle nails.</li>
            <li> I can grow my own strong nails.  After years of having my nails done, I decided to take that money and go on vacation.  Initially, after I had the nails removed, my natural nails were paper thin and were a mess for a long while. For me, this product used regularly made the difference.  Thanks Nail Tek, and oh BTW the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years (recommended and sold by a nail salon owner) and it works beautifully.  I normally have thin and splitting nails, but when I am faithfully using NailTek, my nail grow quickly and are strong and chip-proof.  I have to remember to remove it once a week and start over, applying it every night.  I&#x27;ve bought it for friends, and they love it.</li>
            <li> I try to use this product constantly to keep my nails strong. I have a job where they get ABUSED so it really helps!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! It makes my nails look so healthy!  I have been using it for a number of years, and the only place I could ever find it is Ulta, but the price there is $11.99 or so per bottle.  Being able to buy three times the amount of the product through Amazon is AMAZING!  Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other nail products claiming to strengthen and repair brittle nails, but this one really works. Within a week of use, I could tell a difference, &amp; now my nails are healthy, strong, plus grow long without peeling or breaking.</li>
            <li> I love my NAIL TEK II!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My nails are stronger and and less peeling has occurred!!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone with soft, peeling nails should try NAIL TEK II!!!</li>
            <li> These are perfect for my brittle nails.</li>
            <li> Long and strong! I was never able to grow out my nails until I used this. I have purchased it for anyone I know who has been struggling with their nail growth goals. It has worked for them too. We all compare our DIY manicures every Monday morning.</li>
            <li> My nails were splitting down the middle and constantly breaking.  A Nail Tech suggested I try this product and I bought some.  Within a couple of weeks of using Nail Tek Intensive Therapy II daily and the Nail Tek Cuticle Cream my nails were stronger and had started growing.</li>
            <li> Helps to strengthen your nail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Nail Tek polish for at least 8 years now. Keeps my nails strong and hard when used as directed. I use the Foundation II first and then 2 coats of the Nail Tek II and reapply a coat each night. Nails don&#x27;t peel or chip anymore.&lt;br /&gt;Manicures look professional.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ! Have been using this for more than 10 years ..my nails get better and better every time I use this stuff.. it is worth the money !I Promise you will have great looking nails :)</li>
            <li> The product arrive in a very timely manner and it is a great product to strengthen nails without having to remove polish to apply it.</li>
            <li> Excellent for weak nails, they grow stronger, less prone to break.  My daughter saw a difference while on the first bottle. It makes painting your nails easier if you wear it as a base and let it go out of the nail because you can easily peel the excess paint from your skin at the end without having to rub acetone. We buy 4 at a time. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nailtex works well with the nailtex foundation only. You need to order both. You&#x27;ll get 4 bottles of nailtex way too much but I suppose you can put one bottle per room. It dries to a hard shiny overcoat and won&#x27;t peel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW AND DO GET RESULTS FOR SPLITTING NAILS. I JUST WISHED IT STAYED ON MORE THAN ONE OR TWO DAYS.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different base coats but this is definitely my favorite...my go to.  It has strengthened and conditioned my nails better than anything else I have tried.  I can&#x27;t think of one bad thing to say about it.  I love that this was a 4 pack...I won&#x27;t need to buy any for quite a while...and I polish my nails a LOT lol.</li>
            <li> Not same formulation. I have been using this product for many years and this is not the Nailtek I have used in the past. Unlike the usual formulation, this product is sticky and does not dry quickly. It also fails to harden nails and give them the beautiful shine the original product gives. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 10 years and I have zero plans to stop now.  This is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I use this on an ongoing basis because it is beneficial to my nails.  I have used this products for quite a few years</li>
            <li> This has been the best product for growing my nails! I have tried others with no results. My nails were thin and peeling, now after about a month, they are thicker,harder and finally long.  I would recommend this product to anyone with trouble nails!</li>
            <li> I have been using NailTek Intensive TherapyII for 3 to4 years and had great results. This last order is different it seems dry and then it will get rought or I have had it to just turn to a jell on the nail and have to scrape it off.  I think the formula has been changed, I am verry uphappy with this order and I orfered 8 bottles.  I have recommended it to many people in the past but I will not anymore..</li>
            <li> I use this product religiously under my nail polish on my own nails.  It makes my nails stronger and helps to grow faster.  The product was just as described and the price was great.  Delivery time was fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> My wife love this product.  Best part is she gets 4 bottles for the price of 1 here on amazon as compared to her salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the great product and excellent pricing.</li>
            <li> This product can be worn alone or under and over colored nail enamel. The price was the best I&#x27;ve seen and I received my product promptly.</li>
            <li> I have been a nail bite,r off and on, my whole life.  To avoid biting I would apply polish or conditioner, and then peel it off -- which destroyed the top layer of my nails.  They developed vertical ridges and were weak and looked damaged.  Tried several brands --Nailtiques, Orly, Deborah Lippmann-- they all did nothing or worse.  The Nailtek Intensive Therapy II is somehow just different.  And miraculously better.  I have been using it for  a couple of months now.  I forget and don&#x27;t put it on every day -- may-be every other day.  I still sometimes pick at it but if it does come off it doesn&#x27;t hurt the nail underneath.  My nails now are pink with  white tips, that is, they look &amp;#34;normal.&amp;#34;  The ridges are much reduced.  My nails actually look good for the first time in years.  I have had to file them to keep them at the correct length -- a real first for me.  My nails are no longer a &amp;#34;problem.&amp;#34;  For the first time in my life.  I am 64!</li>
            <li> Starting using Nail Tek after using Nailtique. Both worked wonders for my nail problems (chipping and flaking) but the Nail Tek last longer on the nail.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works I had really brittle nails and this makes them stronger and coupled with Biotin vitamin my nails are actually growing longer without acrylics on them!</li>
            <li> My nails were in very bad shape.  They were peeling and breaking all the time.  Since I have used nailtek, they no longer peel and I have beautiful long nails!</li>
            <li> One of the bottles broke open in shipping, but I recommend this product for those who have cracking &amp; split nails. Apply one coat each day for 3-4 days leave on for a week or 10 days. Remove with polish remover &amp; repeat. My nails were damaged &amp; weak from acrylic nail manicures &amp; fills and they are now great.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to grow out my nail since I had acrylic nails 10 years ago.  Recently, since using this product for a month, I have had to trim my nails.  No more pealing, cracking and chipping of my nails.  I order the four pack thinking it would last me forever, but I just had to share my find with my daughter and two friends.  I will be reordering.  I know this sounds like a commercial, but it is my honest experience.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before......it does help my nails if used as described. I would definitely recommended this product</li>
