            <li>It really is a great product</li>
            <li>I am not to happy with this product.</li>
            <li>However, iit keeps my eye area well moisturized and am happy with the results</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>What are all the great reviews about??</li>
            <li>Works great at smoothing lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li>They are the very best and most healing products I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a really good product.</li>
            <li>so I give it a good rating for that</li>
            <li>It does not do a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The price is always good on Amazon and can&#x27;t beat the convenience.</li>
            <li>Product seems like good quality</li>
            <li>Not as good as Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li>An exceptional skin cream, it was recommended by my skin care practitioner &amp; I can see why.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best you can see the difference in a short time, all Skin Ceuticals products are the best.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product line for about 6 months and very pleased</li>
            <li>This one has a lot, so the feel is good and it will give a nice optical effect upon application).</li>
            <li>i love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li>tingles at first, but it is the best.</li>
            <li>I love all Skinceutical Products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a treatment, so you do have to keep using it on occasion, but it&#x27;s an excellent product and does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Truly an amazing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think this product is effective.</li>
            <li>Skin Ceuticals are awesome very healing skin care products.</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time, unopened, in good condition and authentic.</li>
            <li>it is 0.5 ounce of product - really Skinceuticals that is the best you can do?  </li>
            <li>Great results and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them All and by far THE Best eye cream out there!</li>
            <li>This cream is an excellent eye treatment for mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 31 and have had very fine lines around my eyes since I was 18.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I experienced an improvement and since using this eye cream morning and</li>
            <li>Smooths fine lines nicely.</li>
            <li>I use almost exclusively Skinceuticals products, but this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>This eye cream is the richest, most emollient I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>the circles under my eyes are more pronounced and puffy.</li>
            <li>Btw, I&#x27;m 37, healthy and stay out of the sun now.</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Love the way my eye circles have disappeared.</li>
            <li>evening I have more firmness around my eye area.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I can feel the firmness it gives, while most eyecream did nothing.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>It is my all time favorite eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I would love this product if it didn&#x27;t come in a jar</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that this works any better than Clarins.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how many products that I gave her went unused and then for some mystical reason</li>
            <li>and now she calls me to get her more before the jar runs out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The thing I love about this eye cream is that I can wear it during the day over the AOX  Eye Gel and under my concealer without my makeup and mascara smearing or caking.  </li>
            <li>However, the transformation has been a bit more gradual than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>More of a distance run than a race.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love, love love it.</li>
            <li>I affixed it and took it to the post office wherein they put the appropriate postage on it.  </li>
            <li>I love their eye cream, no doubt the whole line is great.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of the Eye Balm better.</li>
            <li>had to stop using it, which is a bummer since I love everything else about it, and it cost so</li>
            <li>Simply the best.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to use a prescription cream more than once a day for a skin condition I have.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the most amazing product EVER!  </li>
            <li>but mainly for the great price..</li>
            <li>If you want a eye product that is going to really make and repair lines, dark circles, make your eyes look beautiful and healthy, spend the money this is the best.</li>
            <li>Love this whole product line makes the skin feel so good and healthy .</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m far from 30, but it&#x27;s nice to look good \\&quot;for</li>
            <li>i have been making my own eye cream with better success...</li>
            <li>but I just feel like it stops being as effective so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it, i don&#x27;t expect it to completely eliminate all darkness and swelling, but i&#x27;m happy with the 50%+ reduction in signs.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>Around my eyes became more smooth without rinkles.</li>
            <li>still a good deal compared to the .5 ounce jar for twice as much.</li>
            <li>But for people who have been taking good care of their skin all along, it takes time, patience, and consistency to see real improvement.  </li>
            <li>After \\&quot;putting in my time\\&quot; and seeing great results (from their other moisturizers as well), I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>After researching other products, this one looks like the best</li>
            <li>You will see a difference very quick</li>
            <li>I liked very much.</li>
            <li>I am going to add the AOX eye serum in the mornings to my routine with the AGE Eye cream to see if there is any improvement in the fine lines.</li>
            <li>my review: The eye cream is excellent with circulation and works on black circles, reducing puffiness and some sagging.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling effect when you put it on and takes care of some puffiness and seems to work well on fine lines.</li>
            <li>This product also has helped with the smoothness  of the skin around my eyes and has helped with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>, and this is a huge</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy enough with it to continue using it.</li>
            <li>Goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>Saw improvement but not as much as I would have liked to for the cost.</li>
            <li>Although the packaging says it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;mature skin,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s great for those on the younger side considering a good early wrinkle protection measure.</li>
            <li>Skin smooth and wrinkles not as noticeable.</li>
            <li>THAT IS WHY THEY SELL STUFF SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product that does what it says.</li>
            <li>After having tried many eye cream that didn&#x27;t work, this one really seems to!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>This is the best eye cream I have tried in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I realize most people are satisfied with this cream, but you must know about this if you have sensitive skin, or a known reactivity to menthol.</li>
            <li>It is either too strong or has some rare item i am allergic to.</li>
            <li>I find the cream overall to be a good cream.  </li>
            <li>: each full tube weighs .2 ounces.</li>
            <li>I love how this product feels, too - an intense tingling that feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I had a sample from my beautician and ended up buying the full size.</li>
            <li>I am a 32 year Caucasian female with fair skin and olive under tones.  </li>
            <li>Really nice for mature skin.</li>
            <li>I tried Lancome Progres before this product and it was super moisturizing</li>
            <li>If you knew me personally, you&#x27;d know I rarely get excited over a product, and I even more rarely go over the top with accolades, but this stuff is an exception</li>
            <li>its ok - kind of too thick to go on very smoothly over very tender eye area!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Skinceutical products for several years and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Best eye repair, wear every am, pm I am in my 50&#x27;s and my skin is so soft and smooth, no pours and it looks like a baby&#x27;s skin because of this line and sunblock everyday.  </li>
            <li>Great for dark circles, dryness, and wrinkle prevention.</li>
            <li>I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser).</li>
            <li>While this eye cream certainly moisturizes, I have not seen any difference in the appearance of fine lines in over a year.</li>
            <li>This brand is first class!</li>
            <li>Got my sagging skin to go away, Thanks Skinceuticals!!</li>
            <li>I have noticed a reduction in fine lines around my eyes and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my sensitive white mature skin.</li>
            <li>Worth the price</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are still there when I smile, but they don&#x27;t stick around when I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will continue and re-evaluate whether it&#x27;s worth $60 or not.</li>
            <li>However, I do not feel it is worth the money charged for the cream.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I still have close to a months worth of cream</li>
            <li>Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li>(i dont think any product would be able to completely get rid of mine).</li>
            <li>The product never stings and is well absorbed, not feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money as</li>
            <li>I hope with more use the dark circles will diminish more.  </li>
            <li>My facial person recommended this product line to me several years ago and I have been happily using it ever since.  </li>
            <li>Meant for moisturizing &amp; rejuvenation, it is even effective in healing extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products for fine lines and dark circles around my eyes (both over-the-counter and prescription/medical grade).</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;d probably see even better results with twice daily.</li>
            <li>Have had some dryness in under eye area, has been much better since starting using this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell the difference when I run out and don&#x27;t wear it for a week or more</li>
            <li>My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic</li>
            <li>This may be because some of the ingredients are air and light sensitive and continue to get exposed to both these things via the jar packaging.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t switch because I do really like the way it wears and feels!</li>
            <li>Simply the most hydrating eye cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Also, the package, which had more than enough postage on it, was NEVER RETURNED TO ME</li>
            <li>Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminished and my lids in general look firmer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my whole eye area.</li>
            <li>It certainly lightens and brightens around the eye area, and its texture is silky and glimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li>In about two weeks I really started to see significant improvement in fine lines, puffiness, dark circles and crepy skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>After a few months of using it in combination with a good cleanser, toner, and moisturizer/sunscreen morning and night, I am pleased to report that the skin around my eyes is firmer, clearer, and less crepey.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much on the reduction of puffiness.</li>
            <li>I wear some makeup but haven&#x27;t experimented much with concealers.</li>
            <li>It REALLY does make a difference.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this really corrects or dramatically fixes.</li>
            <li>Not irritating</li>
            <li>Shipping was really fast and products arrived so fast</li>
            <li>It really does plump up the eye area and soften lines</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very emollient, and makes your skin feel plumped, and no swelling in the morning.</li>
            <li>but it really is a sample size.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li>Skin is smooth and eyes appear much younger.</li>
            <li>Really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li>really like this product for my eyes .</li>
            <li>The days I remember to use it twice a day really make a difference &#x3D;</li>
            <li>This works better than any other.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t cause those white bumps that can appear when a cream is too rich.  </li>
            <li>while I can&#x27;t say that is because of this or any other makeup, she seems to love this stuff</li>
            <li>Is it better than other eye creams?</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t apply it during the day when i&#x27;ll be blinking and more active.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but until I&#x27;m ready for injections or the knife, this is as far as I&#x27;m willing to go.</li>
            <li>and I can already tell a difference in the smoothness around the outside corners of my eyes, where smile lines first appear.</li>
            <li>In just a few short days I honestly can see a difference in the texture of my skin around my eyes!</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream melts my fine lines instantly and leaves no residue, nice and thick</li>
            <li>This product did not bother my eyes as some products tend to do, but for the price I would expect to see better then average results.  </li>
            <li>I also get some kind of funky bumps on my eyelids that I have had removed by a dermatologist in the past, but this product removed those in time as well.  </li>
            <li>Plus it makes a decent under makeup moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and it is looking overall better with the recent</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought this product with high hopes</li>
            <li>Came highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 yrs old, soon to be 64, and have tried many other skin care products.</li>
            <li>, i wont know if i love it for a little while.</li>
            <li>Skinceuticals A.G.E. has really made a difference in the dark circles looking lighter and the fine lines have disappeared...</li>
            <li>My favorite eye cream, hands down!</li>
            <li>They fade as soon as I put the cream on, but once the cream is absorbed, they come back</li>
            <li>I have thin, fair skin and dark circles are a huge problem.</li>
            <li>I had dark under eye circles and was beginning to get fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;More\\&quot; magazine recently ranked this product among the top ten skin care products voted on by its female readers.  </li>
            <li>Even with the cost of shipping, it was a better price than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, which is where I usually purchase it.</li>
            <li>First off, there is no topical product out there that is going to replace plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>I had noticed pretty severe creping of my eyelids, especially upon awakening.</li>
            <li>This is my second jar, about 6 mos have passed since I finished the first one.</li>
            <li>does help diffuse the light a bit and make it less pronounced.</li>
            <li>After using the trial-sized cream (from my skin pro team :))for 1 1/2 weeks I have noticed a definite improvement in the dark circles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, as far as lasting results, and tightening the fine lines around the eye, its performance is fair to mid-land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product, but I will be searching for one far less expensive and just, if not more effective.</li>
            <li>I have seen marked improvement in eye area.</li>
            <li>So far my puffiness has been reduced and the are around my eyes is less&lt;br /&gt;dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the eye cream product about five weeks, so I can&#x27;t tell much of a change, but I&#x27;ll stick with it, since the CE Ferrulic has made me a believer.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>My mom is 72 years old but she looks like she is 50 and</li>
            <li>This product really helps out with my under eye bags with regular use.</li>
            <li>This product has diminished them, they aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li>Further, when you call their number, it says they are a \\&quot;travel agency\\&quot; and \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; office.</li>
            <li>While I do not have sensitive skin, it made my skin tingle upon application, and I could feel this \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; effect for up to 15 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li>I mean, this stuff is like magic.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li>I think I bought the eye cream because I was on such a high from the fabulous facial that I just needed to take a piece of it home with me in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t come down from my &#x27;facial high&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming months.</li>
            <li>The address on their return lable is different than the address the have listed with the New York Secretary of State.  </li>
            <li>Seasonal allergies seem to be a major factor.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected too much but thought the price might mean more obvious results.  </li>
            <li>know this brand is a little pricey but to us it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but the product is very thick, which i love.</li>
            <li>I continue to use it because I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark circles and the beginnings of bags.</li>
            <li>So far, Skinceutical products are the only products that have made any noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>but they definitely aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li>It is true that if you have been neglecting your skin, it is possible to see some immediate results as you supply what your skin has been missing.  </li>
            <li>It does take some massaging but it glides well, due to the high amount of silicon in the cream (which is not necessarily a good thing either, but most creams contain them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely prone to dry skin, and this is very nourishing around my eyes, and yes, it does help with the &#x27;creping&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>Any derm will tell you to allow 4-6 weeks to see results because that&#x27;s how long it takes for new skin cells to reach the surface.  </li>
            <li>By the second or third day, they were completely gone!  </li>
            <li>After a few days, the tingling only increased, and my whole eye area got very sensitive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li>I really do think that this product helps to reduce the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have never tried any eye cream without using an eye serum because my skin is dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Not sure how much difference I notice as far as puffiness etc...</li>
            <li>what I liked : the texture is very thick and on the firm side -</li>
            <li>but about as much as any other eye creams I have tried I guess!!</li>
            <li>I have deep set eyes which can look very dark, this really helps them look brighter.</li>
            <li>I have tried several high end brands and AGE beats them all hands down.  </li>

            <li> It really is a great product</li>
            <li> I am not to happy with this product.</li>
            <li> However, iit keeps my eye area well moisturized and am happy with the results</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> What are all the great reviews about??</li>
            <li> Works great at smoothing lines and wrinkles around my eyes.</li>
            <li> They are the very best and most healing products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is a really good product.</li>
            <li> so I give it a good rating for that</li>
            <li> It does not do a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The price is always good on Amazon and can&#x27;t beat the convenience.</li>
            <li> Product seems like good quality</li>
            <li> Not as good as Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> An exceptional skin cream, it was recommended by my skin care practitioner &amp; I can see why.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best you can see the difference in a short time, all Skin Ceuticals products are the best.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product line for about 6 months and very pleased</li>
            <li> This one has a lot, so the feel is good and it will give a nice optical effect upon application).</li>
            <li> i love this eye cream!  </li>
            <li> tingles at first, but it is the best.</li>
            <li> I love all Skinceutical Products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a treatment, so you do have to keep using it on occasion, but it&#x27;s an excellent product and does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li> Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Truly an amazing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I think this product is effective.</li>
            <li> Skin Ceuticals are awesome very healing skin care products.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time, unopened, in good condition and authentic.</li>
            <li> it is 0.5 ounce of product - really Skinceuticals that is the best you can do?  </li>
            <li> Great results and worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them All and by far THE Best eye cream out there!</li>
            <li> This cream is an excellent eye treatment for mature skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 31 and have had very fine lines around my eyes since I was 18.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I experienced an improvement and since using this eye cream morning and</li>
            <li> Smooths fine lines nicely.</li>
            <li> I use almost exclusively Skinceuticals products, but this is not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> This eye cream is the richest, most emollient I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> the circles under my eyes are more pronounced and puffy.</li>
            <li> Btw, I&#x27;m 37, healthy and stay out of the sun now.</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Love the way my eye circles have disappeared.</li>
            <li> evening I have more firmness around my eye area.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I can feel the firmness it gives, while most eyecream did nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> It is my all time favorite eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I would love this product if it didn&#x27;t come in a jar</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that this works any better than Clarins.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how many products that I gave her went unused and then for some mystical reason</li>
            <li> and now she calls me to get her more before the jar runs out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The thing I love about this eye cream is that I can wear it during the day over the AOX  Eye Gel and under my concealer without my makeup and mascara smearing or caking.  </li>
            <li> However, the transformation has been a bit more gradual than the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> More of a distance run than a race.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love, love love it.</li>
            <li> I affixed it and took it to the post office wherein they put the appropriate postage on it.  </li>
            <li> I love their eye cream, no doubt the whole line is great.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the Eye Balm better.</li>
            <li> had to stop using it, which is a bummer since I love everything else about it, and it cost so</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to use a prescription cream more than once a day for a skin condition I have.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the most amazing product EVER!  </li>
            <li> but mainly for the great price..</li>
            <li> If you want a eye product that is going to really make and repair lines, dark circles, make your eyes look beautiful and healthy, spend the money this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this whole product line makes the skin feel so good and healthy .</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m far from 30, but it&#x27;s nice to look good \\&quot;for</li>
            <li> i have been making my own eye cream with better success...</li>
            <li> but I just feel like it stops being as effective so quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it, i don&#x27;t expect it to completely eliminate all darkness and swelling, but i&#x27;m happy with the 50%+ reduction in signs.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> Around my eyes became more smooth without rinkles.</li>
            <li> still a good deal compared to the .5 ounce jar for twice as much.</li>
            <li> But for people who have been taking good care of their skin all along, it takes time, patience, and consistency to see real improvement.  </li>
            <li> After \\&quot;putting in my time\\&quot; and seeing great results (from their other moisturizers as well), I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> After researching other products, this one looks like the best</li>
            <li> You will see a difference very quick</li>
            <li> I liked very much.</li>
            <li> I am going to add the AOX eye serum in the mornings to my routine with the AGE Eye cream to see if there is any improvement in the fine lines.</li>
            <li> my review: The eye cream is excellent with circulation and works on black circles, reducing puffiness and some sagging.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling effect when you put it on and takes care of some puffiness and seems to work well on fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product also has helped with the smoothness  of the skin around my eyes and has helped with the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> , and this is a huge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy enough with it to continue using it.</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> Saw improvement but not as much as I would have liked to for the cost.</li>
            <li> Although the packaging says it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;mature skin,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s great for those on the younger side considering a good early wrinkle protection measure.</li>
            <li> Skin smooth and wrinkles not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> THAT IS WHY THEY SELL STUFF SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product that does what it says.</li>
            <li> After having tried many eye cream that didn&#x27;t work, this one really seems to!  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have tried in the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I realize most people are satisfied with this cream, but you must know about this if you have sensitive skin, or a known reactivity to menthol.</li>
            <li> It is either too strong or has some rare item i am allergic to.</li>
            <li> I find the cream overall to be a good cream.  </li>
            <li> : each full tube weighs .2 ounces.</li>
            <li> I love how this product feels, too - an intense tingling that feels like it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I had a sample from my beautician and ended up buying the full size.</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year Caucasian female with fair skin and olive under tones.  </li>
            <li> Really nice for mature skin.</li>
            <li> I tried Lancome Progres before this product and it was super moisturizing</li>
            <li> If you knew me personally, you&#x27;d know I rarely get excited over a product, and I even more rarely go over the top with accolades, but this stuff is an exception</li>
            <li> its ok - kind of too thick to go on very smoothly over very tender eye area!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceutical products for several years and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Best eye repair, wear every am, pm I am in my 50&#x27;s and my skin is so soft and smooth, no pours and it looks like a baby&#x27;s skin because of this line and sunblock everyday.  </li>
            <li> Great for dark circles, dryness, and wrinkle prevention.</li>
            <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser).</li>
            <li> While this eye cream certainly moisturizes, I have not seen any difference in the appearance of fine lines in over a year.</li>
            <li> This brand is first class!</li>
            <li> Got my sagging skin to go away, Thanks Skinceuticals!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed a reduction in fine lines around my eyes and it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my sensitive white mature skin.</li>
            <li> Worth the price</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are still there when I smile, but they don&#x27;t stick around when I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will continue and re-evaluate whether it&#x27;s worth $60 or not.</li>
            <li> However, I do not feel it is worth the money charged for the cream.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I still have close to a months worth of cream</li>
            <li> Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> (i dont think any product would be able to completely get rid of mine).</li>
            <li> The product never stings and is well absorbed, not feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money as</li>
            <li> I hope with more use the dark circles will diminish more.  </li>
            <li> My facial person recommended this product line to me several years ago and I have been happily using it ever since.  </li>
            <li> Meant for moisturizing &amp; rejuvenation, it is even effective in healing extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products for fine lines and dark circles around my eyes (both over-the-counter and prescription/medical grade).</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;d probably see even better results with twice daily.</li>
            <li> Have had some dryness in under eye area, has been much better since starting using this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell the difference when I run out and don&#x27;t wear it for a week or more</li>
            <li> My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic</li>
            <li> This may be because some of the ingredients are air and light sensitive and continue to get exposed to both these things via the jar packaging.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t switch because I do really like the way it wears and feels!</li>
            <li> Simply the most hydrating eye cream I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Also, the package, which had more than enough postage on it, was NEVER RETURNED TO ME</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminished and my lids in general look firmer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my whole eye area.</li>
            <li> It certainly lightens and brightens around the eye area, and its texture is silky and glimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li> In about two weeks I really started to see significant improvement in fine lines, puffiness, dark circles and crepy skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> After a few months of using it in combination with a good cleanser, toner, and moisturizer/sunscreen morning and night, I am pleased to report that the skin around my eyes is firmer, clearer, and less crepey.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much on the reduction of puffiness.</li>
            <li> I wear some makeup but haven&#x27;t experimented much with concealers.</li>
            <li> It REALLY does make a difference.</li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this really corrects or dramatically fixes.</li>
            <li> Not irritating</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast and products arrived so fast</li>
            <li> It really does plump up the eye area and soften lines</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very emollient, and makes your skin feel plumped, and no swelling in the morning.</li>
            <li> but it really is a sample size.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> Skin is smooth and eyes appear much younger.</li>
            <li> Really like this eye cream.</li>
            <li> really like this product for my eyes .</li>
            <li> The days I remember to use it twice a day really make a difference &#x3D;</li>
            <li> This works better than any other.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t cause those white bumps that can appear when a cream is too rich.  </li>
            <li> while I can&#x27;t say that is because of this or any other makeup, she seems to love this stuff</li>
            <li> Is it better than other eye creams?</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t apply it during the day when i&#x27;ll be blinking and more active.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but until I&#x27;m ready for injections or the knife, this is as far as I&#x27;m willing to go.</li>
            <li> and I can already tell a difference in the smoothness around the outside corners of my eyes, where smile lines first appear.</li>
            <li> In just a few short days I honestly can see a difference in the texture of my skin around my eyes!</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream melts my fine lines instantly and leaves no residue, nice and thick</li>
            <li> This product did not bother my eyes as some products tend to do, but for the price I would expect to see better then average results.  </li>
            <li> I also get some kind of funky bumps on my eyelids that I have had removed by a dermatologist in the past, but this product removed those in time as well.  </li>
            <li> Plus it makes a decent under makeup moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and it is looking overall better with the recent</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 yrs old, soon to be 64, and have tried many other skin care products.</li>
            <li> , i wont know if i love it for a little while.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals A.G.E. has really made a difference in the dark circles looking lighter and the fine lines have disappeared...</li>
            <li> My favorite eye cream, hands down!</li>
            <li> They fade as soon as I put the cream on, but once the cream is absorbed, they come back</li>
            <li> I have thin, fair skin and dark circles are a huge problem.</li>
            <li> I had dark under eye circles and was beginning to get fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;More\\&quot; magazine recently ranked this product among the top ten skin care products voted on by its female readers.  </li>
            <li> Even with the cost of shipping, it was a better price than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, which is where I usually purchase it.</li>
            <li> First off, there is no topical product out there that is going to replace plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> I had noticed pretty severe creping of my eyelids, especially upon awakening.</li>
            <li> This is my second jar, about 6 mos have passed since I finished the first one.</li>
            <li> does help diffuse the light a bit and make it less pronounced.</li>
            <li> After using the trial-sized cream (from my skin pro team :))for 1 1/2 weeks I have noticed a definite improvement in the dark circles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, as far as lasting results, and tightening the fine lines around the eye, its performance is fair to mid-land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product, but I will be searching for one far less expensive and just, if not more effective.</li>
            <li> I have seen marked improvement in eye area.</li>
            <li> So far my puffiness has been reduced and the are around my eyes is less&lt;br /&gt;dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 31 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the eye cream product about five weeks, so I can&#x27;t tell much of a change, but I&#x27;ll stick with it, since the CE Ferrulic has made me a believer.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> My mom is 72 years old but she looks like she is 50 and</li>
            <li> This product really helps out with my under eye bags with regular use.</li>
            <li> This product has diminished them, they aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li> Further, when you call their number, it says they are a \\&quot;travel agency\\&quot; and \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; office.</li>
            <li> While I do not have sensitive skin, it made my skin tingle upon application, and I could feel this \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; effect for up to 15 minutes afterwards.</li>
            <li> I mean, this stuff is like magic.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I think I bought the eye cream because I was on such a high from the fabulous facial that I just needed to take a piece of it home with me in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t come down from my &#x27;facial high&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming months.</li>
            <li> The address on their return lable is different than the address the have listed with the New York Secretary of State.  </li>
            <li> Seasonal allergies seem to be a major factor.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much but thought the price might mean more obvious results.  </li>
            <li> know this brand is a little pricey but to us it is worth it.</li>
            <li> but the product is very thick, which i love.</li>
            <li> I continue to use it because I have such sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark circles and the beginnings of bags.</li>
            <li> So far, Skinceutical products are the only products that have made any noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> but they definitely aren&#x27;t completely gone</li>
            <li> It is true that if you have been neglecting your skin, it is possible to see some immediate results as you supply what your skin has been missing.  </li>
            <li> It does take some massaging but it glides well, due to the high amount of silicon in the cream (which is not necessarily a good thing either, but most creams contain them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely prone to dry skin, and this is very nourishing around my eyes, and yes, it does help with the &#x27;creping&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Any derm will tell you to allow 4-6 weeks to see results because that&#x27;s how long it takes for new skin cells to reach the surface.  </li>
            <li> By the second or third day, they were completely gone!  </li>
            <li> After a few days, the tingling only increased, and my whole eye area got very sensitive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I really do think that this product helps to reduce the dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried any eye cream without using an eye serum because my skin is dry and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how much difference I notice as far as puffiness etc...</li>
            <li> what I liked : the texture is very thick and on the firm side -</li>
            <li> but about as much as any other eye creams I have tried I guess!!</li>
            <li> I have deep set eyes which can look very dark, this really helps them look brighter.</li>
            <li> I have tried several high end brands and AGE beats them all hands down.  </li>
            <li> and although it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s worth every penny because it WORKS!!  </li>
            <li> I like it but since starting it I have had a constant itchy dry spot on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes even when I was young.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see a difference.  </li>
            <li> It is a long lasting eye cream over eye serum.  </li>
            <li> My upper lids started looking dry and</li>
            <li> First application, and in a few hours the dark circles under my eyes literally started disappearing.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I saw a marked improvement within a few weeks and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s frustrating - at this price point - to not see results right away, but it takes years to get wrinkles, so it stands to reason they won&#x27;t go away overnight.</li>
            <li> Over time (i.e. the last 2 months), I&#x27;m noticing that the little wrinkles under my eyes are starting to disappear, too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years, and I don&#x27;t have the dark circles that I had prior to using it.  </li>
            <li> and you only need a little bit for each eye.  </li>
            <li> when applied--at least on my skin, which is sensitive, i admit--but doesn&#x27;t quite get to the point of burning/stinging.</li>
            <li> each empty tube weighs .1 ounces.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this cream on Amazon, but on an authorized retailer website (be careful,</li>
            <li> I am curious about the results after a linger time</li>
            <li> but this stuff resolved my dry skin, wrinkles and dark circles</li>
            <li> The puffiness and black circles (which weren&#x27;t bad at all) don&#x27;t really appear much anymore</li>
            <li> I use two different eye serums and it doesn&#x27;t matter which serum is used, as Skinceuticals Eye Complex works over either one and my under eye stays hydrated all day long.  </li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dark circles were gone.....until my jar was empty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and also use other Skinceutical and Skin Medica products, but won&#x27;t use anything else for eyes.</li>
            <li> It is a bit thicker than other products and not runny.  </li>
            <li> Product is a little expensive but it is  worth the money.</li>
            <li> The dark circles were improved but I found out from my derm that the dark circles I have are \\&quot;stained\\&quot;, the pigment has permanently discolored the skin (I was told this was melatonin that built up)</li>
            <li> -- the dark circles under my eyes re-appear.</li>
            <li> I started to see me dark circles disappear after the 2 application.</li>
            <li> i think it sort of has diminished my dark circles</li>
            <li> As for the dark circles, since mine are genetic, there isn&#x27;t an eye cream around that will eliminate them although AGE eye cream has softened their appearance.</li>
            <li> I see no difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are reduced and my eyes seem smoother.  </li>
            <li> It works on dark circles and puffiness and that&#x27;s all I care about.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t just plunk down your money and buy your wrinkles away.</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be put off by the small size for the price point; a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than 1 month and do see a difference in the firmness in my eye area.  </li>
            <li> Ii live in Minnesota where it&#x27;s cold and dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have pale skin and almost always have dark puffy circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> calmed the wrinkles/crows feet a little.</li>
            <li> I had very dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> and I think they&#x27;ve actually gotten worse.  </li>
            <li> but I feel like it starts to wear off after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> All too often people will try a product for just a few days or a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it less than once a week!  </li>
            <li> I have failed to see any overall transformation from using this cream versus another brand.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I would buy again or recommed to a friend.</li>
            <li> and I usually just pat a bit on my ring finger for application</li>
            <li> Only downside is it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> The crepeiness around my eyes is a thing of the past.  </li>
            <li> I had a small amount of scar tissue on my eyelid and repeated use of this product removed it.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive and the jar is so so so TINY!!!</li>
            <li> Really no better than Olay or Loreal, and I have tried a lot of them.</li>
            <li> I could tell no difference in this than my usual eye cream  that cost about half/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SkinCeuticals AGE eye complex morning and night for about a year on the advice of my esthetician, after I saw the beginnings of crows feet and crepiness under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have been using A.G.E. Eye Complex morning and night for four months now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a lotion type of girl, I like my creams on the thick side, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean think about it...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it at this price (although it&#x27;s not quite as expensive through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But, I wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Its very thick and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> but I keep coming back to this one (and regret wasting my money on bad substitutes for it).</li>
            <li> Already reordered at least 3 times!</li>
            <li> a little disappointing</li>
            <li> I have bad allergies which give me dark circles and swollen undereyes and this cleared it up and makes me look awake!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it makes the cream irritating for some people.</li>
            <li> I became obsessed with getting rid of them and tried a handful of eye creams from Lancome and the Avocado eye cream from Kiehls.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the eye cream always creeps and irritates my eyes.</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes appears smoother and not as thin!</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> When they don&#x27;t see the results they were anticipating, they think the product has failed.  </li>
            <li> sorry to say, this product did nothing for me...</li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> I had to sick Amazon on them.  </li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with their products!!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have&#x27;t seen in my life product without expiration date</li>
            <li> This works better than any other. Worth the price</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.  I have been using this product for a long time.  I have seen marked improvement in eye area.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  I get a lot of complements on my great skin and I attribute it to this product.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;More\\&quot; magazine recently ranked this product among the top ten skin care products voted on by its female readers.  It certainly lightens and brightens around the eye area, and its texture is silky and glimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as lasting results, and tightening the fine lines around the eye, its performance is fair to mid-land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this product, but I will be searching for one far less expensive and just, if not more effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great eye cream!  If you&#x27;re patient, you will notice a difference - ten days isn&#x27;t enough.  I&#x27;m definitely prone to dry skin, and this is very nourishing around my eyes, and yes, it does help with the &#x27;creping&#x27;.  Skinceuticals makes a great product that my dermatologist both recommends and uses in her practice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SkinCeuticals AGE eye complex morning and night for about a year on the advice of my esthetician, after I saw the beginnings of crows feet and crepiness under my eyes. I was 35 when I started using it. After a few months of using it in combination with a good cleanser, toner, and moisturizer/sunscreen morning and night, I am pleased to report that the skin around my eyes is firmer, clearer, and less crepey. The wrinkles are still there when I smile, but they don&#x27;t stick around when I&#x27;m not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a note for some reviewers who use a product for a couple weeks and then say it \\&quot;doesn&#x27;t work\\&quot;... People - yes, it&#x27;s frustrating - at this price point - to not see results right away, but it takes years to get wrinkles, so it stands to reason they won&#x27;t go away overnight. You can&#x27;t just plunk down your money and buy your wrinkles away. Even the Skinceuticals site says it takes weeks or months to see results. You have to allow time to let your skin cell layers turn over. After \\&quot;putting in my time\\&quot; and seeing great results (from their other moisturizers as well), I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Pricey for a tiny jar. I think it takes a couple of months to see results. I will continue and re-evaluate whether it&#x27;s worth $60 or not.</li>
            <li> I use almost exclusively Skinceuticals products, but this is not my favorite.  I am 31 and have had very fine lines around my eyes since I was 18. I became obsessed with getting rid of them and tried a handful of eye creams from Lancome and the Avocado eye cream from Kiehls.  Then I decided to give this product a try.  While this eye cream certainly moisturizes, I have not seen any difference in the appearance of fine lines in over a year. I continue to use it because I have such sensitive skin and this seems to be the only one that doesn&#x27;t migrate into my eyes and irriate my eyes. I tried Lancome Progres before this product and it was super moisturizing and I noticed smoothing of lines. Unfortunately the eye cream always creeps and irritates my eyes. I am going to add the AOX eye serum in the mornings to my routine with the AGE Eye cream to see if there is any improvement in the fine lines. I can&#x27;t say much on the reduction of puffiness. I don&#x27;t experience puffy eyes often enough to know if this rids them.</li>
            <li> I find the cream overall to be a good cream.  However, I do not feel it is worth the money charged for the cream.  I have failed to see any overall transformation from using this cream versus another brand.  Not sure I would buy again or recommed to a friend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  In about two weeks I really started to see significant improvement in fine lines, puffiness, dark circles and crepy skin around the eyes. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fair skin and dark circles are a huge problem. Seasonal allergies seem to be a major factor. After using the trial-sized cream (from my skin pro team :))for 1 1/2 weeks I have noticed a definite improvement in the dark circles. After researching other products, this one looks like the best and I have already seen improvement in a short time. I would recommend this to other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Editing my review: The eye cream is excellent with circulation and works on black circles, reducing puffiness and some sagging. The dark circles were improved but I found out from my derm that the dark circles I have are \\&quot;stained\\&quot;, the pigment has permanently discolored the skin (I was told this was melatonin that built up) so I am using a lightening product on the circles. I still use the eye cream! It is a really good product.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is the richest, most emollient I&#x27;ve ever used. Even with the cost of shipping, it was a better price than at my dermatologist&#x27;s office, which is where I usually purchase it. I highly recommend it, especially for those with dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product did not bother my eyes as some products tend to do, but for the price I would expect to see better then average results.  It&#x27;s a thick cream and you do not need to use a lot, and although it does soften some of the lines, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m impressed with the product. I will continue to use till it&#x27;s gone, but I can&#x27;t say I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> i love this eye cream!  tingles at first, but it is the best.</li>
            <li> I think this product is effective. I have pale skin and almost always have dark puffy circles under my eyes. I wear some makeup but haven&#x27;t experimented much with concealers. Even if i could disguise the purple, the puffiness would still be present. I only use it once daily, not twice daily so i&#x27;d probably see even better results with twice daily. It does tingle when applied--at least on my skin, which is sensitive, i admit--but doesn&#x27;t quite get to the point of burning/stinging. I&#x27;m happy enough with it to continue using it. I see a reduction in the purple color and puffiness when i apply it at nighttime. It does get in my eyes some so i don&#x27;t apply it during the day when i&#x27;ll be blinking and more active. When i sleep, it doesn&#x27;t migrate into my eyes.  I can definitely tell when i forget to apply it before sleeping. the circles under my eyes are more pronounced and puffy. I&#x27;ll continue to use it, i don&#x27;t expect it to completely eliminate all darkness and swelling, but i&#x27;m happy with the 50%+ reduction in signs.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: each full tube weighs .2 ounces. each empty tube weighs .1 ounces. a little disappointing but you&#x27;re still getting 6 tubes with .1 ounce of product, for a total of .6 ounces. still a good deal compared to the .5 ounce jar for twice as much.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have tried others but always come back to this one.  Nothing I have found works as well, and I have tried a lot of them.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Have had some dryness in under eye area, has been much better since starting using this eye cream.  I keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to see a difference.  I just don&#x27;t like how the product appears greasy.</li>
            <li> My facial person recommended this product line to me several years ago and I have been happily using it ever since.  Great results and worth the price.</li>
            <li> First off, there is no topical product out there that is going to replace plastic surgery. That said, I&#x27;ve been using this skinceuticals eye cream for a couple of years and I can definitely tell the difference when I run out and don&#x27;t wear it for a week or more -- the dark circles under my eyes re-appear. I won&#x27;t travel without this stuff. It&#x27;s pricey, but until I&#x27;m ready for injections or the knife, this is as far as I&#x27;m willing to go. It REALLY does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using A.G.E. Eye Complex morning and night for four months now.  The puffiness and black circles (which weren&#x27;t bad at all) don&#x27;t really appear much anymore but the crows feet and crepiness are still there.  They fade as soon as I put the cream on, but once the cream is absorbed, they come back and I think they&#x27;ve actually gotten worse.  I still have close to a months worth of cream left so will see if it will start to make a difference in this next month.  If not, I will have to ask my esthetician what else she recomends.  Btw, I&#x27;m 37, healthy and stay out of the sun now.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream melts my fine lines instantly and leaves no residue, nice and thick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful! Around my eyes became more smooth without rinkles. I liked very much. I recomend to use. Really works. Monica-Brazil</li>
            <li> Goes on really smooth. Moisturizes well and can see a difference in my eyes.</li>
            <li> Saw improvement but not as much as I would have liked to for the cost.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream I have used.  It was recommended to me by a dermatologist and it is truly wonderful.  I have bad allergies which give me dark circles and swollen undereyes and this cleared it up and makes me look awake!</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark circles and the beginnings of bags. I don&#x27;t think this really corrects or dramatically fixes. But I do feel like while its on it does help diffuse the light a bit and make it less pronounced. Plus it makes a decent under makeup moisturizer. No issues with my concealer drying out under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have used every brand imaginable after one month I noticed a visible difference. I love all Skinceutical Products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a ton of eye creams with claims of miracles......this one comes through. This product was recommended to me when having a facial. I think I bought the eye cream because I was on such a high from the fabulous facial that I just needed to take a piece of it home with me in hopes I wouldn&#x27;t come down from my &#x27;facial high&#x27;. I started to see me dark circles disappear after the 2 application. My dark circles were gone.....until my jar was empty. I went two months without A.G.E. until I received this shipment yesterday. I used it last night and this morning....it&#x27;s already working!!! Worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> Its one of the best on the market</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years and nothing works as well around my eyes. I&#x27;m 49 and also use other Skinceutical and Skin Medica products, but won&#x27;t use anything else for eyes.</li>
            <li> After having tried many eye cream that didn&#x27;t work, this one really seems to!  So far my puffiness has been reduced and the are around my eyes is less&lt;br /&gt;dry after using this product!  Love it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be awesome... I have always had dark circles under my eyes even when I was young.  Skinceuticals A.G.E. has really made a difference in the dark circles looking lighter and the fine lines have disappeared... I&#x27;m happy to have found this product!  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for less than 1 month and do see a difference in the firmness in my eye area.  Has also helped with puffiness.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the most amazing product EVER!  I mean, this stuff is like magic.  If you knew me personally, you&#x27;d know I rarely get excited over a product, and I even more rarely go over the top with accolades, but this stuff is an exception and although it&#x27;s expensive, it&#x27;s worth every penny because it WORKS!!  First application, and in a few hours the dark circles under my eyes literally started disappearing.  By the second or third day, they were completely gone!  I&#x27;ve never seen a product like this before!!  It only takes a very small amount under the eyes.  Over time (i.e. the last 2 months), I&#x27;m noticing that the little wrinkles under my eyes are starting to disappear, too.  It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34;, it&#x27;s a treatment, so you do have to keep using it on occasion, but it&#x27;s an excellent product and does exactly what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> I recently started using this product at the recommendation of my dermatologist. Although the packaging says it&#x27;s for &amp;#34;mature skin,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s great for those on the younger side considering a good early wrinkle protection measure. I&#x27;m 31 years old and I can already tell a difference in the smoothness around the outside corners of my eyes, where smile lines first appear. I love how this product feels, too - an intense tingling that feels like it&#x27;s working. Don&#x27;t be put off by the small size for the price point; a little goes a long way and I usually just pat a bit on my ring finger for application and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my whole eye area.</li>
            <li> I began using Skin Ceuticals about 10 months ago and won&#x27;t ever use anything else.  Love the way my eye circles have disappeared.</li>
            <li> Just as it said to be . Thank you</li>
            <li> It is a long lasting eye cream over eye serum.  I have never tried any eye cream without using an eye serum because my skin is dry and sensitive.  I use two different eye serums and it doesn&#x27;t matter which serum is used, as Skinceuticals Eye Complex works over either one and my under eye stays hydrated all day long.  Not irritating and it doesn&#x27;t cause those white bumps that can appear when a cream is too rich.  It is perfect for my sensitive white mature skin.</li>
            <li> I find it a very good eye cream.  I&#x27;ve only started using it but have noticed some differences in the eye area. Highly recommended.  Only downside is it&#x27;s a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Skinceutical products for several years and am very pleased with the results. I had noticed pretty severe creping of my eyelids, especially upon awakening. The first time I used this product I experienced an improvement and since using this eye cream morning and evening I have more firmness around my eye area. I&#x27;m 63 yrs old, soon to be 64, and have tried many other skin care products. So far, Skinceutical products are the only products that have made any noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> it helped with the puffiness. calmed the wrinkles/crows feet a little. nothing is a miracle though. but it did help.</li>
            <li> Love this product! You will see a difference very quick</li>
            <li> Shipping was really fast and products arrived so fast I love it I would totally purchase again !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them All and by far THE Best eye cream out there! Already reordered at least 3 times!</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much but thought the price might mean more obvious results.  I&#x27;ll go ahead and use it and see if there&#x27;s a difference but for now, after a month, I don&#x27;t see results.</li>
            <li> I have been using the skinceuticals CE Ferrulic since January (my favorite product so far along with the simply clean cleanser). In the past month I added AOX+ Eye gel in a.m. and A.G.E. eye cream at night, Phyto corrective gel in morning and evening, retexturing activator in evening and after my moisturizer (Aveeno ultra calming) I add in the morning the Skinceuticals physical UV defense spf 30 sunscreen. My skin started looking brighter when I first started the CE Ferrulic and it is looking overall better with the recent additions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using the eye cream product about five weeks, so I can&#x27;t tell much of a change, but I&#x27;ll stick with it, since the CE Ferrulic has made me a believer. I&#x27;m losing weight and fear that will increase the crows feet by my eyes. I hope the eye creams minimize that. Time will tell. I had read the product is supposed to prevent creping. I have no idea what creping means, so I don&#x27;t know if I have it or if the product prevents it (LOL). Again, overall, people have noticed a change in my skin, stating it looks brighter and &amp;#34;great&amp;#34; without solicitation. I will edit my review or write a new one if I notice anything different in the coming months.</li>
            <li> I am seriously impressed with this eye cream! In just a few short days I honestly can see a difference in the texture of my skin around my eyes! The skin under my eyes appears smoother and not as thin! Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I like its texture. I can feel the firmness it gives, while most eyecream did nothing. I just wish it came in a tube not a jar!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.  It is so creamy and you only need a little bit for each eye.  It is my all time favorite eye cream.  I would highly recommend it.  It is truly a product that works.</li>
            <li> I would love this product if it didn&#x27;t come in a jar and it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. It really does plump up the eye area and soften lines but I feel like it starts to wear off after a few weeks of use. This may be because some of the ingredients are air and light sensitive and continue to get exposed to both these things via the jar packaging. I have gotten similar results from just using my facial moisturizers on my eye area, so to me it&#x27;s not worth it at this price (although it&#x27;s not quite as expensive through Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be my forever eye cream and I would buy it by the pound if it came in a different pump or tube air-tight packaging. It really is a great product but I just feel like it stops being as effective so quickly. Skinceuticals- please change the packaging! It has so much potential!</li>
            <li> This is medical grade skincare that you won&#x27;t find in the department stores.&lt;br /&gt;No fluffy luxurious scent only real results.&lt;br /&gt;I am 50 and people tell me I look 25.</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals eye cream smoothes eye wrinkles.</li>
            <li> So far I like it, i wont know if i love it for a little while. When i first got it i thought the container was soo small and that it would barely last but the product is very thick, which i love. doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. i think it sort of has diminished my dark circles but they definitely aren&#x27;t completely gone (i dont think any product would be able to completely get rid of mine).</li>
            <li> Best eye repair, wear every am, pm I am in my 50&#x27;s and my skin is so soft and smooth, no pours and it looks like a baby&#x27;s skin because of this line and sunblock everyday.  If you want a eye product that is going to really make and repair lines, dark circles, make your eyes look beautiful and healthy, spend the money this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this whole product line makes the skin feel so good and healthy . Have been using this product line for about 6 months and very pleased</li>
            <li> Skinceuticals has the best of the best!!  You can&#x27;t go wrong with their products!!  Finally a deep moisturizer that penetrates the dermal layers instead of just sitting on your skin to only get washed away the next morning. Will use this product again and again.</li>
            <li> All too often people will try a product for just a few days or a couple of weeks.  When they don&#x27;t see the results they were anticipating, they think the product has failed.  Any derm will tell you to allow 4-6 weeks to see results because that&#x27;s how long it takes for new skin cells to reach the surface.  It is true that if you have been neglecting your skin, it is possible to see some immediate results as you supply what your skin has been missing.  But for people who have been taking good care of their skin all along, it takes time, patience, and consistency to see real improvement.  I&#x27;ve been using AGE eye cream now for a month and am beginning to see substantial improvement.  The crepeiness around my eyes is a thing of the past.  Fine lines are diminished and my lids in general look firmer and smoother.  As for the dark circles, since mine are genetic, there isn&#x27;t an eye cream around that will eliminate them although AGE eye cream has softened their appearance.</li>
            <li> I have deep set eyes which can look very dark, this really helps them look brighter. Skin smooth and wrinkles not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Though this is sort of pricey for me, I&#x27;ll keep using it.  I had a small amount of scar tissue on my eyelid and repeated use of this product removed it.  I also get some kind of funky bumps on my eyelids that I have had removed by a dermatologist in the past, but this product removed those in time as well.  The product never stings and is well absorbed, not feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> Skin Ceuticals are awesome very healing skin care products. They are the very best and most healing products I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Killer deal, I got this for my mom because the place where she gets her facials,hair, and nails done was out of it.  My mom is 72 years old but she looks like she is 50 and while I can&#x27;t say that is because of this or any other makeup, she seems to love this stuff so I give it a good rating for that but mainly for the great price..</li>
            <li> Quality eye cream for an affordable price. Absorbs well and improves appearance of under eye area. Skinceuticals can always be trusted as a product line.</li>
            <li> sorry to say, this product did nothing for me...i have been making my own eye cream with better success...</li>
            <li> I had a sample from my beautician and ended up buying the full size. Its very thick and hard to apply. I can&#x27;t say that this works any better than Clarins. I will not repurchase this one. It does not do a good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Being a bargain shopper, Amazon offered the best price and shipping fee. Product is a little expensive but it is  worth the money. Moisturizes all day. A little goes a long way. :)</li>
            <li> I like it but since starting it I have had a constant itchy dry spot on my eyelid. It&#x27;s the only thing I use.</li>
            <li> After years of trying to get my mother on board with skincare I finally did it. I don&#x27;t even know how many products that I gave her went unused and then for some mystical reason she actually used this! Not only did she like it, but she started receiving compliments on how well rested she looked and now she calls me to get her more before the jar runs out!&lt;br /&gt;I know this brand is a little pricey but to us it is worth it.</li>
            <li> An exceptional skin cream, it was recommended by my skin care practitioner &amp; I can see why.  Meant for moisturizing &amp; rejuvenation, it is even effective in healing extremely dry skin.  Recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream! Great for dark circles, dryness, and wrinkle prevention. It is expensive so I&#x27;ve tried to stop using it a couple times over the years but I keep coming back to this one (and regret wasting my money on bad substitutes for it). I use it morning and night. The price is always good on Amazon and can&#x27;t beat the convenience.</li>
            <li> Love SkinCeuticals! Love saving $ on SkinCeuticals! The thing I love about this eye cream is that I can wear it during the day over the AOX  Eye Gel and under my concealer without my makeup and mascara smearing or caking.  A win!! And a little goes a long way. I use it morning and night. I have definitely noticed a difference in the skin around my eyes. However, the transformation has been a bit more gradual than the rest of my face. More of a distance run than a race. I won&#x27;t switch because I do really like the way it wears and feels! And I do see results! Plus I get the benefits against glycation. Product arrived on time, unopened, in good condition and authentic. Recommend seller.</li>
            <li> This product really helps out with my under eye bags with regular use.</li>
            <li> I use this every mooring. Keep refrigerated. Love it</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a month. I see no difference in my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Dark circles are reduced and my eyes seem smoother.  Definitely worth the money as a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye cream I have tried in the past 10 years. It has a cooling effect when you put it on and takes care of some puffiness and seems to work well on fine lines. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product caused a burn like rash on my skin. I can&#x27;t even put it on my neck without getting a rash. It is either too strong or has some rare item i am allergic to.</li>
            <li> The best eye cream I ever used before</li>
            <li> Very good in all terms!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite eye cream, hands down!</li>
            <li> I am not to happy with this product. I get up in the morning with puffy eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  I had very dark circles under my eyes.  This product has diminished them, they aren&#x27;t completely gone but I have only been using this product for 6 months.  I hope with more use the dark circles will diminish more.  This product also has helped with the smoothness  of the skin around my eyes and has helped with the fine lines.  The skin around my eyes seems brighter and healthier.  i will certainly keep using it.</li>
            <li> I am a 32 year Caucasian female with fair skin and olive under tones.  Ii live in Minnesota where it&#x27;s cold and dry in the winter. I had dark under eye circles and was beginning to get fine lines and wrinkles under my eyes. This stuff is the real deal. It takes a while to see results but stuck with it for three weeks and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. I mean think about it...it took years for the wrinkles to appear it takes product application consistentcy and patience but this stuff resolved my dry skin, wrinkles and dark circles it also works well to prime my eyes before eye shadow.</li>
            <li> Simply the most hydrating eye cream I have ever used.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I think I have rated this before. But I will say it again. Years of use and I will not stop. Love, love love it. This brand is first class!</li>
            <li> Awesome product!  The best eye cream I have found!  Speedy delivery from Aloha!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is a bit thicker than other products and not runny.  I use it every morning after cleaning my face, and at night.  But, I wish it were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;It is quite pricey, but I like the way it feels on my skin and does not irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cream is an excellent eye treatment for mature skin.  I cannot say that I saw visible improvement in the eye area after using it for an extended period. However, iit keeps my eye area well moisturized and am happy with the results</li>
            <li> I really do think that this product helps to reduce the dark circles under my eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years, and I don&#x27;t have the dark circles that I had prior to using it.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Did not do what it claims to do. Just a moisturzier but doesn&#x27;t tighten and get rid of crows feet.</li>
            <li> These people are scam artists.  I ordered the product.  My skin lady advised me that I did not need that.  I contacted the seller for a return lable.  They never responded.  I had to sick Amazon on them.  I finally received their lable.  I affixed it and took it to the post office wherein they put the appropriate postage on it.  I did not track it.  I have friends that work for the USPS and they say that packages don&#x27;t get lost and tracking is just a way of making money.  Daily Deal said they never got it.  The address on their return lable is different than the address the have listed with the New York Secretary of State.  Yep, NYC scammers.  Further, when you call their number, it says they are a \\&quot;travel agency\\&quot; and \\&quot;real estate\\&quot; office. Why are they selling skin care products? Nobody answers and nobody returns your call.  Also, the package, which had more than enough postage on it, was NEVER RETURNED TO ME BECAUSE THEY KEPT IT.  I filed claims with Amazon but they said since I never tracked it there is no proof.  I should have, but THESE PEOPLE ARE SCAMMERS.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!  THAT IS WHY THEY SELL STUFF SO CHEAP.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and exactly as shown and described. Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar, about 6 mos have passed since I finished the first one. During that interval, I wanted to believe I could get something that gave comparable results. I was indecisive for awhile, but then I couldn&#x27;t stand it- time doesn&#x27;t wait and the skinceutical eye cream works just the best for me. Okay, I&#x27;m far from 30, but it&#x27;s nice to look good \\&quot;for my age\\&quot; which is 64. I love their eye cream, no doubt the whole line is great. But if this is all you can afford, go for it!</li>
            <li> its ok - kind of too thick to go on very smoothly over very tender eye area!! I like the consistency of the Eye Balm better. Not sure how much difference I notice as far as puffiness etc...but about as much as any other eye creams I have tried I guess!!</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on SkinCeuticals website but (of course) it hasn&#x27;t been published. I didn&#x27;t buy this cream on Amazon, but on an authorized retailer website (be careful, Amazon and any vendor here are *not* authorized by SC, so you may get an expired product, or a knock-off).&lt;br /&gt;First, what I liked : the texture is very thick and on the firm side - you may or may not like this. It does take some massaging but it glides well, due to the high amount of silicon in the cream (which is not necessarily a good thing either, but most creams contain them. This one has a lot, so the feel is good and it will give a nice optical effect upon application). It&#x27;s very emollient, and makes your skin feel plumped, and no swelling in the morning. I&#x27;m not a lotion type of girl, I like my creams on the thick side, so your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;BUT, and this is a huge BUT : it also contains a menthol derivative. While this will give it a \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; feel that some appreciate, don&#x27;t mistake this for a sign of effectiveness. Unfortunately, it makes the cream irritating for some people. While I do not have sensitive skin, it made my skin tingle upon application, and I could feel this \\&quot;fresh\\&quot; effect for up to 15 minutes afterwards. After a few days, the tingling only increased, and my whole eye area got very sensitive. Any product (including wash or morning eye cream) would sting. My upper lids started looking dry and crepey.&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using it, which is a bummer since I love everything else about it, and it cost so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone include menthol in an eye cream is beyond me. I realize most people are satisfied with this cream, but you must know about this if you have sensitive skin, or a known reactivity to menthol.</li>
            <li> I like it. Is it better than other eye creams? I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> within a week the darkness under my eyes started fading, I am a fan!!! It will continue to be part of my skinceuticals skin care</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this eye cream about two years ago because I was bothered by &amp;#34;crepeness&amp;#34; under my eyes and crows feet. I saw a marked improvement within a few weeks and have been using it ever since. Each jar lasts me three to four months, if not longer. Great product.</li>
            <li> It works on dark circles and puffiness and that&#x27;s all I care about. If you want a wrinkle cream, you probably need something in addition.</li>
            <li> What are all the great reviews about?? It is expensive and the jar is so so so TINY!!! it is 0.5 ounce of product - really Skinceuticals that is the best you can do?  Product seems like good quality but it really is a sample size. I wont order this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product with high hopes but I feel that I can buy compairable products in any drugstore.  For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> awesome!!! Been using it for years!!!! Got my sagging skin to go away, Thanks Skinceuticals!! Really nice for mature skin.</li>
            <li> A very good product! Im using every Night before sleep! And i haven&#x27;t any problem with The receive.</li>
            <li> Takes away &amp;#34;crows feet&amp;#34; around the eyes. Take a picture before and after with my wife and noticeable improvements. Skin is smooth and eyes appear much younger. Fantastic product that does what it says.</li>
            <li> Really no better than Olay or Loreal, and I have tried a lot of them. Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Really like this eye cream. I have noticed a reduction in fine lines around my eyes and it is very moisturizing. I always use the skinceuticals sunscreen especially for eyes underneath it during the day and they work well together.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. I could tell no difference in this than my usual eye cream  that cost about half/</li>
            <li> really like this product for my eyes .</li>
            <li> Simply the best.  I used to have to use a prescription cream more than once a day for a skin condition I have.  Now I use it less than once a week!  Truly an amazing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Estee Lauder.</li>
            <li> Best eye cream ever. I have tried several high end brands and AGE beats them all hands down.  Over about 3-4 weeks you can see firming and tightening of the upper lid. Smooths fine lines nicely. Have used this product for 3 years</li>
            <li> Works great at smoothing lines and wrinkles around my eyes. Came highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The days I remember to use it twice a day really make a difference &#x3D; with my caregiver memory, I have to keep trying</li>
            <li> I have tried many products for fine lines and dark circles around my eyes (both over-the-counter and prescription/medical grade). This eye cream is a keeper. I would recommend this product without hesitation. It hydrates your skin and leaves it looking brighter and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I can see a difference already after just one month.  I am curious about the results after a linger time</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best you can see the difference in a short time, all Skin Ceuticals products are the best.</li>
    </ol>
