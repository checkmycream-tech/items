            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Also, I just love the look of it!</li>
            <li>Its design is great and easy to manage when styling hair.</li>
            <li>I like my hair too much to keep them!!!!!</li>
            <li>on my own...</li>
            <li>and it came out really nice</li>
            <li>Nice.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it worked great andI loved the curls the iron made.</li>
            <li>Even at its highest heat setting, I was able to touch it with my fingers and it was just warm.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li>I read from so many web sites how this was an amazing curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, medium length colored-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quick, stays hot- and gives you awesome curls!</li>
            <li>Hot Tools always delivers a great product</li>
            <li>While it worked&amp;#60; I was basically happy with it, but even at this price, It should have lasted much longer than 7mos.!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, nice color, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>makes it a lot easier to curl your hair without touching the barrel and hurting yourself.</li>
            <li>I am in love :]</li>
            <li>They have improved the design to allow for more flexibility of the cord.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many curling irons I have owned over the years from your Target-type stores,</li>
            <li>Love the pink/silver look and am buying the hair dryer to match :)</li>
            <li>But was okay until one morning needed to use it and get to appointment</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I have switched it on and off inadvertently many, many times.  </li>
            <li>I have dropped it and banged it so many times.</li>
            <li>I should note that I use this curling iron as more of a straightener, but I am able to curl in some definition.  </li>
            <li>I love this iron.</li>
            <li>I love the way it does my hair</li>
            <li>Now I have to make sure it&#x27;s unplugged as to not start a fire or have someone get burnt.</li>
            <li>is that while I love the reliability of this curling...</li>
            <li>It took me some practice time to really get a good curl, but it came out amazing, once I got the hang of it all.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn off.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li>the light would come on but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all!</li>
            <li>Look into buying from a more reliable site/seller.</li>
            <li>I like it so much better than the ceramic one I was using before.  </li>
            <li>Somehow I did not shut it off after use and this happened on more than one occasion.  </li>
            <li>This curling worked wonderfully, until the on and off switch suddenly stopped working.  </li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>Love love love the cord never gets tangled</li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I love that the cord swivels.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a better quality... but still...  </li>
            <li>and I tend to forget :)</li>
            <li>Love it :)</li>
            <li>To girly cute and works well.  </li>
            <li>I love my hot tools curling iron, it works good.</li>
            <li>Plus its&#x27;s such an amazing price!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s even MORE awesome because it is pink.</li>
            <li>These worked great and get really hot and stay HOT!</li>
            <li>This iron does get very hot relatively quickly which I suppose is a good thing.</li>
            <li>It also seems to get accidentally switched on extremely easily...</li>
            <li>The cord tangles easily.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for over three years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>The 1 inch provides more ringlet curls, so if a softer curl is needed, a larger size will probably fair better.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools is a GREAT bargain and very reliable.</li>
            <li>I said this already, but my fine hair cannot hold a curl with this iron at all.</li>
            <li>my daughter has fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this styling tool and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys loose curls that last.thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I love Hot Tools, I have every size!  </li>
            <li>Love the Hot Tools brand!</li>
            <li>It gets very hot!  </li>
            <li>This curling iron just works fantastic..</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find the same one.  </li>
            <li>I bought this curling iron from Amazon a few months and was really impressed!</li>
            <li>I only have great things to say about it.  </li>
            <li>I have left it on and the automatic shut off is a great attribute.  </li>
            <li>overall it is a great product for the price.  </li>
            <li>it was smooth t like the barrell.  </li>
            <li>Lasted 5 months, plugged it in and light started flickering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great around my face, but for the sides and back, it&#x27;s a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They give me a smooth curl every time.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>Quick heat up and easy to use...</li>
            <li>I liked the design of the curling iron and the non-stick finish but realized very quickly that there was no automatic shutoff, a feature that I had with my old iron.  </li>
            <li>Love the Hot Tools Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li>Love hot tools curling irons.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the hot tools line.</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair and this curl lasted awhile.</li>
            <li>It curls my hair nicely and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>I wont buy any other, it works amazing curls amazing</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews and it having to be a gold box special I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it heats up so fast.  </li>
            <li>so I was able to use it on hair that didn&#x27;t need as much heat.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about the possibility of having an awesome curl for my \\&quot;Fine, thin and lifeless\\&quot; hair once again.</li>
            <li>and I love the color, pink for Breast cancer awareness) anything to get more money for the cure, helping those in need!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product due to reading all of the great reviews.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It heats really quickly and iis adjustable.</li>
            <li>, this iron works fantastic and the curls hold really well!</li>
            <li>so I needed a product that could get very hot, and this curling iron gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li>This is my first professional curling iron and I love it!  </li>
            <li>I bought this one to try and it gets very hot</li>
            <li>Curls thick and fine hair and makes beautiful ringlets.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and heats up fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this for only 14.99 to start off with so it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on my hair, and I have told everyone it is thanks to my Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li>thought it would last more than ONE YEAR at that price!</li>
            <li>First time curls have stayed all day!</li>
            <li>It is pretty!  </li>
            <li>I use this on my fine , straight hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Okay I thought I was going to love this after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s legit RIGHT where your fingers are on the handle of the tool.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s the right size</li>
            <li>This curling iron gets super hot super fast.</li>
            <li>Like I said, my hair is straight as a board, so any amount of curl gives me more volume than I have naturally!  </li>
            <li>It takes a few minutes to warm up but is VERY hot!</li>
            <li>I wold recommend it because it does get hot and does a great job on my thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Have had this for over a year - it heats up quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle, temperature really is adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I have only had this curling iron for a little over a week, but I must say I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li>This curling iron curls fast, and makes very pretty curls.</li>
            <li>Mine is not really long, but &#x27;longer&#x27; than most, and I can&#x27;t get the waves I like to make.  </li>
            <li>curling iron heats up super fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li>I did not choose to curl my bangs first.  </li>
            <li>The pink is a nice touch too, I suppose.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say however that I had a \\&quot;tight\\&quot; curl, but they fell and looked pretty.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>The on off switch can&#x27;t be moved, it is stuck on the on position but doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li>My first iron went haywire and burned my hair.  </li>
            <li>to, I have to place it higher up so that my ends don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and does the job!</li>
            <li>and it is pretty hot.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 pink hot tools PINKTITANIUM curling Irons in 2011 (1&amp;#34; and 1 1/2&amp;#34;) at first I really liked them alot.  </li>
            <li>I will get another one  in the next size up. :)</li>
            <li>I have been using the Hot Tools 1 inch ,faithfully ,for a month now.  </li>
            <li>I will be returning the product and will not be purchasing the Hot Tools brand or from FIVE Star sellers again.</li>
            <li>The barrel stays hot even after you turn it off</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would says 425</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it gets that hot.</li>
            <li>I tried it and the first time, it didn&#x27;t do so well</li>
            <li>and i think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad i bought it, now i can have different styles!</li>
            <li>This gets HOT.  </li>
            <li>Hot tools heat and stay hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for several years &amp; bought this one for when my present one wears out which might not be for many more years.</li>
            <li>I had read that the iron doesn&#x27;t heat up that quick/that hot; the iron warms up fast and is extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>i think it works better on long hair..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price I paid, because I went on vacation and forgot my curling iron and bought a cheap $10 one that worked fine for its purpose.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a large chunk of hair that is about twin he shorter than the rest....</li>
            <li>This iron makes it easy and fast to quickly go around and make soft curls that last.  </li>
            <li>I have had several curling irons in the past and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>I have been happy with this curling iron so far, heats up fast, the tip stays cool, and the clip is tight enough to hold even my hair!  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great little curling iron</li>
            <li>i have a curling wand, and a smaller curling iron, so i figured a large one would come out pretty cool.</li>
            <li>adding that the company was very apologetic and is compensating me.</li>
            <li>Curling time is minimal as you do not have to keep your hair in it for more than 2 seconds to get the curl.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This iron works very well.</li>
            <li>This baby really heats up and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even with hairspray my hair goes straight within 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li>The title really does say it all.  </li>
            <li>gets very hot...nice styling tool</li>
            <li>Curls my straight hair with ease.</li>
            <li>so I decided to order the 1.5 inch one as well since I like this one so much</li>
            <li>I am really upset and would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li>Love the pink as well.</li>
            <li>Thanks to all who wrote in.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to read the reviews before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I got the 1 1/2  inch barrel.  </li>
            <li>and I expected much better quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Products heats very well and fast.</li>
            <li>I like it a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1\\&quot; barrel and really thought about returning it for the 3/4\\&quot; diameter</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not like you really NEED one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been left on SO many times which is a major hazard!!</li>
            <li>I love my new Hot Tools Pink Titanium Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li>so I needed a new one that could get as hot fast.</li>
            <li>I would say beware and double check,to make sure it is actually OFF!</li>
            <li>However, I believe that your hair needs to be in decent shape for it to work well.</li>
            <li>I had used curling irons many years ago with similar results and this one  proved no different.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since late 2011, and I love it!</li>
            <li>The short barrel is my not reading close enough I guess, but I did think the review said for long hair, but it&#x27;s a good curling iron.  </li>
            <li>So far it works very well, heats up quickly, and has a dial to experiment with various heat settings.</li>
            <li>I plan on only using hot tools from now on!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d read that the plastic tip on the end and the plastic on the thumb-latch get so very hot; they do get a little warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that when i curl my hair it last all day and it don&#x27;t take long to curl at all because the heat setting is higher then a cheap store bought curling iron.....</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this iron: it curls my hair on low-med setting in just a few seconds and the curls stay throughout my 12 hour shifts.</li>
            <li>but i cannot put the new one in</li>
            <li>It even comes with new springs, so</li>
            <li>I bought a new one and my hair was still breaking off and frizzing.  </li>
            <li>They really heat up, curl quickly, and the curls last and last!  </li>
            <li>I love that the iron has a temperature control and curls thick hair really well.  </li>
            <li>But actually, it was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is much higher at the local stores.</li>
            <li>With my old iron, it took me over an hour to do my hair each morning; now, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li>Nothing like those drugstore brands that do nothing, these are professional tools, and the prices on Amazon cannot be beat!</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd curling iron that I have purchased by hot tools of this brand.</li>
            <li>After curling, my hair is smooth and shiny and the curls last all day long even without hair spray.</li>
            <li>Hot Tools has been a favorite of mine for several years and this particular model keeps me a fan; they heat up quickly, help my mixed race/not-chemically processed hair hold a smooth curl where other models have failed.</li>
            <li>Product is easy to use and does everything promised - lasting curls in thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is really worth the money to get the bouncy curls or loose waves you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li>the old spring tht was in there</li>
            <li>I chucked my old crappy curling irons and just use this one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy working mom of a toddler and get distracted in the morning and all curling iron&#x27;s</li>
            <li>replaced my old one that lasted for years</li>
            <li>On my old curling iron, I had it at it&#x27;s highest temp.,</li>
            <li>Saves a step, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, this did not lead to good curls.  </li>
            <li>In addition to being cute, the curling iron works really well on my thin and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>This particular iron is for short or medium hair...</li>
            <li>I looked at hundreds of different curling irons, and just when I felt like they all seemed the same I came across this Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li>I had this one for about three to four years, I really don&#x27;t recall - just a long time.  </li>
            <li>The cord design is nice too - it doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up like other irons I&#x27;ve had in the past did.  </li>
            <li>However, here are my major issues:  1)</li>
            <li>For the price on Amazon, there is no other product I will buy.</li>
            <li>Be careful with the fold down stand, that gets pretty hot, too.</li>
            <li>As I said in the title, I&#x27;m not very good at styling my hair, but this curler improved my ability significantly.</li>
            <li>I finally put away my old Conair curling iron.  </li>
            <li>such &#x27;Amazing\\&quot; results.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using my old standby curling brush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely compare this to a professional iron.</li>
            <li>I got this curling iron to try because I have super straight, thin hair and would like to change it up.  </li>
            <li>it can get very hot and heavy!</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth spending a little bit of extra money on!!</li>
            <li>I have had this curling iron for almost exactly 7 months and this morning it is completely dead.  </li>

            <li> Nice.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it it worked great andI loved the curls the iron made.</li>
            <li> Even at its highest heat setting, I was able to touch it with my fingers and it was just warm.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> I read from so many web sites how this was an amazing curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, medium length colored-treated hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quick, stays hot- and gives you awesome curls!</li>
            <li> Hot Tools always delivers a great product</li>
            <li> While it worked&amp;#60; I was basically happy with it, but even at this price, It should have lasted much longer than 7mos.!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, nice color, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> makes it a lot easier to curl your hair without touching the barrel and hurting yourself.</li>
            <li> I am in love :]</li>
            <li> They have improved the design to allow for more flexibility of the cord.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many curling irons I have owned over the years from your Target-type stores,</li>
            <li> Love the pink/silver look and am buying the hair dryer to match :)</li>
            <li> But was okay until one morning needed to use it and get to appointment</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I have switched it on and off inadvertently many, many times.  </li>
            <li> I have dropped it and banged it so many times.</li>
            <li> I should note that I use this curling iron as more of a straightener, but I am able to curl in some definition.  </li>
            <li> I love this iron.</li>
            <li> I love the way it does my hair</li>
            <li> Now I have to make sure it&#x27;s unplugged as to not start a fire or have someone get burnt.</li>
            <li> is that while I love the reliability of this curling...</li>
            <li> It took me some practice time to really get a good curl, but it came out amazing, once I got the hang of it all.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn off.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron.</li>
            <li> the light would come on but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all!</li>
            <li> Look into buying from a more reliable site/seller.</li>
            <li> I like it so much better than the ceramic one I was using before.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I did not shut it off after use and this happened on more than one occasion.  </li>
            <li> This curling worked wonderfully, until the on and off switch suddenly stopped working.  </li>
            <li> love this.</li>
            <li> Love love love the cord never gets tangled</li>
            <li> Love love love</li>
            <li> I love that the cord swivels.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a better quality... but still...  </li>
            <li> and I tend to forget :)</li>
            <li> Love it :)</li>
            <li> To girly cute and works well.  </li>
            <li> I love my hot tools curling iron, it works good.</li>
            <li> Plus its&#x27;s such an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s even MORE awesome because it is pink.</li>
            <li> These worked great and get really hot and stay HOT!</li>
            <li> This iron does get very hot relatively quickly which I suppose is a good thing.</li>
            <li> It also seems to get accidentally switched on extremely easily...</li>
            <li> The cord tangles easily.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for over three years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> The 1 inch provides more ringlet curls, so if a softer curl is needed, a larger size will probably fair better.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools is a GREAT bargain and very reliable.</li>
            <li> I said this already, but my fine hair cannot hold a curl with this iron at all.</li>
            <li> my daughter has fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this styling tool and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys loose curls that last.thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools, I have every size!  </li>
            <li> Love the Hot Tools brand!</li>
            <li> It gets very hot!  </li>
            <li> This curling iron just works fantastic..</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find the same one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron from Amazon a few months and was really impressed!</li>
            <li> I only have great things to say about it.  </li>
            <li> I have left it on and the automatic shut off is a great attribute.  </li>
            <li> overall it is a great product for the price.  </li>
            <li> it was smooth t like the barrell.  </li>
            <li> Lasted 5 months, plugged it in and light started flickering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great around my face, but for the sides and back, it&#x27;s a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They give me a smooth curl every time.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> Quick heat up and easy to use...</li>
            <li> I liked the design of the curling iron and the non-stick finish but realized very quickly that there was no automatic shutoff, a feature that I had with my old iron.  </li>

            <li> After reading the reviews and it having to be a gold box special I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it heats up so fast.  </li>
            <li> so I was able to use it on hair that didn&#x27;t need as much heat.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about the possibility of having an awesome curl for my \\&quot;Fine, thin and lifeless\\&quot; hair once again.</li>
            <li> and I love the color, pink for Breast cancer awareness) anything to get more money for the cure, helping those in need!</li>

            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It heats really quickly and iis adjustable.</li>
            <li> , this iron works fantastic and the curls hold really well!</li>

            <li> It is easy to use and heats up fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this for only 14.99 to start off with so it was a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on my hair, and I have told everyone it is thanks to my Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li> thought it would last more than ONE YEAR at that price!</li>
            <li> First time curls have stayed all day!</li>
            <li> It is pretty!  </li>
            <li> I use this on my fine , straight hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Okay I thought I was going to love this after reading the other reviews.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s legit RIGHT where your fingers are on the handle of the tool.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s the right size</li>
            <li> This curling iron gets super hot super fast.</li>
            <li> Like I said, my hair is straight as a board, so any amount of curl gives me more volume than I have naturally!  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes to warm up but is VERY hot!</li>
            <li> I wold recommend it because it does get hot and does a great job on my thin, baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year - it heats up quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle, temperature really is adjustable.  </li>
            <li> I have only had this curling iron for a little over a week, but I must say I absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron curls fast, and makes very pretty curls.</li>
            <li> Mine is not really long, but &#x27;longer&#x27; than most, and I can&#x27;t get the waves I like to make.  </li>
            <li> curling iron heats up super fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li> I did not choose to curl my bangs first.  </li>
            <li> The pink is a nice touch too, I suppose.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say however that I had a \\&quot;tight\\&quot; curl, but they fell and looked pretty.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> The on off switch can&#x27;t be moved, it is stuck on the on position but doesn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
            <li> My first iron went haywire and burned my hair.  </li>
            <li> to, I have to place it higher up so that my ends don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and does the job!</li>
            <li> and it is pretty hot.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 pink hot tools PINKTITANIUM curling Irons in 2011 (1&amp;#34; and 1 1/2&amp;#34;) at first I really liked them alot.  </li>
            <li> I will get another one  in the next size up. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the Hot Tools 1 inch ,faithfully ,for a month now.  </li>
            <li> I will be returning the product and will not be purchasing the Hot Tools brand or from FIVE Star sellers again.</li>
            <li> The barrel stays hot even after you turn it off</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would says 425</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it gets that hot.</li>
            <li> I tried it and the first time, it didn&#x27;t do so well</li>
            <li> and i think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m glad i bought it, now i can have different styles!</li>
            <li> This gets HOT.  </li>
            <li> Hot tools heat and stay hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for several years &amp; bought this one for when my present one wears out which might not be for many more years.</li>
            <li> I had read that the iron doesn&#x27;t heat up that quick/that hot; the iron warms up fast and is extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> i think it works better on long hair..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price I paid, because I went on vacation and forgot my curling iron and bought a cheap $10 one that worked fine for its purpose.  </li>
            <li> Now I have a large chunk of hair that is about twin he shorter than the rest....</li>
            <li> This iron makes it easy and fast to quickly go around and make soft curls that last.  </li>
            <li> I have had several curling irons in the past and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I have been happy with this curling iron so far, heats up fast, the tip stays cool, and the clip is tight enough to hold even my hair!  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great little curling iron</li>
            <li> i have a curling wand, and a smaller curling iron, so i figured a large one would come out pretty cool.</li>
            <li> adding that the company was very apologetic and is compensating me.</li>
            <li> Curling time is minimal as you do not have to keep your hair in it for more than 2 seconds to get the curl.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This iron works very well.</li>
            <li> This baby really heats up and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even with hairspray my hair goes straight within 20 minutes.  </li>
            <li> The title really does say it all.  </li>
            <li> gets very hot...nice styling tool</li>
            <li> Curls my straight hair with ease.</li>
            <li> so I decided to order the 1.5 inch one as well since I like this one so much</li>
            <li> I am really upset and would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> Love the pink as well.</li>
            <li> Thanks to all who wrote in.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to read the reviews before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I got the 1 1/2  inch barrel.  </li>
            <li> and I expected much better quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Products heats very well and fast.</li>
            <li> I like it a whole lot.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1\\&quot; barrel and really thought about returning it for the 3/4\\&quot; diameter</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not like you really NEED one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I love it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been left on SO many times which is a major hazard!!</li>
            <li> I love my new Hot Tools Pink Titanium Curling Iron.  </li>
            <li> so I needed a new one that could get as hot fast.</li>
            <li> I would say beware and double check,to make sure it is actually OFF!</li>
            <li> However, I believe that your hair needs to be in decent shape for it to work well.</li>
            <li> I had used curling irons many years ago with similar results and this one  proved no different.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since late 2011, and I love it!</li>
            <li> The short barrel is my not reading close enough I guess, but I did think the review said for long hair, but it&#x27;s a good curling iron.  </li>
            <li> So far it works very well, heats up quickly, and has a dial to experiment with various heat settings.</li>
            <li> I plan on only using hot tools from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that the plastic tip on the end and the plastic on the thumb-latch get so very hot; they do get a little warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that when i curl my hair it last all day and it don&#x27;t take long to curl at all because the heat setting is higher then a cheap store bought curling iron.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron: it curls my hair on low-med setting in just a few seconds and the curls stay throughout my 12 hour shifts.</li>
            <li> but i cannot put the new one in</li>
            <li> It even comes with new springs, so</li>
            <li> I bought a new one and my hair was still breaking off and frizzing.  </li>
            <li> They really heat up, curl quickly, and the curls last and last!  </li>
            <li> I love that the iron has a temperature control and curls thick hair really well.  </li>
            <li> But actually, it was better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is much higher at the local stores.</li>
            <li> With my old iron, it took me over an hour to do my hair each morning; now, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li> Nothing like those drugstore brands that do nothing, these are professional tools, and the prices on Amazon cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd curling iron that I have purchased by hot tools of this brand.</li>
            <li> After curling, my hair is smooth and shiny and the curls last all day long even without hair spray.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools has been a favorite of mine for several years and this particular model keeps me a fan; they heat up quickly, help my mixed race/not-chemically processed hair hold a smooth curl where other models have failed.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and does everything promised - lasting curls in thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is really worth the money to get the bouncy curls or loose waves you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> the old spring tht was in there</li>
            <li> I chucked my old crappy curling irons and just use this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy working mom of a toddler and get distracted in the morning and all curling iron&#x27;s</li>
            <li> replaced my old one that lasted for years</li>
            <li> On my old curling iron, I had it at it&#x27;s highest temp.,</li>
            <li> Saves a step, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this did not lead to good curls.  </li>
            <li> In addition to being cute, the curling iron works really well on my thin and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> This particular iron is for short or medium hair...</li>
            <li> I looked at hundreds of different curling irons, and just when I felt like they all seemed the same I came across this Hot Tools curling iron.</li>
            <li> I had this one for about three to four years, I really don&#x27;t recall - just a long time.  </li>
            <li> The cord design is nice too - it doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up like other irons I&#x27;ve had in the past did.  </li>
            <li> However, here are my major issues:  1)</li>
            <li> For the price on Amazon, there is no other product I will buy.</li>
            <li> Be careful with the fold down stand, that gets pretty hot, too.</li>
            <li> As I said in the title, I&#x27;m not very good at styling my hair, but this curler improved my ability significantly.</li>
            <li> I finally put away my old Conair curling iron.  </li>
            <li> such &#x27;Amazing\\&quot; results.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using my old standby curling brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely compare this to a professional iron.</li>
            <li> I got this curling iron to try because I have super straight, thin hair and would like to change it up.  </li>
            <li> it can get very hot and heavy!</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth spending a little bit of extra money on!!</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for almost exactly 7 months and this morning it is completely dead.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick and long hair</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by a beauty professional and have not used any other one since.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time even if (when) dropped on the bathroom floor occasionally.</li>
            <li> I have longer,  straight hair (past my shoulders),  </li>
            <li> i hope this means it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise I can curl my hair (LONG) in 10 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> It has a really long end piece that you hold on to which</li>
            <li> The titanium can sometimes get a strange smell</li>
            <li> ; barrel didn&#x27;t curl my long hair as well.  </li>
            <li> I have long, semi-wavy hair</li>
            <li> I still have alot of bounce and body the next day- minus the curl.</li>
            <li> This iron completely stopped working a few months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have asian hair and it NEVER wants to hold a curl unless i douse it with hairspray.</li>
            <li> The curls are just somehow prettier than with any other iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and they do tend to last.</li>
            <li> , the only problem is the power switch crumbled off today while I was in the middle of turning it in my hair; it&#x27;s stored in a heat-resistant sleeve and has never been dropped or bumped and in just a few weeks it&#x27;s damaged.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheaper curling iron previously and my hair is so thin it would slide right out of the clip!  </li>
            <li> I spent the last year growing my hair out from being bald due to 16 rounds of chemo therapy.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and wanted loose curls.</li>
            <li> After having it less than a year, it now has a short in the elec</li>
            <li> Be careful.  </li>
            <li> I have had the unit for only 6 weeks and this weekend I saw that the on/off switch was not engaging</li>
            <li> However I noticed after a few months that my hair was starting to look frizzy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that the underneath of the clamp is so rough wish</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back and still use it after a few years.</li>
            <li> The on/off switch did stop working entirely after a few months and yesterday morning</li>
            <li> (: there&#x27;s not really much to say I use it every other week for 7 days(:&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with hot tools.</li>
            <li> I had a mullet due to breakage)  </li>
            <li> I read and compared other irons...</li>
            <li> My hair has finally grown past my shoulders, and I felt like I needed a curlng iron to help me syle it.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t use any other curling iron other than this one!</li>
            <li> I have tough to curl hair as it is already naturally curly</li>
            <li> Such a disappointment that something only last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I tried turning the setting down...</li>
            <li> I seem to always turn it up or turn it down while curling.  </li>
            <li> It has and does everything all of my previous irons did not</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously owned</li>
            <li> I use it at slightly under the midpoint</li>
            <li> I would get it if your hair is hard to curl, or very long.</li>
            <li> So I could never wrap it tight around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, can&#x27;t say anything bad about it!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why this was a problem with other users.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to, but then again I did buy the 2inch one.</li>
            <li> This one has broken already, actually just 3 months after buying, I have to unplug it because on and off switch will not work.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating as the curling is just a little over a year old.</li>
            <li> And what \\&quot;Curl\\&quot; was there, was very little.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve just been too lazy to WD40 it.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and I need a curling iron to keep up with me in order to \\&quot;tame the beast\\&quot; every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read that the power switch was in an inconvenient place, causing you to accidentally turn it off during use; I have not once, in the past couple months of daily use, accidentally hit that button.  </li>
            <li> The only curling iron that has worked on my hard to curl hair!!!</li>
            <li> Works well on hard to curl hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, shoulder length hair and my curls</li>
            <li> I bought a less expensive curling iron at WalMart</li>
            <li> the only bad thing is the tip at the end fell off</li>
            <li> no good.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and the curl holds for hours..</li>
            <li> but the on/off switch was broken.</li>
            <li> Had this just shy of one year.</li>
            <li> Sorry to report this iron is not for me...</li>
            <li> The plastic handle fell off but needless to say, it is still durable.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I would feel really bad if I had a child in my home to be hunt by it.</li>
            <li> bad condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have yet to be disappointed-</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed as I think paying $36.00 for a curling iron is  a lot of money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m repurchasing it in hopes that it was just a defective part because I&#x27;d hate to have to try something else.</li>
            <li> I hate making decisions and settled on this.  </li>
            <li> VERY disappointed as it didn&#x27;t heat up correctly.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed that they would sell defective products.</li>
            <li> Terrible position for the on/off switch...</li>
            <li> Worthless!</li>

            <li> This curling iron gets super hot super fast. It has a really long end piece that you hold on to which makes it a lot easier to curl your hair without touching the barrel and hurting yourself. I have had several curling irons in the past and this one is the best so far. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This curling iron just works fantastic..I have thin hair and the curl holds for hours..Its design is great and easy to manage when styling hair.I&#x27;m really pleased with this styling tool and would reccomend it to anyone who enjoys loose curls that last.thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love my hot tools curling iron, it works good. I like the fact that when i curl my hair it last all day and it don&#x27;t take long to curl at all because the heat setting is higher then a cheap store bought curling iron.....I plan on only using hot tools from now on!</li>
            <li> i just received this iron i pluged it in but it didn&#x27;t work and then i read the manual for it and it said to chnage the spring which i did i took out the old spring tht was in there but i cannot put the new one in can anyone help me thnkz</li>
            <li> Would prefer if the heat instantly curled the hair but it is good for the price.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is AMAZING! It heats up quick, stays hot- and gives you awesome curls! I have super thick and long hair and i have never been able to get it to curl and stay curled (allll night!!) on my own... until now! I am in love :]I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Just by using it several different ways- i have got lots of different looks out of my curls and i have yet to be disappointed- though i don&#x27;t think i will be!</li>
            <li> Love the Hot Tools Curling Iron.  Multiple heat settings allow allow you to choose the tightness of curl. They have improved the design to allow for more flexibility of the cord.  Should make it last longer.</li>
            <li> This iron malfunctioned and melted my hair!! I spent the last year growing my hair out from being bald due to 16 rounds of chemo therapy.  Now I have a large chunk of hair that is about twin he shorter than the rest....thank goodness I did not choose to curl my bangs first.  adding that the company was very apologetic and is compensating me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many curling irons I have owned over the years from your Target-type stores, never again, this iron is the best one I have ever had. I have tough to curl hair as it is already naturally curly, this iron works fantastic and the curls hold really well! Curling time is minimal as you do not have to keep your hair in it for more than 2 seconds to get the curl. I would highly recommend! Love the pink/silver look and am buying the hair dryer to match :)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work.  It came in and the iron never heated up!</li>
            <li> Had this just shy of one year. Was basically happy with it. Wished it had an auto shut off. But was okay until one morning needed to use it and get to appointment and it JUST DIED. wouldn&#x27;t heat up. No reason for it to die.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased it when it was priced at over $100.00. thought it would last more than ONE YEAR at that price!</li>
            <li> Hot Tools has been a favorite of mine for several years and this particular model keeps me a fan; they heat up quickly, help my mixed race/not-chemically processed hair hold a smooth curl where other models have failed. They resist sticky buildup if you do touchups with hairspray in your hair. They last a long time even if (when) dropped on the bathroom floor occasionally. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The only curling iron that has worked on my hard to curl hair!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> This iron works very well. Curls thick and fine hair and makes beautiful ringlets. Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and it having to be a gold box special I decided to try it.  It works great!  I chucked my old crappy curling irons and just use this one.  Now I&#x27;ll be on the search to replace my crappy straightener.</li>
            <li> This baby really heats up and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I leave the temp very low to avoid accidents. One touch at the back of my neck and yeow!</li>
            <li> I blew my chi curling iron while in europe so I needed a new one that could get as hot fast. The titanium can sometimes get a strange smell but it doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair. Hot Tools is a GREAT bargain and very reliable. I have very thick curly hair so I needed a product that could get very hot, and this curling iron gets VERY hot.</li>
            <li> I got this curling iron to try because I have super straight, thin hair and would like to change it up.  I bought a cheaper curling iron previously and my hair is so thin it would slide right out of the clip!  So I could never wrap it tight around the barrel.  Needless to say, this did not lead to good curls.  I have been happy with this curling iron so far, heats up fast, the tip stays cool, and the clip is tight enough to hold even my hair!  It even comes with new springs, so i hope this means it will last a long time.  My hair doesn&#x27;t stay curly all day, but I may adjust the heat settings to see if that helps.  Like I said, my hair is straight as a board, so any amount of curl gives me more volume than I have naturally!  I wish it had automatic shut off.  Be careful with the fold down stand, that gets pretty hot, too.</li>
            <li> Reviews looked good for this curling iron, so I bought it.  VERY disappointed as it didn&#x27;t heat up correctly.  Even at its highest heat setting, I was able to touch it with my fingers and it was just warm.  It&#x27;s being returned.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, medium length colored-treated hair.  I love this curling iron.  Easy on my hair and the curl stays!!</li>
            <li> Okay I thought I was going to love this after reading the other reviews. I&#x27;ve had this for about 7 months now and have tried almost everything to try and get the curls to stay and they won&#x27;t!!!   This iron does get very hot relatively quickly which I suppose is a good thing. The cord design is nice too - it doesn&#x27;t get all tangled up like other irons I&#x27;ve had in the past did.  The pink is a nice touch too, I suppose.  However, here are my major issues:  1) Does not hold curl! I said this already, but my fine hair cannot hold a curl with this iron at all. Even with hairspray my hair goes straight within 20 minutes.  2) Terrible position for the on/off switch... it&#x27;s legit RIGHT where your fingers are on the handle of the tool.  I have switched it on and off inadvertently many, many times.  It also seems to get accidentally switched on extremely easily... it&#x27;s been left on SO many times which is a major hazard!! There is no automatic turn off like some of the Conair products...  3) Leaves a crimp.... I know there are probably specific ways to avoid this but I haven&#x27;t had trouble with leaving a crimp from the iron as much as I do with this one...   Sorry to report this iron is not for me...</li>
            <li> The title really does say it all.  It has and does everything all of my previous irons did not and my best hair days are when I&#x27;ve used this tool. :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured. Arrived quickly. This curling iron is much higher at the local stores. Great price on Amazon. This curling iron curls fast, and makes very pretty curls.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use and does everything promised - lasting curls in thin, fine hair.  1&amp;#34; size is perfect for shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> As I said in the title, I&#x27;m not very good at styling my hair, but this curler improved my ability significantly. I would recommend this curler. I have very fine straight hair and this curl lasted awhile. I wouldn&#x27;t say however that I had a \\&quot;tight\\&quot; curl, but they fell and looked pretty. The on/off button didn&#x27;t bother me at all??.?  Not sure why this was a problem with other users.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this item and have used it a couple of times, so my review cannot be as extensive as some others. So far it works very well, heats up quickly, and has a dial to experiment with various heat settings. When I initially researched curling irons, I didn&#x27;t see that this same model comes in various sizes.I would have preferred the 1 1/4 inch to the 1 inch, so my advice is to search the site to find the alternate sizes. The 1 inch provides more ringlet curls, so if a softer curl is needed, a larger size will probably fair better. I rated it with four stars as it has yet to prove its longevity.I am hoping it will retain its functionality with constant usage, however all in all it&#x27;s a very good curling iron.</li>
            <li> I had this one for about three to four years, I really don&#x27;t recall - just a long time.  The plastic handle fell off but needless to say, it is still durable. I have dropped it and banged it so many times. I love it because it heats up so fast.  I was so happy to find the same one.  This was recommended to me by a beauty professional and have not used any other one since.  It is durable.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing, I read a lot of reviews about this curling iron.  I have extremely thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and I need a curling iron to keep up with me in order to \\&quot;tame the beast\\&quot; every day.  I should note that I use this curling iron as more of a straightener, but I am able to curl in some definition.  I had read that the iron doesn&#x27;t heat up that quick/that hot; the iron warms up fast and is extremely hot.  I&#x27;d read that the plastic tip on the end and the plastic on the thumb-latch get so very hot; they do get a little warm, but not hot.  I&#x27;d read that the power switch was in an inconvenient place, causing you to accidentally turn it off during use; I have not once, in the past couple months of daily use, accidentally hit that button.  With my old iron, it took me over an hour to do my hair each morning; now, I&#x27;m done in 20 minutes!  Overall, it&#x27;s a great little curling iron and I would definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I love Hot Tools, I have every size!  They really heat up, curl quickly, and the curls last and last!  Nothing like those drugstore brands that do nothing, these are professional tools, and the prices on Amazon cannot be beat!</li>
            <li> gets very hot...nice styling tool</li>
            <li> I love this iron. il the only bad thing is the tip at the end fell off and I can&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li> The best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Worth every penny.  I&#x27;ve been using it for over three years, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted (it&#x27;s the right size and I love the color, pink for Breast cancer awareness) anything to get more money for the cure, helping those in need! I only have one problem, I used it one time and I knew I turned it off but the on/off switch was broken. I&#x27;ve already thrown the box it came in in the trash. I love the way it does my hair but I didn&#x27;t like burning my hand on it. I wold recommend it because it does get hot and does a great job on my thin, baby fine hair.  I would say beware and double check,to make sure it is actually OFF! I would feel really bad if I had a child in my home to be hunt by it. Now I have to make sure it&#x27;s unplugged as to not start a fire or have someone get burnt. God Bless and have a wonderful day!</li>
            <li> I have this curling iron since 01/31/2014 and it quit working on 05/19/2914.  The on off switch can&#x27;t be moved, it is stuck on the on position but doesn&#x27;t get hot.  Such a disappointment that something only last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> The cord tangles easily. After having it less than a year, it now has a short in the elec and I have to replace</li>
            <li> This one has broken already, actually just 3 months after buying, I have to unplug it because on and off switch will not work.</li>
            <li> This is my first professional curling iron and I love it!  It heats up very quickly.  I have thick, shoulder length hair and my curls hold all day.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I use this on my fine , straight hair. It is easy to use and heats up fast. I&#x27;ve never had a problem burning myself.</li>
            <li> Hot Tools always delivers a great product so the best thing I can tell you is that while I love the reliability of this curling...it&#x27;s even MORE awesome because it is pink.</li>
            <li> ...considering that I have NEVER used a curling iron before, this one is great. My hair stylist recommended it for me in the one inch size. Amazon had a great deal on it, so I couldn&#x27;t resist. It took me some practice time to really get a good curl, but it came out amazing, once I got the hang of it all.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron except for the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an auto turn off.  I&#x27;ve left it on all day twice!  I&#x27;m a busy working mom of a toddler and get distracted in the morning and all curling iron&#x27;s I&#x27;ve previously owned had this feature so I need to raise my awareness level!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling iron. In addition to being cute, the curling iron works really well on my thin and frizzy hair. After curling, my hair is smooth and shiny and the curls last all day long even without hair spray. The multi-temperature heat settings is great and the swivel cord is so convenient. This curling iron is really worth the money to get the bouncy curls or loose waves you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this item before.  I love that the iron has a temperature control and curls thick hair really well.  My first iron went haywire and burned my hair.  I think the thermostat broke.  Be careful.  The 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel didn&#x27;t curl my long hair as well.  If you want tighter curls, get the 1&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
            <li> Love hot tools curling irons. You cannot go wrong with hot tools. I have been using their irons for 25 years now. They are awesome!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it. I tried it once and wanted to cry. It didn&#x27;t hold a curl for five minutes. I threw it in the garbage. What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love the Hot Tools brand! Good service through Amazon! Would buy this again when necessary!!</li>
            <li> bought this item as a Christmas gift for a great price. Hav e heard and seen nothing but great things from its use.</li>
            <li> I like it and I want a 3/4 inch also</li>
            <li> Love it! curling iron heats up super fast and stays hot. Curls my straight hair with ease. First time curls have stayed all day!</li>
            <li> replaced my old one that lasted for years but when I got this replacement it stopped working after 2 weeks... the light would come on but it wouldn&#x27;t heat up at all! Very disappointed that they would sell defective products. Look into buying from a more reliable site/seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but so far I love it.  I like it so much better than the ceramic one I was using before.  It curls my hair nicely and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  I read complaints about the placement of the on/switch but I don&#x27;t see that as an issue.  I have longer hair so I decided to order the 1.5 inch one as well since I like this one so much and it&#x27;s so inexpensive.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because it does not grab the ends as well as I&#x27;d like it to, I have to place it higher up so that my ends don&#x27;t slip out.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd curling iron that I have purchased by hot tools of this brand. Both have shorted out within 6-8 month of eachother.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I have ever owned. Heats up fast and does the job!</li>
            <li> This curing iron doesn&#x27;t have an indicator that lets you know when it has reached the temperature that you want.  I use it at slightly under the midpoint and it is pretty hot.  I have long, semi-wavy hair and I can either get the ends to just turn under or make some great spiral curls.  The only downside is sometimes the pieces of hair slip through and I have to try again.  It does come with 2 replacement springs.</li>
            <li> I liked the design of the curling iron and the non-stick finish but realized very quickly that there was no automatic shutoff, a feature that I had with my old iron.  Somehow I did not shut it off after use and this happened on more than one occasion.  I have had the unit for only 6 weeks and this weekend I saw that the on/off switch was not engaging and I had to pull the plug to shut it off.  I am really upset and would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This was given as a Christmas gift. It works great and is just what recipiant was wanting. It is working great</li>
            <li> I bought 2 pink hot tools PINKTITANIUM curling Irons in 2011 (1&amp;#34; and 1 1/2&amp;#34;) at first I really liked them alot.  However I noticed after a few months that my hair was starting to look frizzy (like it was singed)  I talked to my hair dresser and she thought my blow dryer might be going out....I bought a new one and my hair was still breaking off and frizzing.  I finally fiured out it was the curling iron. (But not until I started looking like I had a mullet due to breakage)  I tried turning the setting down...no good.  It either burns or is too low to curl.  I bought a less expensive curling iron at WalMart and I am not having any issues with breakage or burning.....I am going to toss these to curlers in the trash.  I like my hair too much to keep them!!!!!</li>
            <li> Daughter in-law LOVES this tool!</li>
            <li> I have had this curling iron for almost exactly 7 months and this morning it is completely dead.  Power comes on, but no heat whatsoever.  While it worked&amp;#60; I was basically happy with it, but even at this price, It should have lasted much longer than 7mos.!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - the cord gets super tangled but otherwise I can curl my hair (LONG) in 10 minutes flat.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron, however, I wish I would have gotten a bigger size. Oh well, maybe next time. I will get another one  in the next size up. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this one to try and it gets very hot and I like the adjustment wheel. I have medium length hair and wanted loose curls. This iron makes it easy and fast to quickly go around and make soft curls that last.  I would like auto shutoff.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, can&#x27;t say anything bad about it!  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!(: there&#x27;s not really much to say I use it every other week for 7 days(:&lt;br /&gt;But use HEAT PROTECTOR!</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron from Amazon a few months and was really impressed! It&#x27;s a little heavier than I&#x27;m used to, but then again I did buy the 2inch one. It takes a few minutes to warm up but is VERY hot! Love the pink as well.</li>
            <li> I finally put away my old Conair curling iron.  I found this curling iron with all the wonderful reviews.  Thanks to all who wrote in.  It really helps to read the reviews before purchasing.  I have been using the Hot Tools 1 inch ,faithfully ,for a month now.  I have longer,  straight hair (past my shoulders),  I really wish I got the 1 1/2  inch barrel.  I have learned to adapt with the one inch though.  I only have great things to say about it.  I use it on a low setting since my hair is colored and highlighted.  It holds the curls wonderfully.  I still have alot of bounce and body the next day- minus the curl. I still use a heat protectant on my hair though (Tresemme).  The temperature dial is still intact and in an unbothersome location, to me.  I have left it on and the automatic shut off is a great attribute.  I would definitely buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product due to reading all of the great reviews. The first time I used it it worked great andI loved the curls the iron made. However, after only the second time of using the iron I tried turning the on/off switch to the off position only to find that the switch was permanently stuck in the on position and that the mechanism that controls the switch inside the iron was defective. I am extremely disappointed as I think paying $36.00 for a curling iron is  a lot of money and I expected much better quality for the price. I will be returning the product and will not be purchasing the Hot Tools brand or from FIVE Star sellers again.</li>
            <li> After reading the ratings, I wanted to try it and it seems that anything titanium works well.  But actually, it was better than I expected.  The barrel stays hot even after you turn it off so I was able to use it on hair that didn&#x27;t need as much heat.  Also the curls lasted a lot longer.  They appear to have a set hold that makes them stay.  However, I believe that your hair needs to be in decent shape for it to work well. This is by far the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> I had never tried a titanium iron before until now. It does everything I need it to do. Products heats very well and fast. overall it is a great product for the price.  I like it a whole lot.</li>
            <li> This curling worked wonderfully, until the on and off switch suddenly stopped working.  Very frustrating as the curling is just a little over a year old.</li>
            <li> It is good..  I don&#x27;t like that the underneath of the clamp is so rough wish it was smooth t like the barrell.  Doesn&#x27;t get as hot as I thought it would says 425 but I don&#x27;t think it gets that hot.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron: it curls my hair on low-med setting in just a few seconds and the curls stay throughout my 12 hour shifts. Maybe it&#x27;s because I never had a \\&quot;good\\&quot; curling iron but this is excellent and for $31 it&#x27;s superb, the only problem is the power switch crumbled off today while I was in the middle of turning it in my hair; it&#x27;s stored in a heat-resistant sleeve and has never been dropped or bumped and in just a few weeks it&#x27;s damaged. I&#x27;m repurchasing it in hopes that it was just a defective part because I&#x27;d hate to have to try something else.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!!</li>
            <li> love this. works awesome</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back and still use it after a few years. The only thing is that the lever squeaks and I&#x27;ve just been too lazy to WD40 it.  But it works great. - BTW, I&#x27;m a hairstylist.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron! Works great! Could never figure out how to use the wand without burning my hand somehow. This works way better!</li>
            <li> I read from so many web sites how this was an amazing curling iron.  I was so excited about the possibility of having an awesome curl for my \\&quot;Fine, thin and lifeless\\&quot; hair once again. I had used curling irons many years ago with similar results and this one  proved no different. It did not curl my hair at all. I purchased the 1\\&quot; barrel and really thought about returning it for the 3/4\\&quot; diameter but I do not believe it would have made any difference. After a minute I still had no curl.  I do not have time every morning to stand there holding a curling iron forever waiting for it to curl. And what \\&quot;Curl\\&quot; was there, was very little.  Just don&#x27;t see how everyone get&#x27;s such &#x27;Amazing\\&quot; results.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue using my old standby curling brush.</li>
            <li> This iron completely stopped working a few months after I purchased it. Worthless!</li>
            <li> Lasted 5 months, plugged it in and light started flickering. Would not heat up. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Descent curling iron does the job, heats up nice , not the best i have used but it gets the job done. Love love love the cord never gets tangled</li>
            <li> I am in love with the hot tools line. For the price on Amazon, there is no other product I will buy. I just ordered the 1 1/2 iron as well for a wavier look!</li>
            <li> Works great! Love love love</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m reviewing on my dad&#x27;s account. I bought this for only 14.99 to start off with so it was a pretty good deal. I have asian hair and it NEVER wants to hold a curl unless i douse it with hairspray. I tried it and the first time, it didn&#x27;t do so well ( i think it&#x27;s because i used mousse) but then i did it a second time and it came out really nice... i got a lot of compliments from it and i think it works pretty well. i have a curling wand, and a smaller curling iron, so i figured a large one would come out pretty cool. i&#x27;m glad i bought it, now i can have different styles! I would get it if your hair is hard to curl, or very long. i think it works better on long hair.. just try not to burn your ears off! it can get very hot and heavy!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas present to myself!  I read and compared other irons... I hate making decisions and settled on this.  It&#x27;s lightweight, nice color, and easy to use.  I love that the cord swivels.  Great feature .  This gets HOT.  I have a rubber pad from another iron I have so I use that.  There is one drawback to this, and that&#x27;s the short barrel.  This particular iron is for short or medium hair... Mine is not really long, but &#x27;longer&#x27; than most, and I can&#x27;t get the waves I like to make.  It&#x27;s great around my face, but for the sides and back, it&#x27;s a struggle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure it was worth the price I paid, because I went on vacation and forgot my curling iron and bought a cheap $10 one that worked fine for its purpose.  The short barrel is my not reading close enough I guess, but I did think the review said for long hair, but it&#x27;s a good curling iron.  My $10 burned out, it lasted about 4 months of regular use.  This is definitely a better quality... but still...  It is pretty!  It&#x27;s just for shorter hair.</li>
            <li> It does not heat up, not to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Good quality with excellent heat settings.  Works well on hard to curl hair.  No automatic shut off though and I tend to forget :)</li>
            <li> Hot tools heat and stay hot. Nice.</li>
            <li> These worked great and get really hot and stay HOT! They give me a smooth curl every time. I&#x27;d definitely compare this to a professional iron.</li>
            <li> Quick heat up and easy to use...my daughter has fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl well but this iron has changed that!! Plus its&#x27;s such an amazing price!!</li>
            <li> bad condition.&lt;br /&gt;when i got this , ihe surface already get rusty&lt;br /&gt;what the hell..</li>
            <li> Best curling iron EVER!!! I wont buy any other, it works amazing curls amazing and I won&#x27;t use any other curling iron other than this one! Love it :)</li>
            <li> I love it!  It gets very hot!  On my old curling iron, I had it at it&#x27;s highest temp., on this one I keep it at a low temp.  Everything is as described.  Also, I just love the look of it!</li>
            <li> Would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> I have only had this curling iron for a little over a week, but I must say I absolutely love it!!! My hair has finally grown past my shoulders, and I felt like I needed a curlng iron to help me syle it. I looked at hundreds of different curling irons, and just when I felt like they all seemed the same I came across this Hot Tools curling iron. I am very happy with my results. The curls last... and last... and last... I curled my hair for work on Saturday night, and it is Monday and the curls are still in my hair. I did not even have to use hairspray or any styling products. I have received so many compliments on my hair, and I have told everyone it is thanks to my Hot Tools curling iron. It is definitely worth spending a little bit of extra money on!!</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I ever had.  I&#x27;ve had one for several years &amp; bought this one for when my present one wears out which might not be for many more years.</li>
            <li> To girly cute and works well.  I am very happy with this purchase.  It heats really quickly and iis adjustable.</li>
            <li> I love my new Hot Tools Pink Titanium Curling Iron.  The only thing I would change about it is the position of the heat dial.  I seem to always turn it up or turn it down while curling.  Other than that, it has made curling a lot easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since late 2011, and I love it! The curls are just somehow prettier than with any other iron I&#x27;ve ever used, and they do tend to last. I highly recommend it! The on/off switch did stop working entirely after a few months and yesterday morning it finally just fell off. But it&#x27;s not like you really NEED one. I plug it in; it&#x27;s on. I unplug it; it&#x27;s off. Saves a step, as far as I&#x27;m concerned. But since that&#x27;s the only \\&quot;con\\&quot; I could think of, I mentioned it.</li>
            <li> Have had this for over a year - it heats up quickly, the cord doesn&#x27;t tangle, temperature really is adjustable.  Overall, a great product.</li>
