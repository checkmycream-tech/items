            <li>THOUGHTFUL SEXY BABY DADDY</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>the technician is using it so it is fine</li>
            <li>and it was fine</li>
            <li>The machines were fine.</li>
            <li>I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE ThE SWEETEST MOST GIVING AND</li>
            <li>is an amazing product, very professional and efficient!!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t give a detailed review.</li>
            <li>I heard a popping sound.</li>
            <li>what but for it to make a popping sound</li>
            <li>I think is cheap parts.</li>
            <li>The product was good overall.</li>
            <li>Arrived in a nice package with a professional feel.</li>
            <li>Omg  so happy got in 3 days has every thing the buffer is kind of weak .</li>
            <li>Got it pretty fast love it</li>
            <li>So far it works good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the handle gets really hot, so have to take lots a break in between my manicure for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>The shaft of the motor was slightly bent, causing the tips to be out-of-round, but my husband was able to bend it and tweak it back to center and it works great now.</li>
            <li>This was a gift, and has worked out very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a drill with the foot pedal that works pay a little extra and get a really good drill.</li>
            <li>They provide a quick response and it&#x27;s not automated, its an actual person that you get to speak to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get a new foot pedal for this machine.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t I have to twist it to make it work, not as powerful as I thought, and the drill bits are TOO LONG.</li>
            <li>Arrived early and it brought everything!</li>
            <li>This item works just like at the professional nail shops.</li>
            <li>She uses it for personal use and said that it  really makes doing her nails a lot faster than with the nail drill I bought her from Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>but not if you are a professional.</li>
            <li>I get the right smoothness and eveness on my nails due to this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it is cheaply made or</li>
            <li>It is not as powerful as I hoped and the bit doesn&#x27;t stay in tight.</li>

            <li> It is always on high except for when it randomly decides to lower the speed.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little faster and durable.</li>

            <li> I would not recommend this product at least not from this supplier.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s to slow</li>
            <li> Then when I plugged it in and started it I set it for slow than after about 3 minutes and thin</li>
            <li> The buffing pad that came with it was also broken and the abrasive part of it was peeling off on two sides.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It came in ample time and works great</li>

            <li> it  was exactly how described!!! is an amazing product, very professional and efficient!! it arrived on time, very happy , will definitely order again from seller 5 stars</li>
            <li> Great product.  I wish some instructions would have come with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to get a new foot pedal for this machine.  I bought the loel manicure machine for my daughter&#x27;s birthday.  Everything works but the foot pedal.  Please help</li>
            <li> Good for the price,  wish the foot pedal controlled the speed but that&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> This was a great investment.  I no longer need to pay to get my nails done.  This item works just like at the professional nail shops.</li>
            <li> The speed control on the device does not work.  It is always on high except for when it randomly decides to lower the speed.  The buffing pad that came with it was also broken and the abrasive part of it was peeling off on two sides.  Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> The foot petal doesn&#x27;t work, and I&#x27;m stuck with this half working machine, because I&#x27;m not going to pay shipping charges to return it.</li>
            <li> Omg  so happy got in 3 days has every thing the buffer is kind of weak . other than that salon feel!  I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and has worked out very well. It is working out for the person I bought it for. She uses it for personal use and said that it  really makes doing her nails a lot faster than with the nail drill I bought her from Sally&#x27;s. I haven&#x27;t used this product personally so I can&#x27;t give a detailed review. But I will say I didn&#x27;t have to return it. So I gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s to slow</li>
            <li> Just received my drill a few minutes ago and I love it. Way better than my $15 drill off of eBay.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little faster and durable.</li>
            <li> The product was good overall. The customer service of the company was really great. They provide a quick response and it&#x27;s not automated, its an actual person that you get to speak to.</li>
            <li> It is not as powerful as I hoped and the bit doesn&#x27;t stay in tight. I should have returned it.</li>
            <li> works great. a great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> I do acrylic tips because I work in the beauty department at my job so hands need to always look primp and this does the job beautifully. I am absolutely pleased with this. I get the right smoothness and eveness on my nails due to this product. Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great packaging. Works perfectly fine. ☺️</li>
            <li> I love this still! The price was perfect and it&#x27;s very powerful and will be used in my salon.</li>
            <li> the technician is using it so it is fine</li>
            <li> It would be great if the bits wouldn&#x27;t come out, they just don&#x27;t stay still the gun, as soon you start working on the nail they make there way out the barrel</li>
            <li> I love it! Make it so easy!</li>
            <li> Just like a machine found in the salon but at a fraction of the cost. Good torque, variable speeds and a foot pedal option made this the diy&#x27;er very happy.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t I have to twist it to make it work, not as powerful as I thought, and the drill bits are TOO LONG.</li>
            <li> Great! But the foot pedal didn&#x27;t work... Otherwise very happy</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal but my foot pedal does not work. So if you are looking for a drill with the foot pedal that works pay a little extra and get a really good drill. Nice for home use</li>
            <li> came so fast and works great! I AM SO LUCKY TO HAVE ThE SWEETEST MOST GIVING AND THOUGHTFUL SEXY BABY DADDY HE IS THE BEST, THANK YOU HUNNY ITS EVERYTHING I HOPED AND DREAMED IT WOULD BE.</li>
            <li> It works very wrll it helps alot with the fact of me doing acrylic nails, it just an awesome product that im happy to have!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this drill!! Very easy to use. I would say this drill is salon quality.</li>
            <li> At the beginning worked nice. 20 min latter the handle was so hot!!!!!!  I had to returned it. Hopefully I won&#x27;t have an issue with the return</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Salon durability..I love this product!  Everything I needed was in the box an I got started immediately!</li>
            <li> Got it pretty fast love it</li>
            <li> Arrived in a nice package with a professional feel. The handle has a nice size and feel to it, and it works like it should. The shaft of the motor was slightly bent, causing the tips to be out-of-round, but my husband was able to bend it and tweak it back to center and it works great now. The foot pedal is a bit touchy, but works.</li>
            <li> I got this unit and did not use it for at least 2 months. Then when I plugged it in and started it I set it for slow than after about 3 minutes and thin I heard a popping sound. I shut it down then checked the fuse and it was fine but the unit will not run and smells like something inside is burned. It&#x27;s a shame because I did not have time to send it back. I&#x27;m not sure if it is cheaply made or what but for it to make a popping sound I think is cheap parts. That&#x27;s just my opinion. I would not recommend this product at least not from this supplier.</li>
            <li> The acrylic was pretty bad. The machines were fine. Wouldn&#x27;t use this if your trying to learn to be a nail designer this wouldn&#x27;t be the best</li>
            <li> Arrived early and it brought everything! So far it works good, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the handle gets really hot, so have to take lots a break in between my manicure for it to cool down. I think for personal use it&#x27;s great but not if you are a professional.</li>
