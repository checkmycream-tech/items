            <li>this was the best price I could find--I went to the Better Health Food store website and ordered it there, rather than on amazon.  </li>
            <li>The oil is good, but I was hoping to see changes in my sons molluscum and I have not seen a difference.</li>
            <li>I had bought this brand before, but this time it wasn&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer should have used a better container.</li>
            <li>Love it ..</li>
            <li>This is great for putting on acne, or any other blemishes and is very effective at eliminating them.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping, product came as described, and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>This is the best tea tree oil I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down.</li>
            <li>We use tea tree oil a lot in my house and this worked just fine.</li>
            <li>even our Meijers carries it though, so best to check your local stores first and see if the cost of gas does or doesn&#x27;t outweight the cost of S&amp;H.</li>
            <li>This little bottle is wonderful.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, and this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I mean the smell isn&#x27;t wonderful but</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell as clean or fresh as before</li>
            <li>I use this in my own facial toner and in my humidifier</li>
            <li>This Tea Tree Oil, worked very well, and was a more natural approach to healing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really something</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t mind much anymore because of how beneficial it is.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it says on bottle and considerably cheaper than in the brick and mortar stores.</li>
            <li>I has helped me with my adult acne so much.</li>
            <li>If you ever look around at a store for tea tree oil, most of the time you will find products that contain only 10% or less in it.</li>
            <li>This products is making improvements to clear my toe nails.  </li>
            <li>My skin has looked clearer than I can remember it ever being as a teenager and young adult.</li>
            <li>I think may have been thinned out with another carrier oil, because they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li>This item was exactly what I expected to receive.</li>

            <li> I use this for acne and other skin conditions, as well as sanitizing my makeup brushes. It works well. I have to dilute it a lot to use it on my face, unlike other 100 percent TTO solutions I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m not sure of the difference between them if they&#x27;re all \\&quot;pure\\&quot; and 100 percent. My skin has looked clearer than I can remember it ever being as a teenager and young adult.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I has helped me with my adult acne so much.</li>
            <li> I use this for cuts, soap crafting, cleaning, to make feet spray, and as a facial astringent.  The product is 100% tea tree oil and a quality product.</li>
            <li> The oil is good, but I was hoping to see changes in my sons molluscum and I have not seen a difference.</li>
            <li> This products is making improvements to clear my toe nails.  I had to move the Tea Tree oil to a another container because this doesn&#x27;t come with application nail brush.</li>
            <li> POOR Quality, time to find a different brand. I had bought this brand before, but this time it wasn&#x27;t as good. It didn&#x27;t smell as clean or fresh as before (I still have some of the other to compare it). Also the oil appeared cloudy and there were a few small dust particles floating in it. Also in the mail the oil had soaked into the glue in the cap. The manufacturer should have used a better container.</li>
            <li> If you ever look around at a store for tea tree oil, most of the time you will find products that contain only 10% or less in it. That&#x27;s why I had to take it to Amazon to find a product with 100% tea tree oil in it. This is great for putting on acne, or any other blemishes and is very effective at eliminating them. The scent is very strong, and this is the real deal. I have been using this for years. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best tea tree oil I&#x27;ve ever used, hands down. Other brands I&#x27;ve tried I think may have been thinned out with another carrier oil, because they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with some problems I was having under my  toenails and fingernails.  This Tea Tree Oil, worked very well, and was a more natural approach to healing.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I expected to receive. We use tea tree oil a lot in my house and this worked just fine.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help with the ringworm at all. Stinks really bad. My ringworm has since then gone but not with the help of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> This little bottle is wonderful. it works well on my acne prone skin. i love it! Just bought another bottle!!! The only problem is it really stinks.</li>
            <li> yes, this can dry skin, I found that out the hard way myself. I bought it this time around to be used in other products for health and beauty care, rather than directly on skin (though because of its antiseptic qualities it&#x27;ll probably be used here and there that way too!).  this was the best price I could find--I went to the Better Health Food store website and ordered it there, rather than on amazon.  even our Meijers carries it though, so best to check your local stores first and see if the cost of gas does or doesn&#x27;t outweight the cost of S&amp;H.</li>
            <li> Love it .. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, product came as described, and it is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Exactly what it says on bottle and considerably cheaper than in the brick and mortar stores. What ya use it for is entirely up to you, but given ya only need a little at a time it should last a while.</li>
            <li> I use this in my own facial toner and in my humidifier and I really enjoy it. I mean the smell isn&#x27;t wonderful but any means but it&#x27;s really something iv&#x27;e gotten used to and I don&#x27;t mind much anymore because of how beneficial it is.</li>
