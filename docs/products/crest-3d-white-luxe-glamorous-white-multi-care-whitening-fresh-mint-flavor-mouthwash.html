            <li>If you are light coffee/tea drinker like me, I find it best to use after you have your morning</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li>They do work but aren&#x27;t so good at getting into the spaces between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Delivered in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Received in a timely manner, and in good condition.  </li>
            <li>good stuff that does not stain teeth as its competitors.</li>
            <li>It works, good value.</li>
            <li>Good pre wash.</li>
            <li>The taste is good and it foams well.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that it is a good quality product that is affordable!</li>
            <li>I use this combined with the 3d strips and toothpaste and am very pleased with the whiteness (is that a word?)</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I love the taste of this mouthwash!</li>
            <li>You will see amazing results.</li>
            <li>the results were amazing</li>
            <li>the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li>Good product, good price, I searched multiple sites and this was the best at the time of my purchase, recommend.</li>
            <li>I honestly, don&#x27;t mind the aftertaste</li>
            <li>and then (polishes nicely), and</li>
            <li>I have always liked crest line of products.</li>
            <li>Using the product, it created a foam as I swished -- kind of like scrubbing bubbles for my mouth.</li>
            <li>the taste was very strong</li>
            <li>I used my finger to feel for more sloughed off skin and there was much more!</li>
            <li>It is effective at whitening and not causing teeth to be more prone to stains afterward.</li>
            <li>no smell in the morning and the teeth are as bright as the light.</li>
            <li>I hope that I regain my taste- because I love love love food!</li>
            <li>Using my Oral-B Braun electric toothbrush and giving vigorous cleanings, I just wasn&#x27;t making headway with the crack stains, though it did polish my teeth nicely and made them feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>, Good Housekeeping Dec 2008 issue states that whitening mouth washes are not going to provide huge results, but are good for mild surface stains which I guess I don&#x27;t have).</li>
            <li>This product worked really great at first.</li>
            <li>We think we look pretty good,too, so we are happy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a pretty great whitening regiment.</li>
            <li>I love the taste of this mouthwash as it is very refreshing and the clean feeling lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li>In any case, I don&#x27;t believe this product is safe to use.</li>
            <li>The best brand for whitening teeth and keeping them white.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe there is this many complaints about this stuff on the web.</li>
            <li>and I actually just bought this at Walmart, but I am so impressed</li>
            <li>but it gets better each time I use it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it would have worked just by itself, but it has made a much greater improvement than anything else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects and I&#x27;m tremendously pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s been the most convenient way of using it.</li>
            <li>I love the taste and find it much better than sensodyne, listerine, and colgate.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough for mouthwash, but i have not seen any great improvement with whitening.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I should read the bottle more closely.  </li>
            <li>The second best mouthwash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this product works well</li>
            <li>Not to mention the ultra bright, white teeth I can proudly flash throughout my day even though I smoke.</li>
            <li>i was glad to see that i could get it cheaper with the subscription</li>
            <li>My husband and Mother both love this product.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was in most timely fashion.</li>
            <li>works great , just as described, came fast , doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>The results at the next checkup were excellent, even to the surprise of the dentist.</li>
            <li>Nobody tells you that the alcohol in most mouthwashes dissolves the glue in inlays and onlays over time.  </li>
            <li>I love this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>It has also worked to remove stains, but I find it is better to just prevent them to begin with :)</li>
            <li>Used along with the 3D toothpaste, it makes a very significant difference in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li>This is a nice minty clean mouthwash.</li>
            <li>So anyway, the taste is pretty good.</li>
            <li>I think my aging teeth are simply becoming translucent</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth my teeth feel.</li>
            <li>The great thing about this mouthwash is that it is a non alcohol formula and as far as I can tell it does work (using in conjunction with whitening toothpaste), though the whitening I&#x27;m seeing is mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that it is alcohol free.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in 5 years and my teeth are beautiful, healthy, strong and white and brite.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash has a super fresh taste that I loved.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and find that even with 2x yearly dental visits, my teeth stain easily.  </li>
            <li>I also love waking up in the morning and having a clean feeling mouth.</li>
            <li>Very mild tasting but got used to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>My mouth actually tastes sweet and no bad breath which is awesome!</li>
            <li>Its mouthwash, it tastes kind of funny</li>
            <li>My teeth are in pretty good shape to begin with as I have good cleaning habits, but it didn&#x27;t get me to the next level.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect huge differences in whitening from either product</li>
            <li>But honestly i didn&#x27;t really expect a miracle from an over the counter product.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that this is alcohol and fluoride free.</li>
            <li>this might be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li>I love how fresh my mouth feels after using it.  </li>
            <li>This is a great white wash.</li>
            <li>and I am happy that I switched back.</li>
            <li>and my mouth feels more fresh as does my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of mouthwashes over the years primarily to keep fresh breath after brushing and to maintain healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>After using it, I love how clean my mouth felt and how fresh my breath was.</li>
            <li>mare clean when you rinse your mouth you can feel your tooth smooth</li>
            <li>Was excited to find these in bulk.  </li>
            <li>but it does keep my breath fresh!</li>
            <li>The irritation in my mouth was gradual at first, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if the mouthwash was causing issues.</li>
            <li>It never made my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li>Leaves your mouth and breath feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>Also since I am a teeth freak I know that some people have had mouth blisters because their mouth may be over sensitive to this product or products like this one, there are more acidic mouth washes than this one, this was not even a mild acidity compared to most post washes.</li>
            <li>I switched to Listerine right after and my teeth have never been whiter!</li>
            <li>The tissue is swollen and bright red.</li>
            <li>Using these keep my teeth a bright white.</li>
            <li>fantastic for whitening and fresh breath</li>
            <li>Foods didn&#x27;t taste as sweet as before.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much; it was more an act of desperation.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, will look forward to more business with you.</li>
            <li>Not badly at this price</li>
            <li>So far, pretty good.</li>
            <li>It makes my mouth feel very clean and my teeth really appear to be whiter.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean breath.</li>
            <li>Once a day after brushing your teeth before bed will keep your teeth clean and your breath fresh.</li>
            <li>It does leave the mouth feeling decently cleaned; but as of yet i still dono for sure about its advertised whitening power...</li>
            <li>keeps your mouth clean and fresh quickly</li>
            <li>This product has a mild taste.</li>
            <li>These bottles were more than enough, completely satisfied with shipping,product, and use of the product.</li>
            <li>but I noticed results quick I would recommend this</li>
            <li>Cleans well, nice flavor, and good price (when using subscribe and save).&lt;br /&gt;However, the whitening is done (in part at least) with hydrogen peroxide, so this tends to foam up in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have problems with sensitivity, but one day of using this product was more than I could take.  </li>
            <li>you can stand the foaming, then this should be good, but recommend trying smaller sample first before ordering in quantity.</li>
            <li>I even endured to the very end of the first bottle, using it as prescribed: 3 fl oz twice a day and spit after 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>amazing and laaaaaaaaarg enough</li>
            <li>But its worth it.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I expected, good and reliable.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh without overpowering flavor.</li>
            <li>you know you&#x27;re cleaning your mouth well and the fresh feeling lasts a lot longer than crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it might would for most people, but if you have any sort of sensitive mouth or are looking for a mouth wash, choose another product.</li>
            <li>The pain isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a healthy 24 year old).</li>
            <li>the savings is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a healthy 33 year old who has never had a cavity</li>
            <li>Very effective with no burning sensation or heavy alcohol after taste.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve been using a mouthwash right along, I&#x27;ve come to expect this sensation and associate it with my mouth getting cleaner, bacteria being killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a foamy texture and the taste is kind of bitter and sweet.</li>
            <li>a nice mouth wash that leaves your mouth feeling refreshed for a long while.</li>
            <li>For many people, it is critical that a mouthwash not contain alcohol, as that substance is absorbed on the tongue, thus gets into the system even without swallowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Crest 3D glamorous white will give you a brighter smile whitin seven days safely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great because the toothpaste that goes with this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty freaked out.</li>
            <li>The first couple of days I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste after I spit it out.</li>
            <li>First I tried the Crest 3D Flexfit Whitestrips.</li>
            <li>It actually seemed to highlight the between-the-teeth stains even more -- quite distressing.</li>
            <li>My teeth now have a very even, pleasing color everywhere!</li>
            <li>I had a dentist appointment yesterday and the first thing she asked me was if i was using crest toothpaste or the rinse.</li>
            <li>All of these symptoms subsided over the course of the day, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed.</li>
            <li>I prefer Listerine and if you want to whiten just use the strips which work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just aware of how often I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month, and my teeth really do look whiter!</li>
            <li>The first one I opened, the lid was smashed, and it went all over the place.</li>
            <li>It works better than the white strips.</li>
            <li>The first couple weeks I used this thing it burned.</li>
            <li>Refreshing mouthwash and purchasing in bulk was really a savings over buying at the local stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m doing that thing where I am suddenly taking better care of my teeth now that I am planning on going to the dentist for the first time in years, and I think after using this stuff for a while my new dentist may not grimace when he looks in my mouth the first time.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that my teeth are becoming whiter over several weeks.</li>
            <li>I was becoming somewhat distressed by stained teeth, especially in the cracks between my teeth.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 days and saw some improvement, however, I am rapidly losing the ability to taste certain foods, so far consisting of peanut butter and anything sweet.</li>
            <li>I have been out of my pre wash and had been searching for something new because the wash that I used just didnt seem like it was worth the money or that it was doing what I wanted it too.</li>
            <li>No chapsticks helped and my lips are still super sensitive to acidic foods.</li>
            <li>The plumber who came to my house once told me that whitening mouthwash was an excellent alternative to using bleach which is harsh and sometimes ruins the caulking around the tub or sink.</li>
            <li>sense of taste to certain things.</li>
            <li>FWIW, I have a VERY high pain</li>
            <li>If you want amazing white teeth, I recommend using this with the crest white strips and the whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I think it really works.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s not as fast as visiting the dental office and getting a teeth whitening treatment.</li>
            <li>and I noticed that it does not sting as much.</li>
            <li>I really did.</li>
            <li>job - thank you much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think much about it, but this morning I CAN&#x27;T TASTE ANYTHING.</li>
            <li>too much of it</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I figured out that this product is absolute poison.  </li>
            <li>There is no evidence of ulcers and I can absolutely say that this is the result of the mouth wash.</li>
            <li>it found up too much when I used</li>
            <li>I rinse before my shower, and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything while getting ready.</li>
            <li>but they are much whiter than what I started with.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how much this is helping, but I do know that my teeth are whiter than they have been before</li>
            <li>I keep swishing this stuff in my mouth for about 1-2 minutes to really let it work</li>
            <li>its refreshing but not really whitening</li>
            <li>I am just hoping they will come off, I am going to dentist very soon.</li>
            <li>thanks, looking forward to having a pump .</li>
            <li>I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed my teeth getting any whiter but still an alright mouthwash.</li>
            <li>i have been using it for a while now and work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would taste it at least a good 4 hours after using it, and it grossed me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a 24 year old who regularly brushes/flosses, I have healthy teeth/gums but my dentist recommended using a mouthwash at night</li>
            <li>THIS MOUTHWASH does NOT sting nearly so much, yes it is still quite minty but the stinging sensation is much more bearable as compared to other mouthwashes containing alcohol</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real change in my teeth nor did they feel as clean as when I used the Listerine (Listerine is a pre-brush rinse that has baking soda or something similar</li>
            <li>Once bleached, they have not reverted back to the original shade regardless of nonuse.  </li>
            <li>It also does not taste like medicine as many other mouthwashes tend to do.</li>
            <li>Im sure other customers would like it too.....</li>
            <li>does not burn at all and tastes much better than other mouthwashes I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I was spitting out more blood than I did before, then I noticed that I barely had any gum left between my two teeth.</li>
            <li>However, I think this is a good mouthwash either prior to brushing or right after brushing just as a cleaning boost and to help kill bacteria in hard to reach parts of the mouth.</li>
            <li>I have been using it along with the crest 3D white toothpaste &amp; have noticed a tremendous change in the whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li>It leaves a weird filmy feeling on my gums/cheeks/teeth that I then need to gargle out with more water (a LOT more water) after rinsing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>while it&#x27;s nothing drastic, it looks a little better.</li>
            <li>At first i thought it was normal and would go away in a while, but reading the reviews here, the product has some major issues.</li>
            <li>However, I have been using this product for a few months now and have to say I love the alcohol-free minty flavor, the foaming action, and the slick, smooth, clean feeling on my teeth after each use.</li>
            <li>To my great surprise, within two weeks of once or twice a day use, those irritating crack stains were gone!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a chance, but this kind of sucks.</li>
            <li>Apparently the gasses travel from the mouth to the nasal cavity, which if I recall my anatomy training correctly, is logical.</li>
            <li>I used to use CVS brand to save the money but found this on Amazon and it was actually right about the same price when bought in bulk.</li>
            <li>A recent photo of me confirmed that two months of use, along with the Crest 3D White toothpaste, definitely whitened my smile.</li>
            <li>Say hello to clean mouth, and goodbye to painful, stingy, eye-watering mouthwashes :P</li>
            <li>Not brilliant white (I wasn&#x27;t aiming for that), more like a natural very light ivory color.</li>
            <li>Finally I got the 3D Glamorous White mouthwash because I didn&#x27;t know what else to try and it was easily available.</li>
            <li>, I believe this has caused my teeth to be very sensitive</li>
            <li>I could even drink my hot coffee earlier without wincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just bought Crest 3D Whitening mouthwash yesterday and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve had such a reaction to a mouth wash or rinse.</li>
            <li>I used this mouth wash a total of 3 times exactly as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to try their Crest 3D White Multi-Care Rinse and the first time I used it</li>
            <li>big con for me is that this has the most disgusting flavor I have ever experienced!  </li>
            <li>I actually gagged and almost threw up the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I am a teeth freak as most people who know that I usually pre-wash than brush twice than post wash.</li>
            <li>This is nice mouthwash and does the trick, but my girlfriend tells me that the smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li>I do, however, really like the Crest 3D Vivid White Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Now that you view me as white trash, I&#x27;ll say this: my dentist told me that for as \\&quot;much as you dip and drink coffee, your teeth and gums are darn near perfect.\\</li>
            <li>I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work like a lot of products out there, but i was surprised, my teeth are turning whiter over the course of a week.</li>
            <li>though makes the teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re reformulated it, but it didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive or my gums bleed at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using it for about a month now, and my teeth do not feel sensitive anymore,</li>
            <li>This really helps keep them white and remove stains that may occur between dentist visits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other alcohol free rinse mouthwashes by Crest, but recently I became a coffee drinker</li>
            <li>one is simple: my teeth actually did get whiter after the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I have dipped Copenhagen long cut for the better part of ten years, usually a 1/4 to a whole can a day.</li>
            <li>The first night I used this my tongue felt very sensitive and my mouth burned slightly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been brushing my tongue aggressively and some of the white patch comes off a little at a time, leaving an almost smooth newer tongue.</li>
            <li>so it turnss your regular tooth brushing into a new experience as it foams and tingles).  </li>
            <li>Nothing is really alleviating this dry, sore throat.</li>
            <li>Teeth definitely feel that same tingly feel you get from the whitestrips, but it doesn&#x27;t do much if anything to whiten my teeth by itself, that all comes ffrom the strips.</li>
            <li>One of the primary ingredients in this product, hydrogen peroxide, is known to damage or destroy human cells it comes in contact with, so that may be the cause.</li>
            <li>I started noticing whitening really fast, but last night I used it &amp; it turned my bottom lip in the inside of my mouth w/ white spots.</li>
            <li>When I first used it, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other mouth washes.</li>
            <li>thought maybe it was due to it being my first use, but the symptoms continued with each use.</li>
            <li>Needs a MAJOR do over.</li>
            <li>At least, it is the only one that I could easily FIND without alcohol - I do live in a smaller town</li>
            <li>Apparently these are problems for some but not for others.</li>
            <li>Crest claims I&#x27;m one of the 2% that&#x27;s apparently allergic to it.</li>
            <li>sometimes even the 3D Flexfit Whitestrips ((I&#x27;ve only used 4 so far).</li>
            <li>guess it all depends on how sensitive your gums are as everyone is different.</li>
            <li>My mouth became so sensitive that it bled every time I flossed or brushed.</li>
            <li>So i decided to go back to the old reliable pre wash</li>
            <li>I bought this product hoping it would not only give my teeth a little extra whiteness, but also clean my mouth.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this product works for most people, but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see the results, as I had to stop use due to my gums bleeding when I brushed and a very strange, metallic taste in my mouth hours after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Judging from the other reviews it doesn&#x27;t seem that everyone experiences problems with this rinse, but be warned--it does appear that a reasonable portion of the users that have reviewed have had problems as well.</li>
            <li>Was really happy with this product until about the third day when my gums started to hurt so bad from this.</li>
            <li>I am a major coffee-drinker and notice my front teeth starting to discolor about 3 months after each dental cleaning.</li>
            <li>I thought it was cancer at first, but i noticed that i got a few of blood blisters after every time i used this mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Am an avid tea drinker, and a few months into using this, I realized that the edges of my teeth were getting thoroughly discolored.</li>
            <li>dramatically different and hot and cold food/drink seem to be more intense than usual.</li>
            <li>I finally conceded defeat when the burning sensation on my tongue hurt so much after yesterday morning&#x27;s rinse that tears rolled down my cheeks after I spit (</li>
            <li>I soon developed sores and loose skin on the inside of my lips and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> it doesn&#x27;t taste good</li>
            <li> They do work but aren&#x27;t so good at getting into the spaces between the teeth.</li>
            <li> Delivered in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner, and in good condition.  </li>
            <li> good stuff that does not stain teeth as its competitors.</li>
            <li> It works, good value.</li>
            <li> Good pre wash.</li>
            <li> The taste is good and it foams well.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that it is a good quality product that is affordable!</li>
            <li> I use this combined with the 3d strips and toothpaste and am very pleased with the whiteness (is that a word?)</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this mouthwash!</li>
            <li> You will see amazing results.</li>
            <li> the results were amazing</li>
            <li> the results are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Good product, good price, I searched multiple sites and this was the best at the time of my purchase, recommend.</li>
            <li> I honestly, don&#x27;t mind the aftertaste</li>
            <li> and then (polishes nicely), and</li>
            <li> I have always liked crest line of products.</li>
            <li> Using the product, it created a foam as I swished -- kind of like scrubbing bubbles for my mouth.</li>
            <li> the taste was very strong</li>
            <li> I used my finger to feel for more sloughed off skin and there was much more!</li>
            <li> It is effective at whitening and not causing teeth to be more prone to stains afterward.</li>
            <li> no smell in the morning and the teeth are as bright as the light.</li>
            <li> I hope that I regain my taste- because I love love love food!</li>
            <li> Using my Oral-B Braun electric toothbrush and giving vigorous cleanings, I just wasn&#x27;t making headway with the crack stains, though it did polish my teeth nicely and made them feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> , Good Housekeeping Dec 2008 issue states that whitening mouth washes are not going to provide huge results, but are good for mild surface stains which I guess I don&#x27;t have).</li>
            <li> This product worked really great at first.</li>
            <li> We think we look pretty good,too, so we are happy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a pretty great whitening regiment.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this mouthwash as it is very refreshing and the clean feeling lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li> In any case, I don&#x27;t believe this product is safe to use.</li>
            <li> The best brand for whitening teeth and keeping them white.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe there is this many complaints about this stuff on the web.</li>
            <li> and I actually just bought this at Walmart, but I am so impressed</li>
            <li> but it gets better each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well it would have worked just by itself, but it has made a much greater improvement than anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects and I&#x27;m tremendously pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s been the most convenient way of using it.</li>
            <li> I love the taste and find it much better than sensodyne, listerine, and colgate.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough for mouthwash, but i have not seen any great improvement with whitening.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I should read the bottle more closely.  </li>
            <li> The second best mouthwash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this product works well</li>
            <li> Not to mention the ultra bright, white teeth I can proudly flash throughout my day even though I smoke.</li>
            <li> i was glad to see that i could get it cheaper with the subscription</li>
            <li> My husband and Mother both love this product.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was in most timely fashion.</li>
            <li> works great , just as described, came fast , doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> The results at the next checkup were excellent, even to the surprise of the dentist.</li>
            <li> Nobody tells you that the alcohol in most mouthwashes dissolves the glue in inlays and onlays over time.  </li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It has also worked to remove stains, but I find it is better to just prevent them to begin with :)</li>
            <li> Used along with the 3D toothpaste, it makes a very significant difference in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> This is a nice minty clean mouthwash.</li>
            <li> So anyway, the taste is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I think my aging teeth are simply becoming translucent</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth my teeth feel.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this mouthwash is that it is a non alcohol formula and as far as I can tell it does work (using in conjunction with whitening toothpaste), though the whitening I&#x27;m seeing is mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that it is alcohol free.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in 5 years and my teeth are beautiful, healthy, strong and white and brite.</li>
            <li> The mouthwash has a super fresh taste that I loved.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and find that even with 2x yearly dental visits, my teeth stain easily.  </li>
            <li> I also love waking up in the morning and having a clean feeling mouth.</li>
            <li> Very mild tasting but got used to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> My mouth actually tastes sweet and no bad breath which is awesome!</li>
            <li> Its mouthwash, it tastes kind of funny</li>
            <li> My teeth are in pretty good shape to begin with as I have good cleaning habits, but it didn&#x27;t get me to the next level.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect huge differences in whitening from either product</li>
            <li> But honestly i didn&#x27;t really expect a miracle from an over the counter product.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this is alcohol and fluoride free.</li>
            <li> this might be a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> I love how fresh my mouth feels after using it.  </li>
            <li> This is a great white wash.</li>
            <li> and I am happy that I switched back.</li>
            <li> and my mouth feels more fresh as does my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of mouthwashes over the years primarily to keep fresh breath after brushing and to maintain healthy teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> After using it, I love how clean my mouth felt and how fresh my breath was.</li>
            <li> mare clean when you rinse your mouth you can feel your tooth smooth</li>
            <li> Was excited to find these in bulk.  </li>
            <li> but it does keep my breath fresh!</li>
            <li> The irritation in my mouth was gradual at first, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if the mouthwash was causing issues.</li>
            <li> It never made my mouth feel clean</li>
            <li> Leaves your mouth and breath feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> Also since I am a teeth freak I know that some people have had mouth blisters because their mouth may be over sensitive to this product or products like this one, there are more acidic mouth washes than this one, this was not even a mild acidity compared to most post washes.</li>
            <li> I switched to Listerine right after and my teeth have never been whiter!</li>
            <li> The tissue is swollen and bright red.</li>
            <li> Using these keep my teeth a bright white.</li>
            <li> fantastic for whitening and fresh breath</li>
            <li> Foods didn&#x27;t taste as sweet as before.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much; it was more an act of desperation.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, will look forward to more business with you.</li>
            <li> Not badly at this price</li>
            <li> So far, pretty good.</li>
            <li> It makes my mouth feel very clean and my teeth really appear to be whiter.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean breath.</li>
            <li> Once a day after brushing your teeth before bed will keep your teeth clean and your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> It does leave the mouth feeling decently cleaned; but as of yet i still dono for sure about its advertised whitening power...</li>
            <li> keeps your mouth clean and fresh quickly</li>
            <li> This product has a mild taste.</li>
            <li> These bottles were more than enough, completely satisfied with shipping,product, and use of the product.</li>
            <li> but I noticed results quick I would recommend this</li>
            <li> Cleans well, nice flavor, and good price (when using subscribe and save).&lt;br /&gt;However, the whitening is done (in part at least) with hydrogen peroxide, so this tends to foam up in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have problems with sensitivity, but one day of using this product was more than I could take.  </li>
            <li> you can stand the foaming, then this should be good, but recommend trying smaller sample first before ordering in quantity.</li>
            <li> I even endured to the very end of the first bottle, using it as prescribed: 3 fl oz twice a day and spit after 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> amazing and laaaaaaaaarg enough</li>
            <li> But its worth it.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected, good and reliable.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling fresh without overpowering flavor.</li>
            <li> you know you&#x27;re cleaning your mouth well and the fresh feeling lasts a lot longer than crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Like I said, it might would for most people, but if you have any sort of sensitive mouth or are looking for a mouth wash, choose another product.</li>
            <li> The pain isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a healthy 24 year old).</li>
            <li> the savings is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a healthy 33 year old who has never had a cavity</li>
            <li> Very effective with no burning sensation or heavy alcohol after taste.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve been using a mouthwash right along, I&#x27;ve come to expect this sensation and associate it with my mouth getting cleaner, bacteria being killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a foamy texture and the taste is kind of bitter and sweet.</li>
            <li> a nice mouth wash that leaves your mouth feeling refreshed for a long while.</li>
            <li> For many people, it is critical that a mouthwash not contain alcohol, as that substance is absorbed on the tongue, thus gets into the system even without swallowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Crest 3D glamorous white will give you a brighter smile whitin seven days safely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really great because the toothpaste that goes with this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty freaked out.</li>
            <li> The first couple of days I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste after I spit it out.</li>
            <li> First I tried the Crest 3D Flexfit Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> It actually seemed to highlight the between-the-teeth stains even more -- quite distressing.</li>
            <li> My teeth now have a very even, pleasing color everywhere!</li>
            <li> I had a dentist appointment yesterday and the first thing she asked me was if i was using crest toothpaste or the rinse.</li>
            <li> All of these symptoms subsided over the course of the day, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed.</li>
            <li> I prefer Listerine and if you want to whiten just use the strips which work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just aware of how often I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month, and my teeth really do look whiter!</li>
            <li> The first one I opened, the lid was smashed, and it went all over the place.</li>
            <li> It works better than the white strips.</li>
            <li> The first couple weeks I used this thing it burned.</li>
            <li> Refreshing mouthwash and purchasing in bulk was really a savings over buying at the local stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing that thing where I am suddenly taking better care of my teeth now that I am planning on going to the dentist for the first time in years, and I think after using this stuff for a while my new dentist may not grimace when he looks in my mouth the first time.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that my teeth are becoming whiter over several weeks.</li>
            <li> I was becoming somewhat distressed by stained teeth, especially in the cracks between my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 days and saw some improvement, however, I am rapidly losing the ability to taste certain foods, so far consisting of peanut butter and anything sweet.</li>
            <li> I have been out of my pre wash and had been searching for something new because the wash that I used just didnt seem like it was worth the money or that it was doing what I wanted it too.</li>
            <li> No chapsticks helped and my lips are still super sensitive to acidic foods.</li>
            <li> The plumber who came to my house once told me that whitening mouthwash was an excellent alternative to using bleach which is harsh and sometimes ruins the caulking around the tub or sink.</li>
            <li> sense of taste to certain things.</li>
            <li> FWIW, I have a VERY high pain</li>
            <li> If you want amazing white teeth, I recommend using this with the crest white strips and the whitening tooth paste.</li>
            <li> I think it really works.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s not as fast as visiting the dental office and getting a teeth whitening treatment.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that it does not sting as much.</li>
            <li> I really did.</li>
            <li> job - thank you much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think much about it, but this morning I CAN&#x27;T TASTE ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> too much of it</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> I figured out that this product is absolute poison.  </li>
            <li> There is no evidence of ulcers and I can absolutely say that this is the result of the mouth wash.</li>
            <li> it found up too much when I used</li>
            <li> I rinse before my shower, and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything while getting ready.</li>
            <li> but they are much whiter than what I started with.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how much this is helping, but I do know that my teeth are whiter than they have been before</li>
            <li> I keep swishing this stuff in my mouth for about 1-2 minutes to really let it work</li>
            <li> its refreshing but not really whitening</li>
            <li> I am just hoping they will come off, I am going to dentist very soon.</li>
            <li> thanks, looking forward to having a pump .</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> I actually really like it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed my teeth getting any whiter but still an alright mouthwash.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for a while now and work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would taste it at least a good 4 hours after using it, and it grossed me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a 24 year old who regularly brushes/flosses, I have healthy teeth/gums but my dentist recommended using a mouthwash at night</li>
            <li> THIS MOUTHWASH does NOT sting nearly so much, yes it is still quite minty but the stinging sensation is much more bearable as compared to other mouthwashes containing alcohol</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real change in my teeth nor did they feel as clean as when I used the Listerine (Listerine is a pre-brush rinse that has baking soda or something similar</li>
            <li> Once bleached, they have not reverted back to the original shade regardless of nonuse.  </li>
            <li> It also does not taste like medicine as many other mouthwashes tend to do.</li>
            <li> Im sure other customers would like it too.....</li>
            <li> does not burn at all and tastes much better than other mouthwashes I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I was spitting out more blood than I did before, then I noticed that I barely had any gum left between my two teeth.</li>
            <li> However, I think this is a good mouthwash either prior to brushing or right after brushing just as a cleaning boost and to help kill bacteria in hard to reach parts of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been using it along with the crest 3D white toothpaste &amp; have noticed a tremendous change in the whitening of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It leaves a weird filmy feeling on my gums/cheeks/teeth that I then need to gargle out with more water (a LOT more water) after rinsing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> while it&#x27;s nothing drastic, it looks a little better.</li>
            <li> At first i thought it was normal and would go away in a while, but reading the reviews here, the product has some major issues.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using this product for a few months now and have to say I love the alcohol-free minty flavor, the foaming action, and the slick, smooth, clean feeling on my teeth after each use.</li>
            <li> To my great surprise, within two weeks of once or twice a day use, those irritating crack stains were gone!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a chance, but this kind of sucks.</li>
            <li> Apparently the gasses travel from the mouth to the nasal cavity, which if I recall my anatomy training correctly, is logical.</li>
            <li> I used to use CVS brand to save the money but found this on Amazon and it was actually right about the same price when bought in bulk.</li>
            <li> A recent photo of me confirmed that two months of use, along with the Crest 3D White toothpaste, definitely whitened my smile.</li>
            <li> Say hello to clean mouth, and goodbye to painful, stingy, eye-watering mouthwashes :P</li>
            <li> Not brilliant white (I wasn&#x27;t aiming for that), more like a natural very light ivory color.</li>
            <li> Finally I got the 3D Glamorous White mouthwash because I didn&#x27;t know what else to try and it was easily available.</li>
            <li> , I believe this has caused my teeth to be very sensitive</li>
            <li> I could even drink my hot coffee earlier without wincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just bought Crest 3D Whitening mouthwash yesterday and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve had such a reaction to a mouth wash or rinse.</li>
            <li> I used this mouth wash a total of 3 times exactly as directed on the bottle.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to try their Crest 3D White Multi-Care Rinse and the first time I used it</li>
            <li> big con for me is that this has the most disgusting flavor I have ever experienced!  </li>
            <li> I actually gagged and almost threw up the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I am a teeth freak as most people who know that I usually pre-wash than brush twice than post wash.</li>
            <li> This is nice mouthwash and does the trick, but my girlfriend tells me that the smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I do, however, really like the Crest 3D Vivid White Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Now that you view me as white trash, I&#x27;ll say this: my dentist told me that for as \\&quot;much as you dip and drink coffee, your teeth and gums are darn near perfect.\\</li>
            <li> I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work like a lot of products out there, but i was surprised, my teeth are turning whiter over the course of a week.</li>
            <li> though makes the teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re reformulated it, but it didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive or my gums bleed at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using it for about a month now, and my teeth do not feel sensitive anymore,</li>
            <li> This really helps keep them white and remove stains that may occur between dentist visits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other alcohol free rinse mouthwashes by Crest, but recently I became a coffee drinker</li>
            <li> one is simple: my teeth actually did get whiter after the first bottle.</li>
            <li> I have dipped Copenhagen long cut for the better part of ten years, usually a 1/4 to a whole can a day.</li>
            <li> The first night I used this my tongue felt very sensitive and my mouth burned slightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been brushing my tongue aggressively and some of the white patch comes off a little at a time, leaving an almost smooth newer tongue.</li>
            <li> so it turnss your regular tooth brushing into a new experience as it foams and tingles).  </li>
            <li> Nothing is really alleviating this dry, sore throat.</li>
            <li> Teeth definitely feel that same tingly feel you get from the whitestrips, but it doesn&#x27;t do much if anything to whiten my teeth by itself, that all comes ffrom the strips.</li>
            <li> One of the primary ingredients in this product, hydrogen peroxide, is known to damage or destroy human cells it comes in contact with, so that may be the cause.</li>
            <li> I started noticing whitening really fast, but last night I used it &amp; it turned my bottom lip in the inside of my mouth w/ white spots.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other mouth washes.</li>
            <li> thought maybe it was due to it being my first use, but the symptoms continued with each use.</li>
            <li> Needs a MAJOR do over.</li>
            <li> At least, it is the only one that I could easily FIND without alcohol - I do live in a smaller town</li>
            <li> Apparently these are problems for some but not for others.</li>
            <li> Crest claims I&#x27;m one of the 2% that&#x27;s apparently allergic to it.</li>
            <li> sometimes even the 3D Flexfit Whitestrips ((I&#x27;ve only used 4 so far).</li>
            <li> guess it all depends on how sensitive your gums are as everyone is different.</li>
            <li> My mouth became so sensitive that it bled every time I flossed or brushed.</li>
            <li> So i decided to go back to the old reliable pre wash</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would not only give my teeth a little extra whiteness, but also clean my mouth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this product works for most people, but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see the results, as I had to stop use due to my gums bleeding when I brushed and a very strange, metallic taste in my mouth hours after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Judging from the other reviews it doesn&#x27;t seem that everyone experiences problems with this rinse, but be warned--it does appear that a reasonable portion of the users that have reviewed have had problems as well.</li>
            <li> Was really happy with this product until about the third day when my gums started to hurt so bad from this.</li>
            <li> I am a major coffee-drinker and notice my front teeth starting to discolor about 3 months after each dental cleaning.</li>
            <li> I thought it was cancer at first, but i noticed that i got a few of blood blisters after every time i used this mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Am an avid tea drinker, and a few months into using this, I realized that the edges of my teeth were getting thoroughly discolored.</li>
            <li> dramatically different and hot and cold food/drink seem to be more intense than usual.</li>
            <li> I finally conceded defeat when the burning sensation on my tongue hurt so much after yesterday morning&#x27;s rinse that tears rolled down my cheeks after I spit (</li>
            <li> I soon developed sores and loose skin on the inside of my lips and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product does not burn when used and, thus far, has not turned my teeth brown like other similar alcohol-free products.  </li>
            <li> so I literally spit out large, white chunks of my inner mouth because this product killed and bleached the cells!</li>
            <li> I am not sure why so many reviewers have had various negative issues using this product; I suspect their teeth and gum issues stem from a much deeper and prolonged problem, i.e. poor oral care, particular sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and/or simple genetics.</li>
            <li> Its basically almost as if the peroxide killed my taste buds and new ones are now growing back.</li>
            <li> but i couln&#x27;t continue to use it long enough to see.</li>
            <li> Also, most mouthwashes are very stingy (painful) and by the time you have gargled for the minimal 30 seconds or so, your eyes would probably be watering if you aren&#x27;t near the point of crying from the pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that overuse of whitening products can mess up the natural balance of your mouth</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty nice teeth, so Crest 3D white has been my counterbalance of choice for my terrible habits.</li>
            <li> formula also froths up while being swished around in your mouth and makes the bad flavor especially bad (should be a great thing-to make sure your whole mouth is coated).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a mouth wash, definitely don&#x27;t use this product because it leaves behind a hydrogen peroxide taste in the mouth, and not a fresh, clean taste.</li>
            <li> It does not have a refreshing, minty smell, but instead has an artificial smell.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it as long as it works.</li>
            <li> After using this mouthwash for 3 or 4 weeks, I noticed sugar-sweetened beverages began tasting strange.</li>
            <li> But after a while it went away, but then it hurt all night long.</li>
            <li> It lasts all night long.</li>
            <li> I typically use the blue Crest 3D and whitening strips, but they don&#x27;t get all the way to the gums and so there can be a small discolored line right at the gums that is really unsightly and irritating.  </li>
            <li> Some people say this burned or peeled their mouths, but plain old Hydrogen Peroxide can do that as well.</li>
            <li> When you gargle with this and then spit it out, a foam, like peroxide, stays behind right at the gum line (my problem spot) and continues to do its work.  </li>
            <li> I am willing to put up with that if the bleaching action works because I am unhappy with the appearance of my teeth and unwilling to give up various foods that stain them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE, Nov. 4, 2011: I want to report that I have been using this product daily for 5 months now without any of the gum-pain, bleeding or tooth sensitivity problems reported by other users.</li>
            <li> but when I started using it daily I had extreme adverse effect.  </li>
            <li> Upon investigating other people are having similar experiences....</li>
            <li> Only once a day and really only when I feel my teeth are a little lackluster.</li>
            <li> I am now medically uninsured for the 1st time in my life (due to a job change) and I&#x27;ve stepped up my brushing, flossing, and rinsing habits to prevent any dental problems.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry your mouth out.  </li>
            <li> The trouble with me is that I am impatient and wish it would work wonders much faster.</li>
            <li> so our range of products may be limited.</li>
            <li> and they assure me that I will get my taste back and that my swelling will go down in a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li> Currently dumping it down the drain and throwing it away.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended - have been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks along with the matching toothpaste - won&#x27;t go back to the stronger bleach gel that can be irritating.</li>
            <li> My gums and tongue actually feel LESS sore already.</li>
            <li> But the discoloration is almost half gone and some random person complemented me on how shiny and smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rinse for a few years and while the whitening effect is slight, I like the flavor and foaming action.</li>
            <li> Even a badly stained tooth on the inside of my mouth was free of stain!</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the negative reviews on this product ass</li>
            <li> stopped using the 3D White and the problems cleared in a few days.</li>
            <li> The are not really any cons for this product.</li>
            <li> My marker is one capped incisor that unfortunately matched my teeth &#x27;way back when and now is far too white, creating a telltale contrast.</li>
            <li> However, at the same time, there seems to be a few cons to come with</li>
            <li> There are numerous sites of similar complaints about this product with some symptoms far worse than mine!</li>
            <li> It has a strange, a bit sour, aftertaste.</li>
            <li> As always this may be mental.</li>
            <li> Woke up with 4 places on my gums that are raw and red.</li>
            <li> Dispite drinking black tea everyday, I can definitely tell they are lighter.</li>
            <li> I did some online research and found other users reporting these and other health concerns.</li>
            <li> have not (yet) noticed any of the adverse reactions reported by other users.</li>
            <li> but if you have extremely stained teeth, I think the results would be marginal and you would need to get the Dental bleaching trays.  </li>
            <li> noticeable different in my teeth when I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I use this every other day, alternating with ACT so not to de-mineralize my teeth.</li>
            <li> would not recommend this product to other customers.</li>
            <li> So maybe there are other ingerdients that collectively caused my tongue to turn into an albino spongebob- who knows.</li>
            <li> Plus, alcohol is not the antibacterial component of products like Listerine -- it&#x27;s the other ingredients that are dissolved in it.  </li>
            <li> Now my mouth is very dry and feels slightly burned.</li>
            <li> If only I knew that the active ingredient was peroxide (#note to self \\&quot;duh of course teeth whitening&#x3D;</li>
            <li> Not worth it</li>
            <li> My brother thought I had my teeth professionally whitened until I told him my secret.</li>
            <li> So I have discontinued using this product and even though it&#x27;s been about 3 days since I used it, the white patches are slowly going away.</li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> During the same day my teeth became very sensitive to heat and cold.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; agent they use in this, is too harsh for some people, as I noticed from other reviewers their gums were being affected as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff morning and night for over a year and a half and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care about getting my money back, though if there is serious damage to my health, I will be looking into suing your company for RUINING my mouth.</li>
            <li> Works well, with less burn.</li>
            <li> My teeth have been also slightly sore.</li>
            <li> It has helped to whiten teeth but tastes bland.</li>
            <li> I bought three of these suckers and I won&#x27;t think about picking some up for a long time now.</li>
            <li> and I stay away from smoking, sodas, and coffee, but do drink dark tea almost everyday.</li>
            <li> I want to be clear that I don&#x27;t doubt the reports of others; I am simply stating that with long-term use, I have not experienced these negative results.experienced these negative results.</li>
            <li> It foams up in your mouth, which helps get it to all the little places it needs to go to.  </li>
            <li> It did show immediate whitening results, but the consequences are not worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend because its just not very refreshing with that aftertaste.</li>
            <li> It works, whitening my teeth after just a few uses.  </li>
            <li> It freshens breath but is ber chemically tadting and after use i kept having to spit every few seconds until all the leftover foamy grossness was rinsed out.</li>
            <li> I see mouth tingling or pain as progress, bacteria being killed.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is because of the crest 3D white toothpaste or the 3D white rinse (unfortunately i&#x27;ve been using both for the past 7-8 months).</li>
            <li> I was so confused why I had pain, numbness and white spots all over my tongue.</li>
            <li> Even though I don&#x27;t swallow this mouthwash, it caused me to have heartburn every day, worse yet in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> few uears ago I had tried using a dental tray with whitening gel at night.</li>
            <li> With these two steps (use caution if you feel anything funky going on, take a break for a few days)</li>
            <li> AND it doesn&#x27;t seem to have made my teeth any whiter than it was a few weeks ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just opened the second one, and it&#x27;s lid is broken as well, and leaking all over the place.</li>
            <li> but I use the thing everyday now</li>
            <li> I used this product last night for the first time and afterwards my mouth hurt SO bad!</li>
            <li> found this fairly unpleasant, and am now just using up my last purchase by using this, then rinsing with a smaller amount of Listerine to &#x27;cleanse&#x27; the foamy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I figured out the common active ingredient was hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i thought this stuff tasted pretty bad</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and wine and use to get really bad stains despite brushing several times a day AND using white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this stuff -- no stains!</li>
            <li> The taste suits us and we believe our breath is less offensive by using Crest 3D  and our teeth are slowly getting whiter.</li>
            <li> I used the Crest 3-D strips for a month, have been using the 3-D tooth paste and this Whitener for 8 months and can tell very little difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for the past two years.</li>
            <li> I feel like it does work if you can get past the pain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure anything can correct that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what it is</li>
            <li> We usually have 2 bottles in use at a time anyway.</li>
            <li> Immediately after trying the 3d white mouthwash I noticed an uncomfortable burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what it is that causes this flavor but</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  </li>
            <li> My healthy gums are bleeding from this terrible product.  </li>
            <li> not sure If I should just use it or throw it out or give it away...</li>
            <li> Not sure it made my teeth any whiter</li>
            <li> After awhile the peroxide taste goes away with continually use so disregard negative reviews regarding the small hint of after taste peroxide.</li>
            <li> At least with listerine</li>
            <li> At least for</li>
            <li> It does take time but over a period of time it will slowly make your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> I have never been more disgusted, disappointed, or infuriated by a product before purchasing Crest 3D White Multi-Care Rinse.</li>
            <li> The product tastes bad and barely did anything for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed a very small whitening effect, but my teeth were not that stained to begin with</li>
            <li> So, other than brushing regularly, which I learned after a very painful root canal experience (it wasn&#x27;t the procedure that hurt, but the events necessitating the procedure, that were torture), I&#x27;m pretty much brutal on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Hopefully nothing serious.</li>
            <li> It actually reminded me of years ago when I had a really bad case of strep throat and my mouth got this film in it.  </li>
            <li> Prior to these trays, my teeth were an ugly shade of brown.  </li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> And yes it is painful at times- especially when eating something spicy or drinking something cold/hot.</li>
            <li> One night when the extreme pain and burnt numb feeling in my tongue</li>
            <li> It burns so bad can&#x27;t go by the directions of how long you need to rinse with it.</li>
            <li> Also, the taste is pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> Others complained that with prolonged use Crest mouthwash can leave BROWN SPOTS on your teeth!</li>
            <li> First of all the taste is awful!</li>
            <li> I wanted to share my experience to dissuade other potential buyers from buying this terrible stuff!</li>
            <li> Can only take a few secs of this horrible mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never experienced this with the whitening strips or toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than it taste like being sick.  </li>
            <li> Even my regular dental routine has become a complex task because this crap HURTS!</li>
            <li> Seriously, that stuff looks so fake and your teeth can blind people.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absurd and ridiculous that this product is on the shelf!</li>
            <li> Lame.</li>
            <li> But I knew something was really wrong when I kept finding shredded gum in my mouth every morning and brushing my teeth began to hurt my gums.</li>
            <li> In the morning I no longer have the nasty morning breath or the gross taste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> What is unfortunate about it is that I thought I was buying a mouth wash instead of rinse, but decided to try this out anyway to see if it could whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I thought this product tasted awful and it made my teeth sensitive to cold beverages and air.</li>
            <li> Makes my mouth feel weird also</li>
            <li> Leaves a weird taste in your mouth after you spit it out...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would have done this if I didnt already have gum problems, but I know it is very scary &amp; now I&#x27;m in a worse place than before.</li>
            <li> The product is also very expensive and poor tasting formula.</li>
            <li> I got 1 bottle of this at Walmart because I was looking for a mouthwash without alcohol and without sodium lauryl sulfate (for times when I got some canker sores in the mouth from accidental bites) because the alcohol and the SLS are bad for the mouth (and worse for mouth wounds).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it was a bad choice.</li>
            <li> After days of pain, swelling, mouth sores, swollen lips and numb tongue</li>
            <li> Has a bad taste in the end.</li>
            <li> This product is bad.</li>
            <li> It does not taste bad.</li>
            <li> Yikes it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> I got the whiter teeth, but I also got an overly-sensitive mouth that became EXTREMELY painful to use a toothbrush &amp; dental floss on.</li>
            <li> I had to stop using it because it became too painful to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me :(  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for 6 months, and went for a dental cleaning, and my doctor was disappointed how stained my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> Crest should be boycotted for this horrible, disturbing product.</li>
            <li> I was highly disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Really Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate bleach trays and strips</li>
            <li> Worst part was the fact it made my lips have a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> The worst part (as if what I just typed wasn&#x27;t bad enough)food/drink all taste</li>
            <li> me, some foods trigger very bad heartburn.</li>
            <li> It is very painful to eat and talk at times.</li>
            <li> so I believe this product was the culprit, which is just very tragic for my teeth.</li>
            <li> Woke up with the worst sore throat ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And WHY is this HORRIBLE product still on the shelves?</li>
            <li> I am disgusted with your company.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting, I didn&#x27;t want to swallow it</li>
            <li> This mouthwash taste horrible!</li>
            <li> It tastes horrible and I did not see any difference while using this.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!</li>
            <li> Taste is horrible and once you have rinsed and spit it continues to foam up in your mouth; you continue to spit foam</li>
            <li> two - three times to get the horrible taste gone!  </li>
            <li> Did I mention this is a HORRIBLE product!?!?</li>
            <li> This stuff taste so nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only freshened breath. I didn&#x27;t see one shade whiter.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product and used it at night. I made the mistake of GARGLING with it. Woke up with the worst sore throat ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it a chance, but this kind of sucks. Nothing is really alleviating this dry, sore throat. Lame.</li>
            <li> I wanted Colgate Peroxyl, but bought this instead. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Started using this product several weeks ago on an irregular basis until last week when I used it daily. I soon developed sores and loose skin on the inside of my lips and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the 3D White and the problems cleared in a few days. Also, didn&#x27;t see any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Cleans well, nice flavor, and good price (when using subscribe and save).&lt;br /&gt;However, the whitening is done (in part at least) with hydrogen peroxide, so this tends to foam up in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I found this fairly unpleasant, and am now just using up my last purchase by using this, then rinsing with a smaller amount of Listerine to &#x27;cleanse&#x27; the foamy feeling.  Won&#x27;t be renewing my subscribe and save for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can stand the foaming, then this should be good, but recommend trying smaller sample first before ordering in quantity.</li>
            <li> My teeth have started yellowing and I was looking for something to help besides going movie star bleaching. Seriously, that stuff looks so fake and your teeth can blind people. No reason to go 3000 lumens with your smile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this stuff helps remove some of the surface stain. If you are light coffee/tea drinker like me, I find it best to use after you have your morning cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is coffee, white rinse, water rinse, brush teeth, water rinse, then some mouthwash. After that I save kittens from trees, organize neighborhood bake sales, and day trade on the NASDAQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to help those yellow chompers, this will work, but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mouthwash for the past two years. My teeth are looking whiter than ever. I think it really works. However it&#x27;s not as fast as visiting the dental office and getting a teeth whitening treatment. It does take time but over a period of time it will slowly make your teeth whiter. It does freshen up your breath as well and I noticed that it does not sting as much. Again perfect product at a cheap price from Amazon!</li>
            <li> The are not really any cons for this product. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work like a lot of products out there, but i was surprised, my teeth are turning whiter over the course of a week. I will continue to use it as long as it works.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this whitening rinse. I really did. I even endured to the very end of the first bottle, using it as prescribed: 3 fl oz twice a day and spit after 60 seconds. But I knew something was really wrong when I kept finding shredded gum in my mouth every morning and brushing my teeth began to hurt my gums. My tongue also started giving me a burning sensation while my mouth broke out into canker sores in different areas two weeks ago. I finally conceded defeat when the burning sensation on my tongue hurt so much after yesterday morning&#x27;s rinse that tears rolled down my cheeks after I spit (FWIW, I have a VERY high pain threshold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this last night and this morning. What do you know? My gums and tongue actually feel LESS sore already. I could even drink my hot coffee earlier without wincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason why the Crest 3D White Glamorous White Rinse still gets two stars from me instead of one is simple: my teeth actually did get whiter after the first bottle. YMMV.</li>
            <li> i thought this stuff tasted pretty bad and it didnt seem to do anything, if you want whiter teeth, i would go with the crest strips, very very effective</li>
            <li> fantastic for whitening and fresh breath</li>
            <li> Teeth definitely feel that same tingly feel you get from the whitestrips, but it doesn&#x27;t do much if anything to whiten my teeth by itself, that all comes ffrom the strips. Also, the taste is pretty nasty.</li>
            <li> After using this mouthwash for 3 or 4 weeks, I noticed sugar-sweetened beverages began tasting strange. My husband also said the lining of his cheeks and gums began peeling off in sheets. I did some online research and found other users reporting these and other health concerns. One of the primary ingredients in this product, hydrogen peroxide, is known to damage or destroy human cells it comes in contact with, so that may be the cause. In any case, I don&#x27;t believe this product is safe to use.</li>
            <li> Actually whitens and keeps them white if used with the rest of the saje line. The best brand for whitening teeth and keeping them white.</li>
            <li> Not badly at this price</li>
            <li> works alright. But honestly i didn&#x27;t really expect a miracle from an over the counter product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week. I rinse before I brush and I use the crest 3D toothpaste as well. I do see a difference. I however do not like the aftertaste. But its worth it. In the morning I no longer have the nasty morning breath or the gross taste in my mouth. My mouth actually tastes sweet and no bad breath which is awesome! I def would recommend and continue to use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mouthwash. Bush your teeth. Use mouthwash. I don&#x27;t know, my mom just told me to. I bought three of these suckers and I won&#x27;t think about picking some up for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, and as promised.  Very good job - thank you much.</li>
            <li> One of the best deals on amazon! You get 3 for like the price of 2!</li>
            <li> Awesome, exactly as advertised and incredible packaging.</li>
            <li> Was really happy with this product until about the third day when my gums started to hurt so bad from this. Yikes it&#x27;s painful. I feel like it does work if you can get past the pain. Has a bad taste in the end. Tastes just like the whitening strips.</li>
            <li> At least, it is the only one that I could easily FIND without alcohol - I do live in a smaller town so our range of products may be limited. For many people, it is critical that a mouthwash not contain alcohol, as that substance is absorbed on the tongue, thus gets into the system even without swallowing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can smell/taste the hydrogen peroxide after use. Apparently the gasses travel from the mouth to the nasal cavity, which if I recall my anatomy training correctly, is logical. I am willing to put up with that if the bleaching action works because I am unhappy with the appearance of my teeth and unwilling to give up various foods that stain them. I am also thinking that I will use this mouthwash for a period of time, then return to my regular one. And plan to keep swapping off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not (yet) noticed any of the adverse reactions reported by other users. However, I do feel the same sensations caused by the Crest Pro-Health \\&quot;multi-protection\\&quot; rinse I had been using prior, which is to say that a tingling is produced that some might even call pain. Because I&#x27;ve been using a mouthwash right along, I&#x27;ve come to expect this sensation and associate it with my mouth getting cleaner, bacteria being killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that my teeth are becoming whiter over several weeks. My marker is one capped incisor that unfortunately matched my teeth &#x27;way back when and now is far too white, creating a telltale contrast. I think my aging teeth are simply becoming translucent and I&#x27;m not sure anything can correct that. But with this whitening rinse, they definitely are better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE, Nov. 4, 2011: I want to report that I have been using this product daily for 5 months now without any of the gum-pain, bleeding or tooth sensitivity problems reported by other users. Apparently these are problems for some but not for others. I want to be clear that I don&#x27;t doubt the reports of others; I am simply stating that with long-term use, I have not experienced these negative results.experienced these negative results.</li>
            <li> I got 1 bottle of this at Walmart because I was looking for a mouthwash without alcohol and without sodium lauryl sulfate (for times when I got some canker sores in the mouth from accidental bites) because the alcohol and the SLS are bad for the mouth (and worse for mouth wounds). Also, most mouthwashes are very stingy (painful) and by the time you have gargled for the minimal 30 seconds or so, your eyes would probably be watering if you aren&#x27;t near the point of crying from the pain. THIS MOUTHWASH does NOT sting nearly so much, yes it is still quite minty but the stinging sensation is much more bearable as compared to other mouthwashes containing alcohol (my eyes didn&#x27;t even get teary). It does leave the mouth feeling decently cleaned; but as of yet i still dono for sure about its advertised whitening power...However, I think this is a good mouthwash either prior to brushing or right after brushing just as a cleaning boost and to help kill bacteria in hard to reach parts of the mouth. Say hello to clean mouth, and goodbye to painful, stingy, eye-watering mouthwashes :P</li>
            <li> I use it daily, seems to help.</li>
            <li> This product worked really great at first. I&#x27;ve been using it since last saturday. I started using mouthwash &amp; crest pro health gum protection b/c my gums were bleeding when I brushed so I researched &amp; found out I had gingivitis. So I knew I needed to make changes in my dental hygiene. I started noticing whitening really fast, but last night I used it &amp; it turned my bottom lip in the inside of my mouth w/ white spots. It freaked me out, I thought my lips skin was coming off, it freaked me out, like i thought it burned it, b/c it felt like it was burning &amp; thats why I even looked. But after a while it went away, but then it hurt all night long. This morning after brushing my teeth w/ the pro health toothpaste it was hurting to brush &amp; I was spitting out more blood than I did before, then I noticed that I barely had any gum left between my two teeth. Then I looked &amp; saw a lot of people complaining of their gums hurting, I wish I saw these before I used it. I don&#x27;t know if it would have done this if I didnt already have gum problems, but I know it is very scary &amp; now I&#x27;m in a worse place than before.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended - have been using it twice a day for about 2 weeks along with the matching toothpaste - won&#x27;t go back to the stronger bleach gel that can be irritating.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, I searched multiple sites and this was the best at the time of my purchase, recommend.</li>
            <li> Along with Crest&#x27;s 3D toothpaste, I began to see results after using them for 1-2 weeks. However, at the same time, there seems to be a few cons to come with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs&lt;br /&gt;-Worked for me! I brush my teeth 2-3 times a day and use the rinse morning and night&lt;br /&gt;-Feels like it works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs&lt;br /&gt;-The aftertaste isn&#x27;t that great.&lt;br /&gt;-Lost sense of taste to certain things. Foods didn&#x27;t taste as sweet as before. This has happened in the middle of the day. Hours after rinsed with the mouthwash. Taste eventually comes back.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! I just bought Crest 3D Whitening mouthwash yesterday and used it for the first time last night. I immediately felt tingling on my tongue, and saw that my taste buds were turning red. I didn&#x27;t think much about it, but this morning I CAN&#x27;T TASTE ANYTHING. I can&#x27;t believe there is this many complaints about this stuff on the web. Others complained that with prolonged use Crest mouthwash can leave BROWN SPOTS on your teeth! I figured since it was Crest they would do their homework. I&#x27;m pretty freaked out. Definitely not buying ANYTHING from crest anymore.</li>
            <li> Daily use it....too much of it though makes the teeth sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff morning and night for over a year and a half and have never had any problems. I use this combined with the 3d strips and toothpaste and am very pleased with the whiteness (is that a word?) of my teeth. I decided to write this review because of all the reviews saying it made them have bleeding gums ect. I have not once had anything like others have described and would recommend this product. I would guess its the chemical propylene glycol in this mouth wash that can cause problems - surgeons used to use propylene glycol to sterilize their hands before surgery until it was shown to eat away at the skin on their hands. That might sounds a bit sketchy but from my own experience it seems that a cap of this rinse for only a minute in your mouth has nothing dangerous to it. I was just at the dentist two weeks ago and she said I have very healthy gums!</li>
            <li> Works!!! this is a great product, freshens and you can feel it doing it&#x27;s stuff. I would recommend it to anyone. found it 1st in the USA!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not used to swishing hydrogen peroxide around inside your mouth, this mouthwash can take some getting used to. The first couple of days I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stand the taste after I spit it out. I would taste it at least a good 4 hours after using it, and it grossed me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I stuck with it, and I got used to it, and now I don&#x27;t even notice it. Is it whitening my teeth? I think so. I&#x27;m about two weeks in and it seems to be making a difference. I&#x27;m doing that thing where I am suddenly taking better care of my teeth now that I am planning on going to the dentist for the first time in years, and I think after using this stuff for a while my new dentist may not grimace when he looks in my mouth the first time.</li>
            <li> This product does help whiten teeth.  I drink a lot of coffee and find that even with 2x yearly dental visits, my teeth stain easily.  After using this product, I noticed a visible difference vs when using another brand.  This is the only brand that I use now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about a week and I definitely see an improvement in the whiteness of my teeth. I brush my teeth with the crest whitening toothpaste, rinse with water, use the mouthwash, then rinse with water again just to avoid swallowing any and to get rid of the extra peroxide. Definitely makes my mouth feel cleaner than just brushing. I personally like the taste but it might just not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> It works, whitening my teeth after just a few uses.  I use about 2-3 times a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I think this rinse was working but i couln&#x27;t continue to use it long enough to see. First of all the taste is awful! It freshens breath but is ber chemically tadting and after use i kept having to spit every few seconds until all the leftover foamy grossness was rinsed out. Worst part was the fact it made my lips have a bad reaction. I&#x27;ve heard that overuse of whitening products can mess up the natural balance of your mouth but i&#x27;ve used listerene rinse for years with no problem. This product mafe my lips irritated and chapped! The corners of my mouth cracked and sore. No chapsticks helped and my lips are still super sensitive to acidic foods. Not using this product again- going back to listerene!</li>
            <li> This is the email I sent to Crest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When will the bleeding stop? When will I no longer have constant pain in my gums? I have never been more disgusted, disappointed, or infuriated by a product before purchasing Crest 3D White Multi-Care Rinse. I have never had oral hygiene issues until after I used this product- and I only used it 3 times! It has now been 10 days since I last rinsed my mouth with this POISON and my gums are still sore, swollen, and bleeding! I don&#x27;t care about getting my money back, though if there is serious damage to my health, I will be looking into suing your company for RUINING my mouth. At this point, I would just like to know WHEN my mouth will no longer be in pain? WHEN will the bleeding stop? And WHY is this HORRIBLE product still on the shelves? There are numerous sites of similar complaints about this product with some symptoms far worse than mine! It SICKENS me that I&#x27;m one of the luckier ones- I can still taste food!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give me answers. I am disgusted with your company. I will NEVER buy a Crest product again and I have made a point to tell EVERYONE not to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Great seller- Great value-Great Experience.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I expected, good and reliable.</li>
            <li> I just recently tried this and I really like it.  It foams up in your mouth, which helps get it to all the little places it needs to go to.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh without overpowering flavor.</li>
            <li> We are trying this mouth wash for a while to see if it does what it promises. So far, pretty good. No complaints. The taste suits us and we believe our breath is less offensive by using Crest 3D  and our teeth are slowly getting whiter. The trouble with me is that I am impatient and wish it would work wonders much faster. That&#x27;s why I did not give Crest  five stars, only four. So anyway, the taste is pretty good. We think we look pretty good,too, so we are happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks along with the white 3D brilliance toothpaste and I cannot believe the difference!  I typically use the blue Crest 3D and whitening strips, but they don&#x27;t get all the way to the gums and so there can be a small discolored line right at the gums that is really unsightly and irritating.  But the discoloration is almost half gone and some random person complemented me on how shiny and smooth my teeth were (the toothpaste claims to do this)!!!  When you gargle with this and then spit it out, a foam, like peroxide, stays behind right at the gum line (my problem spot) and continues to do its work.  I am not a review writer and I actually just bought this at Walmart, but I am so impressed, I had to come on and tell everyone.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I just bought it and already see results. It did bother my gums in the beginning but it gets better each time I use it. I honestly, don&#x27;t mind the aftertaste and I love how smooth my teeth feel. I use it at night after brushing. The results are great! I also love waking up in the morning and having a clean feeling mouth. It lasts all night long.</li>
            <li> After using this product my lips are cracked, I have a sore on the tip of my tongue and my gums are swollen.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve had such a reaction to a mouth wash or rinse.</li>
            <li> The first night I used this my tongue felt very sensitive and my mouth burned slightly. I used it three times and lost taste in my mouth for two days. Crest claims I&#x27;m one of the 2% that&#x27;s apparently allergic to it. I use their 3D white tooth paste with no problem so I don&#x27;t know how it could be so different but after reading here that some people have lost taste permanently I will never use this again.</li>
            <li> The product tastes bad and barely did anything for me. It never made my mouth feel clean it doesn&#x27;t taste good it doesn&#x27;t give the tingle and burn of listerine. At least with listerine you know you&#x27;re cleaning your mouth well and the fresh feeling lasts a lot longer than crest mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This works so well that I feel compelled to write this review.  I was becoming somewhat distressed by stained teeth, especially in the cracks between my teeth. In part, this was probably from the coffee, tea, chocolate and hazelnuts that I eat. First I tried the Crest 3D Flexfit Whitestrips. They do work but aren&#x27;t so good at getting into the spaces between the teeth. It actually seemed to highlight the between-the-teeth stains even more -- quite distressing. Then I found and used the Crest Pro-Health HD Daily Two-Step toothpaste system. Using my Oral-B Braun electric toothbrush and giving vigorous cleanings, I just wasn&#x27;t making headway with the crack stains, though it did polish my teeth nicely and made them feel nice and smooth. Finally I got the 3D Glamorous White mouthwash because I didn&#x27;t know what else to try and it was easily available. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much; it was more an act of desperation. To my great surprise, within two weeks of once or twice a day use, those irritating crack stains were gone! All gone! Even a badly stained tooth on the inside of my mouth was free of stain! My teeth now have a very even, pleasing color everywhere! Not brilliant white (I wasn&#x27;t aiming for that), more like a natural very light ivory color. It has worked so well that I will forever be using this mouthwash. I don&#x27;t know how well it would have worked just by itself, but it has made a much greater improvement than anything else. I&#x27;ll continue using my whitening toothpaste (Sensodyne), the HD Two-Step toothpaste now and then (polishes nicely), and sometimes even the 3D Flexfit Whitestrips ((I&#x27;ve only used 4 so far). But the 3D Mouthwash I&#x27;ll use every day forever! I&#x27;ve had no adverse effects and I&#x27;m tremendously pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this product works for most people, but I couldn&#x27;t use it long enough to see the results, as I had to stop use due to my gums bleeding when I brushed and a very strange, metallic taste in my mouth hours after use. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with bleeding gums or anything of that sort before I started using this mouth rinse. What is unfortunate about it is that I thought I was buying a mouth wash instead of rinse, but decided to try this out anyway to see if it could whiten my teeth. If you&#x27;re looking for a mouth wash, definitely don&#x27;t use this product because it leaves behind a hydrogen peroxide taste in the mouth, and not a fresh, clean taste. Like I said, it might would for most people, but if you have any sort of sensitive mouth or are looking for a mouth wash, choose another product.</li>
            <li> After days of pain, swelling, mouth sores, swollen lips and numb tongue I figured out that this product is absolute poison.  I have used it on and off for a year with no problem but when I started using it daily I had extreme adverse effect.  Not knowing what was causing the problem I went to the doctor and the dentist nether which knew what was causing all the problems.  I was referred to ENT and oral surgeon.  One night when the extreme pain and burnt numb feeling in my tongue woke me I began researching my symptoms.  I found page after page of people complaining of both this rinse and rest multi-care tooth paste.  I called Crest and they assure me that I will get my taste back and that my swelling will go down in a couple of weeks.  I do not feel reassured only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I used this mouth wash a total of 3 times exactly as directed on the bottle. My gums, cheeks, and tongue now feel like they have been burned. The tissue is swollen and bright red. It is very painful to eat and talk at times. There is no evidence of ulcers and I can absolutely say that this is the result of the mouth wash. I searched this problem and there have been 491 similar complaints on a consumer  product review website. It did show immediate whitening results, but the consequences are not worth it!</li>
            <li> So, other than brushing regularly, which I learned after a very painful root canal experience (it wasn&#x27;t the procedure that hurt, but the events necessitating the procedure, that were torture), I&#x27;m pretty much brutal on my teeth. I have dipped Copenhagen long cut for the better part of ten years, usually a 1/4 to a whole can a day. I know. Judge me if you like. BUT! What I do is ALWAYS rinse my mouth out afterwards. I also drink a lot of coffee and smoke cigarettes fairly regularly. Now that you view me as white trash, I&#x27;ll say this: my dentist told me that for as \\&quot;much as you dip and drink coffee, your teeth and gums are darn near perfect.\\&quot; When he pokes and prods, I feel no pain in the gums. I attribute it to this rinse and others. My teeth don&#x27;t look like a smoker&#x27;s, and they&#x27;re not dingy looking. They&#x27;re pretty nice teeth, so Crest 3D white has been my counterbalance of choice for my terrible habits. Been using it for over a year, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I&#x27;m like that one guy: I see mouth tingling or pain as progress, bacteria being killed. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I cant believe this product has not been taken off the shelves yet. My gums are swollen and bleeding. I also have stains on my teeth - not sure if it is because of the crest 3D white toothpaste or the 3D white rinse (unfortunately i&#x27;ve been using both for the past 7-8 months). I had a dentist appointment yesterday and the first thing she asked me was if i was using crest toothpaste or the rinse. Please dont buy this product and if you are using one throw it out !</li>
            <li> I have used this product for just a couple of weeks and it seems to work</li>
            <li> It is my second time to purchase this product. It is helping my teeth for whitening and without any burning.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it at all it found up too much when I used so I didn&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> I thought this product tasted awful and it made my teeth sensitive to cold beverages and air. I do, however, really like the Crest 3D Vivid White Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local drugstore when it was on sale. When I first used it, I noticed that it doesn&#x27;t sting as much as other mouth washes. Through out the day, I couldn&#x27;t get rid of the after taste; it was nauseating. Will not use it again.</li>
            <li> Having used Listerine&#x27;s Whitening Rinse for several months I wanted to try a different brand of morning rinse and  purchased 3 bottles of Crest Whitening Rinse.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real change in my teeth nor did they feel as clean as when I used the Listerine (Listerine is a pre-brush rinse that has baking soda or something similar so it turnss your regular tooth brushing into a new experience as it foams and tingles).  The Crest Whitening rinse worked well as a germ fighter /standard rinse.  I didn&#x27;t expect huge differences in whitening from either product but I felt my teeth were cleaner with the Listerine (by the way, Good Housekeeping Dec 2008 issue states that whitening mouth washes are not going to provide huge results, but are good for mild surface stains which I guess I don&#x27;t have).</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean breath. Once a day after brushing your teeth before bed will keep your teeth clean and your breath fresh.</li>
            <li> This product is bad. Hands down. Harmful. I was so confused why I had pain, numbness and white spots all over my tongue. I used the product once a day. Then I stopped using the product. Then the symptoms went away. Then I started using it again. The symptoms came back so I stopped again and, low and behold, so did the symptoms. You do the math.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that this is alcohol and fluoride free. I use it daily, and have had no problems. I rinse before my shower, and don&#x27;t eat or drink anything while getting ready. That&#x27;s been the most convenient way of using it. I wouldn&#x27;t use it before bed, if you don&#x27;t wish to have the lingering \\&quot;film\\&quot; that some speak of. I love the taste and find it much better than sensodyne, listerine, and colgate.</li>
            <li> It whitens, but at a cost. At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With me, some foods trigger very bad heartburn. Even though I don&#x27;t swallow this mouthwash, it caused me to have heartburn every day, worse yet in the middle of the night. It took me a while to figure out what was causing my heartburn, but as soon as I stopped rinsing my mouth with this, the heartburn dissapeared!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few uears ago I had tried using a dental tray with whitening gel at night. It, too, caused me to experience heartburn. I figured out the common active ingredient was hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this happens, or if any one else experiences this. I just can&#x27;t use this product because of the heartburn side effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW it did help to reduce coffee stains on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great follow-up after you brush with Crest whiting toothpaste...</li>
            <li> Works well, with less burn.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for a family member and they have noticed a difference to the brightness of their teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other alcohol free rinse mouthwashes by Crest, but recently I became a coffee drinker so I wanted to try their Crest 3D White Multi-Care Rinse and the first time I used it the taste was very strong and once I spit it out, I noticed my gums started to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought maybe it was due to it being my first use, but the symptoms continued with each use. I noticed a very small whitening effect, but my teeth were not that stained to begin with so I don&#x27;t feel the need to buy this in the future. The pain isn&#x27;t worth it. I&#x27;m guessing the \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; agent they use in this, is too harsh for some people, as I noticed from other reviewers their gums were being affected as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 days and saw some improvement, however, I am rapidly losing the ability to taste certain foods, so far consisting of peanut butter and anything sweet. At first i thought it was normal and would go away in a while, but reading the reviews here, the product has some major issues. My teeth have been also slightly sore. I do NOT recommend this mouthwash. Currently dumping it down the drain and throwing it away.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would work great being from crest. I have always liked crest line of products. Not this one! This product is horrible. Needs a MAJOR do over. It burns so bad can&#x27;t go by the directions of how long you need to rinse with it. Can only take a few secs of this horrible mouthwash. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Its mouthwash, it tastes kind of funny but it gets the job done I guess. Makes my mouth feel weird also</li>
            <li> Upon my 6 month dental check up, my hygienist asked me if I was whitening my teeth.  At the time all I was doing was brushing with Crest 3D whitening toothpaste and using this mouth wash once per day. In fact, I just started using this about one week prior to my dental appointment.&lt;br /&gt;I do have the dental whitening trays from my dentist 4-5 years ago but have not used them in about a year.  Prior to these trays, my teeth were an ugly shade of brown.  Once bleached, they have not reverted back to the original shade regardless of nonuse.  Proper dental care is key.  They may not be as glowing white as they once were but they are much whiter than what I started with.  That said, using this product does help whiten teeth but if you have extremely stained teeth, I think the results would be marginal and you would need to get the Dental bleaching trays.  So my teeth are generally white to begin with but the use of Crest 3D mouth wash helps whiten them to a noticeable level. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like it. Very mild tasting but got used to it and it does work. Keeps my teeth white.  Yes</li>
            <li> I could see results the very same day after using this! Great product and truly does what it says!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. I used to use CVS brand to save the money but found this on Amazon and it was actually right about the same price when bought in bulk. I drink a lot of coffee and wine and use to get really bad stains despite brushing several times a day AND using white strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this stuff -- no stains! At all! It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;ve always been leery about these mouthwashes because I read chances are they do little-to-nothing in the way of removing stains/whitening teeth. I can&#x27;t say how much this is helping, but I do know that my teeth are whiter than they have been before and I&#x27;m loving it! I keep swishing this stuff in my mouth for about 1-2 minutes to really let it work so maybe that&#x27;s key as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless -- definitely recommend this stuff.</li>
            <li> Delivered in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> whitens teeth, but gums receed. They have not recovered even after a month or two without use (I&#x27;m a healthy 24 year old). seems like others are having this issue too. Anyone have solutions to help your gums grow back? It&#x27;s absurd and ridiculous that this product is on the shelf!</li>
            <li> I suffered adverse side effects after 1 use of this product, Crest 3D White Mouthwash. As a 24 year old who regularly brushes/flosses, I have healthy teeth/gums but my dentist recommended using a mouthwash at night (she didn&#x27;t give a specific brand/product). I purchased a bottle of this mouthwash hoping it would do the trick... Unfortunately, it was a bad choice. I used it tonight, following the directions on the back. After 30 minutes of using it, I felt lumps of epithelial tissue from my inner cheeks sloughing off. It was disgusting, I didn&#x27;t want to swallow it so I literally spit out large, white chunks of my inner mouth because this product killed and bleached the cells! I used my finger to feel for more sloughed off skin and there was much more! Now my mouth is very dry and feels slightly burned. This definitely caused irritation of my gums. I am throwing this bottle away and never purchasing it again! I wanted to share my experience to dissuade other potential buyers from buying this terrible stuff!</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> The mouthwash has a super fresh taste that I loved. Using the product, it created a foam as I swished -- kind of like scrubbing bubbles for my mouth. After using it, I love how clean my mouth felt and how fresh my breath was. It&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I recently tried this mouthwash and its&#x27; one that I will definitely stick with. It makes my mouth feel very clean and my teeth really appear to be whiter. It also does not taste like medicine as many other mouthwashes tend to do.</li>
            <li> This is a nice minty clean mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I used this product last night for the first time and afterwards my mouth hurt SO bad! Woke up with 4 places on my gums that are raw and red. Upon investigating other people are having similar experiences.... Not worth it and probably should not be on the market!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Glamorous&amp;#34; white... ehhh.  Hollywood&#x27;s not calling me to be an actor or model yet.  I&#x27;ve been using the stuff once a day for about 6 months now.  It&#x27;s good enough for mouthwash, but i have not seen any great improvement with whitening.  Maybe I should read the bottle more closely.  Maybe you&#x27;re supposed to do it 3 times a day.  But if you&#x27;re like me and wash once a day, dont expect for the phone to ring and have folks clamoring for you to be on the cover of their magazine cause you got pearly whites!</li>
            <li> It has a strange, a bit sour, aftertaste. I&#x27;m not sure what it is but I think its one of the whitening agents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend because its just not very refreshing with that aftertaste.</li>
            <li> its refreshing but not really whitening</li>
            <li> I never thought about buying this online, but sold as a 3-pack the savings is well worth it. We usually have 2 bottles in use at a time anyway. I&#x27;ve been using this rinse for a few years and while the whitening effect is slight, I like the flavor and foaming action.</li>
            <li> The product works as promised. Crest 3D glamorous white will give you a brighter smile whitin seven days safely. No burn of alcohol.</li>
            <li> The second best mouthwash I have ever used. Very effective with no burning sensation or heavy alcohol after taste.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of tea and coffee and my teeth were showing it.  I hate bleach trays and strips so discovered this product at Target.  A 12 oz bottle was $8.99. I checked on Subscribe and Save and found I could get 3 32oz bottles for $17.37.  That is an amazing deal! I get the extra 20% off for having 5 items in my basket.  Works great, I could see a difference after a week using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this product by a girl who had amazingly white teeth. She said this is all she used. Didn&#x27;t work for me :(  I used this product for 1 months and noticed no improvement, even though I was so optimistic.  My teeth are in pretty good shape to begin with as I have good cleaning habits, but it didn&#x27;t get me to the next level. The product is also very expensive and poor tasting formula.</li>
            <li> Refreshing mouthwash and purchasing in bulk was really a savings over buying at the local stores.</li>
            <li> I have brown stains on the sides of my front teeth. I am just hoping they will come off, I am going to dentist very soon. Hopefully nothing serious. This mouthwash taste horrible! Buyer Beware!!!</li>
            <li> Received in a timely manner, and in good condition.  I like this product very much.  Leaves your mouth and breath feeling clean and refreshed.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If there is an option for &amp;#34;zero star&amp;#34;, I&#x27;d like to choose that option. After using this product, in side of my mouth started to have blood blisters. I thought it was cancer at first, but i noticed that i got a few of blood blisters after every time i used this mouth wash. Avoid this product!!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t tell you this, but Invisalign gives you dragon breath.  So I soak my trays in this mouthwash while I&#x27;m showering, etc. and when I pop them back in, they&#x27;ve been cured of the funk and help my teeth stay whiter.  I truly notice the whitening impact.</li>
            <li> I use this product for cleaning bathrooms.  The plumber who came to my house once told me that whitening mouthwash was an excellent alternative to using bleach which is harsh and sometimes ruins the caulking around the tub or sink.</li>
            <li> Love this product works well</li>
            <li> I use mouthwash every day.  I don&#x27;t normally have problems with sensitivity, but one day of using this product was more than I could take.  Immediately after trying the 3d white mouthwash I noticed an uncomfortable burning sensation.  During the same day my teeth became very sensitive to heat and cold.  All of these symptoms subsided over the course of the day, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to risk it again.  It took the rinse back to the store and I will not be trying a whitening rinse again.  Obviously I cannot comment on the formula&#x27;s whitening effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging from the other reviews it doesn&#x27;t seem that everyone experiences problems with this rinse, but be warned--it does appear that a reasonable portion of the users that have reviewed have had problems as well.</li>
            <li> The great thing about this mouthwash is that it is a non alcohol formula and as far as I can tell it does work (using in conjunction with whitening toothpaste), though the whitening I&#x27;m seeing is mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big con for me is that this has the most disgusting flavor I have ever experienced!  I don&#x27;t know how to describe it other than it taste like being sick.  I actually gagged and almost threw up the first time I used it. It actually reminded me of years ago when I had a really bad case of strep throat and my mouth got this film in it.  I&#x27;ve never experienced this with the whitening strips or toothpastes that I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;m not sure what it is that causes this flavor but the whitening that I&#x27;ve seen through my (admittedly, sporadic) use isn&#x27;t worth the icky taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula also froths up while being swished around in your mouth and makes the bad flavor especially bad (should be a great thing-to make sure your whole mouth is coated). Even after you spit it out you have to rinse multiple times to get the flavor out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for the flavor this might be a fabulous product. I&#x27;m pretty bummed.</li>
            <li> Would like a pump added to the Crest 3D mouth wash.......it would make it easier to use.....  thanks, looking forward to having a pump . You could sell it seperately, and thus switch from bottle to bottle..... Im sure other customers would like it too.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks.....</li>
            <li> I am not sure why so many reviewers have had various negative issues using this product; I suspect their teeth and gum issues stem from a much deeper and prolonged problem, i.e. poor oral care, particular sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, and/or simple genetics. However, I have been using this product for a few months now and have to say I love the alcohol-free minty flavor, the foaming action, and the slick, smooth, clean feeling on my teeth after each use. Not to mention the ultra bright, white teeth I can proudly flash throughout my day even though I smoke. My roommate says he needs sunglasses in order to look at my teeth. Love this product and I highly recommend it. And BTW, shame on me but I haven&#x27;t been to the dentist in 5 years and my teeth are beautiful, healthy, strong and white and brite.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the Crest Whitening Toothpaste for years.  Using these keep my teeth a bright white.</li>
            <li> I really did not like this product. It tastes horrible and I did not see any difference while using this. I even used it along side with the toothpaste. I prefer Listerine and if you want to whiten just use the strips which work pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is nice mouthwash and does the trick, but my girlfriend tells me that the smell is not pleasant. It does not have a refreshing, minty smell, but instead has an artificial smell.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  A recent photo of me confirmed that two months of use, along with the Crest 3D White toothpaste, definitely whitened my smile.</li>
            <li> keeps your mouth clean and fresh quickly</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not using this product yet, don&#x27;t. Am an avid tea drinker, and a few months into using this, I realized that the edges of my teeth were getting thoroughly discolored. I did not at all think the mouthwash had anything to do with it until I went in for my regular cleaning and my hygienist asked if I was using this product. I switched to Listerine right after and my teeth have never been whiter! I still drink tea too!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while and it really works.  i was glad to see that i could get it cheaper with the subscription</li>
            <li> Was going to return this product after hearing all the horror stories but ended up just trying it with caution. I actually really like it. It is effective at whitening and not causing teeth to be more prone to stains afterward. I&#x27;m just aware of how often I use it. Only once a day and really only when I feel my teeth are a little lackluster. Don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re reformulated it, but it didn&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive or my gums bleed at all. No numbness either. It&#x27;s really great because the toothpaste that goes with this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried that actually works. With these two steps (use caution if you feel anything funky going on, take a break for a few days) it&#x27;s a pretty great whitening regiment.</li>
            <li> A great mouthwash that tastes great and helps with extending the life of my toothpaste</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! Taste is horrible and once you have rinsed and spit it continues to foam up in your mouth; you continue to spit foam two - three times to get the horrible taste gone!  Did I mention this is a HORRIBLE product!?!?</li>
            <li> Great Product ..AAAAA ++++++</li>
            <li> My husband and Mother both love this product.  Used along with the 3D toothpaste, it makes a very significant difference in teeth whitening.</li>
            <li> This caused severe burns on my tongue and the roof of my mouth.  It hurts to eat and feels like there is a layer of fur on my tongue since the burns are making the skin fall off.  I have been using it for about two weeks.  Do NOT USE.</li>
            <li> Perfect, great item, just as described. Shipping was in most timely fashion. Thank you so much, will look forward to more business with you.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been using it along with the crest 3D white toothpaste &amp; have noticed a tremendous change in the whitening of my teeth. I drink coffee often &amp; do not necessarily avoid foods that discolor teeth. Even with that, my teeth remain white by using this product. I am so glad that it is a good quality product that is affordable!</li>
            <li> This product does not burn when used and, thus far, has not turned my teeth brown like other similar alcohol-free products.  It has helped to whiten teeth but tastes bland.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past.  I stopped using it for 6 months, and went for a dental cleaning, and my doctor was disappointed how stained my teeth were.  So I went back to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went to see my Dentist who does my fillings, and was told to use Listerine that is ADA accepted.  Some of the Listerine mouthwashes are not ADA accepted. Told me that I need to concentrate on the gingivitis on my teeth.  So, I am using Listerine for the gingivitis and this mouthwash for whitening.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed my teeth getting any whiter but still an alright mouthwash.</li>
            <li> It works, but after a month it casued left side mouth pain and tingle sensations!!!</li>
            <li> This product has a mild taste. It does not taste bad. After using it, my lips began to swell. Then itchy bumps showed up around my lips. Not good.</li>
            <li> amazing and laaaaaaaaarg enough</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!  Was excited to find these in bulk.  I love how fresh my mouth feels after using it.  I also love that it is alcohol free.  It won&#x27;t dry your mouth out.  Plus, it does whiten!</li>
            <li> noticeable different in my teeth when I use it everyday! CREST 3D products are great! My dentist even noticed my teeth were whiter!</li>
            <li> This is a great white wash. Probably one of the best. If you want amazing white teeth, I recommend using this with the crest white strips and the whitening tooth paste. You will see amazing results.</li>
            <li> I use this every other day, alternating with ACT so not to de-mineralize my teeth. I used a strip once a week as well. I did this for a month or 2 before my wedding. My brother thought I had my teeth professionally whitened until I told him my secret.</li>
            <li> My healthy gums are bleeding from this terrible product.  My mouth is burning, especially under my tongue.  Why did I put a teeth-whitening mouthwash on my gums, tongue, etc?  Crest should be boycotted for this horrible, disturbing product.</li>
            <li> This stuff taste so nasty. I used it as directed and I still don&#x27;t see any whitening. I ordered a 3 pack... not sure If I should just use it or throw it out or give it away... I even use it with the whitening toothpaste. I do not smoke or drink coffee either.</li>
            <li> I am surprised at the negative reviews on this product ass i have been using it for a while now and work very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it all depends on how sensitive your gums are as everyone is different.</li>
            <li> mare clean when you rinse your mouth you can feel your tooth smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of mouthwashes over the years primarily to keep fresh breath after brushing and to maintain healthy teeth and gums. I&#x27;ve never been concerned about whitening until very recently. I am now medically uninsured for the 1st time in my life (due to a job change) and I&#x27;ve stepped up my brushing, flossing, and rinsing habits to prevent any dental problems. I&#x27;m a healthy 33 year old who has never had a cavity and I stay away from smoking, sodas, and coffee, but do drink dark tea almost everyday. I went through a LOT of orthodontic work as a teenager (braces/headgear/neckgear, etc.) and promised myself I would never stop taking care of my teeth after all the pain I went through in my teens. I started using Crest 3D mouthwash based on a recommendation from a friend. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month, and my teeth really do look whiter! I&#x27;m amazed at the results. Dispite drinking black tea everyday, I can definitely tell they are lighter. My friends and family have also noticed. And you can&#x27;t beat the price of buying bulk on Amazon! I compared prices to Target, Walmart, and our local grocer, HEB. Amazon&#x27;s prices are the best.</li>
            <li> i looooooooooooove it it is realy a very good pt and one of the best product which i have parchased</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping it would not only give my teeth a little extra whiteness, but also clean my mouth. I got the whiter teeth, but I also got an overly-sensitive mouth that became EXTREMELY painful to use a toothbrush &amp; dental floss on. My mouth became so sensitive that it bled every time I flossed or brushed. I had to stop using it because it became too painful to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to other customers.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product. Not sure it made my teeth any whiter but it does keep my breath fresh!</li>
            <li> Been using crest 3d white toothpaste for about a year now. They came out with the glamorous white--purchased the mouthwash since I already had plenty of toothpaste. My teeth are noticeably whiter, I&#x27;m very happy. With just the mouthwash! Wondering if I should add the glamorous white toothpaste as well!</li>
            <li> I never thought the effect of using this mouth wash would be this big. I get compliment for my white teeth almost every week. the results were amazing and I could not be happier with this product. does not burn at all and tastes much better than other mouthwashes I have tried before. i rinse my mouth every night before going to bed. no smell in the morning and the teeth are as bright as the light. I drink 3-4 cups of coffee every day and I can not imaging not using Crest 3D White. best mouth wash you can get.</li>
            <li> It leaves a weird filmy feeling on my gums/cheeks/teeth that I then need to gargle out with more water (a LOT more water) after rinsing with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I believe this has caused my teeth to be very sensitive AND it doesn&#x27;t seem to have made my teeth any whiter than it was a few weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using it for about a month now, and my teeth do not feel sensitive anymore, so I believe this product was the culprit, which is just very tragic for my teeth.</li>
            <li> These bottles were more than enough, completely satisfied with shipping,product, and use of the product. After awhile the peroxide taste goes away with continually use so disregard negative reviews regarding the small hint of after taste peroxide.</li>
            <li> I use this mouthwash along with Crest 3D White Glamorous White toothpaste, and  my teeth have never been so whiter! Some people say this burned or peeled their mouths, but plain old Hydrogen Peroxide can do that as well. HP is also used for cuts and sores, so if anyone using this has any sores in their mouths, the HP will eat away at it just as if you&#x27;d use it for an injury. Hydrogen peroxide can be used for a diverse amount of things, and this mouthwash especially whitens my teeth. It has a foamy texture and the taste is kind of bitter and sweet. Rinse for 60 seconds, spit out, and you&#x27;re done. I ALWAYS use it after the 3D White toothpaste. Great product!</li>
            <li> good stuff that does not stain teeth as its competitors. I will reorder often</li>
            <li> It works, good value.</li>
            <li> I used the Crest 3-D strips for a month, have been using the 3-D tooth paste and this Whitener for 8 months and can tell very little difference. When my supplies are gone, so is my use of these products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this item from Amazon (though I shop here regularly). I was highly disappointed in the results. After about 3 days of use I noticed my entire tongue had become discolored and irritated. My tongue turned white- it appeared at closer glance that my taste buds were dying. My tongue was spongy like and I could leave prints in the white patch by simply pressing on it- talk about gross. So I have discontinued using this product and even though it&#x27;s been about 3 days since I used it, the white patches are slowly going away. I&#x27;ve been brushing my tongue aggressively and some of the white patch comes off a little at a time, leaving an almost smooth newer tongue. Its basically almost as if the peroxide killed my taste buds and new ones are now growing back. The worst part (as if what I just typed wasn&#x27;t bad enough)food/drink all taste dramatically different and hot and cold food/drink seem to be more intense than usual. And yes it is painful at times- especially when eating something spicy or drinking something cold/hot. Even my regular dental routine has become a complex task because this crap HURTS! If only I knew that the active ingredient was peroxide (#note to self \\&quot;duh of course teeth whitening&#x3D;peroxide\\&quot;) I would not have been so eager to purchase this. Though, when I was younger my grandmother made us brush with baking soda and peroxide and although it tasted gross it never ever did this to my tongue. So maybe there are other ingerdients that collectively caused my tongue to turn into an albino spongebob- who knows. All I can say now is that NO I will not recommend this product. And I wish I had the receipt to take this tongue killer back but I lost it. I hope that I regain my taste- because I love love love food! SAD!&lt;br /&gt;Ps. I would have included a pic if it was applicable</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this mouthwash as it is very refreshing and the clean feeling lasts for many hours.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a week now and I have to say that it works GREAT!!! I am a teeth freak as most people who know that I usually pre-wash than brush twice than post wash. I have been out of my pre wash and had been searching for something new because the wash that I used just didnt seem like it was worth the money or that it was doing what I wanted it too. So i decided to go back to the old reliable pre wash and I am happy that I switched back. After just a week my teeth feel cleaner than they have ever felt, I can tell the difference not just in the whiteness but also with my breath throughout the day. Just give the bottle a shot, what do you have to lose. Also since I am a teeth freak I know that some people have had mouth blisters because their mouth may be over sensitive to this product or products like this one, there are more acidic mouth washes than this one, this was not even a mild acidity compared to most post washes. Good pre wash. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I love the taste of this mouthwash! I have noticed a bit of whitening in just 3 days. Will follow up after I finish a bottle.</li>
            <li> a nice mouth wash that leaves your mouth feeling refreshed for a long while. I would buy this mouthwash brand again.</li>
            <li> works great , just as described, came fast , doesn&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> After a not-so-good dental checkup regarding stains I started using this daily.  The results at the next checkup were excellent, even to the surprise of the dentist.</li>
            <li> I was supposed to get 3 bottles of 32oz mouthwash but I only got one 32oz bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Really Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nobody tells you that the alcohol in most mouthwashes dissolves the glue in inlays and onlays over time.  Plus, alcohol is not the antibacterial component of products like Listerine -- it&#x27;s the other ingredients that are dissolved in it.  The Crest version is alcohol-free and very effective, both at cleaning and whitening.  At some point I discovered that swishing longer (2+ minutes) increases its whitening effects.  Combined with Arm&amp;Hammer&#x27;s Advance White toothpaste and their Whitening Booster product the results are amazing.  My dentist was beside herself at the difference between one visit and the next.&lt;br /&gt;So now you know.  Does that take care of any karmic debt between us?</li>
            <li> The first one I opened, the lid was smashed, and it went all over the place. I managed to salvage some of it. I&#x27;ve just opened the second one, and it&#x27;s lid is broken as well, and leaking all over the place.</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash. I am a major coffee-drinker and notice my front teeth starting to discolor about 3 months after each dental cleaning. This really helps keep them white and remove stains that may occur between dentist visits. I try and use it as a preventative measure - I start using it about 2 months after a dental cleaning and use it about 4-5x per week until my next dental appointment. It has also worked to remove stains, but I find it is better to just prevent them to begin with :) The taste is good and it foams well. I have tried the generics and they do not seem to work as well. This has my vote!</li>
            <li> Leaves a weird taste in your mouth after you spit it out...</li>
            <li> prompt service and excellent product</li>
            <li> This stuff is very effective for whitening. It works better than the white strips. However, it caused me to break out in sores all over the inside of my mouth and under my tongue. The irritation in my mouth was gradual at first, so I wasn&#x27;t sure if the mouthwash was causing issues. I stopped using it as soon I realized where the sores were coming from.</li>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It Worked great on me no blisters but I noticed results quick I would recommend this but everybody&#x27;s mouth is different and teeth</li>
            <li> The first couple weeks I used this thing it burned. It made me doubt my dental hygiene. It may be placebo but I use the thing everyday now and my mouth feels more fresh as does my teeth. As always this may be mental. As to the whitening effect, I think it&#x27;s working. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and while it&#x27;s nothing drastic, it looks a little better.</li>
