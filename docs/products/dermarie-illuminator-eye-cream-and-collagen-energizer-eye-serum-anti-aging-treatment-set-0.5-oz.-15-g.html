            <li>Best part about it though, is that my husband noticed and asked what i was doing.</li>
            <li>Ive been using the dermarie eye cream for a while with excellent results and no complaints.</li>
            <li>For close to six months I’ve been using the eye cream and serum that come in this set with wonderful results.</li>
            <li>I’ve been using the dermarie skin care set for over 3 months and have to say I’m very impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>The eye cream has an excellent texture and can notice a brightened look around my eyes within 10-15 minutes of applying.</li>

            <li>Together, these two products have done wonders for my fine lines, crows feet and under eye bags.</li>
            <li>My mother said she recognized a huge change with this since using this product.</li>

            <li>After many years of working in the sun, I thought the damage to my skin was permanent, but Dermarie&#x27;s restorative properties have taken years off my appearance - much appreciated!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s so special about these creams, but I bought them for my wife because a friend of hers recommended them as a gift, and now she has bought them for her friends.</li>
            <li>The eye serum makes my eyes feel like they get a true \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.</li>

            <li>Outstanding products that really work.</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs quickly in my skin.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a lot more confident and happier with how her eyes look now, so I can only recommend this product.</li>
            <li>She says they absorb quickly and are non-greasy.</li>
            <li>This is my very first experience with the Dermarie system.</li>
            <li>My skin can be sensitive so it reacts pretty quickly to a products it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation or break outs with this product so far.</li>
            <li>Both products do an excellent job at absorbing quickly and keeping your skin feeling hydrated and soft all day long.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s def worth a try.</li>
            <li>Love how this product makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>So far she is pleased with them.  </li>
            <li>With this serum I had no irritation, it absorbed right away and does not feel oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>The texture is just right.</li>
            <li>Saw good results in a few days, and I can see the benefit.</li>
            <li>From just this short time, my skin feels soft and looks great, especially in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product twice a day for about two months and notice a big improvement in my fine lines and crows feet.</li>
            <li>The daytime face cream is lightweight and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>I really like this set</li>
            <li>the quality was much greater than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I really will buy it again.</li>
            <li>and she says the under eye area feels much smoother than it did before.</li>
            <li>When I was in automotive sales, I spent quiet a fair amount of time on the lot in the Florida sun.</li>
            <li>Overall good product with average price.&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li>Less than a week of using them so time will tell if she is pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if everyone will be as lucky to have the same results as me but for the price</li>
            <li>Some eye creams are harsh but I&#x27;m pleased to say these ones are gentle and don&#x27;t irritate the area at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to friends and family.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Love how it makes my skin feel soft without the oily residue some other products leave when your out in the humidity.</li>
            <li>It helps the puffiness and wrinkles, and makes the skin around your eyes feel rejuvenated, younger and fresh.</li>
            <li>I got this set for my mother who has all sorts of eye creams and serums and always likes to try new products.</li>
            <li>She didn&#x27;t have noticeable fine lines but would get dark circles and puffiness quite often</li>
            <li>The Dermarie night serum moisturizes well, and appears to reduce fine lines, but a little hard to tell for sure.</li>
            <li>Her eyes are really sensitive and neither of these products sting her eyes at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this system religiously for the past month, and I have to say that I really enjoy it!</li>
            <li>&quot; next to the reviewer, its pretty obvious.</li>
            <li>Starsce is in the mid to high price range.</li>
            <li>She stuck with the Dermarie products and used them every day and was very surprised with the results - there&#x27;s a definite reduction in puffiness</li>
            <li>It seems like all the reviews were created around the same time and all the purchasers have only 1 other review around the same time for another cheap item.</li>
            <li>The directions were simple and the cream did not irritate my skin in any fashion (as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is dry and can be very sensitive to the products I use.</li>
            <li>Before bed, I apply just a tiny bit of the eye serum, and in only a few days, I have noticed my skin is smoother and more firm.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this product if you have dark circles.</li>

            <li> I Highly recommend this product if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually a bit sceptical of these products, but can certainly see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never realized how dry the skin under my eyes is until I started using this cream.</li>
            <li> I’ve used countless eye creams and serums over the past decade with mixed results.</li>
            <li> As for the wrinkles around my eyes...there was just a little change, but in a relatively short time.</li>
            <li> That much exposure to the sun did a lot for my farmers tan, which was bad enough, but I eventually noticed that prolonged periods of squinting had left me with crows feet and other wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> The product is comparable to other other collagen serums on the market.</li>
            <li> The dark circles are diminished.</li>
            <li> With the continued use of the serum I’ve noticed the skin around my eyes is tighter and less saggy.</li>
            <li> I have 2 little girls and for some time had dark rings under my eyes from lack of sleep.</li>
            <li> I feel like that wastes less product, without making you shake the bottle or fetch a Q-tip.</li>
            <li> I started using the Dermarie products a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> So thankful I came across this set because I was buying the two products separately and realized you can save a few bucks with this set.</li>
            <li> The product is not oily or heavy, it leaves the skin hydrated and brightens your skin tone.</li>
            <li> The dark circles have diminished and my eyes are less puffy and tired looking in the morning.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning and still feel a little bit tired, I put some of this on my eyes</li>
            <li> After a few days of using the serum and cream together I felt and saw a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look as tired as I did before!</li>
            <li> Like someone else said - these are totally fake aside from one</li>

            <li> When I was in automotive sales, I spent quiet a fair amount of time on the lot in the Florida sun. That much exposure to the sun did a lot for my farmers tan, which was bad enough, but I eventually noticed that prolonged periods of squinting had left me with crows feet and other wrinkles around the eyes. So after a friend recommended Dermarie, I purchsed both the day and night cream. The directions were simple and the cream did not irritate my skin in any fashion (as I have sensitive skin. I use them every morning and night. Saw good results in a few days, and I can see the benefit. I don&#x27;t look as tired as I did before!</li>
            <li> After many years of working in the sun, I thought the damage to my skin was permanent, but Dermarie&#x27;s restorative properties have taken years off my appearance - much appreciated!</li>
            <li> After a few days of using the serum and cream together I felt and saw a dramatic difference. Fine lines and wrinkles are softer around my eyes. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so I don&#x27;t know if everyone will be as lucky to have the same results as me but for the price it&#x27;s def worth a try. I love it! It&#x27;s part of my daily and nightly regimen now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these products for a month now. I&#x27;m over 40 and have tried everything on the planet. The Dermarie day cream really works, and feels and smells nice. The Dermarie night serum moisturizes well, and appears to reduce fine lines, but a little hard to tell for sure. Both feel good, but I&#x27;m used to richer serums. Both come in a 1/2 oz. pump, and I&#x27;d prefer a tub for the cream, and a dropper for the serum. I feel like that wastes less product, without making you shake the bottle or fetch a Q-tip. Although I&#x27;m happy with the products performance,  I&#x27;d like the price to be $20 less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Quality &#x3D; 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Packaging &#x3D; 2 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Price &#x3D; 3 Stars&lt;br /&gt;Overall Rating &#x3D; 3 Starsce is in the mid to high price range.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system religiously for the past month, and I have to say that I really enjoy it! The eye serum makes my eyes feel like they get a true \\&quot;lift\\&quot;. When I wake up in the morning and still feel a little bit tired, I put some of this on my eyes feel like I look more awake. The nighttime cream makes my face feel relaxed and healthy. The texture is just right. I&#x27;ve never realized how dry the skin under my eyes is until I started using this cream. This cream and serum refreshes my skin. I plan to purchase this product again when I run out, and I would recommend it to anyone else who wants a refreshing and brightening feel for their eyes and face.</li>
            <li> The Dermarie System is amazing, and the best product out there that I have tried. It helps the puffiness and wrinkles, and makes the skin around your eyes feel rejuvenated, younger and fresh. The dark circles are diminished. Strongly recommend this system.</li>
            <li> This is my very first experience with the Dermarie system. I decided to try it after reading positive reviews, and I am happy with my purchase. The daytime face cream is lightweight and absorbs fast. I use it at night after cleansing and it makes my skin feel great. Before bed, I apply just a tiny bit of the eye serum, and in only a few days, I have noticed my skin is smoother and more firm. My skin can be sensitive so it reacts pretty quickly to a products it doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;like&amp;#34; but I&#x27;ve experienced no irritation or break outs with this product so far. I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I started using the Dermarie products a few weeks ago. From just this short time, my skin feels soft and looks great, especially in the morning. As for the wrinkles around my eyes...there was just a little change, but in a relatively short time. In my profession, anything a 40-something can do to help her appearance is definitely a necessity. Best part about it though, is that my husband noticed and asked what i was doing. I teased him and told him he couldn&#x27;t have any! Haha.</li>
            <li> Ive been using the dermarie eye cream for a while with excellent results and no complaints. Just recently tried the serum and have to say it exceeded expectations. Even got my husband to start using these products. Highly recommend to friends and family. Good quality products.</li>
            <li> For close to six months I’ve been using the eye cream and serum that come in this set with wonderful results. My skin hasn’t looked this healthy and bright in years. The dark circles have diminished and my eyes are less puffy and tired looking in the morning. With the continued use of the serum I’ve noticed the skin around my eyes is tighter and less saggy. Both products do an excellent job at absorbing quickly and keeping your skin feeling hydrated and soft all day long. So thankful I came across this set because I was buying the two products separately and realized you can save a few bucks with this set. Outstanding products that really work. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take a rocket scientist to figure this out, but in my opinion it would appear that most, if not all, of the reviews are fake.  It seems like all the reviews were created around the same time and all the purchasers have only 1 other review around the same time for another cheap item.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the dermarie skin care set for over 3 months and have to say I’m very impressed with the results. I’ve used countless eye creams and serums over the past decade with mixed results. The eye cream has an excellent texture and can notice a brightened look around my eyes within 10-15 minutes of applying. The serum absorbs quickly in my skin. No oily residue. Love how it makes my skin feel soft without the oily residue some other products leave when your out in the humidity. I really like this set and I am thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this all around my eyes consistently for the past weeks or a month. No terrible effects whatsoever. I have 2 little girls and for some time had dark rings under my eyes from lack of sleep. My mother said she recognized a huge change with this since using this product. It has not made me break out, which happens easily for me, so that is also amazing. The product is not oily or heavy, it leaves the skin hydrated and brightens your skin tone. I Highly recommend this product if you have dark circles.</li>
            <li> These two products make an amazing duo. Lightweight cream works great at reducing my crows feet, fine lines and under eye bags. Gives me a revived look in my eyes. Serum is one of the best I have tried. I’ve noticed improvement in my skin elasticity around my eyes. Acts as an excellent moisturizer that leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. Together, these two products have done wonders for my fine lines, crows feet and under eye bags. Excellent skin care set.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for about two months and notice a big improvement in my fine lines and crows feet. My skin is dry and can be very sensitive to the products I use. With this serum I had no irritation, it absorbed right away and does not feel oily or sticky. Love how this product makes my skin feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Like someone else said - these are totally fake aside from one I think - just clicking \\&quot;see all my reviews\\&quot; next to the reviewer, its pretty obvious.</li>
            <li> the quality was much greater than I expected.  It was very easy to apply and felt so good. I only had to use once a day.</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife who read the reviews on here and seemed impressed. She&#x27;s used it for only a couple of weeks and I&#x27;m usually a bit sceptical of these products, but can certainly see a difference. She didn&#x27;t have noticeable fine lines but would get dark circles and puffiness quite often and it looks like using this serum and cream has helped to combat it. She&#x27;s a lot more confident and happier with how her eyes look now, so I can only recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love it! Smells great and I see a difference. I really will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this set for my mother who has all sorts of eye creams and serums and always likes to try new products. She&#x27;s always had puffiness under her eyes which wouldn&#x27;t seem to shift, no matter what she did. She stuck with the Dermarie products and used them every day and was very surprised with the results - there&#x27;s a definite reduction in puffiness and she says the under eye area feels much smoother than it did before. Some eye creams are harsh but I&#x27;m pleased to say these ones are gentle and don&#x27;t irritate the area at all. She&#x27;s delighted with the results and I think I&#x27;ll pick up my own set now I can see that they work!</li>
            <li> Writing this for my wife. Her eyes are really sensitive and neither of these products sting her eyes at all.  She says they absorb quickly and are non-greasy. So far she is pleased with them.  Less than a week of using them so time will tell if she is pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s so special about these creams, but I bought them for my wife because a friend of hers recommended them as a gift, and now she has bought them for her friends. My wife has tried all these products and they are all sitting in the cabinet, but this one she uses religiously. And yes, even I can tell the difference! My wife says try them and see.</li>
