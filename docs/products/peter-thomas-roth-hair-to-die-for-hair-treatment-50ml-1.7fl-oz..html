    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>otherwise I have found it to be a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!</li>
            <li>Really Great Price ....</li>
            <li>Great formula.</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is, but it REEKS!</li>
            <li>This is a really good product, just like you would expect from PTR.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff-</li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought it might be.</li>
            <li>It smells sooo good.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results after three months of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it 5 starts when it smells better (or not at all!)</li>
            <li>more juicing for me!</li>
            <li>Anything I ever purchased by Peter Thomas Roth is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice and my husband feels like its working</li>
            <li>Dont think it would fair to comment on growth as I feel that would probably  take more than a week to start noticing.  </li>
            <li>The product does not leave your hair greasy and has a light pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Okay- after having used this for a couple months now, I&#x27;m modifying my revue.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to bear it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;ll know for sure if it worked or not.</li>
            <li>ok so I used this product for a month</li>
            <li>I hope you have better luck with this product than me ...</li>
            <li>Not greasy which I love.</li>
            <li>I really love the product it works .</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker but it feels lovely</li>
            <li>So I am hoping that continued use would help me to retain more  lenghth.  </li>
            <li>Now after just under 2 months of using this probably 70% more of the hair has rapidly fallen out..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than six months and can say that it works because I can see my widow&#x27;s peak again</li>
            <li>but I think you need to use a lot more than indicated to see the results.</li>
            <li>I apply to my scalp at night and over time it does feel as though my hair is fuller and more substantial.</li>
            <li>Just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes.</li>
            <li>Was happy that after couple weeks my hair has become thicker and have seen new growth of hair.</li>
            <li>To use, I just fill the dropper, touch it to the top of my scalp and just kind of run it through my hair, in horizontal rows, while squeezing/dispensing product gently and gradually.</li>
            <li>strong smell.</li>
            <li>But by the fact it makes my hair stop falling out so much... LOVE it!</li>
            <li>And when i came across this product after many research and reviews, it was definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Im really happy with the product and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li>He is primarily balding in the front of his head, so that&#x27;s where we have tested this.</li>
            <li>but im pretty sure i&#x27;ll be repurchasing this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really excited when I read all the reviews.</li>
            <li>However,  I have noticed significantly reduced breakage and shedding.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money and soooo easy to apply .</li>
            <li>Instead I was every other day, which I&#x27;m sure is good for my hair too.  </li>
            <li>After years of using Rogaine, special shampoos and hair growth stimulating hair brushes.... we&#x27;d given up.</li>
            <li>but it is so far still unclear how effective it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, 100% pleased with this product, though i do hope the bottle could be larger for more product usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle, and did not notice a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I lightly tap on my scalp so for those who think it makes your hair greasy must be putting on too much in an area.</li>
            <li>so thats worth the price to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 4 months, wonderful fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This was my first impression: &amp;#</li>
            <li>But if you use the amount indicated by the instruction each time, I think a bottle wouldn&#x27;t last more than a month.</li>
            <li>use it right after a shower and rub into my hair really well, then style my hair as normal.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I continue ordering it as it is as good as any others if not better</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair feel softer to the tough and look shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This product really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>My hair was really thinning and every time I washed my hair a ton would come out.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to treat your scalp with this morning and night, and who wants to rub in a liquid on their scalp if they can&#x27;t wash their hair every morning and night?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my eyebrows and temples and it really works.</li>
            <li>so I would absolutely recommend this</li>
            <li>My hair is thicker and has grown so much since i started using this.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what they are talking about.</li>
            <li>my hair is very fine and coloured and the ends seem less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I had read raving reviews and was excited to try this, especially since I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair since having a baby 4 1/2 months ago.</li>
            <li>I quit using Hair to Die For and made a full recovery within ten days.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>It takes a while for new hair to grow out, so I don&#x27;t feel a real thickness to my hair yet, but I can see from my drain that my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore.</li>
            <li>Very pricey, esp compared to similar products-which i have tried but w/o the success Ive had with this-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>this product surprised me as it really works.</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer to chose my own perfume, I don&#x27;t like having it imposed on me with a product that is supposed to do something specific not related to scenting me!</li>
            <li>I can imagine that with hair growth I might need to give it more time, but I&#x27;m not sure about spending this much money on another bottle if it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me yet.</li>
            <li>My hair loss has been minimized and new hair growth is fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>or so you&#x27;ll see new hair coming out.</li>
            <li>not sure if more is coming out.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it leaves it a little oily sometimes,</li>
            <li>My fall out went from being very worrisome to essentially negligible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 1 week of use, it was almost instant that my hair felt so much thicker.</li>
            <li>and no results so far.</li>
            <li>used this for quite some time and did not work as i thought it would, actually i saw no difference really.</li>
            <li>Biotin  has been reported as causing severe headaches in people who are sensitive to it.</li>
            <li>Appears to be working so far.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product and yes it is expensive</li>
            <li>I think generally I like this product</li>
            <li>I been losing hair for about 2 years and I am only 25 years old</li>
            <li>Three days later, I developed vertigo (dizziness)</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m beginning see to a difference in hair growth, will try using the product for about a complete year hope to see a big difference.</li>
            <li>Im trying to be very careful when using this product around my eyes and it will sting so much.</li>
            <li>Sad that it isn&#x27;t the most natural / organic thing -</li>
            <li>The smell is a little overpowering at first but nothing offensive or nauseating.</li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle of this product and have seen results of hair growth in areas that were previously bare at my temples.  </li>
            <li>I over tweezed my eye brows when I was young but using this for a long time now and within 30</li>
            <li>I am a Hashimoto&#x27;s gal - and a little of this really helps.  </li>
            <li>Good but a little expensive</li>

            <li> I am on my second bottle of this product and have seen results of hair growth in areas that were previously bare at my temples.  </li>

            <li> I am a Hashimoto&#x27;s gal - and a little of this really helps.  </li>
            <li> Good but a little expensive</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for long but combined with the oribe hair oil, gold lust and a hair masque i have noticed my hair is much smoother and seems less tortured.</li>
            <li> I was flat on my back for two days recovering.</li>
            <li> It is HIGHLY perfumed and the scent is very specific, unnatural and, well...just plain gross and tacky.</li>
            <li> The directions say that you should only use one dropper per use, but I end up using several because I want to see hair growth all over and not just in one single area.</li>
            <li> and it does not last long</li>
            <li> As a result, the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I could literally see my new hair growing out from my scalp and falls down to my currently dry and damaged ends.</li>
            <li> One bottle does not last me very long at all.</li>
            <li> I put the product in then blow dry those specific areas and use electric curlers as usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if actually growing new hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown like a weed, even faster than normal, and I&#x27;m starting to see baby hairs in the very small area where I had recession.</li>
            <li> I have thick/curly chemically relaxed hair  and have been concerned about damage and not getting enough length due to my hair breaking off.  </li>
            <li> the type of person who&#x27;s trying to grow out my hair since feb of 2012 and still continues to cut my hair to rid of them darn dry split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can use it on dry hair and it does not make your hair sticky or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It would be quite a coincidence that it got worse this fast with my only regimen change being the use of the treatment..</li>
            <li> Have seen less hair fall out on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet of its overall potential.</li>
            <li> Only a few strands come out during a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Seems to help a bit, but not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I did notice that I am gorwing baby hair in the front but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> ;  I still hate the smell and don&#x27;t understand why any cosmetic companies destroy otherwise perfectly good formulas by overpowering them with (often toxic) perfumes.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars due to the heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Minus the downside of it being in such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Also, I can get away with not washing my previously extremely oily hair every day.</li>
            <li> I work my way down in rows, all around until it&#x27;s all dispensed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 and a half.  </li>
            <li> I do dye hair black as well so maybe by the fact</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Okay- after having used this for a couple months now, I&#x27;m modifying my revue.   This was my first impression: &amp;#34;What I hate is the intensely pungent and disgusting scent. Just got this and so I don&#x27;t know how effective it is, but it REEKS! It is HIGHLY perfumed and the scent is very specific, unnatural and, well...just plain gross and tacky. Personally I prefer to chose my own perfume, I don&#x27;t like having it imposed on me with a product that is supposed to do something specific not related to scenting me! Yuck. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to bear it.&amp;#34;  I still hate the smell and don&#x27;t understand why any cosmetic companies destroy otherwise perfectly good formulas by overpowering them with (often toxic) perfumes. BUT, THE STUFF WORKS. I have had progressively thinning hair and I&#x27;ve tried rogaine, nioxin, etc... this product is the only one that has actually done anything. My fall out went from being very worrisome to essentially negligible. It takes a while for new hair to grow out, so I don&#x27;t feel a real thickness to my hair yet, but I can see from my drain that my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore. Also, I can get away with not washing my previously extremely oily hair every day. Instead I was every other day, which I&#x27;m sure is good for my hair too.  To use, I just fill the dropper, touch it to the top of my scalp and just kind of run it through my hair, in horizontal rows, while squeezing/dispensing product gently and gradually. I work my way down in rows, all around until it&#x27;s all dispensed. I do this one to two times per day.   I&#x27;ll give it 5 starts when it smells better (or not at all!)</li>
            <li> Good but a little expensive and it does not last long</li>
            <li> I have been looking for my holy grail of hair product that does the impossible. And when i came across this product after many research and reviews, it was definitely worth the price. Minus the downside of it being in such a small bottle. This product really does what it claims to do. Trust me, ive got seriously damaged hair and im the type of person who&#x27;s trying to grow out my hair since feb of 2012 and still continues to cut my hair to rid of them darn dry split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 week of use, it was almost instant that my hair felt so much thicker. I could literally see my new hair growing out from my scalp and falls down to my currently dry and damaged ends. I have been using this once a day, before i go to bed, massage it in well and sleep. Ive been trying to savour the bottle but im pretty sure i&#x27;ll be repurchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for my eyebrows and eyelashes, and yes, it works too. My eyebrows have become fuller, therefore no use for my eyebrow pencil anymore. As for my lashes, its still growing, but ever so slowly. Im trying to be very careful when using this product around my eyes and it will sting so much. I use an angled brush in applying- like applying gel liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, 100% pleased with this product, though i do hope the bottle could be larger for more product usage. Otherwise, welldone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this product around my temples/edges for three weeks now and no results so far. I&#x27;ll keep using it until all is gone then I&#x27;ll know for sure if it worked or not.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product, just like you would expect from PTR. My hair was really thinning and every time I washed my hair a ton would come out. Since I started using the Hair to Die For my hair has stopped falling out! Only a few strands come out during a shampoo. Its been about a month so I don&#x27;t know about regrowth yet. Im really happy with the product and will definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m not impressed. I had read raving reviews and was excited to try this, especially since I&#x27;ve been losing a lot of hair since having a baby 4 1/2 months ago. I&#x27;ve been using this product as directed, religiously for about a month now and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference at all. I can imagine that with hair growth I might need to give it more time, but I&#x27;m not sure about spending this much money on another bottle if it hasn&#x27;t done anything for me yet.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff- I have thick hair, but a little bit of recession probably noone but myself would notice. This product was recommended to me by someone at Beauty Brands, and I&#x27;ve been using about a month. My hair has grown like a weed, even faster than normal, and I&#x27;m starting to see baby hairs in the very small area where I had recession. The product does not leave your hair greasy and has a light pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;I use it right after a shower and rub into my hair really well, then style my hair as normal.&lt;br /&gt;If you are having issues with thinning hair, you might combine this product with Biosil- a supplement taken orally which has silica, collagen, biotin, etc. You can mix it with juice or water- it has no taste or smell.&lt;br /&gt;If this combo doesn&#x27;t work- you may have hormonal/medical issues that need to be addressed with a qualified physician.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the healthier your diet the healthier your hair- so if you are eating a ton of junk food- STOP!!!</li>
            <li> Seems to help a bit, but not what I expected.  You&#x27;re supposed to treat your scalp with this morning and night, and who wants to rub in a liquid on their scalp if they can&#x27;t wash their hair every morning and night?  I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and my husband feels like its working so thats worth the price to me.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I read all the reviews. I been losing hair for about 2 years and I am only 25 years old so you can imagine how desperate I feel.. ok so I used this product for a month and I did notice that I am gorwing baby hair in the front but not what I expected. I think I am going to order another bottle and lets see what happens.. I am also using Amway hair, skin and nails vitamins and I wash my hair with Tio Nacho shampoo. I hope you have better luck with this product than me ...</li>
            <li> used this for quite some time and did not work as i thought it would, actually i saw no difference really.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a product for Asian hair for sometime and was recommended this. Was happy that after couple weeks my hair has become thicker and have seen new growth of hair. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Second  bottle.  Have seen less hair fall out on a daily basis.  Not sure yet of its overall potential.</li>
            <li> I have been using peter thomas roth hair to die for,for about three month&#x27;s.I have noticed thicker looking hair.I&#x27;m not sure if actually growing new hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my eyebrows and temples and it really works. Not greasy which I love.</li>
            <li> Really Great Price .... I really love the product it works . I finally found something that holds up to it&#x27;s word.</li>
            <li> I am a Hashimoto&#x27;s gal - and a little of this really helps.  It&#x27;s not a miracle, but I will take even a little help!  Sad that it isn&#x27;t the most natural / organic thing - but it&#x27;s a give and take....more juicing for me!</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it might be.</li>
            <li> Two bottles and nothing.  Now am I Going to purchase another bottle??  No.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for long but combined with the oribe hair oil, gold lust and a hair masque i have noticed my hair is much smoother and seems less tortured. my hair is very fine and coloured and the ends seem less frizzy. I haven&#x27;t noticed my hair getting thicker but it feels lovely so I would absolutely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily at all after using it, after washing and towel drying I part my hair in several spots and dot all over my scalp and massage in for a moment.</li>
            <li> This product made me ill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excitedly, I began using Hair to Die For as soon as it arrived applying it to my scalp as directed. Within a couple of days I began to get severe headaches at night, but made no connection between the product and my medical condition. Three days later, I developed vertigo (dizziness) so severely, I couldn&#x27;t walk or stand up or even sit up! I was flat on my back for two days recovering. I quit using Hair to Die For and made a full recovery within ten days.&lt;br /&gt;Hair To Die For contains topical biotin. Biotin  has been reported as causing severe headaches in people who are sensitive to it. I already take biotin orally, so I guess I didn&#x27;t need more of it pententrating my scalp and making me ill. This product should come with a warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a known sensitivity to biotin, or if you&#x27;re already taking a biotin supplement orally, you may want to reconsider using this product. I hate to leave any product negative reviews, but if I&#x27;d known how sick I would become on this stuff, I would not have used it. Maybe this will review will help someone else to avoid going through the misery I endured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do decide to try this product, proceed with caution.</li>
            <li> this product surprised me as it really works. I continue ordering it as it is as good as any others if not better</li>
            <li> Anything I ever purchased by Peter Thomas Roth is amazing.  This is no exception.  Do not hesitate, it makes a difference in the texture of your hair.  I only gave it 4 stars due to the heavy fragrance.</li>
            <li> Great formula. My hair is thicker and has grown so much since i started using this. I am ordering my fourth bottle. It is worth the money and soooo easy to apply . Love it!!!</li>
            <li> My husband has hair again, I kid you not! I have tried a lot of the PTR products so I thought we&#x27;d give this a shot. After years of using Rogaine, special shampoos and hair growth stimulating hair brushes.... we&#x27;d given up. He is on his 4th bottle of this and everyone from friends, family and coworkers have noticed the big difference. He is primarily balding in the front of his head, so that&#x27;s where we have tested this. I highly recommend. Plus, it smells absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 and a half.  Dont think it would fair to comment on growth as I feel that would probably  take more than a week to start noticing.  However,  I have noticed significantly reduced breakage and shedding.  I have thick/curly chemically relaxed hair  and have been concerned about damage and not getting enough length due to my hair breaking off.  So I am hoping that continued use would help me to retain more  lenghth.  The smell is a little overpowering at first but nothing offensive or nauseating.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost 2 months.. I started using it when I saw my hairline begin to recede and i was losing a horse shoe shape of hair on my hairline in front. Now after just under 2 months of using this probably 70% more of the hair has rapidly fallen out.. It would be quite a coincidence that it got worse this fast with my only regimen change being the use of the treatment.. Beware.. Didn&#x27;t do anything but make mine worse.</li>
            <li> Appears to be working so far.  Using in place of Rogaine.</li>
            <li> i use every morning and night, started to get bumps on scalp.... I believe there is a bit of baby hair growth. still using</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than six months and can say that it works because I can see my widow&#x27;s peak again and I love the way it makes my hair feel softer to the tough and look shiny and healthy.  This is a good product and yes it is expensive but you get results.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this product and have seen results of hair growth in areas that were previously bare at my temples.  You can use it on dry hair and it does not make your hair sticky or greasy feeling.  I use it after shampooing and on the  mornings I don&#x27;t shampoo I put the product in then blow dry those specific areas and use electric curlers as usual.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend anyone struggling with thinning hair to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 4 months, wonderful fragrance.  I think I&#x27;m beginning see to a difference in hair growth, will try using the product for about a complete year hope to see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and it leaves it a little oily sometimes, otherwise I have found it to be a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It smells sooo good. To the reviews that think it stinks I really don&#x27;t know what they are talking about. As well it is the only scalp treatment I have ever found that dosen&#x27;t make my hair gressy looking either. I lightly tap on my scalp so for those who think it makes your hair greasy must be putting on too much in an area. I do dye hair black as well so maybe by the fact it&#x27;s a darker color might make a difference. But by the fact it makes my hair stop falling out so much... LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Used this faithfully and it didn&#x27;t make the slightest bit of difference in my hairs thickness or anything else. The search continues!</li>
            <li> Em...I think generally I like this product but it is so far still unclear how effective it is. I&#x27;m about to finish my first bottle, and did not notice a significant difference. I feel less hair has fallen off during shower but not sure if more is coming out. Maybe I didn&#x27;t use enough. But if you use the amount indicated by the instruction each time, I think a bottle wouldn&#x27;t last more than a month.</li>
            <li> I think that this stuff actually works but I think you need to use a lot more than indicated to see the results. One bottle does not last me very long at all. The directions say that you should only use one dropper per use, but I end up using several because I want to see hair growth all over and not just in one single area. As a result, the bottle doesn&#x27;t last long. I would continue to use this product but at the rate I use it and at the price, i can&#x27;t afford to keep replenishing every 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Ok. I have NO idea how/why this works. It doesn&#x27;t even  make scientific sense bc it won&#x27;t/can&#x27;t actually &#x27;regrow&#x27; hair from a follicle that lost a hair...but it does. I apply to my scalp at night and over time it does feel as though my hair is fuller and more substantial. Very pricey, esp compared to similar products-which i have tried but w/o the success Ive had with this- This is my 4-5 bottle..Im addicted</li>
            <li> I was loosing a substantial amount of hair when I stumbled upon this product.  I am very pleased with the results after three months of use.  My hair loss has been minimized and new hair growth is fuller and thicker.  I apply product to fingertips and massage into my scalp.  I probably use half a dropper for each application.  I always use once a day, sometimes twice a day.  Only drawback is (I found this out when I was sick with the flu) if you stop using, hair loss resumes.  I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s for hair growth for your head but I use it for my eye brows and I now have hair growing in my eye brows.  I over tweezed my eye brows when I was young but using this for a long time now and within 30 or so you&#x27;ll see new hair coming out. I also use it for my eyelashes. Just make sure it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes. I was told about this product a few months ago by an employee at Sephora and she told me that it works for the eye lashes and eye brows too and it works. I Highly recommend it. I use it morning and before bed and I massage the sirum well into the eyelash lid and eye brows. Hope it works for you.</li>
            <li> It did nothing for my thinning hair</li>
            <li> eh....stopped using....strong smell.</li>
