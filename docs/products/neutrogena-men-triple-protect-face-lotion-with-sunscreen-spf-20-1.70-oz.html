            <li>This was perfect cause</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good lotion for applying to my face after shaving.</li>
            <li>good stuff.  </li>
            <li>This is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>packaging was good product works well</li>
            <li>Great product have used it for many years and have recommended it to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>I really love Neutrogena&#x27;s Razor Defense face lotion, and this version of it is just as good but with the added benefit of SPF 20.  </li>
            <li>Found a great deal on Amazon and bought a 5 pack since I liked it so much.  </li>
            <li>Love how it moisturizers and protects w SPF 20.</li>
            <li>Fast service to NZ and better than I can get here.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, little strong smelling tho</li>
            <li>I guess the best of both worlds would be for Neutrogena to just put SPF in its Razor Defense product vs. having to buy 2 different products, but that&#x27;s a different story!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being a guy, I didn&#x27;t think I needed a face moisturizer, but my skin looks so much better now... not dull like before.</li>
            <li>The 3-pack is economical.</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey, but as I said, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>This lotion does what it is supposed to do, does not make me break out, and does not smell funny.  </li>
            <li>I also find I use this more in the spring/summer/fall when I tend to be outside more on the soccer and baseball fields or outside in the yard.  </li>
            <li>A pea size amount covers my whole face.  </li>
            <li>I use the regular stuff most days and take this version of it with me on vacation for beach or skiing or other outdoor activity.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as greasy as other lotions that are made for your whole body.</li>
            <li>stuff is a little thicker than the normal Razor Defense lotion and doesn&#x27;t directly absorb as well as the non-SPF version, but once you get used to that you recognize that you need to use a little less of this stuff and spread it more evenly.  </li>

            <li> I was looking for a good lotion for applying to my face after shaving. This was perfect cause it&#x27;s not as greasy as other lotions that are made for your whole body. It also has SPF 20 to protect your face against the sun&#x27;s damaging rays. When I forget to put this on after shaving, like when I&#x27;m in a bug hurry, I can tell later during the day that I didn&#x27;t use this cause my face feels really dry! I wish I had found this much earlier then I did.</li>
            <li> good stuff.  replaces need for aftershave.  All in one.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy.  Has 20 SPF sun screen, and the lotion goes a long way.  A pea size amount covers my whole face.  I&#x27;ll buy this again and again.  Kind of pricey, but as I said, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Love how it moisturizers and protects w SPF 20. Being a guy, I didn&#x27;t think I needed a face moisturizer, but my skin looks so much better now... not dull like before.</li>
            <li> Bought it at a department store.  Found a great deal on Amazon and bought a 5 pack since I liked it so much.  Keeps my face moisturized without feeling greasy, plus it is also a sunblock so that takes care of sun protection.</li>
            <li> This lotion does what it is supposed to do, does not make me break out, and does not smell funny.  Does not contain Retinol.</li>
            <li> I used this cream and it&#x27;s not sticky and it doesn&#x27;t smell. It seems to work well enough in the open sun because my face is not burnt when I took it to Mexico.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product.  He was using only an after shave on his face, and I suggested he try Neutrogena Face Lotion to moisturize and to give him SPF.  The 3-pack is economical.</li>
            <li> packaging was good product works well</li>
            <li> Great stuff, little strong smelling tho</li>
            <li> Great product have used it for many years and have recommended it to my family and friends.</li>

The SPF protection has done equally well for me on the beach as the baseball field.</li>
            <li> Fast service to NZ and better than I can get here. Now I (and my wife) can look younger with the product!!!</li>
