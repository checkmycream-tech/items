            <li>Really works great.  </li>
            <li>best of the Wound Specialists and after all the treatments, the wound honey was the only thing that actually&lt;br /&gt;healed</li>
            <li>and it seemed to heal better than Neosporin.</li>
            <li>I started using the Wound Honey and with 5 days the wound was significantly better.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to stop banaging it.  </li>

            <li>I received the product promptly and an well satisfied.</li>

            <li>Husband had Mersa and it ate a huge hole in his leg, I brought this and applied it</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT</li>
            <li>This product is great for putting on your feet for calouses or dry and cracked feet.</li>
            <li>Loved the way it worked after only two days on a rash</li>

            <li>Super item.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift and the recipient liked it enough that I made another order.  </li>
            <li>I have been touching this spot with WH after shower each morning and the old scar is gradually going away.</li>
            <li>i try to keep an extra tube handy</li>
            <li>it healed it right away.</li>
            <li>It took more than 3 weeks before they finally arrived.</li>
            <li>going to keep some on hand in my first aid kit..</li>
            <li>but it works miracles with first aid wounds.</li>
            <li>WOW !!!!</li>
            <li>Older skin is much thinner and more tender than when younger .</li>
            <li>I certainly cannot endorse it now.</li>
            <li>We also used it for a large flap of skin removed from the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li>They said it really works.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!  </li>
            <li>Our whole family has used this for cuts and things.  </li>
            <li>It really works well</li>
            <li>It is much lighter in color and looks as though it has a lot of air whipped into it.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the disinfectant properties of honey really aids in secondary-intention wound healing.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had to use it for much.</li>
            <li>It has also worked very well, hard to say if this product was better, but research has shown that Manuka honey is very powerful stuff.</li>
            <li>Same program, clean with soap and water, cover with Manuka Honey and sterile gauze.</li>
            <li>This product is great for any small open ares on the skin, healsin 5 to 10 days</li>
            <li>I would also add that I normally use raw honey that came from my own bee hives for wounds and burns.</li>
            <li>I have used various times and EVERY time it has healed up the wound quickly.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more in the future.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on certain wounds (used by healthcare professional)</li>
            <li>I find this product a great general purpose ointment for small wounds (especially grazed knees when your kid takes a spill from their bike!)</li>
            <li>This product has helped my hands feel normal again</li>
            <li>It has to be at least 15+ to be effective in wound healing.</li>
            <li>He simply mentioned that some of his patients had made complimentary statements about it.</li>
            <li>i have been singing this honey&#x27;s praises all round the hospital, to my primary care physician, etc., because of its natural, gentle and thorough healing power.</li>
            <li>Eras Natural Sciences Dr. Nordykes New Zealand Wound Honey.</li>
            <li>I used on my dog and forgot this important fact but it healed the cut above his eye even though it was only on a short while.</li>
            <li>The customer service was very responsive saying it was on back order, yet on Amazon it still showed 3 in stock.  </li>
            <li>I have been taking care of my elderly 87 year old father-in-law who had diabetic ulcers.  </li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Three years ago he developed an ulcer on his leg from that persistently refused to heal for months.  </li>
            <li>Completely healed with almost no scarring in under 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am 79 years old.</li>
            <li>next morning scab is already there and healing is amazingly fast.  </li>
            <li>have an old scar on my leg from a bug bite from three years ago.</li>
            <li>In about a week my feet are completely healed of splits and crackes.</li>
            <li>WH seems to remove simple scar as it likes normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was in such unbearable agony, that I thought I&#x27;d never function normally</li>
            <li>The new honey is obviously different from what I had received before.</li>
            <li>Great product, used it on a fairly serious 2nd degree burn that was 2.5 inches long and almost an inch wide on my neck.</li>
            <li>I used some of the new honey I ordered and in three days a new hole about 3/8 inch diameter had been eaten out in the center of the area.</li>
            <li>manuka honey was recommended to me by wound care nurses at my local hospital because i had a radiation-caused wound in a sensitive area that wouldn&#x27;t heal.  </li>
            <li>It finally closed after 8 weeks of intense oral antibiotic treatment (that was, incidentally, for an unrelated issue.)  </li>
            <li>Also my old girl lost stopped trying to lick it constantly</li>
            <li>Today the wound has healed and the hair has almostly completely grown back.  </li>
            <li>It healed much faster than other types of antibiotics I have used.  </li>
            <li>When he recently developed another ulcer in the same spot, I was dismayed and after nearly six weeks of trying keeping it covered, keeping it dry, various antibiotic ointments etc, I ordered this wound honey.</li>
            <li>However, she did not live long enough  for me to really tell if it worked or not.  </li>

            <li> I had previously given this product a high rating.</li>
            <li> I first got this product several years ago when I was recovering slowly from a brown recluse bite.</li>
            <li> will keep comming back use cotton gloves after applying and sleep with it all night long.</li>
            <li> but I could only order 2 and once the order was placed, there was no update for a long time until I contacted reseller&#x27;s customer service.  </li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive this gel, however, when I used it for the first time, it was so thick to smear on and it actually made my sore on my arm worse rather than better.</li>
            <li> Active manuka honeys are all tested for anti-bacterial activity, and there are several on the market that list the results obtained (such as 16+ or 20+), also indicating where the activity was tested.</li>
            <li> a minute after I apply it burns for a long time.</li>
            <li> although sticky and thick, this stuff really works, and clearned up my wound - which i&#x27;d been dealing with for over a year - within weeks.  </li>
            <li> The wound had completely healed over with only a little loose skin in the center.</li>
            <li> I shared it with my podiatrist and he has since suggested its use to other patients with similar problems.</li>
            <li> My hands are severly dry</li>
            <li> I am very sad to say that I was allergic to it as my skin is to so many things.  </li>
            <li> This crucial information is also missing.</li>
            <li> and i have to be careful if i am wearing clothes as I think it can damage or stain.</li>
            <li> and I have other friends swear by it.</li>
            <li> The results were nothing short of unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I also compared it to spraying ph acid water on some other skin eruptions and they both seemed to do the trick within 48 hours.</li>
            <li> Now my husband is using it on hard to heal abrasions on his back.</li>
            <li> It is about half the size of a dime.</li>
            <li> I was going to cover it for a little longer just for protection of the area.</li>
            <li> A little bump can cause blood to flow.</li>
            <li> I also add WH to those little sun cancer spots that you get on the tops of your ears.</li>
            <li> Within a few days there is no sign of the damage.</li>
            <li> It is messy to keep on wound without bandage</li>
            <li> The soap may have also helped to a degree, but what really clinched it was using Wound Honey (with BASIC calamine-lotion as a base).</li>
            <li> In the past when trying to heal a cut I&#x27;ve just used honey.  </li>
            <li> Adding a small amount of this wound honey to each created a barrier to infection, and shortened healing time.</li>
            <li> He found it no more unpleasant to use than any other ointment - kept the wound bandaged with the honey if he was out and about, and left it uncovered with the honey when he was home.  </li>
            <li> The honey is very thick</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff on some diabetic ulcers and was horrified to see they got worse.</li>
            <li> My husband was in a serious auto accident a couple of decades ago, has a lot of scar tissue and the attending lousy circulation in his legs.  </li>
            <li> the prescription creams given me by doctors either failed to help, or made it worse.</li>
            <li> Sorry would not buy again</li>
            <li> Can you imagine that all the medication in the world was useless except for this&lt;br /&gt;miraculous honey!</li>
            <li> and my feet were awful, cracked, caloused, and split to the point of bleeding.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Tried this stuff on some diabetic ulcers and was horrified to see they got worse. It looked like mushrooms or something coming out of the wounds. Stopped using it and went back to neosporin which made the growths go away.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product.  In the past when trying to heal a cut I&#x27;ve just used honey.  When reading about this product I thought it would be much better.    Sorry would not buy again</li>
            <li> I find this product a great general purpose ointment for small wounds (especially grazed knees when your kid takes a spill from their bike!) and a boon to me when the roses in my garden fight back. I generously apply the wound honey and, where practical, cover the damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But where I find this product excels is in treating fungus or infections, such as boils, ulcers, skin rashes and the like. To me, it&#x27;s slmost like penicillin. Skin rashes show improvement within hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the wound closes, I start applying Vitamin E from a punctured Vitam E capsule and that almost toatlly eliminates any scarring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wound Honey works for me and I have other friends swear by it. However, the comments I have made above pertain only to MY experiences.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing around for cuts, burns, etc.  I have used various times and EVERY time it has healed up the wound quickly.  I sent some to relatives and they also love it!  IMPORTANT - it&#x27;s honey...so it&#x27;s sticky and you have to put on a covering after applying.  I used on my dog and forgot this important fact but it healed the cut above his eye even though it was only on a short while.</li>
            <li> Eras Natural Sciences Dr. Nordykes New Zealand Wound Honey. After pacemaker surgery, I ended up with a lot of blisters under the bandaging, namely from latex allergy. Adding a small amount of this wound honey to each created a barrier to infection, and shortened healing time.</li>
            <li> I had heard really good things about this so chose to use it on the surgery wound on my greyound.  However, she did not live long enough  for me to really tell if it worked or not.  She has squamous carcinoma.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hands feel normal again it is something you have to use all the time or the splits and cracks in your fingers will keep comming back use cotton gloves after applying and sleep with it all night long.My hands are severly dry I use lots of lotion daily and this Wound Honey and my hands are better than they were...</li>
            <li> I am very sad to say that I was allergic to it as my skin is to so many things.  I passed it along to my sister and she and her family loves it.  They said it really works.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on certain wounds (used by healthcare professional)</li>
            <li> GOOD OINTMEN AND A QUICK HEALER</li>
            <li> manuka honey was recommended to me by wound care nurses at my local hospital because i had a radiation-caused wound in a sensitive area that wouldn&#x27;t heal.  although sticky and thick, this stuff really works, and clearned up my wound - which i&#x27;d been dealing with for over a year - within weeks.  i recommend using non-stick wound pads over the honey to keep it from getting on clothes.  i have been singing this honey&#x27;s praises all round the hospital, to my primary care physician, etc., because of its natural, gentle and thorough healing power.</li>
            <li> I used Manuka Wound after I got a severe burn on my leg.  It healed things without any problems nor a scar.  Just followed the instructions to the letter and all was well.  It healed much faster than other types of antibiotics I have used.  I recommend it highly!  It was delivered in record time as well.  In fact I bought more to keep on hand.  I am not a diabetic, so I can not speak to the results in regards to them.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Really works great.  Arrived quickly!!!</li>
            <li> I found this product during a Google search for foot ulcers. It was a \\&quot;Godsend\\&quot;! I have been fighting open foot ulcers for over three years and this product healed them up in just over two months of continuous use. I shared it with my podiatrist and he has since suggested its use to other patients with similar problems. I only wished I would have found it sooner!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift and the recipient liked it enough that I made another order.  It showed 3 were in stock but I could only order 2 and once the order was placed, there was no update for a long time until I contacted reseller&#x27;s customer service.  The customer service was very responsive saying it was on back order, yet on Amazon it still showed 3 in stock.  It took more than 3 weeks before they finally arrived.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to receive this gel, however, when I used it for the first time, it was so thick to smear on and it actually made my sore on my arm worse rather than better. I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Loved the way it worked after only two days on a rash I&#x27;d been dealing with for three months. Ordered a tube for family to try, too.</li>
            <li> I have been taking care of my elderly 87 year old father-in-law who had diabetic ulcers.  He was attended to by&lt;br /&gt;the best of the Wound Specialists and after all the treatments, the wound honey was the only thing that actually&lt;br /&gt;healed those diabetic ulcers.  Can you imagine that all the medication in the world was useless except for this&lt;br /&gt;miraculous honey!</li>
            <li> Our whole family has used this for cuts and things.  It really works well and I like that it&#x27;s natural.  We&#x27;ve even used it for our dog.</li>
            <li> this wound honey is really an amazing product......healthy skin.......and better healing noted since we began using it....will definitely purchase again........going to keep some on hand in my first aid kit..</li>
            <li> Husband had Mersa and it ate a huge hole in his leg, I brought this and applied it and it seemed to heal better than Neosporin. So its a keeper</li>
            <li> My husband was in a serious auto accident a couple of decades ago, has a lot of scar tissue and the attending lousy circulation in his legs.  Three years ago he developed an ulcer on his leg from that persistently refused to heal for months.  It finally closed after 8 weeks of intense oral antibiotic treatment (that was, incidentally, for an unrelated issue.)  When he recently developed another ulcer in the same spot, I was dismayed and after nearly six weeks of trying keeping it covered, keeping it dry, various antibiotic ointments etc, I ordered this wound honey. The results were nothing short of unbelievable.  Within days of applying the honey twice a day, the wound had started to close.  Within a couple of weeks it was healed. He found it no more unpleasant to use than any other ointment - kept the wound bandaged with the honey if he was out and about, and left it uncovered with the honey when he was home.  I&#x27;m now a believer!</li>
            <li> My Mother in Law recommended this product to me.  I purchased for my aging Dalmation who had a wound on her leg that just would not heal.  I tried daily bandaging and topical ointments but nothing helped.  I started using the Wound Honey and with 5 days the wound was significantly better.  Also my old girl lost stopped trying to lick it constantly and I was able to stop banaging it.  Today the wound has healed and the hair has almostly completely grown back.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It has great healing properties. I first got this product several years ago when I was recovering slowly from a brown recluse bite. Now my husband is using it on hard to heal abrasions on his back.</li>
            <li> I had previously given this product a high rating. I had to order more since the process had not quite been completed. The wound had completely healed over with only a little loose skin in the center. I was going to cover it for a little longer just for protection of the area. I used some of the new honey I ordered and in three days a new hole about 3/8 inch diameter had been eaten out in the center of the area. The new honey is obviously different from what I had received before. It is much lighter in color and looks as though it has a lot of air whipped into it. I certainly cannot endorse it now.</li>
            <li> Super item.  Recommend to all!</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much.  I received the product promptly and an well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product, used it on a fairly serious 2nd degree burn that was 2.5 inches long and almost an inch wide on my neck. Completely healed with almost no scarring in under 3 weeks. I cleaned with soap and water after the initial burn, and used only Manuka wound honey and sterile gauze after that. I did not use antibiotics or proxide or anything. I&#x27;m not saying that it will work for you or that you should treat your wounds the same as I have. Always follow your doctors advice. I would also add that I normally use raw honey that came from my own bee hives for wounds and burns. It has also worked very well, hard to say if this product was better, but research has shown that Manuka honey is very powerful stuff. We also used it for a large flap of skin removed from the palm of the hand. Same program, clean with soap and water, cover with Manuka Honey and sterile gauze. After 2.5 weeks completely healed without infection and minimal scarring. Try for yourself, if nothing else it smells nice and taste good.</li>
            <li> I am 79 years old. Older skin is much thinner and more tender than when younger . A little bump can cause blood to flow. Wound honey is so great as you place some on a bandaid, cover cut and after removing bandaid next morning scab is already there and healing is amazingly fast.  Within a few days there is no sign of the damage. No scar either. I also add WH to those little sun cancer spots that you get on the tops of your ears. It gradually dissolves the spot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an old scar on my leg from a bug bite from three years ago. It is about half the size of a dime. I have been touching this spot with WH after shower each morning and the old scar is gradually going away. WH seems to remove simple scar as it likes normal skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would never be without it again and even carry it when I travel.</li>
            <li> Good product but, why does it say that it is the only one tested for anti-bacterial activity? Active manuka honeys are all tested for anti-bacterial activity, and there are several on the market that list the results obtained (such as 16+ or 20+), also indicating where the activity was tested. This product does not say what brand of manuka honey was used, or what the result of the activity test was. If the activity is low save money and use regular honey. It has to be at least 15+ to be effective in wound healing. Also, what is the percentage content of manuka honey? This crucial information is also missing.</li>
            <li> It seems to be very good at healing.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great product! I&#x27;ve used sugar in wound dressings before, but it can be abrasive, so this is the perfect concoction. Not to mention that the disinfectant properties of honey really aids in secondary-intention wound healing.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to use it for much. Had 2 bites on my back and it seemed to work within 48l hours. I also compared it to spraying ph acid water on some other skin eruptions and they both seemed to do the trick within 48 hours. The honey is very thick and i have to be careful if i am wearing clothes as I think it can damage or stain. My friend has eczema but it&#x27;s in remission but if she does have a flare up i will offer her some to try on it.</li>
            <li> This product is great for any small open ares on the skin, healsin 5 to 10 days</li>
            <li> The wound honey is all natural and smells wonderful. Works Great! I will definitely order more in the future. Just wish it shipped faster.</li>
            <li> i love this item, it works wonders for my daughter&#x27;s knee and foot wounds it healed it right away. i try to keep an extra tube handy</li>
            <li> My doctor did not come out and recommend this product. He simply mentioned that some of his patients had made complimentary statements about it. I tried it and was more than pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful ointment, which cured my acute poison ivy burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were virtually like chemical burns on my palms and between my fingers. I was in such unbearable agony, that I thought I&#x27;d never function normally again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technu made the burns worse.&lt;br /&gt;And the prescription creams given me by doctors either failed to help, or made it worse. People advised bleach baths and naptha soap. The soap may have also helped to a degree, but what really clinched it was using Wound Honey (with BASIC calamine-lotion as a base). I then covered the smeared-spots with duct tape, to keep the healing-honey locked into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila! Dr.Nordyke, if you&#x27;re listening, you can&#x27;t imagine the favor you&#x27;ve done me!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Ditto to the Aveeno people, albeit that was applied to my less-acute poison-ivy areas.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried this stuff you need to get it. It is messy to keep on wound without bandage but it works miracles with first aid wounds.</li>
            <li> This product is great for putting on your feet for calouses or dry and cracked feet. I work and stand on my feet between 8 and 12 hours a day 7 days a week and my feet were awful, cracked, caloused, and split to the point of bleeding. I put this product on my feet every morning before i put my boots on and all i can say is after about three days WOW !!!! I was realy impressed with how much better i could walk without my feet hurting. In about a week my feet are completely healed of splits and crackes. Buy it NOW!!!!. 1 issue i wish it came in bigger containers&lt;br /&gt;Christinia from Missouri</li>
            <li> Does this stuff burn anyone else when you apply it? Man it sure hurts! I have a deep ulcer and a minute after I apply it burns for a long time.</li>
