            <li>Glad its available still.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to find my original bottle to make sure.</li>
            <li>It is a wonderfully fresh and fruity body mist and is perfect for daily usage.</li>
            <li>Very fast on the shipping, love the product.</li>

            <li>Wish it wasn&#x27;t double the price from when I bought it originally.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty similar, but doesn&#x27;t last as long as the original.</li>
            <li>The spray cap wouldn&#x27;t spray, only drip down onto the bottle itself, but I did still love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I went back to Victoria&#x27;s Secret to buy more for her ..........</li>
