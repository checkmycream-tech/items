            <li>Found the lotion I will be sticking with for sure!!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Very warm lotion makes you feel like you are being pricked by something.</li>
            <li>so it was very warm in the car.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>The results are amazing!  </li>
            <li>For the price the results are amazing!</li>
            <li>Works amazing!</li>
            <li>I made sure to rub it in well and wiped my hands as best</li>
            <li>I have tried many lotions and oils to get the perfect tan.  </li>
            <li>I used it and experienced no tingle, as I now have a good tan already.  </li>
            <li>Best lotion that I ever users, I have managed tanning salons for years and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>but thats what brings out the awesome darkness in my skin:-)....</li>
            <li>Yes, I love it and the tingle is great!  </li>
            <li>and I get the most perfect color with it!</li>
            <li>had a pleasant smell that reminded me of starburst candy.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li>I.still have a beautiful warm tint to my tan.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased I was able to find it again at a great price!</li>
            <li>I tan very easy and this worked wonders for my tan!</li>
            <li>I was really happy when, after 15 minutes on the tanning bed, my skin felt good and the color was amazing.</li>
            <li>I loved the color I got from this.  </li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>and i loved it.</li>
            <li>The tingle lasts a good while--but what tingle doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li>The tingle isn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li>I was looking for something with a good tingle but also with bronzer.</li>
            <li>I can see that the bronzers did give me good color.</li>
            <li>Now with that being said i told myself it must be that burning that gives me the good tan.</li>
            <li>great color nice and brown instead of an orange.</li>
            <li>No steaks, smells good, tingle and burning sensation.</li>
            <li>The smell will linger all day and does not smell good.</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>, it was really a good price, and offered both a bronzer and tingle.  </li>
            <li>its always good to switch up ur lotions</li>
            <li>The smell is good as well even after the day goes on.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT</li>
            <li>It smells good too.</li>
            <li>all n all good lotion</li>
            <li>I purchased this tingle lotion, as I like a good tingle from time to time.</li>
            <li>It will soak in a good tan once you get through the tingle of it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and it works great.</li>
            <li>but i loved it</li>
            <li>Good lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells good too which</li>
            <li>Works good burns when firsr put on</li>
            <li>good texture, and comes in an easy-to-dispense bottle.  </li>
            <li>and it has good bronzers in it to boost color.</li>
            <li>I thought my wife was exaggerating because she had fair skin, but when I tried it, I had a similiar feeling.  </li>
            <li>Plus the heat/tingle stays with you for some time (feels good in Minnesota winters</li>
            <li>I have a good tan already and this product keeps increasing the color.</li>
            <li>IT WORK&#x27;S WELL FOR ME, IT&#x27;S JUSK INSANELY GOOD...</li>
            <li>For the price, it is good though.</li>
            <li>have olive skin and tan fairly well, and I have used tingle products before.</li>
            <li>It smells good too tho.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a good lotion</li>
            <li>And it a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Good results.</li>
            <li>I would say rotton is a good name for thief lotion.</li>
            <li>After 4-5 uses I had a really good tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing I have not purchased this.</li>
            <li>but it made my skin feel like it was burning off and the skin did not react really good to it</li>
            <li>Has a good smell for a man&#x27;s tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is soooo good</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it and we used up two bottles this summer.  </li>
            <li>is awesome and you get good results after one use.i wouldnt put it on your face unless you are familiar with what that feels</li>
            <li>Immediately after applying, it&#x27;s best if you can clean your hands with something just like you would with a sunless tanning product.</li>
            <li>It also evened out my skin and hubby noticed that it gave my skin a beautiful glow on top of being so brown...</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
            <li>this tanning lotion has a great smell to it, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my color.  </li>
            <li>It works great, I love this product.  </li>

            <li>and I get an amazing tan</li>
            <li>The smell is nice,  not overbearing at all</li>
            <li>Yes it does get warm</li>
            <li>The smell before hand is nice.</li>
            <li>Kind of smells like something orange.</li>
            <li>The smell is really nice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m tanning fast and evenly and it looks great!  </li>
            <li>Unless you like that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li>It just got really warm.</li>
            <li>She is much more fair than I am, and I can tell you that this product does not work on our skin colors.  </li>
            <li>Love the tingle, smells insanely good.  </li>
            <li>but i really liked it</li>
            <li>Honest review here....</li>
            <li>Well..... being honest here....</li>
            <li>It makes your skin really warm</li>
            <li>this is  not for you, but if you like that nice warm massage like feeling of a warming lotion this is for you.</li>
            <li>While the tingle and the bronzer are good, I used it a couple more</li>
            <li>Well it is warm out and</li>
            <li>The lotion has to be causing some kind of allergic reaction in the skin to create this redness.</li>
            <li>I liked the pain but would be lying if said I wasn&#x27;t relieved to get in the shower and wash it</li>
            <li>you will feel a warm tingling sensation,  no</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good TINGLE!!</li>
            <li>I have had tanning bed of my own since in the 1990.  </li>
            <li>This tanner has a nice tingle and does work for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, almost like fruit loops.</li>
            <li>I liked it....</li>
            <li>and Ive liked the quality of what I used before in this line.</li>
            <li>Nice and tingly.</li>
            <li>Does give me a nice color after two sessions.</li>
            <li>and I felt like I would spontaneously combust at any moment.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>Also you must apply perfectly even or else some spots will be much darker than others</li>
            <li>The tingle was indeed warm, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>and I must say I liked the heat.</li>
            <li>Oh, I read many of the comments stating that the millennium 100 times darker bronzer smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave the afterburn smell?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to say that I am an intermediate tanner, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tingle and bronzing products to see what kind of results they produce.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this lotion because of all the great reviews that I had read.  </li>
            <li>Greatest indoor tanning lotion I have ever used....have purchased this particular one 6 times and will continue to buy it...</li>
            <li>This lotion gives you incredible color and gives it to you fast!</li>
            <li>but i personally love the tingle lotions for the great results and i will purchase this product again!also VERY fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and works great</li>
            <li>I would buy this lotion again, and many more Millenium products!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff and will order more!  </li>
            <li>but I got great color results after my first use!</li>
            <li>and I am so very happy I chose this product instead of the other ones out there that are more costly!!</li>
            <li>this is the best by far</li>
            <li>The kind offered at my tanning bed works much better.</li>
            <li>i love this lotion , but i wouldnt suggest loving on your husband or kids</li>
            <li>I have used plenty of tingle lotions and I have to say this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I continue to buy this lotion again and again because it is by far the best tanning lotion</li>
            <li>The price is also amazing :-)</li>
            <li>lol I don&#x27;t know if that the right word for it  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I tan very easily and found that I got more color in two sessions without tanning lotion than I got in a week using this product.  </li>
            <li>This was a great deal and the delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li>It work great the first 2 bottles</li>
            <li>Great bargain for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The tingle is really good, but not extreme.</li>
            <li>I will forever be a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li>I almost blacked out and got super dizzy !!  </li>
            <li>and it went on very smooth.</li>
            <li>i loved the dark color it gave me because i am fair skinned !!!</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and had been going to the tanning bed for nearly a month with no results.  </li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>and I will order this again in the future :D</li>
            <li>This formula sure does have a tingle-</li>
            <li>I love this tingle lotion.</li>
            <li>It was more of a 6 hour burning process rather than a tingle.</li>
            <li>My summer glow has arrived and I love it.</li>
            <li>, I know it did for me!!! :)</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I personally love tingle lotion</li>
            <li>as all tanning lotions you just have to make sure you rub it in well</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Tingle lotions work better than anything else because they stimulate your blood to the surface and encourage melanin production in your skin.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, I will definitely be using this stuff again!</li>
            <li>Worked okay.</li>
            <li>Was OK but kinda watery...</li>
            <li>started feeling better.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy that I tried this product as a sample only.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it it arrived on time and it does the job</li>
            <li>I am an experienced tanner and was looking for something w/ tingle that tans fast...</li>
            <li>I knew I would not be able to stand laying in the tanning bed</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with...</li>
            <li>Which I love and that&#x27;s why I gave this 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I used it again Sunday and noticed the tingle was a lot more tolerable</li>
            <li>LOVE IT....</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li>It is ok for a fill in lotion but doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I felt a tingling but it was not horrible, but I would not apply any more than I</li>
            <li>It did not help her with tanning any more than if she did not use product.  </li>
            <li>I was satisfied with this product, but probably used it too soon.</li>
            <li>All in all Im very happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li>but this is my favorite of the two...</li>
            <li>It also has bronzer in it which I love.</li>
            <li>the more you itched.</li>
            <li>Sincerely,  itdoesntmatter</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this Millenium lotion too, and I am sooo glad I did.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely be able to tell with this lotion</li>
            <li>after reading the product info and the many reviews, i decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>and i love the Millenium lotions</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product</li>
            <li>I have just started to love tingle lotions because i feel like they create darker tans than just bronzers.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The smell is okay, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin, and the reviews from others with the same skin type said it worked great for them.</li>
            <li>I got her out immediately, but the spots and redness had spread to most of her body.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love to tan with tingle lotion and this bottle has it.</li>
            <li>Given the reaction SO MANY PEOPLE seem to have had, I would be worried this could put a person into anaphylactic shock.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love it if someone at Amazon sent me something better or refunded my money.</li>
            <li>should have read the entire list of ingredients and been more diligent in my research as millenium lotions have always been excellent and i have never had an issue with any others .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love a tingle factor</li>
            <li>The tingle isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and goes away within an hour of washing it off.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE BRONZER</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion....</li>
            <li>Hv used this brand many times.</li>
            <li>So not useing any more</li>
            <li>I love tingle this lotion and all lotions with heat.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to get out of bed I passed out woke up in the floor.</li>
            <li>its not like most of them</li>
            <li>Love the tingle and got it on the day promised.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has been greater than I&#x27;d imagined it would be.  </li>
            <li>I do not know how this is safe or legal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I was able to go to class.</li>
            <li>I love using tingle lotions because i love the feeling of the heat</li>
            <li>but there is a kick to it which i love.</li>
            <li>I gave the product away to someone of Hispanic descent and the product worked ok for them.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion and I&#x60;m</li>
            <li>but i think this is much better and the price is better.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this tanner...</li>
            <li>it works great and my tan is much deeper and it does not make me itch..</li>
            <li>LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li>I love the tingle</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>But it is one of the more stronger tingles I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m more used to the reaction it gives, who knows.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel a bit better.</li>
            <li>LOVE this lotion</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, I will buy it again</li>
            <li>so I have to make sure I wash my hands and let it sit on my skin after I tan.</li>
            <li>But I am in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>I am sure some love it</li>
            <li>Arrived on time as promised and definately love this lotion and will definately purchase from here again and again</li>
            <li>The one good thing I will say about this lotion is if you&#x27;re looking to sweat a few calories off this lotion is perfect for that...take a bottle of water, you&#x27;re going to be parched.</li>
            <li>5 stars because you can&#x27;t find a better tingler lotion for the price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it works immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am Not that Satisfied From this product.</li>
            <li>I am in love with Millennium tanning products (bronzers, accelerators, tingle)</li>
            <li>it better than others).</li>
            <li>It has a great tingle sensation which I really like</li>
            <li>I truly love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I know most of you said dont put it on your face</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT</li>
            <li>becuae I really love this product is when I haven&#x27;t tanned in</li>
            <li>love love love love love</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning lotion on the market.</li>
            <li>Love this product, but be prepared to feel the tingle.</li>
            <li>As a not so experienced tanner i found this products didn&#x27;t irritate my skin much</li>
            <li>I had to out it to the side till I can handle it better.</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>so i have many lotions with and without tingle</li>
            <li>i love this tanning lotion you see immediate results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never tried one but decided to go nuts and to try this one because I am a fool for tanning.  :)</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t love the fragrance of this lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love a tingle lotion</li>
            <li>Fast service, great product, fantastic price!</li>
            <li>but it is just saying that the lotion has a lot of bronzer in it that gets washed of more and more after every shower you take.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>The tingle is really intense, and the bronzer is a great color too</li>
            <li>Really love.</li>
            <li>But u better like the tingle factor.</li>
            <li>If you can take the pain, this is probably a great lotion, but I will not be ordering this product again because it&#x27;s way too intense.</li>
            <li>So this helps my sunbed tan look more like it came from laying by the pool instead of laying in a bed.</li>
            <li>Love that factor.</li>
            <li>And I dont know if its all in my head or not, but my skintone looks much more even now.</li>
            <li>i read the reviews and people were saying its ok.</li>
            <li>This does give me a more noticeable coloring.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I have used lotions that tingle many times before , and I have been tanning for years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it 3 times now and can&#x27;t stay away :)</li>
            <li>Definitely the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>I love the shoe.</li>
            <li>Most tingle tanning lotions makes spots on me but this one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>MAKE SURE YOU RUB IT IN EVENLY</li>
            <li>but I had thought  that 100 times would be more potent than 50Xs?</li>
            <li>If you like tingle you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I love a silicone based tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li>They  feel better to the skin.  </li>
            <li>I was even asked to take a picture for a tanning salon billboard :)</li>
            <li>and I have used many</li>
            <li>Love this lotion..</li>
            <li>it was ok.</li>
            <li>I thought for sure I was having an allergic reaction and was going to need to go to the ER.</li>
            <li>This product is ok.</li>
            <li>I saw the warning, but wasn&#x27;t sure what it would do when applied.  </li>
            <li>but I made sure that I rubbed it in after that and had no more&lt;br /&gt;problems  </li>
            <li>is beyond many others.</li>
            <li>I have very sesitive skin and LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion  super quick tan, but do not use if tingle affects your skin.  </li>
            <li>great product and arrived super quick</li>
            <li>AND IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN FEEL HOT!!!</li>
            <li>so expect that when you first apply it !!!</li>
            <li>This is a very unique product.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll feel super hot after a good tan!</li>
            <li>I mix it with another high tingle lotion and it works great.</li>
            <li>For this price I would recommend it to everyone if you like tingles or if you were thinking of trying a tingle, this one is a pretty good one to start out with.</li>
            <li>It tingled pretty good</li>
            <li>and I got really good color the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I tried it on myself and it burned my skin pretty good.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s so many blood vessels in your face and a product this strong can rush those to the surface and that causes damage over time.</li>
            <li>Love this product did not give a strong tingling sensation that people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>works very well just the smell as wasn&#x27;t pleasant as I had thought.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, though the tingle isn&#x27;t nearly as intense as some of these whiners make it sound.  </li>
            <li>Overall I will try another kind of tanning lotion until I am 100% happy.</li>
            <li>Warning, this is a very hot lotion, but the results are amazing, it also has a built in bronzer as well.</li>
            <li>I was nice and red when I got out though, and now I am turning a very nice brown.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you read the fine print.</li>
            <li>well make sure you read the fine print before purchasing.</li>
            <li>While I have been impressed with other products from this line, this one is OK.  </li>
            <li>But you can see very good results after only 4 uses</li>
            <li>i would recommend this for more advanced tanners or for someone who&#x27;s used tinglers before.</li>
            <li>On a lighter note- the Blackberry Citrus does smell fantastic :)</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>is a nice light brown color and smells like a sweet tart</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for changing you from just semi tan to a golden color in one use but it is really hot</li>
            <li>then I completely disagree with those people that state that it has a great smell before &amp; after, after one tanning bed session your skin is two times darker, and again maybe I am disillusioned</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone that is tanning that wants something that leaves a good color.</li>
            <li>and it had a extremly Intense burning sensation it did not feel good...</li>
            <li>be sure to check if your lotion keeps working after you tan, and shower accordingly, give yourself plenty of time to tan and shower before your get ready to go out!!!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this provider ,but most importantly this lotion.</li>
            <li>Other than that the lotion was great!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to even out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was in pain all night; this product does not wash off easily.  </li>
            <li>me, who tans easily and has no issues</li>
            <li>It is strong.</li>
            <li>it does have a really strong tingle..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li>I have used a tingle lotion before but this was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend that you use this on a level two bed.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>still this lotion to strong for me.  </li>
            <li>and it is kind of hot</li>
            <li>The tingle starts off kind of hot</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried..</li>
            <li>This is a great tingling lotion that isn&#x27;t too strong but still makes you super dark, the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I was several shades darker after the first time I used it, and I had even been using an excellent bronzer before I bought this lotion.  </li>
            <li>insanely black being THE BEST</li>
            <li>Its light and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>Yes, my face felt like it was going to blow up,  but my body felt just fine.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to do a spot test first on alot of parts on your body. :)</li>
            <li>If you are new to tanning DO NOT use this lotion!!!!!</li>
            <li>so my skin doesn&#x27;t get too used to one kind, but this one definitely makes it into my top favs!</li>
            <li>I receieved my product quickly and have used it many times; the bronzer is amazing but this lotion dries out my skin so much</li>
            <li>I tan pretty very easily</li>
            <li>It is very hot!</li>
            <li>a little dissapointed becuase the reviews were raving of perfectly bronzed non ommpa loompa skin</li>
            <li>VERY hot tingler!</li>
            <li>Worked GREAT on me but as for my best friend it made her itch like crazy after tanning the itching didn&#x27;t go away and she had to go to the emergency room and get two shots</li>
            <li>and I have had great success with it, but if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After using this just twice I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li>so I applied another light layer.</li>
            <li>I was really light and being out in the sun,</li>
            <li>This product came in just a few days and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It reminded me of a mix between Nair and a cheap self tanning</li>
            <li>But for me to personally enjoy a tanning lotion, its gotta smell fabulous.</li>
            <li>this lotion tans fantasticly.</li>
            <li>I have gotten a fantastic tan from this product.</li>
            <li>I have experienced my entire head melting as if I stuck it in sulfuric acid!!!!</li>
            <li>However fantastic results after two twenty minute sessions.</li>
            <li>I ended up giving both bottles away for free.</li>
            <li>&amp; i hope you enjoy (:</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy feeling like your skin is on fire as soon as you put this stuff on then save your money.  </li>
            <li>STOP BEING CHEAP &amp;</li>
            <li>However, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth scent ( not overly fruity),&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li>the cheap ones i find are greasy and dont do anything</li>
            <li>So go get your tan on great for outside and inside!!!</li>
            <li>I just recently ordered this product because i read the great reveiws</li>
            <li>and my tan is fabulous.</li>
            <li>i do get very red after use and it fades into a great bronzed glow</li>
            <li>This product is by far the most INTENSE tingle I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>It did leave a good color and seemed to leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li>i thought i was going to die, the tingle is that intense but the more i&#x27;ve used this the more i&#x27;ve been getting used to it and can stand the feeling.</li>
            <li>Awesome tan!!!!!  However..... the intense tingle only exists on my face!!</li>
            <li>and i feel like this price range is as good as it can get as far as tanning goes.</li>
            <li>But after an hour the red hot wore off and after 3 hours i was sooo brown and it looked amazing!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product 120% for sure!</li>
            <li>This lotion has a very very slight tingle, it does have a wonderful smell though.</li>
            <li>I find it very relaxing!!!</li>
            <li>normally tanning is an enjoyable experience for me, most times i even take a nap in the tanning booth.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m telling you your results are so worth it!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s well worth the pain and the cost!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t decide if it was worth the pain!  </li>
            <li>Its powerful!</li>
            <li>After using it for 3 days I could see a significant improvement in my tan.  </li>
            <li>worth a try with this price though!</li>
            <li>This was my first tingle lotion and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m allergic to the lotion.</li>
            <li>After the first time, i did not even notice the tingle any more.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered this.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed, at all.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has scent that is honestly friendly for both genders, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product until I used it.</li>
            <li>But the tan is worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t relate it at all with the lotion... until I used it one more time.  </li>
            <li>Love the hot tingle factor.</li>
            <li>This tingle tanning lotion is the best, I haven&#x27;t bought anything else in the past 4 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results of this product over a longer period of time.</li>
            <li>First bought this lotion from a salon, and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price again when I ran out, so turned to amazon</li>
            <li>it was too much for him,but other wise its good.</li>
            <li>but i think this one does a much better job of giving a nice brown glow and instant results!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used several tingles, and this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>this lotion does working very well.the skin color after tanning is nice and golden.</li>
            <li>At this point i was anything but impressed by the lotion but thought nothing of it until later as i liked the color it gave me (a reddish dark color).</li>
            <li>it works great and it gives me a great deep dark tan.</li>
            <li>The red on my skin has turned to a very nice golden brown.</li>
            <li>nothing special..</li>
            <li>but right now I look TAN!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion, it is by far the most intense tingler I have ever used!!</li>
            <li>Also, smells amazing and leaves your skin super soft!</li>
            <li>could never hold a pretty golden tan like most..</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I&#x27;m done tanning, my skin is instantly bright red and splotchy anywhere I missed a spot.</li>
            <li>It DOES subside, but it feels great and sorta peppery when it is tanning</li>
            <li>The tingle factor leaves your skin bright red for 5-6 hours when tested in a patch area without entering the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>and it turns me bright red.</li>
            <li>My skin turned BRIGHT red, burned, itched, and raised up where the lotion had been put.</li>
            <li>Horrrrrible made my skin turn bright red and burn.</li>
            <li>The only good thing that I would have to say about this is i feel like it is getting me tanner.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the burning it gets fun after the first...3 or 4 times I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li>Overall it seems to be good for the price $15.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even stand to stay in my tanning bed the full time with this on</li>
            <li>im a sucker for tingles and this is the best tingle I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
            <li>or so.&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I love this product is because it contains DHA as its 5th ingredient.</li>
            <li>I was several levels darker, the colour is great, no orange tinge, a nice deep sunny looking tan.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff because it really works.</li>
            <li>but once I got home took a cool shower</li>
            <li>but this is good too....stayed red for hours after i used it...</li>
            <li>The tingle lotion body shots by ed hardy has been my absolute favorite lotion ever and has gotten me the darkest out of any tanning lotion on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li>so I sat infront of a fan to cool off.</li>
            <li>my skin was so red and sting my skin that cant be good</li>
            <li>If you do not rub in the lotion all the way you will notice streak lines, so it is worth it to blend in smoothly and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just wish the tingle was more intense.</li>
            <li>I tan warm naturally, and brown in beds.</li>
            <li>The tingle was more intense than I had anticipated,  </li>
            <li>No issues at all can&#x27;t wait to try it out full spectrum.</li>
            <li>if that makes scence but its true.</li>
            <li>Its not bad.</li>
            <li>I put on a light coat of this on my legs and didnt notice any tingle right away</li>
            <li>The first use I thought I might be allergic it was so strong.</li>
            <li>is you HAVE TO make sure you rub it in really good on your hands or wipe them off because you will turn a little orange .</li>
            <li>Overall good lotion, fast shipping,  and I will order again!!</li>
            <li>the tingle factor, well i can say its not that intense, i was expecting something far more tingly but its still a great lotion and definitely get the job done, be sure to wash it off as soon as you get home, stuff really itches!</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Tingle and a mild bronzer, which was what I wanted.</li>
            <li>, it gets you super tan</li>
            <li>Granted, I have the type of skin that tans quickly anyways</li>
            <li>Love love love Insanely Black.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After 30 minutes I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li>But I used it outdoors for about 20 minutes to see if I liked it,I definitely Enjoy this product as an outdoor tanner compared to ANY regular outdoor tanning</li>
            <li>One week of not tanning and using the lotion, my color become noticeably paler quickly.</li>
            <li>This product works great indoor or outdoor for a ridiculously dark tan.</li>
            <li>i did find for me there was a very intense tingle!</li>
            <li>My legs felt very hot.</li>
            <li>and it does get very HOT  </li>
            <li>I used this lotion the very first time that I tanned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that is normal</li>
            <li>Loved this tanning lotion it was intense to the max and delivered an amazing tan not a lotion I would use for everyday use though</li>
            <li>The very first exp I had with this product, was extremely&lt;br</li>
            <li>session went well, but again... was very hot.  </li>
            <li>The price is unbeatable and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>This was my very first tingle lotion</li>
            <li>DHA is the chemical that reacts with your dead skin cells to produce the beautiful tan you get when you spray tan.</li>
            <li>Super hot!</li>
            <li>New at this tanning thing, Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was looking for or what to look for</li>
            <li>So... great tan from product but recommend Black Night 60X or Paint</li>
            <li>so this is a great deal I will b sticking with this lotion or paint me black bc</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used ROAR previously and it works great.</li>
            <li>For someone that loves a good HOT BURNING TINGLE then this is definitely for them.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t very tan at all the first time I used this product and it felt more like my skin was on fire than a tingle.</li>
            <li>BURNS YOUR SKIN BUT POWERFUL FOR A QUICK TAN</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that this stuff was mostly for people who use tanning beds, so it didn&#x27;t really seem to give a tan....</li>
            <li>I have tryed several lotions and this is the best that I have found for a long time.  </li>
            <li>i usually can&#x27;t feel tingles because im so used to them, but this one is intense and the bronzers are great!</li>
            <li>I felt like I really got a strong feeling of sun while in the bed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used tanning accelerators before (even ones from Millenium Tanning), which were all mildly uncomforatble, but worth it for the desired effect.  </li>
            <li>It is really hot though, like your on fire!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used a \\&quot;Tingle\\&quot; lotion before!</li>
            <li>It was EXTREMELY HOT!</li>
            <li>Lotion doesn&#x27;t streak and rubs in very well, also contains tyrosine, which helps boost color!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more!  </li>
            <li>If you like tinlge lotions, this one is definitly HOT and well worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li>Fast Tanning!!</li>
            <li>First !</li>
            <li>This is an extreme tingle for avid tingle users and experienced tanners and you need to spot test if you are unsure.</li>
            <li>It also tingled and I didn&#x27;t enjoy it much</li>
            <li>It felt great when I applied it but very quickly dried up in the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>It works amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tingle lotion,&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I am addicted to tingles now and this one gives me great color!</li>
            <li>Insanely is not for those w/ sensitive skin (like mine)</li>
            <li>Totally worth it</li>
            <li>The color it gives is worth it though.</li>
            <li>no tan is worth the pain of this!&lt;br /&gt;Tingle is not proven to make you tanner...</li>
            <li>Worth the buy</li>
            <li>Every place it was on my skin now is red and warm but</li>
            <li>and I was surprised how many are using walnuts .</li>
            <li>If you think the side effects are worth the tan, then I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have tried many and this one tops them all by far.</li>
            <li>Had a nice golden tan after only 25 minutes in the sun.</li>
            <li>This product was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Great product...got a nice tan, after only a few times.</li>
            <li>but i dont think its worth that burning sensation.</li>
            <li>, the face is the most sensitive area.  </li>
            <li>I use it 2x a week to stay a golden bronze that everyone compliments.</li>
            <li>I liked the results TOTALLY, and if I&lt;br /&gt;hadn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I bought this product after seeing great reviews from other customers but was very dissatisfied with it...</li>
            <li>it gets super hot..especially on the higher level beds so be prepared.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even go in the tanning bed and it was already super hot.</li>
            <li>I turned the fans on high and felt fine.  </li>
            <li>and this is coming from a girl who would only use &#x27;Designer Skin&#x27; lotions until I found this :) Overall VERY pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>In some places, it started burning right when I put it on...</li>
            <li>The redness faded and right away I could tell a difference in the shade of my skin.  </li>
            <li>the plus is that the bronzer seems to give the rest of the body the right amount of color</li>
            <li>I put it on after I got out of the shower and right before leaving to go tan.</li>
            <li>plus it helps my nerve damage i have in my right arm.</li>
            <li>I will admit right after getting out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li>Just the right amount of bronzer</li>
            <li>so I recommend using it right when you are gonna tan</li>
            <li>Great lotion, non greasy and gets you tanned and dark fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very experienced tanner.i though this lotion was going to be amazing based on reviews.is says the tingle factor is little to moderate it gets your skin red but barley tingles.</li>
            <li>The major downside is that the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; is more like a burning sensation.</li>
            <li>To tan my face, I use Black Night, which is definitely the perfect bronzing power for your face!  </li>
            <li>The tingle is intense and it gets you very brown very quickly.</li>
            <li>i rotate this with my Solid Black 100x, which is also excellent.</li>
            <li>This lotion was pretty cheap, and it worked ok, but it wasn&#x27;t anything wondrous - I tanned with it, but it didn&#x27;t make me super super dark like it says it would.</li>
            <li>i use other lotiions to keep a rotation, but if i have a special day or plans that require a nice color to my legs and arms, this is the lotion i use</li>
            <li>great tingle, but I am not able to pass my tan plateau.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used most every brand of combination high tingle and high bronzer for over 15 years and this one&#x27;s the hottest and darkest, with no orange color, at the cheapest price on the market at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>this tanning lotion got super dark super fast and love the tingle and the hotness!</li>
            <li>But newbies really should start with a warming lotion or a mild tingle.</li>
            <li>I am surprised this product has not killed someone to be honest.</li>
            <li>really i.ncreases your tan quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s HOT, it&#x27;s dark and it smells good.</li>
            <li>am giving Insanley black 5 stars because it is a good tingle</li>
            <li>but overall I got a great price on amazon, compared to the 40 bucks my tanning salon wanted for the same thing.</li>
            <li>Tanning results with this product are great, but the tingle can be best described as the name &#x27; Insanely&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used paint it black from the line before and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I would probably torture myself with&lt;br /&gt;the tingling sting to obtain the results so quickly and very efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I GOT SOOOO DARK VERY QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li>I was using a lower level tanning bed and when I went back to the salon I normally go to - really great bulbs and higher levels - I INSTANTLY noticed a difference after tanning.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews before buying I saw alot of people refer to this product as very intense.</li>
            <li>Not literally, but its a very intense burning sensation for about and hour when you use it.</li>
            <li>It has a very intense burning sensation the minute you put it on.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for the job this lotion does.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>The delivery time is very fast.</li>
            <li>but, if i take a day or two off i find that my color fades very fast.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a must try for anyone who wants quick results and can take the heat :-)</li>
            <li>I love the fact that i can get so dark so quick!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure people will complain about the burning sensation and the red skin, but I think that&#x27;s just par for the course with this product.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time yesterday during my lunch break..</li>
            <li>it definitely has the tingle factor, but I love tingle.</li>
            <li>so this happen to be my first pick.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li>Well just felt tingly with the first 15 mins on.</li>
            <li>the first time i used this i&#x27;m not going to lie</li>
            <li>I have used many different tanning lotions over the years and have NEVER had anything that BURNS like this one does.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I burnt.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it i also used it with a lotion with more bronzer in it.</li>
            <li>I was pretty tan before I used this.  </li>
            <li>I tried it once..too hot for me.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when you know it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li>I received my lotion on Saturday which was also my first time to use it.  </li>
            <li>Was not sure of it with the mixed reviews but this stuff is AWESOME!!!!!!.</li>
            <li>I was more red than a cherry, ahha.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this lotion.</li>
            <li>It tingles at first, but then goes away.</li>
            <li>I feel like the redness gives my stubborn ski a more lasting result.  </li>
            <li>The tingle begins to decrease after the first week or so of use.</li>
            <li>If the first burning sensation didn&#x27;t warn you, then i pray that this will.</li>
            <li>i used this tanning for the first time about two days ago.</li>
            <li>I put it on and by the time I was 10 mins into tanning, I became bumpy and pretty itchy.</li>
            <li>my whole body swelled, came home and took shower and had to apply benadry!</li>
            <li>The tingling sensation the lotion has made me really hot while in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I needed some bronzer for the tanning bed, however, because they didn&#x27;t advertise that it is REALLY REALLY HOT</li>
            <li>so if you don&#x27;t like it hot</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I noticed that it made me smell \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; after I got out.  </li>
            <li>When I put this on I thought Ghost peppers were the first ingredient.</li>
            <li>I bought it with higher expectatations.</li>
            <li>Scared me with the hot burning pain, rash, and irregular tan marks.</li>
            <li>so this is more likely the cause</li>
            <li>I have read lots of reviews that had the same reaction I should have read more before I purchased.</li>
            <li>This lotion worked really well for me!</li>
            <li>One more thing is that if you do not rub this in properly then your going to have streaks.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>My arms started tingling first, then my legs and stomach.</li>
            <li>tanner after the first application.  </li>
            <li>Intense burn!</li>
            <li>Then it was very bad/Hot! &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li>This was my first tingle product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>is, I put on a Level 10 tingle lotion first while at home then put this on at the salon.</li>
            <li>expectations of the tingle factor based off the reviews was higher.</li>
            <li>I love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>like I did when I first started using it..  </li>
            <li>The tingle is def hot</li>
            <li>and when I use it, it&#x27;s not sooo Hot</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Hope you like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li>I have to say I like this lotion, it just wasn&#x27;t as hot as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I threw away this product after my first use.</li>
            <li>I tried it out the first night it showed up while sitting at home</li>
            <li>it gets HOT if you can stand it.</li>
            <li>Too much bronzer!</li>
            <li>More than when I got back from Cancun.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like getting a spray tan than actually tanning.</li>
            <li>It gets hot in the bed, but not burning your arm off hot.</li>
            <li>I surely looked darker after coming out of the tanning bed, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because of my body turning deep red from the chemical reaction it was causing.</li>
            <li>If you decide to use it for the first time be cautious.</li>
            <li>I love the deep soultry brown results from this lotion.</li>
            <li>this lotion is exactly what it says it is........</li>
            <li>so if you dont like hot then its not for you</li>
            <li>i wouldnt use it at first if you cant stand the heat.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Oh well... I guess you really do get what you pay for these days!  </li>
            <li>Spot-test it on yourself first before you tan if you are like me and are not used to tingly lotions.  </li>
            <li>Well I did and it was hot at first, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather pay more for something that actually does work!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>and this lotion definitely helped! :)</li>
            <li>It stimulates with a hot sensation and the bronzer is immediate so you can see a difference within an hour.  </li>
            <li>Most recently I was using Snooki Hot Bronzer.</li>
            <li>love this product &amp; price, I have used this product  for the last three years 5 star all the way</li>
            <li>My hole body burned for about three hours and stayed red for about three more.</li>
            <li>Im an avid tanner</li>
            <li>It did get HOT</li>
            <li>Just opened and used for the first time, they talk about the tingle in the write-up</li>
            <li>Bought this on a whim and tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li>I love trying different tanning lotions...</li>
            <li>I love mixing lotions together when you feel you just can&#x27;t reach that next level...</li>
            <li>but there was a Tingle for the first 2days and no none at all</li>
            <li>I like the lotion since it gets so hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very big in Crossfit &amp; love to run 3-10 miles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a tad scared to put this all over my body and lay in a hot tanning bed.</li>
            <li>but the first time i use it in a while i can litteraly hear my heart beating and feel my skin pulsing</li>
            <li>and personally I thought it was okay....</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how pretty &amp; deep my tan is.  </li>
            <li>1st time i used itwas HOT.</li>
            <li>and I gave 5 stars the first time.</li>
            <li>I moved up to a higher tingle</li>
            <li>i was really hot, after  about eight minutes</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion is the bomb, a hot bomb.  </li>
            <li>Save them for next summer when you may not be able to find it.</li>
            <li>WARNING: if you cannot handle stinging &amp; tingling (like Caspian in hot peppers) on your skin,&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li>I layed outdoors the first time..</li>
            <li>hot though(sweated</li>
            <li>And to the person crying about looking like an oompa loompa, umm that sounds like a good tingle to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many MANY lotions and spent top dollar for LESS results than what this stuff gave me in just 2 uses.</li>
            <li>LOL, if you read all the reviews that give this one or two stars you might find that most of them were just inexperienced users or just plain irresponsible users.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>thought the lotion was great but was very hott gave my at least 2 shades the first time using it will be buying again</li>
            <li>a little too much tingle but good</li>
            <li>and I also worked at a salon where we got to try all the new lotions, and older lotions for free.</li>
            <li>My entire body was bright red even in places I didn&#x27;t apply (face &amp; bloodshot eyes).</li>
            <li>It turns your skin RED like bright, beet red before you even get into the sun/bed or anything at all</li>
            <li>I immediately dropped everything and got in the shower to get this @#$ off, but the water only seemed to piss it off more, so the itching spread from my legs, to my whole body.</li>
            <li>and  I was very pleased that the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; sensation was not super intense for me</li>
            <li>Love the tingle and makes you super dark.</li>
            <li>I looked really burnt at first</li>
            <li>I use it for outside tanning works great got dark in the first 15 minutes</li>
            <li>I really do like this lotion I was darker after the first visit.</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work fast!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get UBER hot, though; I felt very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this lotion but only to those of yall who tan on a regular basis and are fully aware of what a tingle lotion does because this is by far the best!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a nice dark brown tan with no hints of orange.</li>
            <li>It is not bad at all; however, do not put it on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I mean amazing!</li>
            <li>I have been using black storm and really liked it</li>
            <li>It spreads easy, like a regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth &amp; slick the texture is.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this and expect not to feel the warm, slight burn/tingle.  </li>
            <li>The tingle is somewhat strong especially on your face</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;orange\\&quot; palms, but even with only touching her with my hands, she developed huge red spots on her arms almost right away.  </li>
            <li>But I do hit a plateau after a certain point....</li>
            <li>It will not leave you orange and certainly will not dissapoint you.</li>
            <li>and I stayed warm for a little while</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to anybody who can tolerate their skin feeling a little inflamed and enjoys a nice fast tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>They tan fantasticly without intense facial pain.</li>
            <li>Have to watch how much you use and</li>
            <li>so I would recommend this to anyone to wants to kick their tanning up a notch.</li>
            <li>People that like an intense tingle lotion, I would try something else.</li>
            <li>2 to 5 times is all you really need.</li>
            <li>It tingled the whole time I was in the bed</li>
            <li>If you like tingles, I would HIGHLY recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>It does just what it says works very well dont use too much because u do feel the burning and tingling sensations...</li>
            <li>I am a person who wants to look like I just went tanning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really intense but it works very well.</li>
            <li>It goes on very sheer and smooth</li>
            <li>This tanning lotion really works.</li>
            <li>But who cares really.</li>
            <li>I have used bombshell from designer skin which is also a tingle and that lotion doesn&#x27;t even come close to how much this stuff tingles.</li>
            <li>I put it on and got really nausiated.</li>
            <li>I got dressed, picked up my bag, and was ready to walk out the door.</li>
            <li>and I was really looking foward to the bronze skin.</li>
            <li>The tingle is very neat  and groovey.</li>
            <li>This lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li>Intense burn for an hour or so after tanning</li>
            <li>but it really brings out the melanin in your skin.</li>
            <li>I really felt like my heart was going to explode</li>
            <li>my whole body was swelled up not to mention the PAIN</li>
            <li>The tingle wasn&#x27;t intense or too much.</li>
            <li>I DO really like this lotion</li>
            <li>no tingle really except on my face.</li>
            <li>You should really test this out on an area of your body before you go to tan.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about.  </li>
            <li>So I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>That sums this up Really...</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT doesn&#x27;t tingle that much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and You can really see it.</li>
            <li>or I might just mix it in With some REAL TINGLE samples from the salon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a tingler but doesn&#x27;t tingle much.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re skin orange if you use It too much.</li>
            <li>It really just depends on your skin.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s supposed to tingle, but I felt absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>It smells spicy if you know what i&#x27;m talking about haha.</li>
            <li>I really like the color I have gotten using this product.</li>
            <li>I recently tried a light tingle packet at my tanning salon....</li>
            <li>Truly intense.</li>
            <li>This product has a reddening agent and a tingle enhancer that is very severe.</li>
            <li>my advice is to try something else because this embodies extremly intense burning sensation.</li>
            <li>It was cheap and had some mixed reviews</li>
            <li>I had to take so much allergy medicine to try to stop the intense itching.  </li>
            <li>I am very please.</li>
            <li>Recieved it very quicly after my order was placed .</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>This has done really well.</li>
            <li>I do tan very well with it</li>
            <li>I tanned this morning, and now, getting ready for bed</li>
            <li>so the tingle isn&#x27;t so intense.</li>
            <li>, you might aswell rub a ghost pepper on yourself, can&#x27;t even wash it off very well.</li>
            <li>About 3 minutes in my heart was racing so fast that I thought I was going to pass out.  </li>
            <li>started burning my eyes and was not tolerable, my arms were better but not much.</li>
            <li>Definitely do a test patch on a more sensitive area before you commit to putting it in your whole body.</li>
            <li>a lot of tingle , too much for me.</li>
            <li>This lotion has some heat, but I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, if I  did get the real deal Millenium</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>But no so much now I guess I got use to it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for tingle much</li>
            <li>A real deal.</li>
            <li>I was in so much tingly pain all over.</li>
            <li>it made me feel like I was burning/on fire the whole 12 min in tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok, not great not horrible..</li>
            <li>4 1/2 hours later I am a nice red burned color</li>
            <li>It got my legs super dark and didn&#x27;t stain my knees when I applied it lightly.</li>
            <li>I am new to this tanning thing and this is the first product I used.</li>
            <li>I previously used the Black Storm lotion and liked it a lot, but I wanted something that would give me more color</li>
            <li>Works very well dark after 1st tan it does turn you bright red but</li>
            <li>I am really glad I read other reviews before I used it</li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t hot enough for my skin to break that barrier and take me into a darker level, and if I use it regularly now, I will have more of an orange hue -</li>
            <li>please be sure and read the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li>This lotion is intensely hot tingle with just the right bronzes mixed in.</li>
            <li>The results look better than other high end lotions I have used, for four times the price.</li>
            <li>I would rather pay full price for the product and actually have it work</li>
            <li>this spreads pretty far for a lotion.</li>
            <li>It was my impression, that a 100Xs dark tanning bronzer is supposed to give you more darkness than a 50 Xs bronzer?  </li>
            <li>Its a whole new level of tan,  </li>
            <li>but this stuff has taken me to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li>Ive paid more than that for alot less results.</li>
            <li>A slight downside is that it does seem to include a somewhat potent bronzer, so wash your hands well as soon as you can</li>
            <li>Out of control was pretty hot, but this stuff is definitely hotter.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re supposed to be RED, the longer the better and that the deeper your color will be later.</li>
            <li>It definitely will step up your tan quickly.</li>
            <li>and I love to use it once I have a great base tan.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra $10 at your local salon for a better product.</li>
            <li>The tingle is not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li>it when I first used it a week ago &amp; now it just turns my skin kind of red for a little while, maybe I&#x27;m just used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didnt even make it out of my bedroom before my whole body was on complete fire!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that it didn&#x27;t take the tanning bed to activate the lotion as my legs were on fire before I even got in the room!  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this one to anyone, even if you&#x27;re a fan of high tingles and bronzers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to people who arent fair-skinned</li>
            <li>but have never used any of these high quality tanners.</li>
            <li>Highly discourage purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I used a high pressure level 4 bed with a max time of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>i also have a difficult time with my legs and after one use they had a nice golden tan!</li>
            <li>First if all it&#x27;s very hot, which I expected, but it&#x27;s day 6</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a little more out of this product.</li>
            <li>Im going to use it a little longer to see if it works better.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve used this for a week now because my view has changed a little.</li>
            <li>It actually is a little more bronzer than tingle in my opinion</li>
            <li>You would definitely pay a pretty penny for this in a salon!</li>
            <li>The tingle kicks in right away, is super intense and last for a long time.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin feeling really frangrant and soft</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but wherever you put this, get ready for a burning and reddening to occur.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that when i try it again, I will have better results, because now, I actually have a good base tan and am not getting red at all when tanning.</li>
            <li>i have never bought tanning lotion online before, i normally buy it at the tanning salon and thought i could save a couple bucks.</li>
            <li>The lotion really does make your skin RED and makes you feel like you are on fire when you use it for the first time</li>
            <li>every place where the lotion is not applied is completely normal.</li>
            <li>I have done some further research on this lotion as so many people experience unexplained itching and what I found in my case is that this lotion contains walnuts and I have nut allergies</li>
            <li>The chair that I sat in also absorbed this product which transferred to someone else&#x27;s skin upon sitting in the chair on the same day.</li>
            <li>The tanning salon that I go to wants $110 for the exact same bottle!</li>
            <li>After a few times of use and a bit getting used to, I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li>I use this to go beyond a normal tan.  </li>
            <li>I like the instant color is apparent, and the tingle is intense and fades into a dark lasting tan great</li>
            <li>A little on the intense side, so if your not use to a strong tingle or bronzer</li>
            <li>If you like tingle plus bronzing lotion, you&#x27;ll love insanely black!  </li>
            <li>I tan easily, and I like tingle, this left me red and burning for hrs after</li>
            <li>5 min later my hand was very RED and had a strong burning sensation.</li>
            <li>Obviously my self confidence is through the roof right now.</li>
            <li>I think my face is the only part of my body that isn&#x27;t itchy/burnt feeling right now.  </li>
            <li>My skin right now is very red, and itchy.</li>
            <li>but right now im seeing I actually got darker..</li>
            <li>makes your skin feel like it is on fire and turns you scolding red right after you put it on before you even catch any sun rays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s rare first of all (in response to other reviews) that you won&#x27;t smell somewhat like a tanning bed after using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li>this is the third time ive used a tingle lotion although ive tanned a lot.this lotion is super hot and definetly not for someone who doesnt prefer the hot and tingly sensation.on the other hand if you do this lotion</li>
            <li>I get really dark after using it, like a deep red that a few hours later is a nice Brown tone, I also use after bronzer when I get out of the bed, but the tingle is almost to much to handle, feels insanely hot after applying tan extender, my clothes almost hurt my skin when I am putting my clothes back on, I don&#x27;t recommend this unless you are really into tingle lotions that really do tingle, compared to Swedish beauty tingle, this is way more intense</li>
            <li>so it gets pretty hot the first few times you use it then</li>
            <li>Wow, first Time used and super tan, however my body is still burning especially on my legs since yesterday, i did a 10 min stand up tanning bed, product definitely works,  </li>
            <li>I bought this one because I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>(I live across the street)</li>
            <li>live in MN</li>
            <li>you get super red and hot after but my tan is fabulous after only using a week and a half</li>
            <li>Than I ordered smoke I loved that got dark in one tan than sn o o k i and now insanely black.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It Black was fine, no sensation...</li>
            <li>The tingle in it was definitely noticeable that first time, (I tanned for 20 minutes), but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t start to burn until about 10 minutes into my session.  </li>
            <li>i hadn&#x27;t tanned in over a month and the first day i went back</li>
            <li>cuz i was so red and hot</li>
            <li>This is the first tanning lotion product where it doesn&#x27;t make me look totally red instead of bronze.  </li>
            <li>I felt as if my entire body had been dipped in hot wax.</li>
            <li>I had been tanning for about a month when I first got this (from never being in the sun before) and had only used a sample packet of a tingle lotion before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after that first use and the redness faded i definitely turned a darker shade than i was.</li>
            <li>but otherwise i completely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li>Not as hot as people say it is, but then again IMA big tingle fan.</li>
            <li>on skin first before using in actual tanning.</li>
            <li>I dont want to even think about how it would be if I had actually tanned first.</li>
            <li>Chemical burns are similar to first degree burns except they don&#x27;t always hurt.  </li>
            <li>If you like a HOT TINGLE,this IS the one and only!!!</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for one hot tingle definitely try this.</li>
            <li>ended up with light and dark spots on my legs.</li>
            <li>Wow, I was scared to try this lotion after what everyone wrote!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it stained my hands orange for a solid three days</li>
            <li>I would not feel hot but again, would turn red.</li>
            <li>i usually do not buy the tingles as i dont like the burning feeling.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been tanning in three months and this was my first session back.</li>
            <li>Just a little too strong smelling for me</li>
            <li>Its does get hot but the color is WELL worth a little bit of heat in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>makes you very dark very quickly.</li>
            <li>:) it would be VERY difficult for me to find a better lotion..</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product if you are looking for a deep dark tan :)</li>
            <li>Skin is a little red right after but turns into great color a few hours later.</li>
            <li>Make sure u read further down.....</li>
            <li>and it got very hot, as i expected after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li>It did get a little red right after I finished tanning but not bad at all...</li>
            <li>It was a better deal than just buying Solid Black.  </li>
            <li>Just ok, I prefer the Solid Black</li>
            <li>The only thing I would worry about is if you are not careful with application and put too much in one area the bronzer will stain and it looks almost like you used a fake sunless tanning lotion, but if you apply it evenly the results are great.</li>
            <li>After this whole mess, I read the reviews and many other people said the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>And as long as you rotate it every other time it doesn&#x27;t seem overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Places like the backs of your arms or inner thighs can sting more than less sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>Turns out this product mixed with certain products tanning bed cleaning products cause this reaction.  </li>
            <li>It gives a light tingle and warmth and a little redness</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t mind the smell of other lotions after getting out of the tanning bed but this one made me want to shower right away.</li>
            <li>A little too HOT for me !!</li>
            <li>if I wanna go that much but this lotion will get u dark the first time u use it, u will itch when u get out the tanning bed and be blochy</li>
            <li>Even with that, my gym only allows 10 minute tanning sessions at a time in moderately intense stand-up beds.</li>
            <li>Actually threw it out and did not use it since the smell was too much.</li>
            <li>I would only use thos once and awhile because the burning was almost unbearable but it did really improve my tan...</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would say to use caution with this product.</li>
            <li>and she was already commenting on how tan I am and when I got back after using this she even couldn&#x27;t believe how much darker I was.</li>
            <li>They feel like a very itchy sunburn while in the bed and until I wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li>i felt the intense tingle almost instantly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;One day after tanning, my 5-year old daughter came up and gave me a hug.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a frequent tanner, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I got it</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and wow did it get be colored.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I have used it once so far, I switch up between tingles and bronzers and I am noticeably darker after one session with this.</li>
            <li>The product states it provides the ultimate tan with a tingling sensation, but it really means your body will feel like it&#x27;s on FIRE.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t drive home fast enough to try to wash this stuff off.  </li>
            <li>Obviously, there is something else in this lotions formulation that really doesn&#x27;t work too well for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Well, I got this lotion because I like tingle and in some other reviews people said it was very hot.</li>
            <li>In other reviews it states that it was very hot and don&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li>I will be buying my lotion directly from the tanning salon from now on.</li>
            <li>If you have extremely sensitive skin, this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have SENSITIVE skin, at all what so ever DO NOT USE IT.</li>
            <li>I would not try this lotion on or near the face/eyes.</li>
            <li>Not for the sensitive.</li>
            <li>This is my second pair of the minimus style I really like them.</li>
            <li>I payed for an intense tingle, and that is definitely what I got!!  </li>
            <li>It made my skin red but didnt really tan me all that well.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but after using it a few more times, I still had the same results.</li>
            <li>So forget even going out in public right after tanning with this lotion unless you want people to think you just made it back from a trip to the surface of the sun itself.</li>
            <li>It definitely makes your skin turn red right away</li>
            <li>To me, Insanely Black isn&#x27;t really that hot.  </li>
            <li>It crept up slowly at first, the feeling like my skin was dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>This makes you dark really quick.</li>
            <li>even for advanced tanners the first time is a little rough.</li>
            <li>I was somewhat red for several hours after tanning, but the red eventually faded and I have a nice dark brown now.</li>
            <li>but when i was an extra dark factor in my color i turn to it ..just not as a regular lotion :) &amp; for the price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li>When we used it last night in the tanning bed - I felt more than a tingle  - I got burnt and tingled for most of the night -- very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>its a HIGH tingle &amp; as do other high tingles do it leaves u itchy after which is NORMAL.</li>
            <li>After looking at several different tanning lotions, I decided to purchase Insanely Black, and I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Insanely Black will quickly make you change your outlook</li>
            <li>/&gt;It just isn&#x27;t hot enough for me - as every person&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>It was the exact same symptoms 4 hours later.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty unfair that people who dont know what they are messing with give great products like this poor rating when they do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I love tingle lotions, but I find that very few actually give me any tingling sensation, or redness.</li>
            <li>I am taken back how strong the tingle factor is here... and it sells for less then $20, I have tried all the other brands and tingles at higher prices and nothing comapares to this product..</li>
            <li>It is definitely HOT, first time tingle user or the very pale should probably start with something weaker.</li>
            <li>It also spreads fast, thorough and lasts long.</li>
            <li>She applied normal amounts to cover skin until it starting hurting her.  </li>
            <li>It got me tan but not dark.</li>
            <li>It took me 4 benadryl and 5 hours later before I began feeling normal.</li>
            <li>a tingle lotion was the first time I used one, which was years ago &amp; it was Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond T2.</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li>After an hour in a cool shower and trying to remove with a few washes and make up remover</li>
            <li>Makes you super dark!</li>
            <li>it gets you super dark!</li>
            <li>so it took hours for my skin to calm down.  </li>
            <li>so my skin is tough enough for this kind of lotion.</li>
            <li>The only down side that it does dry my skin out if I use it more than 3 times in a row.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m somewhat new to the world of tanning and tanning accelerators, but this stuff definitely makes you darker!!!</li>
            <li>i also live three blocks from my tanning salon and walk there and back in the heat</li>
            <li>I just need to try a new brand for a time and then go back.  </li>
            <li>Now this next and final portion must be stated with a very grave warning.</li>
            <li>But if you can handle it insanely black is well worth it.</li>
            <li>And it certainly doesn&#x27;t turn you insanely black very quick, other than your hands due to the high bronzer content</li>
            <li>I can barely make it through my 15 minute session!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty extreme.</li>
            <li>the next day i went for 12 minutes using this and WOW!</li>
            <li>First off be careful maybe use latex gloves when applying!  </li>
            <li>Cuz everyone here is claiming it burned and Tingled majorly.</li>
            <li>I have bought other products that have a higher x&#x27;s and they do not work.</li>
            <li>Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
            <li>First of all i must state that i have tanned several years and that i am not new to it.</li>
            <li>I took some photographs (they did not turn out very well to show the DISTINCT contrast) but you can see there is white and red from where I missed a few spots with the lotion on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the red tints tingles give, but some brands, such as cherry bomb, the red fades away after a few hours.</li>
            <li>I am not pale by any means, my father is half Italian, and I tan very easily, rarely burn.</li>
            <li>I have used several different lotions through out that time and they all gave me decent color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch though lol</li>
            <li>..........be sure to give your lotion time to work, it continues to work even after you get out of the tanning bed, wait to shower at least 3 hours, some people cannot handle the prickly feeling that long, but showering immediately after a session stops the process of lotions that keep tanning after you leave the tanning bed....</li>
            <li>I will say that I barely put any on my face</li>
            <li>next morning, the redness is always completely gone</li>
            <li>i just warn that after tanning avoid direct physical contact with anyone until you have showered.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews about the \\&quot;tingle,\\&quot; and prepared myself for the screaming intense pain i expected.</li>
            <li>The name is a Complete opposite of what the product does.</li>
            <li>i was pretty dark before i started to use this lotion and it still set me on fire a bit .</li>
            <li>Maybe my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough</li>
            <li>The company said it is only sold in salons and direct.  </li>
            <li>So I was surprised it turned so red.  </li>
            <li>Since I have been using this lotion I have completely lost my tan and have not only had to purchase another lotion but start my tanning process all over again.  </li>
            <li>Makes you dark with first use.</li>
            <li>As far as any tan coloration after the red wore off, I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all.  </li>
            <li>It DIDN&#x27;T try my skin out, you can definitely feel the soft silicone&#x27;s that it has.</li>
            <li>my skin was extremly red and sensitive afterwards i did get a darker tan</li>
            <li>, this lotion is by far the hottest (tingle) and would drive someone nuts if they never used it before, but with all my lotions, i have found that i always seem to migrate back to this one because i know that it works...</li>
            <li>This product takes my tan to the next level, But do a patch test if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I did get really dark the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I had been tanning for about 2 weeks with a pretty good bronzer to build up a base tan and decided I wanted to kick it up a notch.</li>
            <li>What I had before I used this lotion was a pretty good base from tanning every two days for two months.</li>
            <li>cause some of the times it made my hands a little orange and didn&#x27;t wash off right away.  </li>
            <li>I do suggest when you use it for the first time cut your tanning min down, I tan for 12 min in the tanning bed and cut it to 5 min this helped to get use to the lotion.</li>
            <li>At first I just thought that I was coming down with something</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin though and am pretty pale when I haven&#x27;t been tanning.</li>
            <li>I did a spot test when I first got it to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t burn me bad, and all I got to say is WOW!</li>
            <li>since it seemed to be a neat looking bidy by the name and description along with it being a well known company however, I will never purchase another product made by this company ever again as long as I live.</li>
            <li>Today was the first day i tried insanely black.</li>
            <li>It has me tan so much faster than any other lotions that I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>Anyways i did not think it was extremely intense probably because I am used to using extreme tingle</li>
            <li>Even when I diluted it with other lotions it still was fairly intense.</li>
            <li>But my tan is getting darker much quicker than with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>other than this it worked very well.</li>
            <li>It burned my skin after tanning for a minute, I was in tears and it took a few hours before my skin went back to normal and the intense pain went away.</li>
            <li>I used this product twice thinking it would even out, it&#x27;s very orange and leaves you completely blotchy and uneven ..</li>
            <li>Just a warning to anyone that is not accustomed to anything that tingles , use a little first.</li>
            <li>It really makes you dark.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know of any REAL 100Xs dark tanning?  </li>
            <li>so if tingle doesn&#x27;t bother you or you really wanna get dark</li>
            <li>Other than the intense allergic reaction, the only &amp;#34;tan/orange&amp;#34</li>
            <li>After enough use, you barely feel the tingle anymore.</li>
            <li>Then afterwards I was red all over, I was itchy all over and for about a week my skin was super dry and slightly itchy.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t mind the odor, but for some reason after a few uses I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I applied it to my legs and was distracted for a few minutes and then continued applying it to the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is only for those who are not only serious tanners, but also like lotions that have a strong tingle factor in them.</li>
            <li>Although it did take my tan to the next level, I&#x27;m not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I usually have no problems with the Swedish Beauty Green Tease tingle and the Swedish Beauty Stunning tingle lotions.  </li>
            <li>only got the tingle the first few sessions ?</li>
            <li>I get a decent redness from it, but not as red as other tingles i have used.</li>
            <li>this tingle lotion stung so bad i was not able to tan for more then 3 minutes, and normally i tan for the full 20.</li>
            <li>Why is this not the case with this particular 100 times dark bronzer?  </li>
            <li>I still felt a little burnt after but not as much.</li>
            <li>(60x is not too much or too little for me</li>
            <li>Only need to use a small amount, very intense Tanning Lotion.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Very warm lotion makes you feel like you are being pricked by something.</li>
            <li> so it was very warm in the car.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> The results are amazing!  </li>
            <li> For the price the results are amazing!</li>
            <li> Works amazing!</li>
            <li> I made sure to rub it in well and wiped my hands as best</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and oils to get the perfect tan.  </li>
            <li> I used it and experienced no tingle, as I now have a good tan already.  </li>
            <li> Best lotion that I ever users, I have managed tanning salons for years and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> but thats what brings out the awesome darkness in my skin:-)....</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it and the tingle is great!  </li>
            <li> and I get the most perfect color with it!</li>
            <li> had a pleasant smell that reminded me of starburst candy.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> I.still have a beautiful warm tint to my tan.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased I was able to find it again at a great price!</li>
            <li> I tan very easy and this worked wonders for my tan!</li>
            <li> I was really happy when, after 15 minutes on the tanning bed, my skin felt good and the color was amazing.</li>
            <li> I loved the color I got from this.  </li>
            <li> It smells good.</li>
            <li> and i loved it.</li>
            <li> The tingle lasts a good while--but what tingle doesn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> The tingle isn&#x27;t that good</li>
            <li> I was looking for something with a good tingle but also with bronzer.</li>
            <li> I can see that the bronzers did give me good color.</li>
            <li> Now with that being said i told myself it must be that burning that gives me the good tan.</li>
            <li> great color nice and brown instead of an orange.</li>
            <li> No steaks, smells good, tingle and burning sensation.</li>
            <li> The smell will linger all day and does not smell good.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> , it was really a good price, and offered both a bronzer and tingle.  </li>
            <li> its always good to switch up ur lotions</li>
            <li> The smell is good as well even after the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT</li>
            <li> It smells good too.</li>
            <li> all n all good lotion</li>
            <li> I purchased this tingle lotion, as I like a good tingle from time to time.</li>
            <li> It will soak in a good tan once you get through the tingle of it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and it works great.</li>
            <li> but i loved it</li>
            <li> Good lotion.</li>
            <li> Smells good too which</li>
            <li> Works good burns when firsr put on</li>
            <li> good texture, and comes in an easy-to-dispense bottle.  </li>
            <li> and it has good bronzers in it to boost color.</li>
            <li> I thought my wife was exaggerating because she had fair skin, but when I tried it, I had a similiar feeling.  </li>
            <li> Plus the heat/tingle stays with you for some time (feels good in Minnesota winters</li>
            <li> I have a good tan already and this product keeps increasing the color.</li>
            <li> IT WORK&#x27;S WELL FOR ME, IT&#x27;S JUSK INSANELY GOOD...</li>
            <li> For the price, it is good though.</li>
            <li> have olive skin and tan fairly well, and I have used tingle products before.</li>
            <li> It smells good too tho.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a good lotion</li>
            <li> And it a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Good results.</li>
            <li> I would say rotton is a good name for thief lotion.</li>
            <li> After 4-5 uses I had a really good tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I have not purchased this.</li>
            <li> but it made my skin feel like it was burning off and the skin did not react really good to it</li>
            <li> Has a good smell for a man&#x27;s tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is soooo good</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it and we used up two bottles this summer.  </li>
            <li> is awesome and you get good results after one use.i wouldnt put it on your face unless you are familiar with what that feels</li>
            <li> Immediately after applying, it&#x27;s best if you can clean your hands with something just like you would with a sunless tanning product.</li>
            <li> It also evened out my skin and hubby noticed that it gave my skin a beautiful glow on top of being so brown...</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion has a great smell to it, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with my color.  </li>
            <li> It works great, I love this product.  </li>

            <li> This lotion is amazing.</li>
            <li> results are amazing.</li>
            <li> &amp; i see amazing results as soon as i get out of the tanning bed,</li>
            <li> but it gives amazing results.</li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it is nothing amazing.</li>
            <li> and I get an amazing tan</li>
            <li> The smell is nice,  not overbearing at all</li>
            <li> Yes it does get warm</li>
            <li> The smell before hand is nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of smells like something orange.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m tanning fast and evenly and it looks great!  </li>
            <li> Unless you like that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> It just got really warm.</li>
            <li> She is much more fair than I am, and I can tell you that this product does not work on our skin colors.  </li>
            <li> Love the tingle, smells insanely good.  </li>
            <li> but i really liked it</li>
            <li> Honest review here....</li>
            <li> Well..... being honest here....</li>
            <li> It makes your skin really warm</li>
            <li> this is  not for you, but if you like that nice warm massage like feeling of a warming lotion this is for you.</li>
            <li> While the tingle and the bronzer are good, I used it a couple more</li>
            <li> Well it is warm out and</li>
            <li> The lotion has to be causing some kind of allergic reaction in the skin to create this redness.</li>
            <li> I liked the pain but would be lying if said I wasn&#x27;t relieved to get in the shower and wash it</li>
            <li> you will feel a warm tingling sensation,  no</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good TINGLE!!</li>
            <li> I have had tanning bed of my own since in the 1990.  </li>
            <li> This tanner has a nice tingle and does work for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, almost like fruit loops.</li>
            <li> I liked it....</li>
            <li> and Ive liked the quality of what I used before in this line.</li>
            <li> Nice and tingly.</li>
            <li> Does give me a nice color after two sessions.</li>
            <li> and I felt like I would spontaneously combust at any moment.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> Also you must apply perfectly even or else some spots will be much darker than others</li>
            <li> The tingle was indeed warm, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> and I must say I liked the heat.</li>
            <li> Oh, I read many of the comments stating that the millennium 100 times darker bronzer smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave the afterburn smell?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say that I am an intermediate tanner, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tingle and bronzing products to see what kind of results they produce.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this lotion because of all the great reviews that I had read.  </li>
            <li> Greatest indoor tanning lotion I have ever used....have purchased this particular one 6 times and will continue to buy it...</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you incredible color and gives it to you fast!</li>
            <li> but i personally love the tingle lotions for the great results and i will purchase this product again!also VERY fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great</li>
            <li> I would buy this lotion again, and many more Millenium products!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff and will order more!  </li>
            <li> but I got great color results after my first use!</li>
            <li> and I am so very happy I chose this product instead of the other ones out there that are more costly!!</li>
            <li> this is the best by far</li>
            <li> The kind offered at my tanning bed works much better.</li>
            <li> i love this lotion , but i wouldnt suggest loving on your husband or kids</li>
            <li> I have used plenty of tingle lotions and I have to say this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this lotion again and again because it is by far the best tanning lotion</li>
            <li> The price is also amazing :-)</li>
            <li> lol I don&#x27;t know if that the right word for it  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I tan very easily and found that I got more color in two sessions without tanning lotion than I got in a week using this product.  </li>
            <li> This was a great deal and the delivery was very fast.  </li>
            <li> It work great the first 2 bottles</li>
            <li> Great bargain for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The tingle is really good, but not extreme.</li>
            <li> I will forever be a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li> I almost blacked out and got super dizzy !!  </li>
            <li> and it went on very smooth.</li>
            <li> i loved the dark color it gave me because i am fair skinned !!!</li>
            <li> I am very fair skinned and had been going to the tanning bed for nearly a month with no results.  </li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> and I will order this again in the future :D</li>
            <li> This formula sure does have a tingle-</li>
            <li> I love this tingle lotion.</li>
            <li> It was more of a 6 hour burning process rather than a tingle.</li>
            <li> My summer glow has arrived and I love it.</li>
            <li> , I know it did for me!!! :)</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I personally love tingle lotion</li>
            <li> as all tanning lotions you just have to make sure you rub it in well</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> Tingle lotions work better than anything else because they stimulate your blood to the surface and encourage melanin production in your skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, I will definitely be using this stuff again!</li>
            <li> Worked okay.</li>
            <li> Was OK but kinda watery...</li>
            <li> started feeling better.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy that I tried this product as a sample only.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it it arrived on time and it does the job</li>
            <li> I am an experienced tanner and was looking for something w/ tingle that tans fast...</li>
            <li> I knew I would not be able to stand laying in the tanning bed</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with...</li>
            <li> Which I love and that&#x27;s why I gave this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I used it again Sunday and noticed the tingle was a lot more tolerable</li>
            <li> LOVE IT....</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li> It is ok for a fill in lotion but doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I felt a tingling but it was not horrible, but I would not apply any more than I</li>
            <li> It did not help her with tanning any more than if she did not use product.  </li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this product, but probably used it too soon.</li>
            <li> All in all Im very happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li> but this is my favorite of the two...</li>
            <li> It also has bronzer in it which I love.</li>
            <li> the more you itched.</li>
            <li> Sincerely,  itdoesntmatter</li>
            <li> so I decided to try this Millenium lotion too, and I am sooo glad I did.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely be able to tell with this lotion</li>
            <li> after reading the product info and the many reviews, i decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> and i love the Millenium lotions</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I have just started to love tingle lotions because i feel like they create darker tans than just bronzers.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is okay, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin, and the reviews from others with the same skin type said it worked great for them.</li>
            <li> I got her out immediately, but the spots and redness had spread to most of her body.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love to tan with tingle lotion and this bottle has it.</li>
            <li> Given the reaction SO MANY PEOPLE seem to have had, I would be worried this could put a person into anaphylactic shock.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love it if someone at Amazon sent me something better or refunded my money.</li>
            <li> should have read the entire list of ingredients and been more diligent in my research as millenium lotions have always been excellent and i have never had an issue with any others .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love a tingle factor</li>
            <li> The tingle isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and goes away within an hour of washing it off.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE BRONZER</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion....</li>
            <li> Hv used this brand many times.</li>
            <li> So not useing any more</li>
            <li> I love tingle this lotion and all lotions with heat.</li>
            <li> Once I was able to get out of bed I passed out woke up in the floor.</li>
            <li> its not like most of them</li>
            <li> Love the tingle and got it on the day promised.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has been greater than I&#x27;d imagined it would be.  </li>
            <li> I do not know how this is safe or legal.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I was able to go to class.</li>
            <li> I love using tingle lotions because i love the feeling of the heat</li>
            <li> but there is a kick to it which i love.</li>
            <li> I gave the product away to someone of Hispanic descent and the product worked ok for them.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion and I&#x60;m</li>
            <li> but i think this is much better and the price is better.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this tanner...</li>
            <li> it works great and my tan is much deeper and it does not make me itch..</li>
            <li> LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li> I love the tingle</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> But it is one of the more stronger tingles I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m more used to the reaction it gives, who knows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel a bit better.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> so I have to make sure I wash my hands and let it sit on my skin after I tan.</li>
            <li> But I am in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> I am sure some love it</li>
            <li> Arrived on time as promised and definately love this lotion and will definately purchase from here again and again</li>
            <li> The one good thing I will say about this lotion is if you&#x27;re looking to sweat a few calories off this lotion is perfect for that...take a bottle of water, you&#x27;re going to be parched.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because you can&#x27;t find a better tingler lotion for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love that it works immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am Not that Satisfied From this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Millennium tanning products (bronzers, accelerators, tingle)</li>
            <li> it better than others).</li>
            <li> It has a great tingle sensation which I really like</li>
            <li> I truly love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I know most of you said dont put it on your face</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> becuae I really love this product is when I haven&#x27;t tanned in</li>
            <li> love love love love love</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but be prepared to feel the tingle.</li>
            <li> As a not so experienced tanner i found this products didn&#x27;t irritate my skin much</li>
            <li> I had to out it to the side till I can handle it better.</li>
            <li> Love the product</li>
            <li> so i have many lotions with and without tingle</li>
            <li> i love this tanning lotion you see immediate results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never tried one but decided to go nuts and to try this one because I am a fool for tanning.  :)</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t love the fragrance of this lotion.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love a tingle lotion</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product, fantastic price!</li>
            <li> but it is just saying that the lotion has a lot of bronzer in it that gets washed of more and more after every shower you take.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> The tingle is really intense, and the bronzer is a great color too</li>
            <li> Really love.</li>
            <li> But u better like the tingle factor.</li>
            <li> If you can take the pain, this is probably a great lotion, but I will not be ordering this product again because it&#x27;s way too intense.</li>
            <li> So this helps my sunbed tan look more like it came from laying by the pool instead of laying in a bed.</li>
            <li> Love that factor.</li>
            <li> And I dont know if its all in my head or not, but my skintone looks much more even now.</li>
            <li> i read the reviews and people were saying its ok.</li>
            <li> This does give me a more noticeable coloring.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used lotions that tingle many times before , and I have been tanning for years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought it 3 times now and can&#x27;t stay away :)</li>
            <li> Definitely the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I love the shoe.</li>
            <li> Most tingle tanning lotions makes spots on me but this one didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> MAKE SURE YOU RUB IT IN EVENLY</li>
            <li> but I had thought  that 100 times would be more potent than 50Xs?</li>
            <li> If you like tingle you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> I love a silicone based tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> They  feel better to the skin.  </li>
            <li> I was even asked to take a picture for a tanning salon billboard :)</li>
            <li> and I have used many</li>
            <li> Love this lotion..</li>
            <li> it was ok.</li>
            <li> I thought for sure I was having an allergic reaction and was going to need to go to the ER.</li>
            <li> This product is ok.</li>
            <li> I saw the warning, but wasn&#x27;t sure what it would do when applied.  </li>
            <li> but I made sure that I rubbed it in after that and had no more&lt;br /&gt;problems  </li>
            <li> is beyond many others.</li>
            <li> I have very sesitive skin and LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion  super quick tan, but do not use if tingle affects your skin.  </li>
            <li> great product and arrived super quick</li>
            <li> AND IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN FEEL HOT!!!</li>
            <li> so expect that when you first apply it !!!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique product.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel super hot after a good tan!</li>
            <li> I mix it with another high tingle lotion and it works great.</li>
            <li> For this price I would recommend it to everyone if you like tingles or if you were thinking of trying a tingle, this one is a pretty good one to start out with.</li>
            <li> It tingled pretty good</li>
            <li> and I got really good color the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself and it burned my skin pretty good.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s so many blood vessels in your face and a product this strong can rush those to the surface and that causes damage over time.</li>
            <li> Love this product did not give a strong tingling sensation that people have mentioned.  </li>
            <li> works very well just the smell as wasn&#x27;t pleasant as I had thought.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, though the tingle isn&#x27;t nearly as intense as some of these whiners make it sound.  </li>
            <li> Overall I will try another kind of tanning lotion until I am 100% happy.</li>
            <li> Warning, this is a very hot lotion, but the results are amazing, it also has a built in bronzer as well.</li>
            <li> I was nice and red when I got out though, and now I am turning a very nice brown.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you read the fine print.</li>
            <li> well make sure you read the fine print before purchasing.</li>
            <li> While I have been impressed with other products from this line, this one is OK.  </li>
            <li> But you can see very good results after only 4 uses</li>
            <li> i would recommend this for more advanced tanners or for someone who&#x27;s used tinglers before.</li>
            <li> On a lighter note- the Blackberry Citrus does smell fantastic :)</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> is a nice light brown color and smells like a sweet tart</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for changing you from just semi tan to a golden color in one use but it is really hot</li>
            <li> then I completely disagree with those people that state that it has a great smell before &amp; after, after one tanning bed session your skin is two times darker, and again maybe I am disillusioned</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone that is tanning that wants something that leaves a good color.</li>
            <li> and it had a extremly Intense burning sensation it did not feel good...</li>
            <li> be sure to check if your lotion keeps working after you tan, and shower accordingly, give yourself plenty of time to tan and shower before your get ready to go out!!!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this provider ,but most importantly this lotion.</li>
            <li> Other than that the lotion was great!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to even out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was in pain all night; this product does not wash off easily.  </li>
            <li> me, who tans easily and has no issues</li>
            <li> It is strong.</li>
            <li> it does have a really strong tingle..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that strong.</li>
            <li> I have used a tingle lotion before but this was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend that you use this on a level two bed.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> still this lotion to strong for me.  </li>
            <li> and it is kind of hot</li>
            <li> The tingle starts off kind of hot</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried..</li>
            <li> This is a great tingling lotion that isn&#x27;t too strong but still makes you super dark, the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I was several shades darker after the first time I used it, and I had even been using an excellent bronzer before I bought this lotion.  </li>
            <li> insanely black being THE BEST</li>
            <li> Its light and rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> Yes, my face felt like it was going to blow up,  but my body felt just fine.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to do a spot test first on alot of parts on your body. :)</li>
            <li> If you are new to tanning DO NOT use this lotion!!!!!</li>
            <li> so my skin doesn&#x27;t get too used to one kind, but this one definitely makes it into my top favs!</li>
            <li> I receieved my product quickly and have used it many times; the bronzer is amazing but this lotion dries out my skin so much</li>
            <li> I tan pretty very easily</li>
            <li> It is very hot!</li>
            <li> a little dissapointed becuase the reviews were raving of perfectly bronzed non ommpa loompa skin</li>
            <li> VERY hot tingler!</li>
            <li> Worked GREAT on me but as for my best friend it made her itch like crazy after tanning the itching didn&#x27;t go away and she had to go to the emergency room and get two shots</li>
            <li> and I have had great success with it, but if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After using this just twice I notice a huge difference.</li>
            <li> so I applied another light layer.</li>
            <li> I was really light and being out in the sun,</li>
            <li> This product came in just a few days and worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It reminded me of a mix between Nair and a cheap self tanning</li>
            <li> But for me to personally enjoy a tanning lotion, its gotta smell fabulous.</li>
            <li> this lotion tans fantasticly.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a fantastic tan from this product.</li>
            <li> I have experienced my entire head melting as if I stuck it in sulfuric acid!!!!</li>
            <li> However fantastic results after two twenty minute sessions.</li>
            <li> I ended up giving both bottles away for free.</li>
            <li> &amp; i hope you enjoy (:</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy feeling like your skin is on fire as soon as you put this stuff on then save your money.  </li>
            <li> STOP BEING CHEAP &amp;</li>
            <li> However, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth scent ( not overly fruity),&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li> the cheap ones i find are greasy and dont do anything</li>
            <li> So go get your tan on great for outside and inside!!!</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered this product because i read the great reveiws</li>
            <li> and my tan is fabulous.</li>
            <li> i do get very red after use and it fades into a great bronzed glow</li>
            <li> This product is by far the most INTENSE tingle I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> It did leave a good color and seemed to leave my skin soft.</li>
            <li> i thought i was going to die, the tingle is that intense but the more i&#x27;ve used this the more i&#x27;ve been getting used to it and can stand the feeling.</li>
            <li> Awesome tan!!!!!  However..... the intense tingle only exists on my face!!</li>
            <li> and i feel like this price range is as good as it can get as far as tanning goes.</li>
            <li> But after an hour the red hot wore off and after 3 hours i was sooo brown and it looked amazing!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product 120% for sure!</li>
            <li> This lotion has a very very slight tingle, it does have a wonderful smell though.</li>
            <li> I find it very relaxing!!!</li>
            <li> normally tanning is an enjoyable experience for me, most times i even take a nap in the tanning booth.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m telling you your results are so worth it!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s well worth the pain and the cost!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t decide if it was worth the pain!  </li>
            <li> Its powerful!</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 days I could see a significant improvement in my tan.  </li>
            <li> worth a try with this price though!</li>
            <li> This was my first tingle lotion and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m allergic to the lotion.</li>
            <li> After the first time, i did not even notice the tingle any more.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed, at all.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has scent that is honestly friendly for both genders, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product until I used it.</li>
            <li> But the tan is worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t relate it at all with the lotion... until I used it one more time.  </li>
            <li> Love the hot tingle factor.</li>
            <li> This tingle tanning lotion is the best, I haven&#x27;t bought anything else in the past 4 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the results of this product over a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> First bought this lotion from a salon, and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price again when I ran out, so turned to amazon</li>
            <li> it was too much for him,but other wise its good.</li>
            <li> but i think this one does a much better job of giving a nice brown glow and instant results!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used several tingles, and this is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> this lotion does working very well.the skin color after tanning is nice and golden.</li>
            <li> At this point i was anything but impressed by the lotion but thought nothing of it until later as i liked the color it gave me (a reddish dark color).</li>
            <li> it works great and it gives me a great deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> The red on my skin has turned to a very nice golden brown.</li>
            <li> nothing special..</li>
            <li> but right now I look TAN!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion, it is by far the most intense tingler I have ever used!!</li>
            <li> Also, smells amazing and leaves your skin super soft!</li>
            <li> could never hold a pretty golden tan like most..</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I&#x27;m done tanning, my skin is instantly bright red and splotchy anywhere I missed a spot.</li>
            <li> It DOES subside, but it feels great and sorta peppery when it is tanning</li>
            <li> The tingle factor leaves your skin bright red for 5-6 hours when tested in a patch area without entering the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> and it turns me bright red.</li>
            <li> My skin turned BRIGHT red, burned, itched, and raised up where the lotion had been put.</li>
            <li> Horrrrrible made my skin turn bright red and burn.</li>
            <li> The only good thing that I would have to say about this is i feel like it is getting me tanner.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the burning it gets fun after the first...3 or 4 times I&#x27;d say.</li>
            <li> Overall it seems to be good for the price $15.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even stand to stay in my tanning bed the full time with this on</li>
            <li> im a sucker for tingles and this is the best tingle I&#x27;ve ever used..</li>
            <li> or so.&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I love this product is because it contains DHA as its 5th ingredient.</li>
            <li> I was several levels darker, the colour is great, no orange tinge, a nice deep sunny looking tan.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because it really works.</li>
            <li> but once I got home took a cool shower</li>
            <li> but this is good too....stayed red for hours after i used it...</li>
            <li> The tingle lotion body shots by ed hardy has been my absolute favorite lotion ever and has gotten me the darkest out of any tanning lotion on the market that I have tried.</li>
            <li> so I sat infront of a fan to cool off.</li>
            <li> my skin was so red and sting my skin that cant be good</li>
            <li> If you do not rub in the lotion all the way you will notice streak lines, so it is worth it to blend in smoothly and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just wish the tingle was more intense.</li>
            <li> I tan warm naturally, and brown in beds.</li>
            <li> The tingle was more intense than I had anticipated,  </li>
            <li> No issues at all can&#x27;t wait to try it out full spectrum.</li>
            <li> if that makes scence but its true.</li>
            <li> Its not bad.</li>
            <li> I put on a light coat of this on my legs and didnt notice any tingle right away</li>
            <li> The first use I thought I might be allergic it was so strong.</li>
            <li> is you HAVE TO make sure you rub it in really good on your hands or wipe them off because you will turn a little orange .</li>
            <li> Overall good lotion, fast shipping,  and I will order again!!</li>
            <li> the tingle factor, well i can say its not that intense, i was expecting something far more tingly but its still a great lotion and definitely get the job done, be sure to wash it off as soon as you get home, stuff really itches!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Tingle and a mild bronzer, which was what I wanted.</li>
            <li> , it gets you super tan</li>
            <li> Granted, I have the type of skin that tans quickly anyways</li>
            <li> Love love love Insanely Black.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 30 minutes I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li> But I used it outdoors for about 20 minutes to see if I liked it,I definitely Enjoy this product as an outdoor tanner compared to ANY regular outdoor tanning</li>
            <li> One week of not tanning and using the lotion, my color become noticeably paler quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works great indoor or outdoor for a ridiculously dark tan.</li>
            <li> i did find for me there was a very intense tingle!</li>
            <li> My legs felt very hot.</li>
            <li> and it does get very HOT  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion the very first time that I tanned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that is normal</li>
            <li> Loved this tanning lotion it was intense to the max and delivered an amazing tan not a lotion I would use for everyday use though</li>
            <li> The very first exp I had with this product, was extremely&lt;br</li>
            <li> session went well, but again... was very hot.  </li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable and the shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> This was my very first tingle lotion</li>
            <li> DHA is the chemical that reacts with your dead skin cells to produce the beautiful tan you get when you spray tan.</li>
            <li> Super hot!</li>
            <li> New at this tanning thing, Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was looking for or what to look for</li>
            <li> So... great tan from product but recommend Black Night 60X or Paint</li>
            <li> so this is a great deal I will b sticking with this lotion or paint me black bc</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used ROAR previously and it works great.</li>
            <li> For someone that loves a good HOT BURNING TINGLE then this is definitely for them.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t very tan at all the first time I used this product and it felt more like my skin was on fire than a tingle.</li>
            <li> BURNS YOUR SKIN BUT POWERFUL FOR A QUICK TAN</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that this stuff was mostly for people who use tanning beds, so it didn&#x27;t really seem to give a tan....</li>
            <li> I have tryed several lotions and this is the best that I have found for a long time.  </li>
            <li> i usually can&#x27;t feel tingles because im so used to them, but this one is intense and the bronzers are great!</li>
            <li> I felt like I really got a strong feeling of sun while in the bed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tanning accelerators before (even ones from Millenium Tanning), which were all mildly uncomforatble, but worth it for the desired effect.  </li>
            <li> It is really hot though, like your on fire!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used a \\&quot;Tingle\\&quot; lotion before!</li>
            <li> It was EXTREMELY HOT!</li>
            <li> Lotion doesn&#x27;t streak and rubs in very well, also contains tyrosine, which helps boost color!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more!  </li>
            <li> If you like tinlge lotions, this one is definitly HOT and well worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> Fast Tanning!!</li>
            <li> First !</li>
            <li> This is an extreme tingle for avid tingle users and experienced tanners and you need to spot test if you are unsure.</li>
            <li> It also tingled and I didn&#x27;t enjoy it much</li>
            <li> It felt great when I applied it but very quickly dried up in the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> It works amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tingle lotion,&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I am addicted to tingles now and this one gives me great color!</li>
            <li> Insanely is not for those w/ sensitive skin (like mine)</li>
            <li> Totally worth it</li>
            <li> The color it gives is worth it though.</li>
            <li> no tan is worth the pain of this!&lt;br /&gt;Tingle is not proven to make you tanner...</li>
            <li> Worth the buy</li>
            <li> Every place it was on my skin now is red and warm but</li>
            <li> and I was surprised how many are using walnuts .</li>
            <li> If you think the side effects are worth the tan, then I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and this one tops them all by far.</li>
            <li> Had a nice golden tan after only 25 minutes in the sun.</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product...got a nice tan, after only a few times.</li>
            <li> but i dont think its worth that burning sensation.</li>
            <li> , the face is the most sensitive area.  </li>
            <li> I use it 2x a week to stay a golden bronze that everyone compliments.</li>
            <li> I liked the results TOTALLY, and if I&lt;br /&gt;hadn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing great reviews from other customers but was very dissatisfied with it...</li>
            <li> it gets super hot..especially on the higher level beds so be prepared.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even go in the tanning bed and it was already super hot.</li>
            <li> I turned the fans on high and felt fine.  </li>
            <li> and this is coming from a girl who would only use &#x27;Designer Skin&#x27; lotions until I found this :) Overall VERY pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> In some places, it started burning right when I put it on...</li>
            <li> The redness faded and right away I could tell a difference in the shade of my skin.  </li>
            <li> the plus is that the bronzer seems to give the rest of the body the right amount of color</li>
            <li> I put it on after I got out of the shower and right before leaving to go tan.</li>
            <li> plus it helps my nerve damage i have in my right arm.</li>
            <li> I will admit right after getting out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li> Just the right amount of bronzer</li>
            <li> so I recommend using it right when you are gonna tan</li>
            <li> Great lotion, non greasy and gets you tanned and dark fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very experienced tanner.i though this lotion was going to be amazing based on reviews.is says the tingle factor is little to moderate it gets your skin red but barley tingles.</li>
            <li> The major downside is that the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; is more like a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> To tan my face, I use Black Night, which is definitely the perfect bronzing power for your face!  </li>
            <li> The tingle is intense and it gets you very brown very quickly.</li>
            <li> i rotate this with my Solid Black 100x, which is also excellent.</li>
            <li> This lotion was pretty cheap, and it worked ok, but it wasn&#x27;t anything wondrous - I tanned with it, but it didn&#x27;t make me super super dark like it says it would.</li>
            <li> i use other lotiions to keep a rotation, but if i have a special day or plans that require a nice color to my legs and arms, this is the lotion i use</li>
            <li> great tingle, but I am not able to pass my tan plateau.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most every brand of combination high tingle and high bronzer for over 15 years and this one&#x27;s the hottest and darkest, with no orange color, at the cheapest price on the market at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion got super dark super fast and love the tingle and the hotness!</li>
            <li> But newbies really should start with a warming lotion or a mild tingle.</li>
            <li> I am surprised this product has not killed someone to be honest.</li>
            <li> really i.ncreases your tan quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s HOT, it&#x27;s dark and it smells good.</li>
            <li> am giving Insanley black 5 stars because it is a good tingle</li>
            <li> but overall I got a great price on amazon, compared to the 40 bucks my tanning salon wanted for the same thing.</li>
            <li> Tanning results with this product are great, but the tingle can be best described as the name &#x27; Insanely&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used paint it black from the line before and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I would probably torture myself with&lt;br /&gt;the tingling sting to obtain the results so quickly and very efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I GOT SOOOO DARK VERY QUICKLY!!</li>
            <li> I was using a lower level tanning bed and when I went back to the salon I normally go to - really great bulbs and higher levels - I INSTANTLY noticed a difference after tanning.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews before buying I saw alot of people refer to this product as very intense.</li>
            <li> Not literally, but its a very intense burning sensation for about and hour when you use it.</li>
            <li> It has a very intense burning sensation the minute you put it on.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for the job this lotion does.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> The delivery time is very fast.</li>
            <li> but, if i take a day or two off i find that my color fades very fast.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a must try for anyone who wants quick results and can take the heat :-)</li>
            <li> I love the fact that i can get so dark so quick!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure people will complain about the burning sensation and the red skin, but I think that&#x27;s just par for the course with this product.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time yesterday during my lunch break..</li>
            <li> it definitely has the tingle factor, but I love tingle.</li>
            <li> so this happen to be my first pick.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Well just felt tingly with the first 15 mins on.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this i&#x27;m not going to lie</li>
            <li> I have used many different tanning lotions over the years and have NEVER had anything that BURNS like this one does.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I burnt.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it i also used it with a lotion with more bronzer in it.</li>
            <li> I was pretty tan before I used this.  </li>
            <li> I tried it once..too hot for me.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when you know it&#x27;s really working!</li>
            <li> I received my lotion on Saturday which was also my first time to use it.  </li>
            <li> Was not sure of it with the mixed reviews but this stuff is AWESOME!!!!!!.</li>
            <li> I was more red than a cherry, ahha.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It tingles at first, but then goes away.</li>
            <li> I feel like the redness gives my stubborn ski a more lasting result.  </li>
            <li> The tingle begins to decrease after the first week or so of use.</li>
            <li> If the first burning sensation didn&#x27;t warn you, then i pray that this will.</li>
            <li> i used this tanning for the first time about two days ago.</li>
            <li> I put it on and by the time I was 10 mins into tanning, I became bumpy and pretty itchy.</li>
            <li> my whole body swelled, came home and took shower and had to apply benadry!</li>
            <li> The tingling sensation the lotion has made me really hot while in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I needed some bronzer for the tanning bed, however, because they didn&#x27;t advertise that it is REALLY REALLY HOT</li>
            <li> so if you don&#x27;t like it hot</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I noticed that it made me smell \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; after I got out.  </li>
            <li> When I put this on I thought Ghost peppers were the first ingredient.</li>
            <li> I bought it with higher expectatations.</li>
            <li> Scared me with the hot burning pain, rash, and irregular tan marks.</li>
            <li> so this is more likely the cause</li>
            <li> I have read lots of reviews that had the same reaction I should have read more before I purchased.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked really well for me!</li>
            <li> One more thing is that if you do not rub this in properly then your going to have streaks.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> My arms started tingling first, then my legs and stomach.</li>
            <li> tanner after the first application.  </li>
            <li> Intense burn!</li>
            <li> Then it was very bad/Hot! &amp;#34;Its</li>
            <li> This was my first tingle product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> is, I put on a Level 10 tingle lotion first while at home then put this on at the salon.</li>
            <li> expectations of the tingle factor based off the reviews was higher.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> like I did when I first started using it..  </li>
            <li> The tingle is def hot</li>
            <li> and when I use it, it&#x27;s not sooo Hot</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Hope you like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> I have to say I like this lotion, it just wasn&#x27;t as hot as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I threw away this product after my first use.</li>
            <li> I tried it out the first night it showed up while sitting at home</li>
            <li> it gets HOT if you can stand it.</li>
            <li> Too much bronzer!</li>
            <li> More than when I got back from Cancun.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like getting a spray tan than actually tanning.</li>
            <li> It gets hot in the bed, but not burning your arm off hot.</li>
            <li> I surely looked darker after coming out of the tanning bed, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because of my body turning deep red from the chemical reaction it was causing.</li>
            <li> If you decide to use it for the first time be cautious.</li>
            <li> I love the deep soultry brown results from this lotion.</li>
            <li> this lotion is exactly what it says it is........</li>
            <li> so if you dont like hot then its not for you</li>
            <li> i wouldnt use it at first if you cant stand the heat.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Oh well... I guess you really do get what you pay for these days!  </li>
            <li> Spot-test it on yourself first before you tan if you are like me and are not used to tingly lotions.  </li>
            <li> Well I did and it was hot at first, but not unbearable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather pay more for something that actually does work!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> and this lotion definitely helped! :)</li>
            <li> It stimulates with a hot sensation and the bronzer is immediate so you can see a difference within an hour.  </li>
            <li> Most recently I was using Snooki Hot Bronzer.</li>
            <li> love this product &amp; price, I have used this product  for the last three years 5 star all the way</li>
            <li> My hole body burned for about three hours and stayed red for about three more.</li>
            <li> Im an avid tanner</li>
            <li> It did get HOT</li>
            <li> Just opened and used for the first time, they talk about the tingle in the write-up</li>
            <li> Bought this on a whim and tried it for the first time today.</li>
            <li> I love trying different tanning lotions...</li>
            <li> I love mixing lotions together when you feel you just can&#x27;t reach that next level...</li>
            <li> but there was a Tingle for the first 2days and no none at all</li>
            <li> I like the lotion since it gets so hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very big in Crossfit &amp; love to run 3-10 miles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tad scared to put this all over my body and lay in a hot tanning bed.</li>
            <li> but the first time i use it in a while i can litteraly hear my heart beating and feel my skin pulsing</li>
            <li> and personally I thought it was okay....</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on how pretty &amp; deep my tan is.  </li>
            <li> 1st time i used itwas HOT.</li>
            <li> and I gave 5 stars the first time.</li>
            <li> I moved up to a higher tingle</li>
            <li> i was really hot, after  about eight minutes</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is the bomb, a hot bomb.  </li>
            <li> Save them for next summer when you may not be able to find it.</li>
            <li> WARNING: if you cannot handle stinging &amp; tingling (like Caspian in hot peppers) on your skin,&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> I layed outdoors the first time..</li>
            <li> hot though(sweated</li>
            <li> And to the person crying about looking like an oompa loompa, umm that sounds like a good tingle to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many MANY lotions and spent top dollar for LESS results than what this stuff gave me in just 2 uses.</li>
            <li> LOL, if you read all the reviews that give this one or two stars you might find that most of them were just inexperienced users or just plain irresponsible users.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> thought the lotion was great but was very hott gave my at least 2 shades the first time using it will be buying again</li>
            <li> a little too much tingle but good</li>
            <li> and I also worked at a salon where we got to try all the new lotions, and older lotions for free.</li>
            <li> My entire body was bright red even in places I didn&#x27;t apply (face &amp; bloodshot eyes).</li>
            <li> It turns your skin RED like bright, beet red before you even get into the sun/bed or anything at all</li>
            <li> I immediately dropped everything and got in the shower to get this @#$ off, but the water only seemed to piss it off more, so the itching spread from my legs, to my whole body.</li>
            <li> and  I was very pleased that the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; sensation was not super intense for me</li>
            <li> Love the tingle and makes you super dark.</li>
            <li> I looked really burnt at first</li>
            <li> I use it for outside tanning works great got dark in the first 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion I was darker after the first visit.</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work fast!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get UBER hot, though; I felt very good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this lotion but only to those of yall who tan on a regular basis and are fully aware of what a tingle lotion does because this is by far the best!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a nice dark brown tan with no hints of orange.</li>
            <li> It is not bad at all; however, do not put it on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> I mean amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using black storm and really liked it</li>
            <li> It spreads easy, like a regular lotion.  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth &amp; slick the texture is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this and expect not to feel the warm, slight burn/tingle.  </li>
            <li> The tingle is somewhat strong especially on your face</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;orange\\&quot; palms, but even with only touching her with my hands, she developed huge red spots on her arms almost right away.  </li>
            <li> But I do hit a plateau after a certain point....</li>
            <li> It will not leave you orange and certainly will not dissapoint you.</li>
            <li> and I stayed warm for a little while</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to anybody who can tolerate their skin feeling a little inflamed and enjoys a nice fast tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> They tan fantasticly without intense facial pain.</li>
            <li> Have to watch how much you use and</li>
            <li> so I would recommend this to anyone to wants to kick their tanning up a notch.</li>
            <li> People that like an intense tingle lotion, I would try something else.</li>
            <li> 2 to 5 times is all you really need.</li>
            <li> It tingled the whole time I was in the bed</li>
            <li> If you like tingles, I would HIGHLY recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> It does just what it says works very well dont use too much because u do feel the burning and tingling sensations...</li>
            <li> I am a person who wants to look like I just went tanning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really intense but it works very well.</li>
            <li> It goes on very sheer and smooth</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion really works.</li>
            <li> But who cares really.</li>
            <li> I have used bombshell from designer skin which is also a tingle and that lotion doesn&#x27;t even come close to how much this stuff tingles.</li>
            <li> I put it on and got really nausiated.</li>
            <li> I got dressed, picked up my bag, and was ready to walk out the door.</li>
            <li> and I was really looking foward to the bronze skin.</li>
            <li> The tingle is very neat  and groovey.</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li> Intense burn for an hour or so after tanning</li>
            <li> but it really brings out the melanin in your skin.</li>
            <li> I really felt like my heart was going to explode</li>
            <li> my whole body was swelled up not to mention the PAIN</li>
            <li> The tingle wasn&#x27;t intense or too much.</li>
            <li> I DO really like this lotion</li>
            <li> no tingle really except on my face.</li>
            <li> You should really test this out on an area of your body before you go to tan.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about.  </li>
            <li> So I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> That sums this up Really...</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT doesn&#x27;t tingle that much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and You can really see it.</li>
            <li> or I might just mix it in With some REAL TINGLE samples from the salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tingler but doesn&#x27;t tingle much.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re skin orange if you use It too much.</li>
            <li> It really just depends on your skin.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s supposed to tingle, but I felt absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> It smells spicy if you know what i&#x27;m talking about haha.</li>
            <li> I really like the color I have gotten using this product.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a light tingle packet at my tanning salon....</li>
            <li> Truly intense.</li>
            <li> This product has a reddening agent and a tingle enhancer that is very severe.</li>
            <li> my advice is to try something else because this embodies extremly intense burning sensation.</li>
            <li> It was cheap and had some mixed reviews</li>
            <li> I had to take so much allergy medicine to try to stop the intense itching.  </li>
            <li> I am very please.</li>
            <li> Recieved it very quicly after my order was placed .</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This has done really well.</li>
            <li> I do tan very well with it</li>
            <li> I tanned this morning, and now, getting ready for bed</li>
            <li> so the tingle isn&#x27;t so intense.</li>
            <li> , you might aswell rub a ghost pepper on yourself, can&#x27;t even wash it off very well.</li>
            <li> About 3 minutes in my heart was racing so fast that I thought I was going to pass out.  </li>
            <li> started burning my eyes and was not tolerable, my arms were better but not much.</li>
            <li> Definitely do a test patch on a more sensitive area before you commit to putting it in your whole body.</li>
            <li> a lot of tingle , too much for me.</li>
            <li> This lotion has some heat, but I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, if I  did get the real deal Millenium</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> But no so much now I guess I got use to it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for tingle much</li>
            <li> A real deal.</li>
            <li> I was in so much tingly pain all over.</li>
            <li> it made me feel like I was burning/on fire the whole 12 min in tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok, not great not horrible..</li>
            <li> 4 1/2 hours later I am a nice red burned color</li>
            <li> It got my legs super dark and didn&#x27;t stain my knees when I applied it lightly.</li>
            <li> I am new to this tanning thing and this is the first product I used.</li>
            <li> I previously used the Black Storm lotion and liked it a lot, but I wanted something that would give me more color</li>
            <li> Works very well dark after 1st tan it does turn you bright red but</li>
            <li> I am really glad I read other reviews before I used it</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t hot enough for my skin to break that barrier and take me into a darker level, and if I use it regularly now, I will have more of an orange hue -</li>
            <li> please be sure and read the instructions very carefully.</li>
            <li> This lotion is intensely hot tingle with just the right bronzes mixed in.</li>
            <li> The results look better than other high end lotions I have used, for four times the price.</li>
            <li> I would rather pay full price for the product and actually have it work</li>
            <li> this spreads pretty far for a lotion.</li>
            <li> It was my impression, that a 100Xs dark tanning bronzer is supposed to give you more darkness than a 50 Xs bronzer?  </li>
            <li> Its a whole new level of tan,  </li>
            <li> but this stuff has taken me to a whole new level.  </li>
            <li> Ive paid more than that for alot less results.</li>
            <li> A slight downside is that it does seem to include a somewhat potent bronzer, so wash your hands well as soon as you can</li>
            <li> Out of control was pretty hot, but this stuff is definitely hotter.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to be RED, the longer the better and that the deeper your color will be later.</li>
            <li> It definitely will step up your tan quickly.</li>
            <li> and I love to use it once I have a great base tan.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $10 at your local salon for a better product.</li>
            <li> The tingle is not as strong as I expected.</li>
            <li> it when I first used it a week ago &amp; now it just turns my skin kind of red for a little while, maybe I&#x27;m just used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didnt even make it out of my bedroom before my whole body was on complete fire!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that it didn&#x27;t take the tanning bed to activate the lotion as my legs were on fire before I even got in the room!  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this one to anyone, even if you&#x27;re a fan of high tingles and bronzers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to people who arent fair-skinned</li>
            <li> but have never used any of these high quality tanners.</li>
            <li> Highly discourage purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I used a high pressure level 4 bed with a max time of 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> i also have a difficult time with my legs and after one use they had a nice golden tan!</li>
            <li> First if all it&#x27;s very hot, which I expected, but it&#x27;s day 6</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a little more out of this product.</li>
            <li> Im going to use it a little longer to see if it works better.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve used this for a week now because my view has changed a little.</li>
            <li> It actually is a little more bronzer than tingle in my opinion</li>
            <li> You would definitely pay a pretty penny for this in a salon!</li>
            <li> The tingle kicks in right away, is super intense and last for a long time.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin feeling really frangrant and soft</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but wherever you put this, get ready for a burning and reddening to occur.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that when i try it again, I will have better results, because now, I actually have a good base tan and am not getting red at all when tanning.</li>
            <li> i have never bought tanning lotion online before, i normally buy it at the tanning salon and thought i could save a couple bucks.</li>
            <li> The lotion really does make your skin RED and makes you feel like you are on fire when you use it for the first time</li>
            <li> every place where the lotion is not applied is completely normal.</li>
            <li> I have done some further research on this lotion as so many people experience unexplained itching and what I found in my case is that this lotion contains walnuts and I have nut allergies</li>
            <li> The chair that I sat in also absorbed this product which transferred to someone else&#x27;s skin upon sitting in the chair on the same day.</li>
            <li> The tanning salon that I go to wants $110 for the exact same bottle!</li>
            <li> After a few times of use and a bit getting used to, I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li> I use this to go beyond a normal tan.  </li>
            <li> I like the instant color is apparent, and the tingle is intense and fades into a dark lasting tan great</li>
            <li> A little on the intense side, so if your not use to a strong tingle or bronzer</li>
            <li> If you like tingle plus bronzing lotion, you&#x27;ll love insanely black!  </li>
            <li> I tan easily, and I like tingle, this left me red and burning for hrs after</li>
            <li> 5 min later my hand was very RED and had a strong burning sensation.</li>
            <li> Obviously my self confidence is through the roof right now.</li>
            <li> I think my face is the only part of my body that isn&#x27;t itchy/burnt feeling right now.  </li>
            <li> My skin right now is very red, and itchy.</li>
            <li> but right now im seeing I actually got darker..</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel like it is on fire and turns you scolding red right after you put it on before you even catch any sun rays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s rare first of all (in response to other reviews) that you won&#x27;t smell somewhat like a tanning bed after using a tanning bed.</li>
            <li> this is the third time ive used a tingle lotion although ive tanned a lot.this lotion is super hot and definetly not for someone who doesnt prefer the hot and tingly sensation.on the other hand if you do this lotion</li>
            <li> I get really dark after using it, like a deep red that a few hours later is a nice Brown tone, I also use after bronzer when I get out of the bed, but the tingle is almost to much to handle, feels insanely hot after applying tan extender, my clothes almost hurt my skin when I am putting my clothes back on, I don&#x27;t recommend this unless you are really into tingle lotions that really do tingle, compared to Swedish beauty tingle, this is way more intense</li>
            <li> so it gets pretty hot the first few times you use it then</li>
            <li> Wow, first Time used and super tan, however my body is still burning especially on my legs since yesterday, i did a 10 min stand up tanning bed, product definitely works,  </li>
            <li> I bought this one because I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> (I live across the street)</li>
            <li> live in MN</li>
            <li> you get super red and hot after but my tan is fabulous after only using a week and a half</li>
            <li> Than I ordered smoke I loved that got dark in one tan than sn o o k i and now insanely black.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It Black was fine, no sensation...</li>
            <li> The tingle in it was definitely noticeable that first time, (I tanned for 20 minutes), but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t start to burn until about 10 minutes into my session.  </li>
            <li> i hadn&#x27;t tanned in over a month and the first day i went back</li>
            <li> cuz i was so red and hot</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion product where it doesn&#x27;t make me look totally red instead of bronze.  </li>
            <li> I felt as if my entire body had been dipped in hot wax.</li>
            <li> I had been tanning for about a month when I first got this (from never being in the sun before) and had only used a sample packet of a tingle lotion before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after that first use and the redness faded i definitely turned a darker shade than i was.</li>
            <li> but otherwise i completely recommend this lotion!</li>
            <li> Not as hot as people say it is, but then again IMA big tingle fan.</li>
            <li> on skin first before using in actual tanning.</li>
            <li> I dont want to even think about how it would be if I had actually tanned first.</li>
            <li> Chemical burns are similar to first degree burns except they don&#x27;t always hurt.  </li>
            <li> If you like a HOT TINGLE,this IS the one and only!!!</li>
            <li> So if you are looking for one hot tingle definitely try this.</li>
            <li> ended up with light and dark spots on my legs.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was scared to try this lotion after what everyone wrote!  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it stained my hands orange for a solid three days</li>
            <li> I would not feel hot but again, would turn red.</li>
            <li> i usually do not buy the tingles as i dont like the burning feeling.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been tanning in three months and this was my first session back.</li>
            <li> Just a little too strong smelling for me</li>
            <li> Its does get hot but the color is WELL worth a little bit of heat in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> makes you very dark very quickly.</li>
            <li> :) it would be VERY difficult for me to find a better lotion..</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product if you are looking for a deep dark tan :)</li>
            <li> Skin is a little red right after but turns into great color a few hours later.</li>
            <li> Make sure u read further down.....</li>
            <li> and it got very hot, as i expected after reading some reviews.</li>
            <li> It did get a little red right after I finished tanning but not bad at all...</li>
            <li> It was a better deal than just buying Solid Black.  </li>
            <li> Just ok, I prefer the Solid Black</li>
            <li> The only thing I would worry about is if you are not careful with application and put too much in one area the bronzer will stain and it looks almost like you used a fake sunless tanning lotion, but if you apply it evenly the results are great.</li>
            <li> After this whole mess, I read the reviews and many other people said the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> And as long as you rotate it every other time it doesn&#x27;t seem overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> Places like the backs of your arms or inner thighs can sting more than less sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> Turns out this product mixed with certain products tanning bed cleaning products cause this reaction.  </li>
            <li> It gives a light tingle and warmth and a little redness</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t mind the smell of other lotions after getting out of the tanning bed but this one made me want to shower right away.</li>
            <li> A little too HOT for me !!</li>
            <li> if I wanna go that much but this lotion will get u dark the first time u use it, u will itch when u get out the tanning bed and be blochy</li>
            <li> Even with that, my gym only allows 10 minute tanning sessions at a time in moderately intense stand-up beds.</li>
            <li> Actually threw it out and did not use it since the smell was too much.</li>
            <li> I would only use thos once and awhile because the burning was almost unbearable but it did really improve my tan...</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would say to use caution with this product.</li>
            <li> and she was already commenting on how tan I am and when I got back after using this she even couldn&#x27;t believe how much darker I was.</li>
            <li> They feel like a very itchy sunburn while in the bed and until I wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li> i felt the intense tingle almost instantly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;One day after tanning, my 5-year old daughter came up and gave me a hug.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent tanner, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I got it</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and wow did it get be colored.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used it once so far, I switch up between tingles and bronzers and I am noticeably darker after one session with this.</li>
            <li> The product states it provides the ultimate tan with a tingling sensation, but it really means your body will feel like it&#x27;s on FIRE.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t drive home fast enough to try to wash this stuff off.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, there is something else in this lotions formulation that really doesn&#x27;t work too well for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Well, I got this lotion because I like tingle and in some other reviews people said it was very hot.</li>
            <li> In other reviews it states that it was very hot and don&#x27;t use it on your face.</li>
            <li> I will be buying my lotion directly from the tanning salon from now on.</li>
            <li> If you have extremely sensitive skin, this is not for you.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have SENSITIVE skin, at all what so ever DO NOT USE IT.</li>
            <li> I would not try this lotion on or near the face/eyes.</li>
            <li> Not for the sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair of the minimus style I really like them.</li>
            <li> I payed for an intense tingle, and that is definitely what I got!!  </li>
            <li> It made my skin red but didnt really tan me all that well.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but after using it a few more times, I still had the same results.</li>
            <li> So forget even going out in public right after tanning with this lotion unless you want people to think you just made it back from a trip to the surface of the sun itself.</li>
            <li> It definitely makes your skin turn red right away</li>
            <li> To me, Insanely Black isn&#x27;t really that hot.  </li>
            <li> It crept up slowly at first, the feeling like my skin was dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> This makes you dark really quick.</li>
            <li> even for advanced tanners the first time is a little rough.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat red for several hours after tanning, but the red eventually faded and I have a nice dark brown now.</li>
            <li> but when i was an extra dark factor in my color i turn to it ..just not as a regular lotion :) &amp; for the price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> When we used it last night in the tanning bed - I felt more than a tingle  - I got burnt and tingled for most of the night -- very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> its a HIGH tingle &amp; as do other high tingles do it leaves u itchy after which is NORMAL.</li>
            <li> After looking at several different tanning lotions, I decided to purchase Insanely Black, and I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Insanely Black will quickly make you change your outlook</li>
            <li> /&gt;It just isn&#x27;t hot enough for me - as every person&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> It was the exact same symptoms 4 hours later.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty unfair that people who dont know what they are messing with give great products like this poor rating when they do exactly what they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I love tingle lotions, but I find that very few actually give me any tingling sensation, or redness.</li>
            <li> I am taken back how strong the tingle factor is here... and it sells for less then $20, I have tried all the other brands and tingles at higher prices and nothing comapares to this product..</li>
            <li> It is definitely HOT, first time tingle user or the very pale should probably start with something weaker.</li>
            <li> It also spreads fast, thorough and lasts long.</li>
            <li> She applied normal amounts to cover skin until it starting hurting her.  </li>
            <li> It got me tan but not dark.</li>
            <li> It took me 4 benadryl and 5 hours later before I began feeling normal.</li>
            <li> a tingle lotion was the first time I used one, which was years ago &amp; it was Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond T2.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li> After an hour in a cool shower and trying to remove with a few washes and make up remover</li>
            <li> Makes you super dark!</li>
            <li> it gets you super dark!</li>
            <li> so it took hours for my skin to calm down.  </li>
            <li> so my skin is tough enough for this kind of lotion.</li>
            <li> The only down side that it does dry my skin out if I use it more than 3 times in a row.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat new to the world of tanning and tanning accelerators, but this stuff definitely makes you darker!!!</li>
            <li> i also live three blocks from my tanning salon and walk there and back in the heat</li>
            <li> I just need to try a new brand for a time and then go back.  </li>
            <li> Now this next and final portion must be stated with a very grave warning.</li>
            <li> But if you can handle it insanely black is well worth it.</li>
            <li> And it certainly doesn&#x27;t turn you insanely black very quick, other than your hands due to the high bronzer content</li>
            <li> I can barely make it through my 15 minute session!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty extreme.</li>
            <li> the next day i went for 12 minutes using this and WOW!</li>
            <li> First off be careful maybe use latex gloves when applying!  </li>
            <li> Cuz everyone here is claiming it burned and Tingled majorly.</li>
            <li> I have bought other products that have a higher x&#x27;s and they do not work.</li>
            <li> Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
            <li> First of all i must state that i have tanned several years and that i am not new to it.</li>
            <li> I took some photographs (they did not turn out very well to show the DISTINCT contrast) but you can see there is white and red from where I missed a few spots with the lotion on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the red tints tingles give, but some brands, such as cherry bomb, the red fades away after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am not pale by any means, my father is half Italian, and I tan very easily, rarely burn.</li>
            <li> I have used several different lotions through out that time and they all gave me decent color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch though lol</li>
            <li> ..........be sure to give your lotion time to work, it continues to work even after you get out of the tanning bed, wait to shower at least 3 hours, some people cannot handle the prickly feeling that long, but showering immediately after a session stops the process of lotions that keep tanning after you leave the tanning bed....</li>
            <li> I will say that I barely put any on my face</li>
            <li> next morning, the redness is always completely gone</li>
            <li> i just warn that after tanning avoid direct physical contact with anyone until you have showered.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews about the \\&quot;tingle,\\&quot; and prepared myself for the screaming intense pain i expected.</li>
            <li> The name is a Complete opposite of what the product does.</li>
            <li> i was pretty dark before i started to use this lotion and it still set me on fire a bit .</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough</li>
            <li> The company said it is only sold in salons and direct.  </li>
            <li> So I was surprised it turned so red.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using this lotion I have completely lost my tan and have not only had to purchase another lotion but start my tanning process all over again.  </li>
            <li> Makes you dark with first use.</li>
            <li> As far as any tan coloration after the red wore off, I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all.  </li>
            <li> It DIDN&#x27;T try my skin out, you can definitely feel the soft silicone&#x27;s that it has.</li>
            <li> my skin was extremly red and sensitive afterwards i did get a darker tan</li>
            <li> , this lotion is by far the hottest (tingle) and would drive someone nuts if they never used it before, but with all my lotions, i have found that i always seem to migrate back to this one because i know that it works...</li>
            <li> This product takes my tan to the next level, But do a patch test if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did get really dark the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I had been tanning for about 2 weeks with a pretty good bronzer to build up a base tan and decided I wanted to kick it up a notch.</li>
            <li> What I had before I used this lotion was a pretty good base from tanning every two days for two months.</li>
            <li> cause some of the times it made my hands a little orange and didn&#x27;t wash off right away.  </li>
            <li> I do suggest when you use it for the first time cut your tanning min down, I tan for 12 min in the tanning bed and cut it to 5 min this helped to get use to the lotion.</li>
            <li> At first I just thought that I was coming down with something</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin though and am pretty pale when I haven&#x27;t been tanning.</li>
            <li> I did a spot test when I first got it to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t burn me bad, and all I got to say is WOW!</li>
            <li> since it seemed to be a neat looking bidy by the name and description along with it being a well known company however, I will never purchase another product made by this company ever again as long as I live.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day i tried insanely black.</li>
            <li> It has me tan so much faster than any other lotions that I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> Anyways i did not think it was extremely intense probably because I am used to using extreme tingle</li>
            <li> Even when I diluted it with other lotions it still was fairly intense.</li>
            <li> But my tan is getting darker much quicker than with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> other than this it worked very well.</li>
            <li> It burned my skin after tanning for a minute, I was in tears and it took a few hours before my skin went back to normal and the intense pain went away.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice thinking it would even out, it&#x27;s very orange and leaves you completely blotchy and uneven ..</li>
            <li> Just a warning to anyone that is not accustomed to anything that tingles , use a little first.</li>
            <li> It really makes you dark.</li>
            <li> Does anyone know of any REAL 100Xs dark tanning?  </li>
            <li> so if tingle doesn&#x27;t bother you or you really wanna get dark</li>
            <li> Other than the intense allergic reaction, the only &amp;#34;tan/orange&amp;#34</li>
            <li> After enough use, you barely feel the tingle anymore.</li>
            <li> Then afterwards I was red all over, I was itchy all over and for about a week my skin was super dry and slightly itchy.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t mind the odor, but for some reason after a few uses I couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I applied it to my legs and was distracted for a few minutes and then continued applying it to the rest of my body.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is only for those who are not only serious tanners, but also like lotions that have a strong tingle factor in them.</li>
            <li> Although it did take my tan to the next level, I&#x27;m not sure it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually have no problems with the Swedish Beauty Green Tease tingle and the Swedish Beauty Stunning tingle lotions.  </li>
            <li> only got the tingle the first few sessions ?</li>
            <li> I get a decent redness from it, but not as red as other tingles i have used.</li>
            <li> this tingle lotion stung so bad i was not able to tan for more then 3 minutes, and normally i tan for the full 20.</li>
            <li> Why is this not the case with this particular 100 times dark bronzer?  </li>
            <li> I still felt a little burnt after but not as much.</li>
            <li> (60x is not too much or too little for me</li>
            <li> Only need to use a small amount, very intense Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> Honestly some of them on here scared the crap outta me because they said it was so intense.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel bad on my body, but I was putting on my lotion for the first time before I left for the tanning beds, and I felt fine, Until I put it on my face, which for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m german with darker skin because of native american decent and I will get my desired color if i go everyday for a week.</li>
            <li> B0058E3XJI Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Bronzer Tanning Bed Lotion, 100x, 13.5-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> the Insanely Black on the other hand is EXTREMELY hot and has A LOT of tingle and will turn you VERY RED!  </li>
            <li> only positive I will say about the solid black 100 times dark tanning bronzer is it has not left orange streaks nor orange tint on my hands or body!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used a lot of tingles, besides Supre Cherry Bomb which I&#x27;m not sure is actually a legit tingle.  </li>
            <li> Be careful if you have light/pale skin because the heavy sunless tanner in this can turn your skin pretty orange.</li>
            <li> My legs are SO hard to tan, but this had my legs looking very tan in 1 week!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, test lotion on your wrist-if you do not get any kinda of bad reaction it is safe to use in a tanning bed OR outside.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s not for someone with sensitive skin or someone who doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; aspect of a dark tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin soft and DARK....</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for a while and nothing gets me anywhere near as dark as this lotion does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this lotion is getting me very tan...</li>
            <li> i just dont feel like it last as long as i would like it to.</li>
            <li> Haha!&lt;br /&gt;I got out of the tanner and had a really red face even though I had a good base tan prior to my going in and using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if this lotion was watered down or just old...</li>
            <li> My chest felt very heavy and my heart started beating really fast.</li>
            <li> It left streaks on my hands and arms and also rubbed off on my clothes even though it was dry.</li>
            <li> My one and only complaint is the fact that it has such powerful bronzers in it, you must wash your hands after applying or you will get results like sunless tanning lotions where your fingers turn a slight orange.  </li>
            <li> Be careful to avoid this if possible - it definitely hurts!</li>
            <li> I Developed a severe allergic reaction from only a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;Test</li>
            <li> folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not suggest using this unless you already have a good solid base tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and the bronzers really help me.</li>
            <li> When the other reviewers discuss the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; keep in mind they are talking about the most horrible burning/itching sensation imaginable, such as being covered in a swarm of biting red ants, or rubbing light grain sandpaper over sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> a lot)&lt;br /&gt;skin was red but that went away and then deep dark tan replaced it the next day.  </li>
            <li> So my recommendation is to buy the product if you have skin that is not very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> When I got back to work, my usual delivery driver commented on how tan I seemed to get overnight and said it looked extremely natural!</li>
            <li> I have a rich, golden brown base tan that with lotion has helped me achieve.</li>
            <li> Where are these people&#x27;s sense of smell or did I get one of those scammed, old solid black bottles or perhaps somebody poured a different type of lotion in the damn bottle and calls it 100Xs dark tanning bronzer.</li>
            <li> The smell of this lotion isn&#x27;t good or awful, it&#x27;s just decent.</li>
            <li> After about 1 hour my arms were burning/itching pretty bad and my legs just felt really burnt!!  </li>
            <li> It smells similar to a wet towel shoved into a gym locker for a month.</li>
            <li> As long as I am tanned I will be using this again and again.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strange scent.</li>
            <li> I ran outside and dunked my face in the pool, didn&#x27;t work, got a wet towel, didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> and my skin is not sensitive.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get results.</li>
            <li> They went down a bit after giving her benadryl, but later when she was in the bath, the spots reappeared and then got bigger.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed that it leaves me so dry because otherwise I think it is a good product, however, once this bottle is empty I don&#x27;t believe I will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> It makes you get very hot and uncomfortable but I usually mix it when another tanning lotion to calm it down.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m currently switching back and forth with this and solid black 100x every other day.</li>
            <li> so if youre not into tingle lotions or think it may be too intense for you, for the price i definitely recommend getting it for at least your legs!</li>
            <li> but he only down side i felt that it left my skin very dry .</li>
            <li> then some, my bronze last days and my tan is darker quicker than with any other lotions, and i am a tanning lotion junkie.</li>
            <li> I only felt the extreme burn after being in water or over exposed areas like my face.</li>
            <li> Aweful product under describes the extreme burning and instant redness</li>
            <li> Hopefully, other people will not have the same reaction that I did.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, my issue is not the tingle (which is moderate IMO), but the smell!</li>
            <li> It leaves really bad orange stains and streaks on your skin which takes about ten or more washes to get off.</li>
            <li> By the time I showered, I was flaky dry (not burnt).  </li>
            <li> but if you have ANY dry spot on your body it will turn orange and you MUST wash your hands with soap and water or your palms will turn orange as well.</li>
            <li> I put it on my legs in a few areas and those areas turned red and stayed red even after I washed the stuff off.</li>
            <li> I was still red and a few hours later I got NOTICIBLY tanned.</li>
            <li> I go tanning every single day</li>
            <li> and I have tried just about every single lotion out there I thought</li>
            <li> And yes it turns you red for a few hours which it&#x27;s supposed to do, but WOW does it make you dark!</li>
            <li> With the bad reviews in mind, I still purchased it because I tan easily and never have issues with burning or issues with lotions in general.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, even the smell which is usually not good on some tanning products.</li>
            <li> Even after a couple hours after using this product, I&#x27;ve got my dark tan back.</li>
            <li> and I have a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> That sucks because normally cheaper online.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it I did not get as dark but was still using an upgraded bed.</li>
            <li> but I am starting to turn dark.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this lotion unless you are having trouble getting darker after you&#x27;ve already got a good base tan, it&#x27;s not really necessary otherwise.</li>
            <li> The only down side, and the reason why I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars...</li>
            <li> i propped my legs up on his when i got home and sat down for about 5 min and within another 5 min his legs were red, itchy and burning as if he put it on and went tanning himself.</li>
            <li> only down fall to this lotion</li>
            <li> Not a high degree of tingle or bronzer.</li>
            <li> it was a pretty intense after effect for a tanning lotion, but it wasnt too bad.</li>
            <li> and I have NEVER had a tanning product leave my skin this DRY!  </li>
            <li> that on so I mixed 2 teaspoons of Insanely Black with 3 Tablespoons of Paint</li>
            <li> Insanely black tanning lotion left no streaks and I saw results after using it twice!</li>
            <li> It has a slight smell of like.. candy, mixed with damp basement.</li>
            <li> i used black storm which got me sooo brown after only a 10 minute session...</li>
            <li> I bought Solid Black and it had this with a combo.  </li>
            <li> although only slightly.</li>
            <li> I switch between this and Paint it Black regularly</li>
            <li> ...rotated this lotion with Solid Black Tanning lotion and now my skin has turned orange..</li>
            <li> SOLID BLACK BRONZER TANNING LOTION.  </li>
            <li> Then I used solid black  y</li>
            <li> It does leave you red afterwards but it doesn&#x27;t last too long, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I took a quick cold shower and rubbed some aloe on and about 20 minutes later</li>
            <li> Now a session that i normally would stay in for 15 minutes turned into about 9 minutes of hell as i was forced out of the bed by the extreme burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I heard about its effects and just rubbed a little on the back side of my hand.</li>
            <li> i am deep dark chocolate brown!</li>
            <li> but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will be orange from all the bronzer in it..it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> Iam very dark but this lotion still gets me very red after tanning with it.</li>
            <li> I love a tingle on my face which people say is bad</li>
            <li> this lotion works great but smells awful.</li>
            <li> I really expected moor.</li>
            <li> If you know and are careful that won&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> It did give me some color but not what I expected.</li>
            <li> after i was done i was a bit on the red side and tingly for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning lotions over several years and I am here to tell you that this one is by far the worst one that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Not What I expected.</li>
            <li> this is the product for you, if not, be careful with this.  </li>
            <li> Faster than I expected.  </li>
            <li> so be careful around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble tanning my il upper body</li>
            <li> I used it quite A few times the last time used it</li>
            <li> Recieved faster than expected.</li>
            <li> the product did not really work for me.</li>
            <li> as expected it does wash off</li>
            <li> I dont know if I have sensitive skin, not experienced enough, or just cant handle.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as i expected, i bought one from wal mart and sorry to say but it works a lot better and darker faster and cheaper, not real happy with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> If you can handle the tingle I definitely suggest using Insanely Black!</li>
            <li> It had a strong tingle the first time i used it, but not the worst.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week only due to the annoying itchy feeling the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> editorial is right: this lotion is not for the faint of heart.  </li>
            <li> maybe its just me not sure cuz i do live in a tiny town in upstate n.y and my selection of tanning beds is very small</li>
            <li> Do not put this lotion NEAR your eyes, seriously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m preparing for a bodybuilding competition, so I want to get a nice dark base tan before I spray.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too.  </li>
            <li> Now while i was drying off with my towel, i started to get a slight itching feeling all over the areas that i had applied the lotion to earlier and had just dried off.</li>
            <li> but it was nothing like what some of the other reviews stated.  </li>
            <li> i would use this 2 days and the other 1 if it wasn&#x27;t for my skin feeling like it was one fire</li>
            <li> as with my other lotions that i buy i try them at the salon that i go to</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t itch like some of the other tingles I&#x27;ve used though.</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing it had tingle from the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I used this just once and within 60 seconds of application i began to feel an extreme burning sensation all over the applied area.</li>
            <li> i was worried about all the reviews saying EXTREME tingle.</li>
            <li> :( I love the tingle and color</li>
            <li> I feel this product should have been labeled correctly with extreme tingle in the description.</li>
            <li> it makes you think it is working harder!</li>
            <li> We have never had a problem with other Millennium products but this one started burning as soon as we put it on.</li>
            <li> have used tons of different types of tanning lotions in the past - and still do - some with tingle and some without, some with and without bronzers - and NONE of them have ever had this reaction with my kids at all.  </li>
            <li> this is like paint in a bottle will leave your skin discolored in sections and not colored in other sections</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting the same wimpy tingle as I usually get......</li>
            <li> Its extreme tingle.</li>
            <li> But other than that i plan on buying this product again</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker with the other lotions I was using so  </li>
            <li> &amp;  I go about every other day.)&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and the smell isn&#x27;t as harsh as other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It said EXTREME tingle.</li>
            <li> I tried mixing with other lotions to dilute the smell but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Be Careful!</li>
            <li> and i have to say after using this i cant even tell any of my other lotions</li>
            <li> Was not hot at all on the body to me.</li>
            <li> I had 3 other people try a test spot on their arm</li>
            <li> this one was extreme.  </li>
            <li> It got me to a level in tan after one use I never got with any other lotion before.</li>
            <li> I did not have these issues with the other 3 Millennium tanning lotions I mentioned.  </li>
            <li> other then then</li>
            <li> Causes the skin to get a rash for about two hours so extremely unnatural sensation.  </li>
            <li> the weird, but pungent smell was the first obstacle.</li>
            <li> alternating every other day.</li>
            <li> I tried the Insanely Black and it was not very tingely at all..</li>
            <li> I honestly cannot believe this company is allowed to sell such a terrible product.</li>
            <li> It was bad enough that my husband noticed the smell right away.  </li>
            <li> There is something in it that is not right.</li>
            <li> However, this particular tanning lotion was not pleasant at all!  </li>
            <li> The only down side... hard to believe there is one</li>
            <li> It made me soo dark</li>
            <li> It was pretty painful but only lasted about one minute.  </li>
            <li> No golden ticket for me.</li>
            <li> talk about feeling like your on fire, but it got me SO ridiculously dark.</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you REAL color, not all of the fake bronzers that come off in the shower.</li>
            <li> I got dark with just one use.</li>
            <li> So as soon as you are done tanning you are instantly dark.</li>
            <li> Gets you dark.</li>
            <li> I am getting really dark.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money...if I had gotten on sooner I would have returned and asked for my money back..trashing it</li>
            <li> You should be dark already before using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my understanding that it say was supposed to be a dark bronzer; however, I read all 172 comments</li>
            <li> after that my body was use to it and now after 4 times using i am Dark.  </li>
            <li> but I can say I was so dark</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how dark I was I like the results but not the pain involved</li>
            <li> It does get me dark</li>
            <li> You either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> I upped my time to 10 then 12 again and the burn and red of the lotion has gone down with each use, BUT still gives me a KILLER tan!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Solid Black for the past few weeks, but I feel like my skin eventually stopped getting darker.</li>
            <li> hours later you look tan!!Can mess with you by making it hard to breath because of the feeling of being on Fire but the over all it makes you tan</li>
            <li> so I was let down.</li>
            <li> I had to lie down for an hour before washing it off in shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not let down at all buy purchasing this lotion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was watered down or what the deal was</li>
            <li> Was the only time I ever felt like I was burning in the tanning bed, &amp; wasn&#x27;t able to shower for longer than a day due to traveling &amp; broke out in a horrible itchy bumpy rash all over.</li>
            <li> i had a little burning sensation nothing to extreme</li>
            <li> But other than that, OUCH!</li>
            <li> right away- even in a cold bed.  </li>
            <li> Insanely Black will get you extremely dark.</li>
            <li> What I do now is apply this from my neck down, and then I grab my wife&#x27;s Black Night</li>
            <li> i used insanely black from the neck down got into the booth</li>
            <li> But I Have used a few other tingler samples &amp; went ahead and bought this.</li>
            <li> This paticular lotion was very extreme, It felt like it was literally burning my skin off, could not use on my face at all had to wipe it off as soon as I put it on it</li>
            <li> When I reorder I will definitely order insanely Black !!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for the price, i expected to get crap in a bottle, but this stuff WORKS!</li>
            <li> With insanely black, I don&#x27;t feel the tingle until about 7-8 minutes in..</li>
            <li> I bought Insanely Black and Paint</li>
            <li> It Black together as a deal.</li>
            <li> Paint It Black.  </li>
            <li> It Black.</li>
            <li> So i bought this and black storm</li>
            <li> i now swear by black storm and</li>
            <li> Insanely black produces the strongest tingle I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It Black 50X and apply that to my face.</li>
            <li> It Black 50X.</li>
            <li> the inside of my car is black</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like a slight burning sensation, do not purchase this lotion.</li>
            <li> and she even said something smelled odd and blamed it on a leak in the roof of the building.</li>
            <li> I think everyone should try this lotion because if you want results, try insanely black you will get what you paid for and get results</li>
            <li> My husband is hook to this lotion, he has been using it for about a year an a half now.</li>
            <li> There is a slight tingle with this product</li>
            <li> it Black 50x</li>
            <li> (Any indoor tanning leaves an odd scent afterwards, some lotion masks</li>
            <li> I came across Insanely Black and started reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> Ive tried Millenium tanning lotions previously</li>
            <li> Insanely black does say it has a tingle factor</li>
            <li> it Black lotion</li>
            <li> When tanning with this product I HAD TO CUT MY TANNING IN HALF</li>
            <li> I tried the Insanely Black</li>
            <li> Secondly, I like serious tingle</li>
            <li> it black</li>
            <li> One of the best  tingle lotions out, gets you so dark after about 3-4 uses, only bad thing is the after smell, one of the worst after tan odors ever..</li>
            <li> The tingle is not nearly as strong as other lotions I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> as I could before getting in the bed, however I did end up with a small bit of staining on my hands, which is to be expected.</li>
            <li> the brief contact i had with my boyfriend before showering was not good for him.</li>
            <li> I was a mess for about 15 min&lt;</li>
            <li> but it is just not right for me!</li>
            <li> Also I do have to complain That the bronzer that is in this product If you rub it in too hard or it gets dry crumbles...</li>
            <li> It provides a very natural looking tan but it is not for the faint of heart .</li>
            <li> Plus, I got ridiculously dark!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve been really dark!</li>
            <li> It was far worse than Chicken Pox, far worse than any amount of Mosquito bites, far worse than any possible \\&quot;itching\\</li>
            <li> Immediately took a shower and I was covered in little bumps.</li>
            <li> Not fun!</li>
            <li> A little watery though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it burns a little, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> got a little bit of a difference in color today,</li>
            <li> A little streaky but defiantly has the tingle.</li>
            <li> It seemed stinky to me, it smelled a little like diesel oil.</li>
            <li> I suggest you start with something a little lighter.</li>
            <li> The tingle was NOT unbearable and IM SOOOO DARK!</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m so dark!</li>
            <li> Granted, I did go a little lighter on my face than I did on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> , I get so dark with this lotion!</li>
            <li> but the lotion gives you a little burning feelings from the begining,even before you start tanning.</li>
            <li> But it is less and less with each use!</li>
            <li> He has such a hard time tanning and this got him dark in just a few times of using it!!</li>
            <li> BE VERY CAREFUL USING THIS PRODUCT, TRY ON A SMALL PATCH OF SKIN BEFORE USE.</li>
            <li> I wear 11 size I did have to go with 11E because shoe was little mor narrow than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> It took a minute, but then I felt like Smaug was breathing fire down upon me!</li>
            <li> I have been and am very dark.</li>
            <li> I tan everyday, rotating lotions &amp; I</li>
            <li> it only gets WORSE after you tan.</li>
            <li> I just got this product today and used it a few hours ago...</li>
            <li> There is no burning while applying, but it begins a few minutes after laying in a bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So unless you like the burn I wouldn&#x27;t get this it will be a waste of money</li>
            <li> I tan 2-3 times a week year round.</li>
            <li> it kinda of freaked me out because within a few min of laying in the tanning bed it started burning alittle..</li>
            <li> Just using it a few times I was a shade darker and keeps me tan longer.  </li>
            <li> The product stains your skin and washes off in a few days......</li>
            <li> I am a year round tanner and have been tanning for about 3 years.</li>
            <li> Not tingly but don&#x27;t shower for a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few years now</li>
            <li> I am a year round tanner, so I am always looking for diff tanning lotions to use.  </li>
            <li> After a few hours it would go away and then a tan would appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it everyday when I go tanning and</li>
            <li> From just the smell of it I would not tell any one to buy this product,it stained my hands orange just in a few</li>
            <li> Google Amazon and get a few bottles now.  </li>
            <li> this stuff burns bad the tingle so so strong,even before i went in the bed,it started burning right away,and m bro had to go wash it off</li>
            <li> I will stick to Black Storm!</li>
            <li> ive always used a tingle lotion and this was no where to being TOO extreme hardly felt tingle at all.</li>
            <li> I have used three other Millennium tanning products (Black Storm, Solid Black, Paint It Black) and this one (Insanely Black) is BY FAR the worst.  </li>
            <li> This will definitely give you an extra dark tan!&lt;br /&gt;For those who can&#x27;t take the tingle, the product could be painful</li>
            <li> When I say slight burning sensation, I mean slight.</li>
            <li> The ATO isn&#x27;t bad either, although I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell in general.</li>
            <li> So, after the first two insane applications I completely gave up applying to any part of my head.</li>
            <li> My entire arm was burning, pulsating, extremly red, had white spots, and painful!</li>
            <li> the tingle and hot feeling is not as bad on the legs at all.</li>
            <li> It burns really bad, but gets you SO tan SO fast!</li>
            <li> Then whole body was shaking and got sick to my stomach for about hour and half after</li>
            <li> Took about 30 min for my heart to slow down.  </li>
            <li> I mean you will get dark.</li>
            <li> My face turned beat red, the whites of my eyes were turning red and my eyes were watering bad.</li>
            <li> When I used the product again in the tanning bed it burned twice as bad and left me twice as red all over.  </li>
            <li> I called the company today to advise them and the guy was so RUDE and could care less what happened to me</li>
            <li> This lotion does get very hot so have a base tan before using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if he just got a reaction to it or what.</li>
            <li> When I tan, I usually go in for about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> tried it on my abdomen on a small spot.  </li>
            <li> To say this sensation is merely a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; is a disgustingly gross understatement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many lotions, but this one tops my list as the worst and most dangerous!!!!</li>
            <li> Will never be using this product again and definitely not pleased.</li>
            <li> Should come with warning label to try on small patch of skin.</li>
            <li> Will never apply any lotion again before using on a small patch of skin.</li>
            <li> this shit sucks.</li>
            <li> I saw a noticeable difference from my usual lotion (DS Bellezza).  </li>
            <li> and that was the most awful tanning session I ever had I actuall</li>
            <li> It made me feel like I had creepy crawlyies all over and turned my skin a patchy red.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> bottle says on back (Not for the faint of heart)</li>
            <li> This helps push past a plateau.</li>
            <li> After about two minutes in the tanning bed, I felt physically ill and actually had to stop tanning.  </li>
            <li> I knew from past experiences, that these types of lotions tingled and gave me a &amp;#34;flushed&amp;#34; appearance, but this</li>
            <li> So I tried it on a small spot on my arm then waited then my legs...</li>
            <li> I am not sure what is in it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update*****&lt;br /&gt;I been using this for the past week</li>
            <li> I can go out for a little bit and build up my tan without looking ridiculous in the process.</li>
            <li> Thing is some people hate the tingle burn and some love it in a weird way.</li>
            <li> It was such a horrible experience that I ended up throwing the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a base tan I would recommend achieving that first level of tan before using tingle lotion.</li>
            <li> It gets you brown, not orange, and lotions like that are extremely hard to find.</li>
            <li> tanner, so it was hard to find something that would get me even darker, without turning me orange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard to tan and this stuff gives you a tingle in your skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard to tan</li>
            <li> It is doubtful i will use this product again because I am not a masochist, although I would certainly recommend it to someone I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> and it sucks</li>
            <li> complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> Well, me at least, but people seem to like that.</li>
            <li> I use it at least once a week alternating with bronzers.</li>
            <li> This burns your skin like crazy and leaves you red as a tomato when you leave the tanning bed, if you like a tingle lotion this is for you!  </li>
            <li> I even have tried lathering it on thickly</li>
            <li> but it slowly went away</li>
            <li> Well like a lot of other reviews have stated this stuff burns!!!!  </li>
            <li> Informed that the Insanely title of this lotion was due to the tingle being intense.</li>
            <li> I mean BURN.  </li>
            <li> DONT FORGET TO DO A TEST ON A SMALL PATCH OF SKIN BEFORE YOU PUT THIS LOTION ALL OVER YOUR SKIN!</li>
            <li> When I say immediately, I mean literally within 60 seconds of application.</li>
            <li> People should know that tingle doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it tingles, some just gives off heat</li>
            <li> The serious redness went away after about 4 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  seriously in loooove with this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I believe serious harm can be done to your skin.</li>
            <li> Should have read details has a serious tingle/burning sensation.</li>
            <li> This was ridiculously tingly and without any bronzing or darkening power.</li>
            <li> This is serious tingle.</li>
            <li> I got a really bad allergic reaction to the lotion, and my skin burned for hours, and was red and swollen for days.&lt;br /&gt;Never going to use it again, waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Then it started warming up a little, but it was nothing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> This actually burned my skin so bad  </li>
            <li> It consisted of a red painful skin reaction and burning of the skin along with increase in temperature of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells terrible but again still worth it</li>
            <li> Not so thin it doesn&#x27;t cover and not so thick it takes for ever to put on.</li>
            <li> when I want to look a few shades darker in one tan session since I noticed a lot of people said the second time you use a tingle lotion its not as bad!</li>
            <li> I recommend this lotion for anyone who has tried at least one other tingle before and wasn&#x27;t too badly affected by the sensation.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got home I stripped down and got in and took a cold shower.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> Apply evenly and carefully, especially if you do not have a base tan.</li>
            <li> Also when using tingle you NEVER shower after because it makes it worse.</li>
            <li> However this was the WORSE exp I have ever had.</li>
            <li> and I have never experienced anything like this.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t annoying enough to me to discount the quality of its effectiveness and rating.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute worst tanning lotion I have ever used in my life.  </li>
            <li> Are you game?</li>
            <li> I have tried the other lotions with no negitive problems but this one is bad.</li>
            <li> Then when I got out of the tanning bed the serious burning started!</li>
            <li> This lotion packs a serious punch!  </li>
            <li> It may give decent color but do not be deceived, this will drive you insane!..</li>
            <li> What I did not have was a high tolerance for shear horrible agony.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out and the smell isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> this is BY FAR the WORST smelling one out there.</li>
            <li> i immediately stripped down and laid on the cold kitchen floor!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different lotions and this one has very bad bronzers that leave you orange.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and after the tan, my skin was very red like I had a very bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> makes you dark but like fake bronzer it washes off even after waiting hours to shower :(</li>
            <li> Product should be taken off market dangerous my face was seriously burned</li>
            <li> Had a base tan now very Dark...  </li>
            <li> I have always used a tingle and this one is honestly not that bad.</li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> I had to get back into the shower to rinse, because it burned so bad!!!</li>
            <li> It Burned a lot - it truly is not for the faint of heart like the directions say.</li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong, it is somewhat tingly.</li>
            <li> I feel should be off the market, if you have to feel like this to get a tan, sad.</li>
            <li> The heat from the inside of the CAR ALONE made my skin burn worse!</li>
            <li> I was in pain and  uncomfortable for hours.</li>
            <li> i thought something was wrong till i was telling him about the burning and he informed me it said so on the bottle.</li>
            <li> ill never buy another tannin product off line.</li>
            <li> needless to say</li>
            <li> /&gt;After 6 times of tanning, my face doesn&#x27;t burn prior to tanning and my body doesn&#x27;t insanely itch afterwards.</li>
            <li> WTF.  </li>
            <li> seriously, I thought I was going to need to go to the emergency room thats how bad it was.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this for it is not for the faint hearted !!!</li>
            <li> Just got this today and after reading the horrible reviews I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Well, as soon as I sat down at class my classmates surrounding me started to complain about a terrible moldy smell that lingered throughout the classroom.</li>
            <li> Its Green and smells terrible.</li>
            <li> it is the concern on how dangerous this product is.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but I just don&#x27;t feel it like others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I thought she was crazy until I decided to try it myself.</li>
            <li> it was crazy people thought I got sprayed tanned</li>
            <li> Holy co w did it burn to the point I thought something was terribly wrong!</li>
            <li> Needless to say ya need a shower before coming in contact with anyone!</li>
            <li> AND ILL NEVER USE ANOTHER LOTION AGAIN!</li>
            <li> So disappointed, after 3 uses, hoping I was wrong and would get a result, I gave it away to a friend.</li>
            <li> this was the worst possible itching i have ever endured, almost driving me insane.</li>
            <li> Made me feel sick &amp; very faint.</li>
            <li> Id fry and burn up badly</li>
            <li> so it might not be as bad for some people afterwards.</li>
            <li> Burnt me soooo bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, its not that bad.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how bad it burned from the moment in my hand and for hours after.</li>
            <li> than it being a bad lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> SO BAD</li>
            <li> This burned so badly.</li>
            <li> but after a couple uses my body doesnt burn as bad &amp; i still feel the tingle</li>
            <li> I am not one to write bad reviews on things</li>
            <li> to bad when you get use to it.</li>
            <li> The tingle in this feels like really bad sun burn.</li>
            <li> This burnt me so bad.</li>
            <li> I almost had to go to the docter to stop it from burning and it broke me out so bad.</li>
            <li> and I had to get an IV with Benadryl because this irratated me so badly.</li>
            <li> i had to return this because it burned my skin so bad</li>
            <li> But feels like a bad sun burn</li>
            <li> still burning so bad I started to cry.  </li>
            <li> no I didn&#x27;t like it ,,, it was bad</li>

            <li> I  Have never had a bad reaction to any tanning lotion</li>
            <li> but I have to shower after using it because the lotion burns so bad.</li>
            <li> It feels like a incredibly bad sunburn for up to two hours, for me atleast.</li>
            <li> The pain was almost unbearable, and I didn&#x27;t know how bad it would hurt, and my friend made me try it, knowingly that I&#x27;d hurt.</li>
            <li> this lotion will give you color and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.  </li>
            <li> It burns so bad and gets on everything and anything you touch.</li>
            <li> Hurts badly.</li>

            <li> but it gave me this sick feeling.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was going to get sick.</li>
            <li> u can get lightheaded and feel sick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think it made my skin darker so very disappointed because it was expensive too.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is ok. I really expected moor. so I was let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m somewhat new to the world of tanning and tanning accelerators, but this stuff definitely makes you darker!!! I&#x27;ve been using Solid Black for the past few weeks, but I feel like my skin eventually stopped getting darker. I&#x27;m preparing for a bodybuilding competition, so I want to get a nice dark base tan before I spray. In any case, this stuff definitely helped get me to the next level. The major downside is that the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; is more like a burning sensation. In fact, it felt like someone dowsed my skin with gasoline and lit it on fire :( I was somewhat red for several hours after tanning, but the red eventually faded and I have a nice dark brown now. I&#x27;m sure people will complain about the burning sensation and the red skin, but I think that&#x27;s just par for the course with this product. If you want to be tan, you have to just suck it up and deal, folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not suggest using this unless you already have a good solid base tan. Even with that, my gym only allows 10 minute tanning sessions at a time in moderately intense stand-up beds.</li>
            <li> This product works great indoor or outdoor for a ridiculously dark tan.</li>
            <li> Omg, I am absolutely in love with this lotion! I had been tanning for about 2 weeks with a pretty good bronzer to build up a base tan and decided I wanted to kick it up a notch. Used it for the first time yesterday during my lunch break.. it definitely has the tingle factor, but I love tingle. Probably not for someone who doesn&#x27;t know what to expect, lol. The smell is nice,  not overbearing at all and it went on very smooth. I made sure to rub it in well and wiped my hands as best as I could before getting in the bed, however I did end up with a small bit of staining on my hands, which is to be expected. When I got up this morning I was noticeably darker and extremely happy. Today I went again and wow! When I got back to work, my usual delivery driver commented on how tan I seemed to get overnight and said it looked extremely natural! Obviously my self confidence is through the roof right now. Lol... This is definitely a must try for anyone who wants quick results and can take the heat :-)</li>
            <li> Its Green and smells terrible. Not happy</li>
            <li> I have never used a &amp;#34;:tingle&amp;#34; product before and was weary about if it would work. This stuff is amazing!!! Just a warning to anyone that is not accustomed to anything that tingles , use a little first. I put on a light coat of this on my legs and didnt notice any tingle right away so I applied another light layer. WOW!!!! within 5 minutes I felt like I had been in the sun unprotected for an hour or more!! My legs were on FIRE!! It was tolerable but next time I will not use 2 layers at a time.&lt;br /&gt;For the price this stuff is amazing and I am so very happy I chose this product instead of the other ones out there that are more costly!! I can not wait to wear my summer clothing now and show off the awesome color I have achieved with this product!!  I am so very happy that I found this product.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews before buying I saw alot of people refer to this product as very intense. I did not find that the case when using it. It did leave a good color and seemed to leave my skin soft. I would recommend this to anyone that is tanning that wants something that leaves a good color.</li>
            <li> this product works like is says and then some, my bronze last days and my tan is darker quicker than with any other lotions, and i am a tanning lotion junkie.</li>
            <li> New at this tanning thing, Wasn&#x27;t sure what I was looking for or what to look for so this happen to be my first pick. My Results are amazing. I was really light and being out in the sun, Id fry and burn up badly could never hold a pretty golden tan like most.. I give this product ***** a five!!! My skin is amazing looking and I will order this again in the future :D</li>
            <li> Their not kidding when they said insanely... insanely tingly! This formula sure does have a tingle- It takes some getting used to but it is definitely a great bronzer!</li>
            <li> I love this tingle lotion. I purchased it before and I was very pleased I was able to find it again at a great price!</li>
            <li> sorry but this had a terrible odor not a fragrance.  Actually threw it out and did not use it since the smell was too much.</li>
            <li> I put the lotion on and it felt like it was burning my skin and my ball sack. I have tried the other lotions with no negitive problems but this one is bad.</li>
            <li> My entire body was bright red even in places I didn&#x27;t apply (face &amp; bloodshot eyes). It was more of a 6 hour burning process rather than a tingle. Didn&#x27;t see any change in color after one use and will be returning this item asap. Made me sick for over 24 hours and I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin or a sensitive stomach, and tan regularly year round.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell so have to shower after using. Have to watch how much you use and how well you rub it in. I have found the palms of my hand to look off color and blotchy. If you know and are careful that won&#x27;t happen. Use nit every weekend and I keep a great color tan!</li>
            <li> This is a great tingling lotion that isn&#x27;t too strong but still makes you super dark, the best one I&#x27;ve tried so far. I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> After looking at several different tanning lotions, I decided to purchase Insanely Black, and I&#x27;m in love with this product. After just one use the difference is truly noticeable! My summer glow has arrived and I love it. I would recommend this product to anyone. Especially to those of you that don&#x27;t think you like bronzers and tingle lotions. Insanely Black will quickly make you change your outlook, I know it did for me!!! :)</li>
            <li> I loved the color I got from this.  Yes it does get warm and I stayed warm for a little while after I got our of the tanning bed but it was nothing like what some of the other reviews stated.  The redness faded overnight and I am very pleased with my color.  I will most definitely continue to use this.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!! I GOT SOOOO DARK VERY QUICKLY!! THE TAN LASTED OVER A MONTH SINCE I WENT TANNING!! WONDERFUL PRODUCT!! U WILL LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> It smells good. The tingle is not as strong as I expected. And the bronzer shows up between your fingers after applying it.</li>
            <li> I like the product ok but I do not care for the smell.  I was hoping for a little more out of this product.</li>
            <li> It works great, I love this product.  I personally love tingle lotion so I would recommend this to anyone to wants to kick their tanning up a notch.</li>
            <li> Well just felt tingly with the first 15 mins on. Then when I got out of the tanning bed the serious burning started! Holy co w did it burn to the point I thought something was terribly wrong! It ended after about a hour later however. The serious redness went away after about 4 hours. Had a awesome tan after all of this though! I would only use thos once and awhile because the burning was almost unbearable but it did really improve my tan...</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m currently switching back and forth with this and solid black 100x every other day. i&#x27;m using the two lotions together to get both the effects of a bronzer and a tingler. i tan every day and this is by far my favorite lotion. it smells great, i still get that after tan smell but i think you&#x27;ll always get that tanning indoors. as all tanning lotions you just have to make sure you rub it in well or you&#x27;ll be streaky. i would recommend this for more advanced tanners or for someone who&#x27;s used tinglers before. you get super red and hot after but my tan is fabulous after only using a week and a half and i definitely don&#x27;t think it would be this tan just using a bronzer. the first time i used this i&#x27;m not going to lie i thought i was going to die, the tingle is that intense but the more i&#x27;ve used this the more i&#x27;ve been getting used to it and can stand the feeling. i&#x27;m telling you your results are so worth it! i also live three blocks from my tanning salon and walk there and back in the heat so it might not be as bad for some people afterwards. i would use this 2 days and the other 1 if it wasn&#x27;t for my skin feeling like it was one fire</li>
            <li> It is very hot! I seen results within 2 days of tanning!! It made me soo dark I loved it!! I will use this every year going forward to achieve my summer glow</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tingle lotion,&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered my 2d bottle,&amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to that in a tanning salon</li>
            <li> I have used many different tanning lotions over the years and have NEVER had anything that BURNS like this one does.  Not only does it burn but it leaves your skin extremely RED for hours after application.  So forget even going out in public right after tanning with this lotion unless you want people to think you just made it back from a trip to the surface of the sun itself.</li>
            <li> this is the third time ive used a tingle lotion although ive tanned a lot.this lotion is super hot and definetly not for someone who doesnt prefer the hot and tingly sensation.on the other hand if you do this lotion is awesome and you get good results after one use.i wouldnt put it on your face unless you are familiar with what that feels like!i would buy again especially for the price .you cant beat it!</li>
            <li> I receieved my product quickly and have used it many times; the bronzer is amazing but this lotion dries out my skin so much I can barely make it through my 15 minute session! I even have tried lathering it on thickly but it doesn&#x27;t help. I am disappointed that it leaves me so dry because otherwise I think it is a good product, however, once this bottle is empty I don&#x27;t believe I will be purchasing it again. On a lighter note- the Blackberry Citrus does smell fantastic :)</li>
            <li> I use tingle lotions all the time. I tried the Insanely Black and it was not very tingely at all.. It did give me some color but not what I expected. People that like an intense tingle lotion, I would try something else. This lotion has a very very slight tingle, it does have a wonderful smell though.</li>
            <li> Why tan when you can put this on and look and feel like you have a horrible sun burn?  It hurts. Tanning lotion should not hurt. I look like a lobster.  They should re-name it Fire Ants Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> I have never used a tingle lotion before so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. The first time I used it I burnt. But someone told me that is what a tingle lotion does. That it irritates the skin and makes it burns at firt then turns to tan after? The smell before hand is nice. Kind of smells like something orange. However after I got out the tanning bed I did not like the smell at all. I normally don&#x27;t mind the smell of other lotions after getting out of the tanning bed but this one made me want to shower right away. Also, after I tanned I was holding my boyfriends hand and my arm was on his too, it ended up burning his skin. I&#x27;m not sure if he just got a reaction to it or what. The second time I used it i also used it with a lotion with more bronzer in it. I still felt a little burnt after but not as much. I still couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. I wont be buying this one again after I use this bottle. The only good thing that I would have to say about this is i feel like it is getting me tanner.</li>
            <li> LOL, if you read all the reviews that give this one or two stars you might find that most of them were just inexperienced users or just plain irresponsible users. This is an extreme tingle for avid tingle users and experienced tanners and you need to spot test if you are unsure. Tingle lotions work better than anything else because they stimulate your blood to the surface and encourage melanin production in your skin. They work best and that is just a fact. But newbies really should start with a warming lotion or a mild tingle. After enough use, you barely feel the tingle anymore. It is pretty unfair that people who dont know what they are messing with give great products like this poor rating when they do exactly what they are supposed to do. So go for it experienced tingle tanners! It will help change your color and break through that wall!</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff is the bomb.com! I mean amazing! I did a spot test when I first got it to make sure it wouldn&#x27;t burn me bad, and all I got to say is WOW! I did a spot test on my belly, so now I have a big brown polka dot on my belly! I love this stuff! My polka dot is literally 4 shades darker than the rest of my belly. It is really hot though, like your on fire! I think it&#x27;s well worth the pain and the cost! Wonderful, I will definitely be using this stuff again! &lt;3</li>
            <li> This is a great tingle lotion for experienced tanners.  I didn&#x27;t Feel like this lotion is any \\&quot;hotter\\&quot; than most tingle lotions!  I tan everyday, rotating lotions &amp; I feel like this is a great lotion to rotate if you have reached a plateau in your tan.</li>
            <li> Worked okay. Made my skin really red and I didn&#x27;t like that. It also tingled and I didn&#x27;t enjoy it much</li>
            <li> You want tan, you get tan with this!!! 2 to 5 times is all you really need. Works under sun and tanning bed the same. Thing is some people hate the tingle burn and some love it in a weird way. To me the tingle is great. You either love it or hate it. i gave been using this for 2 years and i love it!</li>
            <li> Was OK but kinda watery...</li>
            <li> Burnt me soooo bad. I hurt for over a week.</li>
            <li> Okay! I just used this product 3 hours ago!  I was pretty tan before I used this.  This is the first time I have used a \\&quot;Tingle\\&quot; lotion before! WOW. In some places, it started burning right when I put it on...I mean BURN.  It was pretty painful but only lasted about one minute.  It tingled the whole time I was in the bed but it wasn&#x27;t too painful.  I put it on my face and I know alot of people say don&#x27;t do that!  I think my face is the only part of my body that isn&#x27;t itchy/burnt feeling right now.  It did get a little red right after I finished tanning but not bad at all...I will say that I barely put any on my face and I put it on my face last.  After about 1 hour my arms were burning/itching pretty bad and my legs just felt really burnt!!  I took a quick cold shower and rubbed some aloe on and about 20 minutes later started feeling better.  I look WAY darker and am not orange at all...I always put my lotion on evenly and never OVERLOAD! I looked really burnt at first but right now I look TAN!  I can&#x27;t decide if it was worth the pain!  While i was burning/itching I was thinking I will never use this again but now I might use it every once in a while when I want to look a few shades darker in one tan session since I noticed a lot of people said the second time you use a tingle lotion its not as bad!</li>
            <li> If you like the burning sensation, then its the perfect product for you. The people who rated it 1 star did so because they obviously want the color results without the pain or sensation. You have to like the tingle to like this product. I tried it once..too hot for me. Out of control was pretty hot, but this stuff is definitely hotter. And to the person crying about looking like an oompa loompa, umm that sounds like a good tingle to me. You&#x27;re supposed to be RED, the longer the better and that the deeper your color will be later. Enjoy the burning it gets fun after the first...3 or 4 times I&#x27;d say. But don&#x27;t put it on your face..you just never know. There&#x27;s so many blood vessels in your face and a product this strong can rush those to the surface and that causes damage over time. Its powerful! Use luminary on your face, its the best.</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I tried this product as a sample only.  I&#x27;m an experienced indoor tanner and I have NEVER had a tanning product leave my skin this DRY!  It felt great when I applied it but very quickly dried up in the tanning bed.  By the time I showered, I was flaky dry (not burnt).  Color is great, smell is okay but I won&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. Work&#x27;s awesome. I believe the \\&quot;insanely\\&quot; part of the name is for the tingle. It&#x27;s pretty extreme.</li>
            <li> as with my other lotions that i buy i try them at the salon that i go to and i loved it. its a HIGH tingle &amp; as do other high tingles do it leaves u itchy after which is NORMAL. i loved the dark color it gave me because i am fair skinned !!! but he only down side i felt that it left my skin very dry . i don&#x27;t think it has a lot of moisturizers in it . so i don&#x27;t use it that often for that reason but when i was an extra dark factor in my color i turn to it ..just not as a regular lotion :) &amp; for the price you cant beat it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite lotions!!!!! I can&#x27;t stand going into the tanning bed and feeling like I got nothing! With insanely black, I don&#x27;t feel the tingle until about 7-8 minutes in.. The tingle lasts a good while--but what tingle doesn&#x27;t? If you like tingles, I would HIGHLY recommend this lotion! Plus, I got ridiculously dark! The smell---ehhh... it smells like tingle. Tingle has a distinctive smell..</li>
            <li> It does just what it says works very well dont use too much because u do feel the burning and tingling sensations...</li>
            <li> This product came in just a few days and worked wonderfully. But if you don&#x27;t like a tingle lotion this is not the product for you. But it gave wonderful results and I was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned for years and used various lotions.  This one I absolutely hated!  I&#x27;ve never turned orange from tanning beds or lotions and I literally looked like an oompa loompa.  No golden ticket for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Will definitely be ordering it again. Very satisfied with service and delivery.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I am addicted to tingles now and this one gives me great color! I love when th workers at sun tan city are jealous of my color ! That&#x27;s when you know it&#x27;s really working! I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This product is definately a burn. I heard about its effects and just rubbed a little on the back side of my hand. 5 min later my hand was very RED and had a strong burning sensation. In a discouraged rage I ran to my friend and he insisted that these were the intended results. This puzzled me as I wondered who would want a sunburn with or without the sun??</li>
            <li> I bought and used this product from amazon 3 days ago.  I am very fair skinned and had been going to the tanning bed for nearly a month with no results.  After reading tons of reviews I decided on a tingle lotion and this because of the price.  The smell is really nice and  I was very pleased that the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; sensation was not super intense for me and I really only started feeling it after 5 minutes in our stand up bed.  I was really red and itchy for about an hour after but it slowly went away and I was definitely darker than before. I am happy and will be using it again tomorrow!</li>
            <li> Love it it arrived on time and it does the job</li>
            <li> I am an experienced tanner and was looking for something w/ tingle that tans fast...I bought Insanely Black and Paint It Black together as a deal. I had never used either but a friend recommended Paint It Black.  I did a patch test w/ both and the Paint It Black was fine, no sensation...the Insanely Black on the other hand is EXTREMELY hot and has A LOT of tingle and will turn you VERY RED!  I knew I would not be able to stand laying in the tanning bed w/ that on so I mixed 2 teaspoons of Insanely Black with 3 Tablespoons of Paint It Black. Thats my formula, I mix it and put it in a travel size squirt bottle. Its enough for 2-3 sessions. It gives a light tingle and warmth and a little redness but I can still tell a big difference in my tan.  After using it for 3 days I could see a significant improvement in my tan.  I&#x27;m tanning fast and evenly and it looks great!  Insanely is not for those w/ sensitive skin (like mine) so please mix it w/ something if you use it! I&#x27;m very satisfied w/ the results of both lotions.</li>
            <li> This smells AWFUL!!! And, don&#x27;t let the smell out of the bottle fool you- it only gets WORSE after you tan. Disgusting! It reminded me of a mix between Nair and a cheap self tanning lotion- after it processes. Never again! I&#x27;ve been tanning for 10 years, using tingles for 6 and this is BY FAR the WORST smelling one out there. You&#x27;re better off with... well ANYTHING but this one if you don&#x27;t want to reek the rest of your day!     F.Y.I. All you complaining about showering afterwards- that REACTIVATES the tingle chemicals in the lotion.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different lotions and this one has very bad bronzers that leave you orange. The tingle isn&#x27;t that good and it didn&#x27;t increase my tan the way you would think it should. I am going back to swedish beauty.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I am a person who wants to look like I just went tanning. I like the instant gratification  :) it would be VERY difficult for me to find a better lotion.. However it&#x27;s not for someone with sensitive skin or someone who doesn&#x27;t like the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; aspect of a dark tanning lotion. Which I love and that&#x27;s why I gave this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day i tried insanely black. I wanted to try it cuz of the reviews. I was looking for something with a good tingle but also with bronzer. Well this has both. I thought it would be alot hotter than what it was but I have been using tingle for awhile. It mmay be alot hotter to someone who doesnt use tingle.I can see that the bronzers did give me good color. I was hoping it would help me with my \\&quot;tanning plateau\\&quot;. I only tan in spring and summer and i always just stop getting any darker after awhile. Im going to use it a little longer to see if it works better. Overall it seems to be good for the price $15. Ive paid more than that for alot less results.</li>
            <li> Insanely black tanning lotion left no streaks and I saw results after using it twice! I love it. seller shipped in 3 days which was great!</li>
            <li> I just got this product today and used it a few hours ago...talk about feeling like your on fire, but it got me SO ridiculously dark. The tingle lotions are very well known for breaking the plateau if you&#x27;re having trouble getting any darker using regular lotions. This lotion gives you REAL color, not all of the fake bronzers that come off in the shower. I literally got four shades darker just within one use in a regular bed in a fifteen minute session. I would definitely recommend this lotion. It&#x27;s really intense but it works very well. It gets you brown, not orange, and lotions like that are extremely hard to find.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion, it is by far the most intense tingler I have ever used!! It goes on very sheer and smooth so you dont have to use a lot, and I can feel it working right away- even in a cold bed.  I was several shades darker after the first time I used it, and I had even been using an excellent bronzer before I bought this lotion.  Its a whole new level of tan,  but I would definitely not recommend if for beginners, and dont put it on your face!</li>
            <li> A little too HOT for me !! I have used tingle lotions before but this one sat me on fire ! I couldn&#x27;t even stand to stay in my tanning bed the full time with this on, I had to get out and get in the shower to try to was some of the burning off. For someone that loves a good HOT BURNING TINGLE then this is definitely for them.</li>
            <li> I have tried many lotions and oils to get the perfect tan.  While there are lots of lotions out there that work great, this is the one I have found to be the fastest and most effective for my skin.    I received my lotion on Saturday which was also my first time to use it.  The tingle in it was definitely noticeable that first time, (I tanned for 20 minutes), but I noticed that it didn&#x27;t start to burn until about 10 minutes into my session.  Once I got out, it was like instant sunburn all over for about an hour.  The redness faded and right away I could tell a difference in the shade of my skin.  I used it again Sunday and noticed the tingle was a lot more tolerable and I was not as red at the end of my session, just \\&quot;sun-kissed\\&quot; looking.  Monday (yesterday) I used it and experienced no tingle, as I now have a good tan already.  Today everyone has commented on my glowing skin and they don&#x27;t believe me when I tell them I have only used it for 3 days.  It is definitely a noticeable difference and is the fastest I have ever achieved a tan.    My one and only complaint is the fact that it has such powerful bronzers in it, you must wash your hands after applying or you will get results like sunless tanning lotions where your fingers turn a slight orange.  Also, I would avoid using it on your face.  To tan my face, I use Black Night, which is definitely the perfect bronzing power for your face!  I highly recommend this product 120% for sure!</li>
            <li> I recently just used this lotion and I don&#x27;t think that I will be using it again. When I tan, I usually go in for about 10 minutes. I couldn&#x27;t even stay in for five. It started burning my skin and I had to get out. It hurt me to even put my clothes on. As soon as I got home I stripped down and got in and took a cold shower. That didn&#x27;t even help. It took about two hours to finally stop burning but I&#x27;m still really red. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Unless you like that kind of stuff.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion really works. Was not sure of it with the mixed reviews but this stuff is AWESOME!!!!!!. Had a base tan now very Dark...  The smell of the lotion is like an Orange Sherbert.... Leaves skin soft and DARK.... Got it at a great cost with free shipping..... Ordered lotion on a Friday and had it in hand on Monday will purchase product again... LOVE IT.... LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li> Not a high degree of tingle or bronzer. It is ok for a fill in lotion but doesn&#x27;t do what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I just got this stuff today. After not tanning for a week, I started to lose my tan and as soon as I used this.. I was more red than a cherry, ahha. It didn&#x27;t itch like some of the other tingles I&#x27;ve used though. It just got really warm. Even after a couple hours after using this product, I&#x27;ve got my dark tan back. Maybe even darker than I was last week. I like this stuff. The only down side, and the reason why I won&#x27;t give it 5 stars... this stuff STINKS! It has a slight smell of like.. candy, mixed with damp basement. Haha! I don&#x27;t know, its not that bad. But for me to personally enjoy a tanning lotion, its gotta smell fabulous. I felt like everybody could smell how stinky I was! Haha.&lt;br /&gt;Its worth a try with this price though!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend and I tried this product.  She applied normal amounts to cover skin until it starting hurting her.  The hurt lasted for about 2 hours, and it was severe.  It consisted of a red painful skin reaction and burning of the skin along with increase in temperature of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my abdomen on a small spot.  I felt a tingling but it was not horrible, but I would not apply any more than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result?  It did not help her with tanning any more than if she did not use product.  For me, it created a bluish bruise like lesion on the abdomen which lasted for about 7 days.  It was the 2 inches by 1 inch, just as I had applied the cream.  Thereafter, the skin change went away as if I had never tried the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are both physicians and white.  She is much more fair than I am, and I can tell you that this product does not work on our skin colors.  I do not recommend product.</li>
            <li> Not as dark as i expected, i bought one from wal mart and sorry to say but it works a lot better and darker faster and cheaper, not real happy with this product for the price.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with this product, but probably used it too soon. I wasn&#x27;t very tan at all the first time I used this product and it felt more like my skin was on fire than a tingle. I do have sensitive skin though and am pretty pale when I haven&#x27;t been tanning. The smell of the lotion wasn&#x27;t the best, but it wasn&#x27;t horrible either. I could tolerate it. I&#x27;m sure that when i try it again, I will have better results, because now, I actually have a good base tan and am not getting red at all when tanning. If you have sensitive skin, I would say to use caution with this product. Try it a couple times before you decide if you like it or not. This was my first tingle lotion and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with this lotion.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel like your on FIRE!! Makes your skin beet red then hours later you look tan!!Can mess with you by making it hard to breath because of the feeling of being on Fire but the over all it makes you tan faster!and try not to touch kids until you shower cause it rubs off on them and will make there skin look blistered for couple hours and make them feel like they got a  burn for couple hours,done this by accident !Needless to say ya need a shower before coming in contact with anyone!</li>
            <li> Always my go-to for tanning.  Love the tingle, smells insanely good.  Not for the novice tanner though.  But if you like a &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; tan - go for it!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing. It really makes you dark. It tingles at first, but then goes away. Product arrived quickly. I would recommend this product if you are looking for a deep dark tan :)</li>
            <li> I bought this knowing it had tingle from the other reviewers.  I had just started tanning again and forgot about tingle. After my initial burn from tanning I would go 3-4 times a week and just never felt like I was getting any color. So I decided to try this.  The tingle is somewhat strong especially on your face but I like it. I feel like the redness gives my stubborn ski a more lasting result.  The consistency is perfect. Not so thin it doesn&#x27;t cover and not so thick it takes for ever to put on. It also spreads fast, thorough and lasts long. The smell is ok, not great not horrible.. But who cares really. A slight downside is that it does seem to include a somewhat potent bronzer, so wash your hands well as soon as you can or you will get orange fingernails, etc. the plus is that the bronzer seems to give the rest of the body the right amount of color so I tend to leave it on a couple hours before showering it off,  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend leaving it on all night. All in all Im very happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product at all. It turned my skin red and it did not tingle my skin it made me feel as if I had laid out all day with baby oil and fried my skin. Maybe some people like that feeling but not me. Can&#x27;t give it away at my tanning salon. Sorry I hated it.</li>
            <li> So i bought this and black storm but this is my favorite of the two...im a sucker for tingles and this is the best tingle I&#x27;ve ever used.. i hadn&#x27;t tanned in over a month and the first day i went back i used black storm which got me sooo brown after only a 10 minute session...the next day i went for 12 minutes using this and WOW! It was EXTREMELY HOT! And was soooo red! My husband was laughing at me cuz i was so red and hot i immediately stripped down and laid on the cold kitchen floor! But after an hour the red hot wore off and after 3 hours i was sooo brown and it looked amazing!! It also evened out my skin and hubby noticed that it gave my skin a beautiful glow on top of being so brown... i now swear by black storm and insanely black being THE BEST.. I&#x27;ve been switching back and forth for 2 week now and these 2 lotions together have gotten me the DARKEST I HAVE EVER BEEN! And I&#x27;ve been really dark! I&#x27;ve had so many compliments its amazing! I am not tan... i am deep dark chocolate brown! Love it!</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves my skin soft and moisturized. I would not recommend this lotion for tanners who are just beginning, but it is great for an experienced tanner. The tingle begins to decrease after the first week or so of use. I think it is one of the best.</li>
            <li> Product should be taken off market dangerous my face was seriously burned</li>
            <li> Make sure you read the fine print. I didn&#x27;t and this is a mega tingle lotion. My fault totally. It set me on fire! It also has bronzer in it which I love. If you are a lover of the tingle lotions this is for you. If you can&#x27;t handle tingle do not buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> I had an instantaneous reaction to the lotion. About 5 minutes after I put it on my skin turned red and started itching.</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion product where it doesn&#x27;t make me look totally red instead of bronze.  Love this product and will always use now!</li>
            <li> I was completely unaware of what \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; meant.  So I purchased it and slathered it on my skin prior to my session.  60 seconds into the tanning session I had to get out and rush home after my skin felt like someone had poured sulfuric acid on my :D    Yeah, I will stick with regular bronzer with NO tingle</li>
            <li> First of all i must state that i have tanned several years and that i am not new to it. I have used several different lotions through out that time and they all gave me decent color. I used this just once and within 60 seconds of application i began to feel an extreme burning sensation all over the applied area. To say this sensation is merely a \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; is a disgustingly gross understatement. I felt as if my entire body had been dipped in hot wax. Now with that being said i told myself it must be that burning that gives me the good tan. So with out further adieu I got in to the bed and started tanning. Now a session that i normally would stay in for 15 minutes turned into about 9 minutes of hell as i was forced out of the bed by the extreme burning sensation. At this point i was anything but impressed by the lotion but thought nothing of it until later as i liked the color it gave me (a reddish dark color). Now i preceded to go work out and when i got home about 3 hours later, proceeded to take a shower. Now while i was drying off with my towel, i started to get a slight itching feeling all over the areas that i had applied the lotion to earlier and had just dried off. Now this next and final portion must be stated with a very grave warning. If the first burning sensation didn&#x27;t warn you, then i pray that this will. I swear by every thing i hold sacred this was the worst possible itching i have ever endured, almost driving me insane. It was far worse than Chicken Pox, far worse than any amount of Mosquito bites, far worse than any possible \\&quot;itching\\&quot; you could have imagined. And the worst part!... the more you scratched!.. the more you itched. Please heed my warning and do not use this lotion. It may give decent color but do not be deceived, this will drive you insane!.. they are not joking.    Thank you and best wishes.  Sincerely,  itdoesntmatter</li>
            <li> i have never bought tanning lotion online before, i normally buy it at the tanning salon and thought i could save a couple bucks. well make sure you read the fine print before purchasing. normally tanning is an enjoyable experience for me, most times i even take a nap in the tanning booth. this tingle lotion stung so bad i was not able to tan for more then 3 minutes, and normally i tan for the full 20.</li>
            <li> If you want tingle...you might like this. It does give a good tan if you can stand the BURN! I put it on after I got out of the shower and right before leaving to go tan. I had to get back into the shower to rinse, because it burned so bad!!! My feet were still burning 3 hours later!! I think I should have followed the instructions and tried it on a small area first.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! I have been using black storm and really liked it so I decided to try this Millenium lotion too, and I am sooo glad I did. This lotion worked insanely well after just one use. I got dark with just one use. I dropped my kids off at my moms and she was already commenting on how tan I am and when I got back after using this she even couldn&#x27;t believe how much darker I was. The tingle with this lotion is insane. I am really glad I read other reviews before I used it so I knew what I was getting myself into. I have used bombshell from designer skin which is also a tingle and that lotion doesn&#x27;t even come close to how much this stuff tingles. If you can&#x27;t handle tingle lotion this stuff is NOT for you. But if you can handle it insanely black is well worth it. I will definately buy this lotion again.</li>
            <li> i used this tanning for the first time about two days ago. i was worried about all the reviews saying EXTREME tingle. ive always used a tingle lotion and this was no where to being TOO extreme hardly felt tingle at all. but i really liked it i could tell i was bronzed after only one session. great color nice and brown instead of an orange.</li>
            <li> Just got it today very happy with delivery . is a nice light brown color and smells like a sweet tart I&#x27;m going tanning today so I&#x27;ll leave another review for results</li>
            <li> This is the best tingle lotion on the market and the price is unbeatable. The tingle is intense and it gets you very brown very quickly. It provides a very natural looking tan but it is not for the faint of heart .</li>
            <li> Delivered on time product as described</li>
            <li> This lotion worked great! If I could continue to use it.:( I love the tingle and color I got but unfortunately I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m allergic to the lotion. I put it on and by the time I was 10 mins into tanning, I became bumpy and pretty itchy. Immediately took a shower and I was covered in little bumps. Other than that the lotion was great! No steaks, smells good, tingle and burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I feel this product should have been labeled correctly with extreme tingle in the description. I would not have purchased it. I put it on and got really nausiated.</li>
            <li> My legs are SO hard to tan, but this had my legs looking very tan in 1 week! I am obsessed!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had a horrrible allergic reaction to this lotion. I&#x27;ve never had that type of reaction with a tingle before!</li>
            <li> I had been tanning for about a month when I first got this (from never being in the sun before) and had only used a sample packet of a tingle lotion before buying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, tingle lotions do NOT tingle to me. They feel like a very itchy sunburn while in the bed and until I wake up the next morning. The smell of this lotion isn&#x27;t good or awful, it&#x27;s just decent. There is no burning while applying, but it begins a few minutes after laying in a bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I&#x27;m done tanning, my skin is instantly bright red and splotchy anywhere I missed a spot. It doesn&#x27;t turn into a tan or stop itching even after a shower, lotion etc. I don&#x27;t bother showering immediately anymore since it has no impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, the redness is always completely gone and I&#x27;m a nice dark brown tan with no hints of orange. Missed spots? You&#x27;ll definitely be able to tell with this lotion but it&#x27;s easy to even out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t personally use this lotion before I have errands to run (I&#x27;ve done it... I look like a lobster) and I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once a week only due to the annoying itchy feeling the rest of the day. It should be noted that I tan around 6pm, so if you go earlier you may only be itchy a portion of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are amazing. Totally worth it, I&#x27;d recommend this lotion to anybody who can tolerate their skin feeling a little inflamed and enjoys a nice fast tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: though I never apply to my face, some always seems to rub off. Be careful to avoid this if possible - it definitely hurts!</li>
            <li> Yes! This burns! Not literally, but its a very intense burning sensation for about and hour when you use it. The color it gives is worth it though. I love this stuff! It smells terrible but again still worth it</li>
            <li> thought the lotion was great but was very hott gave my at least 2 shades the first time using it will be buying again</li>
            <li> I broke out in hives ..my whole body swelled, came home and took shower and had to apply benadry! Sending back..no tan is worth the pain of this!&lt;br /&gt;Tingle is not proven to make you tanner...it makes you think it is working harder!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! Only need to use a small amount, very intense Tanning Lotion. My wife and I will continue to purchase and use.</li>
            <li> after reading the product info and the many reviews, i decided to give it a try. i did find for me there was a very intense tingle! had a pleasant smell that reminded me of starburst candy. aferwards the smell wasnt that great though. but as soon as i stepped into the tanning bed i felt the intense tingle almost instantly! and it got very hot, as i expected after reading some reviews. after i was done i was a bit on the red side and tingly for a few hours. it was a pretty intense after effect for a tanning lotion, but it wasnt too bad. after that first use and the redness faded i definitely turned a darker shade than i was. i also have a difficult time with my legs and after one use they had a nice golden tan! so if youre not into tingle lotions or think it may be too intense for you, for the price i definitely recommend getting it for at least your legs! the tingle and hot feeling is not as bad on the legs at all. but otherwise i completely recommend this lotion! it is fantastic! i just warn that after tanning avoid direct physical contact with anyone until you have showered. the brief contact i had with my boyfriend before showering was not good for him. i propped my legs up on his when i got home and sat down for about 5 min and within another 5 min his legs were red, itchy and burning as if he put it on and went tanning himself. thats the only downfall to this product. i rotate this with my Solid Black 100x, which is also excellent. but i think this one does a much better job of giving a nice brown glow and instant results!</li>
            <li> I did not like it at all. The tingling sensation the lotion has made me really hot while in the tanning bed. Then afterwards I was red all over, I was itchy all over and for about a week my skin was super dry and slightly itchy.</li>
            <li> makes you very dark very quickly.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Insane&amp;#34; is correct... it is a sunburn in a bottle. It Burned a lot - it truly is not for the faint of heart like the directions say.</li>
            <li> Insanely black produces the strongest tingle I&#x27;ve ever used. The first use I thought I might be allergic it was so strong. IF you like tingles you will like it. It definitely makes your skin turn red right away and it can feel like its on fire, but it goes away after an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;The real reason I love this product is because it contains DHA as its 5th ingredient. DHA is the chemical that reacts with your dead skin cells to produce the beautiful tan you get when you spray tan. This is like spray tab in a bottle without the orange or streaky color you get with store bought sunless tanners. This will definitely give you an extra dark tan!&lt;br /&gt;For those who can&#x27;t take the tingle, the product could be painful so that&#x27;s why it only got 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Honest review here....Informed that the Insanely title of this lotion was due to the tingle being intense. Well..... being honest here.... this lotion... I found wasn&#x27;t all that tingly. Dont get me wrong, it is somewhat tingly. Here is what I find.... this lotion tans fantasticly. I have gotten a fantastic tan from this product. This is a fact. Awesome tan!!!!!  However..... the intense tingle only exists on my face!! I rub this lotion all over my body and all except my face I feel nothing. However, when applying this lotion to my face.... HOLY MOTHER OF.....  I have experienced my entire head melting as if I stuck it in sulfuric acid!!!! That bad!!!! So, after the first two insane applications I completely gave up applying to any part of my head. What I do now is apply this from my neck down, and then I grab my wife&#x27;s Black Night 60X or my daughter&#x27;s Paint It Black 50X and apply that to my face. {by the way...those products are smokin good!!}. So... great tan from product but recommend Black Night 60X or Paint It Black 50X. They tan fantasticly without intense facial pain. No Joke!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very warm lotion makes you feel like you are being pricked by something.</li>
            <li> This product is the best yet i ever tried. I have been tanning for almost a year now and i love the Millenium lotions, this tingle lotion has brought me great results already and i&#x27;ve only gone to the salon twice with it.  Thank you Millenium for all your great products.</li>
            <li> I really hate this stuff. I bought it because I needed some bronzer for the tanning bed, however, because they didn&#x27;t advertise that it is REALLY REALLY HOT I bought it. I cannot tell you how bad it burned from the moment in my hand and for hours after. I did not make it to the tanning bed that day and took another shower to try to get it off so maybe it would quit burning. I would not recommend this to anyone unless they like the burn. It doesn&#x27;t tingle it BURNS. I am a olive skin person and I have never burned except maybe my face, and never in a tanning bed. So unless you like the burn I wouldn&#x27;t get this it will be a waste of money and they do not take returns.</li>
            <li> Ok i am not impressed, not only did this stuff burn the heck out of my skin, the tanning results were quite a disapointment. Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> This lotion made me beat red, i always put on my lotion before I leave my house so it will soak in, well.. I didnt even make it out of my bedroom before my whole body was on complete fire! The smell was horrible! I would not recomend this lotion to anyone!</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product</li>
            <li> This lotion was pretty cheap, and it worked ok, but it wasn&#x27;t anything wondrous - I tanned with it, but it didn&#x27;t make me super super dark like it says it would.</li>
            <li> I have just started to love tingle lotions because i feel like they create darker tans than just bronzers. I love this product. It had a strong tingle the first time i used it, but not the worst. After the first time, i did not even notice the tingle any more. I get a decent redness from it, but not as red as other tingles i have used. I would not recommend this or any tingle for a beginner tanner. The smell is okay, but not horrible. I would buy this lotion again, and many more Millenium products!</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I broke out from this product. We have never had a problem with other Millennium products but this one started burning as soon as we put it on. Not fun!</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion  super quick tan, but do not use if tingle affects your skin.  It is strong.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my mom which she loves!!</li>
            <li> Made me feel sick &amp; very faint. I had to lie down for an hour before washing it off in shower. The smell will linger all day and does not smell good. Will not use again. I feel should be off the market, if you have to feel like this to get a tan, sad. This deserves 0 stars.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered this. I have fair skin, and the reviews from others with the same skin type said it worked great for them. I received it today, and was very happy when I got home from work to go tanning. I applied it at home [[I don&#x27;t apply at the gym where I tan]]. I got dressed, picked up my bag, and was ready to walk out the door. My legs felt very hot. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it. I looked in the bathroom mirror before I went, and noticed my chest was red. I then took off my pants to look at my legs, and I looked like a lobster. My arms, back, stomach, face were burning like I was on fire. I instantly jumped in the shower to get the lotion off of my skin. My skin right now is very red, and itchy. Will be returning.</li>
            <li> Not as hot as people say it is, but then again IMA big tingle fan. Smells good. A little watery though. I like the thicker type of lotions. Worth the buy and I&#x27;ll definitely buy again</li>
            <li> I Developed a severe allergic reaction from only a few drops.&lt;br /&gt;Test on skin first before using in actual tanning.</li>
            <li> Best lotion that I ever users, I have managed tanning salons for years and this is my favorite one. Makes you super dark!</li>
            <li> Well the tingle is great...but if you aren&#x27;t careful you will be orange from all the bronzer in it..it only takes a little bit</li>
            <li> I use it for outside tanning works great got dark in the first 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I use this product in the indoor tanning salon and have the darkest Tan I&#x27;ve ever had!! It makes your skin really warm so if you don&#x27;t like it hot this is  not for you, but if you like that nice warm massage like feeling of a warming lotion this is for you. I find it very relaxing!!! Great Product!!!</li>
            <li> I really do like this lotion I was darker after the first visit. I would recommend it to anyone that likes tingle lotions.</li>
            <li> I have tanned for years and used tons of different types of lotions.  I bought this one because I wanted to try something new, it was really a good price, and offered both a bronzer and tingle.  The first time I used it, I noticed that it made me smell \\&quot;burnt\\&quot; after I got out.  I smelled like that until I took a shower later that evening.  It was bad enough that my husband noticed the smell right away.  While the tingle and the bronzer are good, I used it a couple more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day after tanning, my 5-year old daughter came up and gave me a hug.  I always wash my hands after I put lotion on so I don&#x27;t have \\&quot;orange\\&quot; palms, but even with only touching her with my hands, she developed huge red spots on her arms almost right away.  They went down a bit after giving her benadryl, but later when she was in the bath, the spots reappeared and then got bigger.  I got her out immediately, but the spots and redness had spread to most of her body.  She never had any problems breathing or anything but I took her to the doctor anyway.  As we were leaving, I noticed that my son had big red spots where I had hugged him too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used tons of different types of tanning lotions in the past - and still do - some with tingle and some without, some with and without bronzers - and NONE of them have ever had this reaction with my kids at all.  I would not recommend this one to anyone, even if you&#x27;re a fan of high tingles and bronzers.  Don&#x27;t take a risk that your kids, friends, family, etc could be allergic to this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion that my husband nad I have ever used!! He has such a hard time tanning and this got him dark in just a few times of using it!! I tan very easy and this worked wonders for my tan! I do suggest when you use it for the first time cut your tanning min down, I tan for 12 min in the tanning bed and cut it to 5 min this helped to get use to the lotion. The lotion really does make your skin RED and makes you feel like you are on fire when you use it for the first time but I promise it wears off and leaves you with a killer tan!! :) I upped my time to 10 then 12 again and the burn and red of the lotion has gone down with each use, BUT still gives me a KILLER tan!!! :) I LOVE this stuff and will order more!  DONT FORGET TO DO A TEST ON A SMALL PATCH OF SKIN BEFORE YOU PUT THIS LOTION ALL OVER YOUR SKIN! IF YOU READ THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE IT TELLS YOU TO DO A TEST ON YOUR SKIN! IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN RED AND IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN FEEL HOT!!! BUT IT DOES WEAR OFF!!! I have very sesitive skin and LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff!! :)</li>
            <li> This lotion is great. I will say this is the HOTTEST lotion I have ever used.  I would recommend it to anyone IF you can handle tingle. If Not this lotion is NOT FOR YOU.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. it works great and it gives me a great deep dark tan. The cost of this stuff at my salon is five times the cost. This is a no brainer.</li>
            <li> ive used ALOT of diff tanning lotion this is the best by far I only have to tan 2 maybe 3 time a week depending on if I wanna go that much but this lotion will get u dark the first time u use it, u will itch when u get out the tanning bed and be blochy but it will go away in about 30ins or after a show but I know in the salons they try selling this fr 50-70 bucks so this is a great deal I will b sticking with this lotion or paint me black bc its always good to switch up ur lotions it gets u darker and u stay darker longer and I use it at the beach</li>
            <li> This lotion is intensely hot tingle with just the right bronzes mixed in. I love to tan with tingle lotion and this bottle has it. I&#x27;m not let down at all buy purchasing this lotion. I&#x27;ll buy again!</li>
            <li> I read all reviews and was not at all prepared for this lotion!!! OUCH!!! Thankfully I followed the bottles directions and only tried a patch test on my forearm and holy guacomole!! This set my arm on fire! My entire arm was burning, pulsating, extremly red, had white spots, and painful! I dont want to even think about how it would be if I had actually tanned first. I&#x27;ve only been tanning for almost a year and never tried tingle lotions I only used Australian Gold products since I been tanning but parts of my body were not the same color as the rest for instance my upper chest so I heard tingle products help tan those areas. I dont know if I have sensitive skin, not experienced enough, or just cant handle. Im not saying dont buy the lotion but im a little dissapointed becuase the reviews were raving of perfectly bronzed non ommpa loompa skin and I was really looking foward to the bronze skin. I might just keep the lotion till I tanned more and try a skin test again though! Does anyone know if I wait till Im darker if it will help ease the redness and burning?</li>
            <li> One of the best  tingle lotions out, gets you so dark after about 3-4 uses, only bad thing is the after smell, one of the worst after tan odors ever..</li>
            <li> OMG! That was what I was saying to myself within 3 minutes of applying...yes APPLYING the lotion. It burns the devil out of your skin before you even get into the sun. I thought it was was just me, but it gets worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply my lotion at home before I make the short drive to the tanning bed. Well it is warm out and the inside of my car is black so it was very warm in the car. The heat from the inside of the CAR ALONE made my skin burn worse! It does NOT tingle, it BURNS! It would not stop burning at that point. By the time I got to the parking lot of the tanning salon I was trying to wipe the stuff off with wet-nappies I keep in the car. It turns your skin RED like bright, beet red before you even get into the sun/bed or anything at all and it burns like you are getting a sunburn just sitting there. I just said forget it at that point and I raced home to wash it off. Every place it was on my skin now is red and warm but every place where the lotion is not applied is completely normal. I took some photographs (they did not turn out very well to show the DISTINCT contrast) but you can see there is white and red from where I missed a few spots with the lotion on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I DID NOT tan after applying the lotion the redness/burning is caused by ambient heat alone and whatever is in this lotion. After this whole mess, I read the reviews and many other people said the exact same thing. I honestly cannot believe this company is allowed to sell such a terrible product. I have been using Millenium Tanning products for years and I am SHOCKED at how bad this stuff is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on contacting the company to get a refund. I am surprised this product has not killed someone to be honest. Given the reaction SO MANY PEOPLE seem to have had, I would be worried this could put a person into anaphylactic shock. The lotion has to be causing some kind of allergic reaction in the skin to create this redness. So now, here I sit swimming in coco butter andaloe lotion and I have taken antihistamines to see if it will make the red go away.</li>
            <li> as an experienced tanner, this tingle lotion gives me the bronze glow I desire. Just enough tingle. Love it! Will buy again &amp; again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it a zero if I could. Put this stuff on and immediately turned candy apple red everywhere. When I say immediately, I mean literally within 60 seconds of application. Horrible.</li>
            <li> When I put this on I thought Ghost peppers were the first ingredient. It took a minute, but then I felt like Smaug was breathing fire down upon me! Do not put this lotion NEAR your eyes, seriously. Now that the precautions are printed, lets get to why I am giving this awesome lotion 5 stars. After one use, the results were noticeable! I was several levels darker, the colour is great, no orange tinge, a nice deep sunny looking tan. The results look better than other high end lotions I have used, for four times the price.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this lotion I turn extremely red.  It has a very intense burning sensation the minute you put it on.</li>
            <li> I bought it with higher expectatations. It must be either phony cream or it&#x27;s junk.I&#x27;d love it if someone at Amazon sent me something better or refunded my money. I DO NOT recommend it to anyone. Terrible!!</li>
            <li> This is a very unique product. You MUST have a base tan to start or this can hurt you. The tingle is very neat  and groovey.</li>
            <li> Worst lotion ever! It burns!!!! If you want to fry your skin, this is how. Ouch!!! Scared me with the hot burning pain, rash, and irregular tan marks. I&#x27;ve used many lotions, but this one tops my list as the worst and most dangerous!!!! Take it off the market, please!</li>
            <li> Great product, but strong bronzer. Apply evenly and carefully, especially if you do not have a base tan.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like a slight burning sensation, do not purchase this lotion. When I say slight burning sensation, I mean slight. It is not bad at all; however, do not put it on sensitive areas. It definitely will step up your tan quickly. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for then this is the lotion for you. Also lasts for quite a while. Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is legit. The kind offered at my tanning bed works much better.</li>
            <li> Inferior product not recommended, stick to industry brands this is like paint in a bottle will leave your skin discolored in sections and not colored in other sections</li>
            <li> I have done some further research on this lotion as so many people experience unexplained itching and what I found in my case is that this lotion contains walnuts and I have nut allergies so this is more likely the cause than it being a bad lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I should have read the entire list of ingredients and been more diligent in my research as millenium lotions have always been excellent and i have never had an issue with any others .&lt;br /&gt;I do suggest if you have this lotion and are experiencing uncontrolled itching do not use it and take benadryl as tanning and the tingle open your pores and the intent of tingles are to increase the blood flow which can allow the ingredients into the system, which for someone not allergic is not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;Use caution and research , you can google what lotions contain nut shells or extracts and I was surprised how many are using walnuts .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very experienced tanner.i though this lotion was going to be amazing based on reviews.is says the tingle factor is little to moderate it gets your skin red but barley tingles. It got me tan but not dark. I don&#x27;t know if this was watered down or what the deal was but all I know is that I will not buy this again</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome!!! I love a tingle factor and it really i.ncreases your tan quickly. The price is very reasonable for the job this lotion does. I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE WORST LOTION EVER! BURNS SKIN SO BAD YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO TAN AGAIN! MADE MY GIRLFRIEND CRY BEFORE SHE EVEN MADE IT OUTSIDE.</li>
            <li> BE prepared for burning and maybe some spots after you tan but the next day it&#x27;s all tan . I love it !</li>
            <li> This lotion works very well.  I previously used the Black Storm lotion and liked it a lot, but I wanted something that would give me more color and I decided to try this one because of the tingle.  The tingle isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and goes away within an hour of washing it off.  The color you get is great!  And as long as you rotate it every other time it doesn&#x27;t seem overwhelming.  For this price I would recommend it to everyone if you like tingles or if you were thinking of trying a tingle, this one is a pretty good one to start out with.</li>
            <li> I bought this expecting the same wimpy tingle as I usually get...... Definitely not! Beware.... even for advanced tanners the first time is a little rough. However fantastic results after two twenty minute sessions. A must have!</li>
            <li> What I had before I used this lotion was a pretty good base from tanning every two days for two months. What I did not have was a high tolerance for shear horrible agony. I had read the reviews about the \\&quot;tingle,\\&quot; and prepared myself for the screaming intense pain i expected. I was really happy when, after 15 minutes on the tanning bed, my skin felt good and the color was amazing. Yes, this product will get you darker. However, after getting home from tanning i sat around for a while, tinkered about, for about 30 minutes. It crept up slowly at first, the feeling like my skin was dry and itchy. Ten minutes later I was scratching like an addict going through cocaine psychosis. I immediately dropped everything and got in the shower to get this @#$ off, but the water only seemed to piss it off more, so the itching spread from my legs, to my whole body. I am only grateful that I don&#x27;t use tanning lotion on my face. It is doubtful i will use this product again because I am not a masochist, although I would certainly recommend it to someone I don&#x27;t like. When the other reviewers discuss the \\&quot;tingle\\&quot; keep in mind they are talking about the most horrible burning/itching sensation imaginable, such as being covered in a swarm of biting red ants, or rubbing light grain sandpaper over sunburned skin.</li>
            <li> This product is DANGEROUS!!! BURNS WHILE U ARE TANNING!! BURNS AFTER U SHOWER!!! burned for two hours after my shower!!! DO NOT USE!!!! SHOULD NOT BE SOLD TO ANYONE!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and I love to use it once I have a great base tan. The smell is good as well even after the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Intense burn for an hour or so after tanning but it really brings out the melanin in your skin.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this unless you want to be burnt.</li>
            <li> I LOVED IT I WOULD BUY AGAIN I LOVE THE BRONZER IN IT  MY TAN GOT EVEN DARKER GREAT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion....it does have a really strong tingle..but thats what brings out the awesome darkness in my skin:-)....and it leaves my skin feeling really frangrant and soft</li>
            <li> Wife did not like this product. Hv used this brand many times. But this one burned her skin. So not useing any more</li>
            <li> People should know that tingle doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean it tingles, some just gives off heat and you will be red and blotchy...your never suppose to apply tingle to your face but I do and the people who do and then complain should already know if you&#x27;ve used tingle before the affects it makes. Also when using tingle you NEVER shower after because it makes it worse. Anywho I love tingle this lotion and all lotions with heat. You should know though if you tan you should always switch up your lotions or you will not see your color get darker it will just plateau because your skin is use to the same lotion ingredients etc....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this lotion again.  Turned skin red and burns a lot.  Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> great tingle, but I am not able to pass my tan plateau. I am Polish, so my tan only gets so deep. I wanted this to tan my legs, however they do not burn or tan... they just stay white. this lotion would probably work on everyone else.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this product to try this year, I tan all the time so I am no stranger to lotions. However this was the WORSE exp I have ever had. 5 minutes after applying lotion I became sick, my blood pressure shot up and could not even hold my head up to get out of bed. Once I was able to get out of bed I passed out woke up in the floor. I really felt like my heart was going to explode I managed to get dressed sometime later and made it home. (I live across the street) By time I got home my whole body was swelled up not to mention the PAIN I was in, I tried to take a shower but could not stand the touch of the water. It took me 4 benadryl and 5 hours later before I began feeling normal. It has been 3 days now and I still feel like I have been laying in a fire ant bed. I have to keep itching lotion on me and benadryl every 4 hours just to stop the itching. This should not even be sold. I have read lots of reviews that had the same reaction I should have read more before I purchased. I called the company today to advise them and the guy was so RUDE and could care less what happened to me and of course no refund. But the refund is no big deal it is the concern on how dangerous this product is. So please do not buy this product..</li>
            <li> this product has a tingle in it. Couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> this stuff works, just wipe your hands immediately</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s HOT, it&#x27;s dark and it smells good. I&#x27;ve got 2 bottls of them and I&#x27;ll recommend it to all</li>
            <li> This lotion worked really well for me! Tingle and a mild bronzer, which was what I wanted. Lotion doesn&#x27;t streak and rubs in very well, also contains tyrosine, which helps boost color!! Thank you:-)!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff because it really works. I&#x27;m about to purchase my third bottle in fact.</li>
            <li> I rated this as okay because it works great and you are tan instantly after.&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like was that I felt like I was freezing and then burning up after using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;Also, after taking a shower the tan fades. One more thing is that if you do not rub this in properly then your going to have streaks.</li>
            <li> This burned so badly. Anywhere I put it my skin turned red; so embarrassing when I&#x27;d walk out of the tanning salon! Although it did take my tan to the next level, I&#x27;m not sure it was worth it. Also, it smelled terrible. At first I didn&#x27;t mind the odor, but for some reason after a few uses I couldn&#x27;t stand it. I don&#x27;t know whether it was the smell or the fact that it burned but it gave me this sick feeling. Like having the flu. If you think the side effects are worth the tan, then I recommend it. But I just finished up my bottle and I&#x27;m definitely not purchasing again.</li>
            <li> would recommend it to every one. its not like most of them i try. it dont leave the red marks that some do.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion! Great product, great price, great tingle!!!! I used this for the first time today in the tanning bed. Loved it! Awesome lotion. It smells good too. The tingle wasn&#x27;t intense or too much. After a couple of minutes in the bed, I felt it fully hit. My arms started tingling first, then my legs and stomach. After tanning, I didn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;burnt&amp;#34; after tan smell and my skin felt incredible - softer than before I tanned. The red on my skin has turned to a very nice golden brown. I will buy this lotion again!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love the tingle and got it on the day promised.</li>
            <li> First off be careful maybe use latex gloves when applying!  So I got it today and like any lotion I start applying and then about 5 mins later I feel the BURN!  So ignore it and drive 10mins to the tanning salon and omg it was painful the burning from the lotion it felt like sunburnt I used to get in the summer from being at the beach for 8  hours a a day 3 days a week.  So once I got in the bed I turned the fans on high and felt fine.  12 mins later once i was done I felt the burn again but once I got home took a cool shower the burning sensation went away.  I&#x27;m sunburnt looking but I know in 2 days it will tan over.  Keep away from kids</li>
            <li> HOTTTT!! VERY hot tingler! Thought my skin was on fire</li>
            <li> Yes, it has been greater than I&#x27;d imagined it would be.  It has me tan so much faster than any other lotions that I&#x27;ve used before.  GREAT!</li>
            <li> No big difference in my tan using this lotion and I have tanned daily for almost a year.</li>
            <li> It leaves really bad orange stains and streaks on your skin which takes about ten or more washes to get off.</li>
            <li> It tingled pretty good and I got really good color the first time I used it. I continue to use it and I have a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> This is the worst lotion that I have ever purchased from Amazon. I thought it was another product. After I put it on I thought I was having an allergic reaction. My face turned beat red, the whites of my eyes were turning red and my eyes were watering bad. My body was on fire. It was the worst sunburn feeling ever. I was in pain and  uncomfortable for hours. I had to go home and put Aloe Vera lotion on. I felt like I had to throw up. Plus my heart started to race. I do not know how this is safe or legal.&lt;br /&gt;I have been tanning for years and I have never experienced anything like this. It was such a horrible experience that I ended up throwing the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> this tanning lotion has a great smell to it, and goes on very smoothly. but it does have a burn to it. please be sure and read the instructions very carefully. i didnt. my husband did. i thought something was wrong till i was telling him about the burning and he informed me it said so on the bottle. so please do read the lable. all n all good lotion</li>
            <li> I purchased this tingle lotion, as I like a good tingle from time to time. I have tried products with the same amount of tingle and, while they did make me red following my tan, they did not give me the hives that this product gave me. As soon as I exited the tanning bed, my body began itching profusely and I got red bumps from head to toe. Finally, after about three hours, the rash began to fade and I was able to go to class. Well, as soon as I sat down at class my classmates surrounding me started to complain about a terrible moldy smell that lingered throughout the classroom. At one point my professor came around the room to hand back papers and she even said something smelled odd and blamed it on a leak in the roof of the building. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it until I returned home and the smell had followed me.. Turns out that it was the after scent of the lotion on me. It smells similar to a wet towel shoved into a gym locker for a month. Will never be using this product again and definitely not pleased.</li>
            <li> Insanely Black will get you extremely dark. I mean you will get dark. I love using tingle lotions because i love the feeling of the heat plus it helps my nerve damage i have in my right arm. Anyways i did not think it was extremely intense probably because I am used to using extreme tingle but there is a kick to it which i love. I love the fact that i can get so dark so quick! I think everyone should try this lotion because if you want results, try insanely black you will get what you paid for and get results</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for the 1st time yesterday..man I can tell it works!!&lt;br /&gt;I already have  great base tan  and this took me 1 shade darker .&lt;br /&gt;Highly approve of this lotion in my tanning lotion rotation.</li>
            <li> the tingle factor, well i can say its not that intense, i was expecting something far more tingly but its still a great lotion and definitely get the job done, be sure to wash it off as soon as you get home, stuff really itches!</li>
            <li> Perfect service. Great product.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a bronzer, I felt as though I wasn&#x27;t even using a lotion. It didn&#x27;t give me any sort of tan or a tan line when using it. The name is a Complete opposite of what the product does. It did get here in a timely fashion&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I got a really bad allergic reaction to the lotion, and my skin burned for hours, and was red and swollen for days.&lt;br /&gt;Never going to use it again, waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I did ALOT of research before purchasing this lotion and I was not disappointed, at all.  The smell isn&#x27;t horrible.  It spreads easy, like a regular lotion.  The first time I used it I applied it to my legs and was distracted for a few minutes and then continued applying it to the rest of my body.  I was very surprised that it didn&#x27;t take the tanning bed to activate the lotion as my legs were on fire before I even got in the room!  I liked the pain but would be lying if said I wasn&#x27;t relieved to get in the shower and wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONSIDERABLY tanner after the first application.  Very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I tried it on myself and it burned my skin pretty good.  Chemical burns are similar to first degree burns except they don&#x27;t always hurt.  I gave the product away to someone of Hispanic descent and the product worked ok for them.  No burns at all.  So my recommendation is to buy the product if you have skin that is not very sensitive.  I put it on my legs in a few areas and those areas turned red and stayed red even after I washed the stuff off.</li>
            <li> BURNS YOUR SKIN BUT POWERFUL FOR A QUICK TAN I USE IT OUTSIDE</li>
            <li> Yes, I love it and the tingle is great!  Arrived on time and as described.&lt;br /&gt;I love the bronzer in it as well!</li>
            <li> Well like a lot of other reviews have stated this stuff burns!!!!  Even when I diluted it with other lotions it still was fairly intense. I wasn&#x27;t aware that this stuff was mostly for people who use tanning beds, so it didn&#x27;t really seem to give a tan....</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is one of the best tingle you can get. I will admit right after getting out of the tanning bed you will think your burnt but after an hour or two you will have one of the best tans you have ever had. I love this lotion and I&#x60;m going to continue to use it!!</li>
            <li> I did not realize that tingle meant your skin feels like it is burnt from the sun.  If your into that sort of thing maybe you would like it</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally. Its extreme tingle. Wherever you rub it on you can see the redness afterwards (or if you missed a spot). I have to shower as soon as I finish using this or else it itches/burns. I can&#x27;t let my 12 y.o daughter touch me if I have any of this product on my hands or arms. it&#x27;s that strong. It will soak in a good tan once you get through the tingle of it.</li>
            <li> Recieved my package alot sooner then I thought.best tingle lotion iv ever used and cheapest ..I have tried many and this one tops them all by far.I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help me to establish a tan. I applied this product, my skin burned for hours. The chair that I sat in also absorbed this product which transferred to someone else&#x27;s skin upon sitting in the chair on the same day.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, though the tingle isn&#x27;t nearly as intense as some of these whiners make it sound.  If you don&#x27;t have a base tan I would recommend achieving that first level of tan before using tingle lotion. Yes, you will turn red, yes you will feel a warm tingling sensation,  no you&#x27;re not on fire, yes it is supposed to happen and it will go away. Tingle lotions aren&#x27;t for everyone but if you&#x27;ve hit your tanning plateau and you don&#x27;t want the orangey look of accelerators, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Has a great scent.  Tanning was great. Used to use bombshell tingle but i think this is much better and the price is better. Would order it again</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it was 60x the tingle. I used it and my skin turned red and bubbled up. I ended up giving both bottles away for free.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this tanner...it works great and my tan is much deeper and it does not make me itch..I will def buy it again</li>
            <li> I used this product twice thinking it would even out, it&#x27;s very orange and leaves you completely blotchy and uneven .. Awful buy</li>
            <li> I tan 2-3 times a week year round. I usually alternate bronzes and tingle lotions. I thought I&#x27;d try this and stop alternating. I LOVE it! It is definitely HOT, first time tingle user or the very pale should probably start with something weaker. I was red before I even got finished putting it on, I could see any spots I missed! I put a sticker on before tanning and about 2 hours after tanning I could actually see the before and after difference. It smells like raspberries to me.</li>
            <li> makes you dark but like fake bronzer it washes off even after waiting hours to shower :(</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work fast! I was in the sun a short time with it on and I saw a noticeable difference. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> If you like a HOT TINGLE,this IS the one and only!!! It smells nice and it works great.I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good TINGLE!!</li>
            <li> Intense burn! LOVE IT:)</li>
            <li> BEWARE!! creates a chemical burn on your skin. I used it once. My skin was burning for 2 days! I threw it away!!</li>
            <li> Its not bad. My sister couldnt stand it. I will admit that I didnt know it was a &amp;#34;Burning lotion&amp;#34; until after I bought it. I only felt the extreme burn after being in water or over exposed areas like my face. Then it was very bad/Hot! &amp;#34;Its ok&amp;#34; maybe 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but wherever you put this, get ready for a burning and reddening to occur. Have not seen it make a difference in my skin color. Just painful.</li>
            <li> this stuff burns bad the tingle so so strong,even before i went in the bed,it started burning right away,and m bro had to go wash it off it was too much for him,but other wise its good.</li>
            <li> I have had tanning bed of my own since in the 1990.  I have tryed several lotions and this is the best that I have found for a long time.  I love the tingle lotions.[[ASIN:B0058E3XJI Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Bronzer Tanning Bed Lotion, 100x, 13.5-Ounce]]</li>
            <li> If you like tingle plus bronzing lotion, you&#x27;ll love insanely black!  I will definitely be buying more!  It also smells good!</li>
            <li> this lotion i must warn you is not for beginners, unless you want to feel like youre dying. i was pretty dark before i started to use this lotion and it still set me on fire a bit . but after a couple uses my body doesnt burn as bad &amp; i still feel the tingle so i know its working &amp; i see amazing results as soon as i get out of the tanning bed, only down fall to this lotion is you HAVE TO make sure you rub it in really good on your hands or wipe them off because you will turn a little orange . i love this lotion , but i wouldnt suggest loving on your husband or kids espically kids after tanning for a couple hours unless you take a shower . But other than that i plan on buying this product again &amp; i hope you enjoy (:</li>
            <li> I didnt know this was a tingle lotion when i bought it lmfao but i loved it, it gets you super tan</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy feeling like your skin is on fire as soon as you put this stuff on then save your money.  This stuff made me burn bad!  Terrible Product!</li>
            <li> could not use this lotion. had a allergic reaction and turned beat red with burning skin. had to take a benadrly. not for me.</li>
            <li> This tanner has a nice tingle and does work for indoor tanning. One thing to note; however, is that it seems to have a bronzer included IN it, so it will discolor your hands. Immediately after applying, it&#x27;s best if you can clean your hands with something just like you would with a sunless tanning product. It wasn&#x27;t annoying enough to me to discount the quality of its effectiveness and rating.</li>
            <li> Best tingle lotion I have used! Love it!</li>
            <li> I tan pretty very easily but this stuff has taken me to a whole new level.  If you like tinlge lotions, this one is definitly HOT and well worth EVERY penny!</li>
            <li> This was my first tingle product I&#x27;ve used and I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker with the other lotions I was using so  I figured i would give this a try  ..it kinda of freaked me out because within a few min of laying in the tanning bed it started burning alittle..after my session I noticed I was alittle red but right now im seeing I actually got darker..I love it..</li>
            <li> Awesome tingle! It set me on fire! So if you are looking for one hot tingle definitely try this. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product definitely insane. I have used plenty of tingle lotions and I have to say this is by far the best. It smells nice, almost like fruit loops. The results of using this product were wonderful. The only thing I would worry about is if you are not careful with application and put too much in one area the bronzer will stain and it looks almost like you used a fake sunless tanning lotion, but if you apply it evenly the results are great. WARNING not for a person who has never used tingle before</li>
            <li> I love how smooth &amp; slick the texture is. And also that it&#x27;s a tingle &amp; dha mixed lotion. Just the right amount of bronzer (60x is not too much or too little for me &amp;  I go about every other day.)&lt;br /&gt;  I get compliments on my skin all the time.&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;m a frequent tanner, I&#x27;ve been using it ever since I got it, I only \\&quot;felt\\&quot; it when I first used it a week ago &amp; now it just turns my skin kind of red for a little while, maybe I&#x27;m just used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve actually been doing is, I put on a Level 10 tingle lotion first while at home then put this on at the salon. Call me crazy, but I just don&#x27;t feel it like others do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My expectations of the tingle factor based off the reviews was higher. But it is one of the more stronger tingles I&#x27;ve used. Maybe my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive enough or I&#x27;m more used to the reaction it gives, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;  All I know is the strongest time I ever felt a tingle lotion was the first time I used one, which was years ago &amp; it was Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond T2. Was the only time I ever felt like I was burning in the tanning bed, &amp; wasn&#x27;t able to shower for longer than a day due to traveling &amp; broke out in a horrible itchy bumpy rash all over. I never used that one again,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but I DO really like this lotion overall &amp; I recommend it for experienced tanners.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, non greasy and gets you tanned and dark fast.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely awful. It burned my skin.</li>
            <li> I thought this might burn me (the tingle) but it didn&#x27;t I was pleasantly surprised.  I love this product and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> If u r use to tingles then this lotion will not b a problem for u....ive had hotter but this is good too....stayed red for hours after i used it...cant beat the price either</li>
            <li> Should come with warning label to try on small patch of skin. This actually burned my skin so bad  I feel like I laid out in sun for 8 hours with baby oil on. BE VERY CAREFUL USING THIS PRODUCT, TRY ON A SMALL PATCH OF SKIN BEFORE USE. After an hour in a cool shower and trying to remove with a few washes and make up remover they applying benedryl cream I feel a bit better. Will never apply any lotion again before using on a small patch of skin.</li>
            <li> So I got this hot/tingle lotion for my husband and he swears by it, if you are stuck and need to take your tan to the next level you should purchase this. My husband is hook to this lotion, he has been using it for about a year an a half now. This is not a lotion to start tanning with or a beginner tanner. Also do not use on your face. You will not be disappointed. Delivery was great got it in 2 days!</li>
            <li> i personally HATE this product. it smells AWFUL. no tingle really except on my face. this shit sucks. ill never buy another tannin product off line. STOP BEING CHEAP &amp; JUS BUY SOME FROM THE TANNING SALON. THAT WAY YOU KNO WHAT YOUR GETTING</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion and it does get very HOT  I even use it on the beach and it gives you a great tan</li>
            <li> She said she enjoys the use of this product I don&#x27;t use it personally. I have to take her word for it as she has bought the product multiple times now.</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for the last 10 years and I also worked at a salon where we got to try all the new lotions, and older lotions for free. This has been the BEST I have used. I am an &amp;#34;advanced&amp;#34; tanner, so it was hard to find something that would get me even darker, without turning me orange. THIS IS THE PRODUCT FOR YOU IF YOU LOVE TO TAN!!! Just beware that this is a TINGLE LOTION and you will turn RED and possibly become itchy. If you have sensitive skin, test lotion on your wrist-if you do not get any kinda of bad reaction it is safe to use in a tanning bed OR outside. ENJOY!!!</li>
            <li> I have used many tanning lotions over several years and I am here to tell you that this one is by far the worst one that I have ever used. It will give you color but when I used it, My heart started to race. I felt like I was going to get sick. At first I just thought that I was coming down with something but after using it a few more times, I still had the same results. My chest felt very heavy and my heart started beating really fast. I have never had a lotion do that to my before. I am not one to write bad reviews on things but when it comes to this, I feel like I should worn people about this product. There is something in it that is not right. They need to take it off of the market.</li>
            <li> When I reorder I will definitely order insanely Black !!! I look like I have been to the Bahama &#x27;s !!!I am a fair skinned person but you would not guess so by the results I have gotten from this product !! There is a slight tingle with this product so expect that when you first apply it !!!</li>
            <li> Warning, this is a very hot lotion, but the results are amazing, it also has a built in bronzer as well. So as soon as you are done tanning you are instantly dark. I love this lotion, I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Absolutely great price for this lotion! The tanning salon that I go to wants $110 for the exact same bottle! They are craaaazy!! Love the tingle and makes you super dark. I like to switch up tanning lotions so my skin doesn&#x27;t get too used to one kind, but this one definitely makes it into my top favs! Just be sure to wash your hands after you use or you will have brown in between your fingers!</li>
            <li> This lotion gives you incredible color and gives it to you fast! It makes you get very hot and uncomfortable but I usually mix it when another tanning lotion to calm it down. I have been tanning for a while and nothing gets me anywhere near as dark as this lotion does. It works amazing, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I have been using Millenium products for 6 years now.  I found that eventually I think my body just got used to the lotion and I quit getting color like I did when I first started using it..  My Sister in law has a bed and she had a lotion called Hottie Bottie.  I tried it one time and wow did it get be colored.  The tingle is def hot and I wouldn&#x27;t recomend it for a beginner.  I will probly start switching between Millienium tingles and the Hottie Bottie tingles.  The company said it is only sold in salons and direct.  That sucks because normally cheaper online. Here is where I found it.  [...]  The one I was using was the So Hott Tingle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving Insanley black 5 stars because it is a good tingle I just need to try a new brand for a time and then go back.  I also use Millenium Paint it Black 50x when I don&#x27;t want a tingle factor but a bronzer and that works well to.  I think we any lotions you just have to switch brands because your skin gets used to it.</li>
            <li> I used this one time and after the tan, my skin was very red like I had a very bad sunburn. I already had a great base tan.  So I was surprised it turned so red.  I was on fire for hours!!  Would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve used this for a week now because my view has changed a little. First if all it&#x27;s very hot, which I expected, but it&#x27;s day 6 and when I use it, it&#x27;s not sooo Hot, maybe this goes for all tingles, I&#x27;ve used same product, maybe I should switch up, and it&#x27;s got a bronzer in it so I have to make sure I wash my hands and let it sit on my skin after I tan. It actually is a little more bronzer than tingle in my opinion but overall I got a great price on amazon, compared to the 40 bucks my tanning salon wanted for the same thing. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute worst tanning lotion I have ever used in my life.  I go tanning every single day and I have tried just about every single lotion out there I thought since it seemed to be a neat looking bidy by the name and description along with it being a well known company however, I will never purchase another product made by this company ever again as long as I live. I use bronzers all the time and this is the worst.  Since I have been using this lotion I have completely lost my tan and have not only had to purchase another lotion but start my tanning process all over again.  Just would not recommend this product to my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> You should really test this out on an area of your body before you go to tan.  If you have sensitive skin, I would not recommend using this product. Within 2 minutes of putting it on, my skin was on fire!! Had a nice golden tan after only 25 minutes in the sun.</li>
            <li> Good lotion. Makes you dark with first use. It is a tingle lotion so it gets pretty hot the first few times you use it then it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;seem to bad when you get use to it.</li>
            <li> I bought Solid Black and it had this with a combo.  It was a better deal than just buying Solid Black.  But I am in love with this one.  The results are amazing!  Smells good too which I&#x27;m very picky about.  Tingles do burn a bit depending on the intensity.  Don&#x27;t buy this and expect not to feel the warm, slight burn/tingle.  That is the entire purpose of Tingles.  I used to work at a tanning salon and I never used a tingle that I couldn&#x27;t feel.  I totally recommend this.  Oh and it does have a bit of a self tanner/bronzer to it cause some of the times it made my hands a little orange and didn&#x27;t wash off right away.  That part wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me though.  Hope you like it as much as I do!</li>
            <li> Granted, I have the type of skin that tans quickly anyways, it&#x27;s winter and it&#x27;s been awhile since I&#x27;ve been in the sun or tanning bed. This lotion changed my color after one time of laying!! And for only 12 mins! I&#x27;ve laid 3 times now and you would think it&#x27;s summer and I&#x27;ve been out in the sun for months..this stuff is incredible! The tingle is not nearly as strong as other lotions I&#x27;ve used but it gives amazing results. Found the lotion I will be sticking with for sure!!</li>
            <li> I have always used a tingle and this one is honestly not that bad. It keeps you tan for weeks even at a low bulb setting. I told my friends to use it!</li>
            <li> this lotion works great but smells awful. my skin does sometimes feel itchy if i do not shower immediately after using</li>
            <li> I got this yesterday and used it when I went tanning today.  I haven&#x27;t really used a lot of tingles, besides Supre Cherry Bomb which I&#x27;m not sure is actually a legit tingle.  To me, Insanely Black isn&#x27;t really that hot.  I didn&#x27;t feel a thing until about 8 minutes in (in a 12 min bed). Then it started warming up a little, but it was nothing uncomfortable. I was nice and red when I got out though, and now I am turning a very nice brown.  I saw a noticeable difference from my usual lotion (DS Bellezza).  I have to say I like this lotion, it just wasn&#x27;t as hot as I was expecting.  The ATO isn&#x27;t bad either, although I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell in general.</li>
            <li> this product has carrot seed oil in it which makes you orange. I threw it away very disappointing. Tingle doesn&#x27;t tingle your skin, it burns it.</li>
            <li> great product and arrived super quick</li>
            <li> I threw away this product after my first use. It burned my skin after tanning for a minute, I was in tears and it took a few hours before my skin went back to normal and the intense pain went away. I would not recommend anyone use this product as it is a torture weapon.</li>
            <li> The tingle in this feels like really bad sun burn. I am sure some love it but it is just not right for me!</li>
            <li> Worked GREAT on me but as for my best friend it made her itch like crazy after tanning the itching didn&#x27;t go away and she had to go to the emergency room and get two shots BC her throat started to close. But my tan is amazing !!</li>
            <li> Love this product did not give a strong tingling sensation that people have mentioned.  But my tan is getting darker much quicker than with other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> So I really like this lotion, it is stronger than the 100x bronzer, well it seems like it is, I get really dark after using it, like a deep red that a few hours later is a nice Brown tone, I also use after bronzer when I get out of the bed, but the tingle is almost to much to handle, feels insanely hot after applying tan extender, my clothes almost hurt my skin when I am putting my clothes back on, I don&#x27;t recommend this unless you are really into tingle lotions that really do tingle, compared to Swedish beauty tingle, this is way more intense</li>
            <li> Works good burns when firsr put on</li>
            <li> This burnt me so bad. I almost had to go to the docter to stop it from burning and it broke me out so bad. Do Not buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift thinking that this is the best lotion to turn my sister brown. turns out that this gave her a red rash! I have used tingle lotions before so I thought she was crazy until I decided to try it myself. I put it on my hand and they almost instantly turned red with bumps and were itchy! The lotion is now laying somewhere in my sister&#x27;s room, untouched. I would never buy this again and I would not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Absolutely satisfied with ordering this product from Amazon ! Arrived on time as promised and definately love this lotion and will definately purchase from here again and again</li>
            <li> This product actually burns your skin!  I tried it out the first night it showed up while sitting at home and I was in pain all night; this product does not wash off easily.  The next morning I had color on my skin and I hadn&#x27;t even went tanning.  When I used the product again in the tanning bed it burned twice as bad and left me twice as red all over.  As far as any tan coloration after the red wore off, I didn&#x27;t notice anything at all.  I tan very easily and found that I got more color in two sessions without tanning lotion than I got in a week using this product.  The one good thing I will say about this lotion is if you&#x27;re looking to sweat a few calories off this lotion is perfect for that...take a bottle of water, you&#x27;re going to be parched.</li>
            <li> 5 stars because you can&#x27;t find a better tingler lotion for the price. It lasts a long time and the smell isn&#x27;t as harsh as other lotions I&#x27;ve used. BUY IT! You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> The product was improperly represented in the description category. After having a horrible reaction to the product, I asked for an exchange , and was told no . It did not indicate it was a tingler and that was the most awful tanning session I ever had I actuall threw up in the tanning salon as soon as I got out of the bed .</li>
            <li> Love love love Insanely Black. I am not pale by any means, my father is half Italian, and I tan very easily, rarely burn. But I do hit a plateau after a certain point.... This broke through and made me darker than I have been in years. Love it. Would totally recommend.</li>
            <li> I love that it works immediately.&lt;br /&gt;After 30 minutes I&#x27;m super dark.&lt;br /&gt;Although it burns a little, I&#x27;ve gotten used to it!&lt;br /&gt;I only have to tan once a week and I keep my tan well.&lt;br /&gt;First time users... I recommend 15 minutes tops because you may get a bit of a burn.</li>
            <li> Not What I expected. That sums this up Really... It was a let down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When It said EXTREME tingle. I thought It might actually *tingle* I am a beginner tanner But I Have used a few other tingler samples &amp; went ahead and bought this.I would have to say if you have done tingles before... THIS PRODUCT doesn&#x27;t tingle that much at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad batch though lol Cuz everyone here is claiming it burned and Tingled majorly. Lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Also I do have to complain That the bronzer that is in this product If you rub it in too hard or it gets dry crumbles... lol I don&#x27;t know if that the right word for it  but it bunches up and You can really see it. I took a shower after using this product because I didn&#x27;t wanna walk around like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a little bit of a difference in color today, But I used it outdoors for about 20 minutes to see if I liked it,I definitely Enjoy this product as an outdoor tanner compared to ANY regular outdoor tanning oil.&lt;br /&gt;(Dont do outdoors if you dontknow what your doing lol :P)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am Not that Satisfied From this product. I might Use it alone for outside Use only or I might just mix it in With some REAL TINGLE samples from the salon. I Wont be Buying this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But hey You get what you pay for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;XoXoXo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tan-a-holic</li>
            <li> best indoor tanning lotion. it gets HOT if you can stand it.</li>
            <li> Aweful product under describes the extreme burning and instant redness the min you get on a bed aweful stuff do not buy !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Came quickly and works great</li>
            <li> I love tingle lotions, but I find that very few actually give me any tingling sensation, or redness. I am in love with Millennium tanning products (bronzers, accelerators, tingle) and this lotion was no different. I have a rich, golden brown base tan that with lotion has helped me achieve. However, it isn&#x27;t hot enough for my skin to break that barrier and take me into a darker level, and if I use it regularly now, I will have more of an orange hue - although only slightly. I recommend this lotion for anyone who has tried at least one other tingle before and wasn&#x27;t too badly affected by the sensation. This lotion should help you get to another level of tanning, if not to the maximum you&#x27;d like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just isn&#x27;t hot enough for me - as every person&#x27;s skin is different. However, it goes on smoothly. I don&#x27;t feel greasy and the smell is not overpowering. (Any indoor tanning leaves an odd scent afterwards, some lotion masks it better than others). This lotion has scent that is honestly friendly for both genders, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love it works great will bring tan out immediately.</li>
            <li> This burns and turns your skin red!!! Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> greatb tingle and colour</li>
            <li> This makes you dark really quick. After a few times of use and a bit getting used to, I absolutely love the results.</li>
            <li> Stuff is amazing. Gets you dark. It&#x27;s a tingler but doesn&#x27;t tingle much. I&#x27;m one who loves tinglers. Only downfall is ut turns you&#x27;re skin orange if you use It too much. I&#x27;d use it 3 times a week maybe, I have been and am very dark. Switching off with different lotions. Great smell! I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not as tingly as you would think. It tingles but its bearable. It really just depends on your skin. I&#x27;m  seriously in loooove with this tanning lotion it gets you super dark!</li>
            <li> Burns my skin! Instant burning red rash, my mother, and friend also tried it same reaction! :-( very disappointed</li>
            <li> A little streaky but defiantly has the tingle.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion.  It has a smooth scent ( not overly fruity),&lt;br /&gt;a good texture, and comes in an easy-to-dispense bottle.  Great bargain for the money.&lt;br /&gt;The tingle is really good, but not extreme.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product until I used it. It has a great tingle sensation which I really like but if you have ANY dry spot on your body it will turn orange and you MUST wash your hands with soap and water or your palms will turn orange as well. Too much bronzer! I&#x27;m sticking to a tingler without bronzer, they work the best!</li>
            <li> i had written a review on another tanning product and I purchased this as well to test it out. Insane describles this perfectly.  I used this stuff and in only one hour in the sun I saw results. Its a tingle which can be discomforting to some in the beginning but after a while I either got used to it or the tingle sensation just went away.  I was in Cancun last week so I had a base tan. After using this stuff I did get red as it was indicated on the label. But I wasn&#x27;t burned.  After I got out of the sun I was still red and a few hours later I got NOTICIBLY tanned. More than when I got back from Cancun. I am not a tanning expert but I will say if you don&#x27;t have a base tan I suggest NOT using this stuff until you do.  There is no sunscreen and if you do get burned using this stuff I believe serious harm can be done to your skin. As stated this stuff works but use caution.  As long as I am tanned I will be using this again and again.  It also has a pleasant smell to it.</li>
            <li> If you like tingle this is a great lotion.  Just using it a few times I was a shade darker and keeps me tan longer.  It is not a greasy lotion and smells great</li>
            <li> This contains DHA&#x27;s. It&#x27;s more like getting a spray tan than actually tanning. The product stains your skin and washes off in a few days......however it doesn&#x27;t wash off uniformally.....ended up with light and dark spots on my legs. Also it&#x27;s supposed to tingle, but I felt absolutely nothing. I don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> The tingle lotion body shots by ed hardy has been my absolute favorite lotion ever and has gotten me the darkest out of any tanning lotion on the market that I have tried. I am a year round tanner and have been tanning for about 3 years. This tingle reminds me of the body shots. It smells spicy if you know what i&#x27;m talking about haha. Its light and rubs in easily. It gets hot in the bed, but not burning your arm off hot. It does leave you red afterwards but it doesn&#x27;t last too long, at least for me. I have used it once so far, I switch up between tingles and bronzers and I am noticeably darker after one session with this. So far so good! Definitely recommend if you like tingles.</li>
            <li> Turns your hands orange would not buy again</li>
            <li> Smells godawful and burns like crap. I almost blacked out.</li>
            <li> I have used a tingle lotion before but this was too strong for me. It made me feel like I had creepy crawlyies all over and turned my skin a patchy red.</li>
            <li> It seemed stinky to me, it smelled a little like diesel oil. I tried mixing with other lotions to dilute the smell but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i will never buy this product again ever again hell no it leaves oranges blotche all over you i dont recommend you to buy just got this wednesday and it sucks</li>
            <li> one of the better tanning lotions i have used in the price range though i have never tried the really expensive ones. the cheap ones i find are greasy and dont do anything and i feel like this price range is as good as it can get as far as tanning goes. i like the smell and it has good bronzers in it to boost color.</li>
            <li> This product was well worth the money. A little on the intense side, so if your not use to a strong tingle or bronzer I suggest you start with something a little lighter. I really like the color I have gotten using this product.</li>
            <li> I used this the day I got it not reading the bottle bc the heading I bought it under didn&#x27;t mention that it was not a regular bronzer.  I had just started to tan so it took hours for my skin to calm down.  What a feeling I thought I had 3rd degree burns</li>
            <li> I truly love this tanning lotion. This is my second year purchasing this product and I will continue to use it for years to come.</li>
            <li> I recently tried a light tingle packet at my tanning salon....defintely a beginners tingle. I liked it.... So then I started reading about different lotions with that tingle factor. I came across Insanely Black and started reading the reviews. Honestly some of them on here scared the crap outta me because they said it was so intense. Ive tried Millenium tanning lotions previously so I ordered. Its always a great price and Ive liked the quality of what I used before in this line. Anyways so it came in today. I COULD NOT WAIT TO GO TANNING!!!! I know most of you said dont put it on your face but I did anyways. I guess Im fearless...lol.&lt;br /&gt;I tanned for 15 in a regular bed. The result......I LOVEEEEEE THIS LOTION!!!! The tingle was NOT unbearable and IM SOOOO DARK! ITS INSANE! I LOVE IT AND ILL NEVER USE ANOTHER LOTION AGAIN! Defintely try it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!!! The only down side... hard to believe there is one becuae I really love this product is when I haven&#x27;t tanned in a while I notice a bit of a orange like stain on my skin... Has anyone else expericence this?? I am taken back how strong the tingle factor is here... and it sells for less then $20, I have tried all the other brands and tingles at higher prices and nothing comapares to this product.. I will forever be a loyal customer!!</li>
            <li> Left skin red and splotchy.</li>
            <li> Be Careful! The product states it provides the ultimate tan with a tingling sensation, but it really means your body will feel like it&#x27;s on FIRE.  I thought my wife was exaggerating because she had fair skin, but when I tried it, I had a similiar feeling.  When I put this product on, my skin immediately began having a reaction to this product. (The makers may say that is the tingling experience) The sensation felt like running through a bush of stinging nettle&#x27;s or similiar to an entire body rash.  I couldn&#x27;t drive home fast enough to try to wash this stuff off.  If you into self inflicted pain...this is the product for you, if not, be careful with this.  I surely looked darker after coming out of the tanning bed, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was because of my body turning deep red from the chemical reaction it was causing. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> love love love love love this tanning lotion got super dark super fast and love the tingle and the hotness!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning lotion on the market.</li>
            <li> Love this product, but be prepared to feel the tingle. Tanning results with this product are great, but the tingle can be best described as the name &#x27; Insanely&#x27;. I typcailly dont like tingle tanning lotions, however if used in moderation, the results are great!</li>
            <li> Great product...got a nice tan, after only a few times.</li>
            <li> Terrible, worst lotion I have ever used before! I used in a level one bed LEVEL ONE, and it felt like my flesh was being burned off, I didn&#x27;t not get a deeper tan, I ended up going to the emergency room and I had to get an IV with Benadryl because this irratated me so badly. This wasn&#x27;t from the bed either! (I am a regular tanner)</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing for the price, i expected to get crap in a bottle, but this stuff WORKS! i usually can&#x27;t feel tingles because im so used to them, but this one is intense and the bronzers are great! It DIDN&#x27;T try my skin out, you can definitely feel the soft silicone&#x27;s that it has. I&#x27;ve tried many MANY lotions and spent top dollar for LESS results than what this stuff gave me in just 2 uses. Will definitely be buying again when i run out! and this is coming from a girl who would only use &#x27;Designer Skin&#x27; lotions until I found this :) Overall VERY pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product by mistake i didn&#x27;t realize it was a tingler until it was shipped to me. I figured since i already brought it i would try it even after the scary reviews of it being horrible. As a not so experienced tanner i found this products didn&#x27;t irritate my skin much i had a little burning sensation nothing to extreme i did not put it on my face because i&#x27;m not an idiot. i did seem to get darker after one use but nothing drastic perhaps after repeated use that will change? i will update my review in a month</li>
            <li> as long as you&#x27;re not fair-skinned, this stuff gets you dark, REALLY fast. I&#x27;m german with darker skin because of native american decent and I will get my desired color if i go everyday for a week. I highly recommend this to people who arent fair-skinned</li>
            <li> Truly intense. I had to out it to the side till I can handle it better. Super hot! Love the product</li>
            <li> Not too heavy and goes on very well.  A little bit goes a long way too.  This was a great deal and the delivery was very fast.  Faster than I expected.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion the very first time that I tanned. I strongly recommend that you use this on a level two bed. If you decide to use it for the first time be cautious. I love the deep soultry brown results from this lotion. It will not leave you orange and certainly will not dissapoint you. I strongly recommend this provider ,but most importantly this lotion.</li>
            <li> Great customer service. This product has a reddening agent and a tingle enhancer that is very severe. I used it once and won&#x27;t try it again. It caused a rash and made me feel like I had the flu for two days.</li>
            <li> Wow, first Time used and super tan, however my body is still burning especially on my legs since yesterday, i did a 10 min stand up tanning bed, product definitely works,  I&#x27;ll try it again to day but only for 6 min, not use to the burning or tingling. I&#x27;ll give another try, just about couldn&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried..it gets super hot..especially on the higher level beds so be prepared. Plus the heat/tingle stays with you for some time (feels good in Minnesota winters lol)&lt;br /&gt;I get so bronzed from this lotion, my friends tell me I need to stop tanning cuz I&#x27;m so dark!</li>
            <li> i had to return this because it burned my skin so bad :/ i didnt like it at all .. but the customer service for the return was great!!</li>
            <li> Just ok, I prefer the Solid Black</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. I have a good tan already and this product keeps increasing the color. I have bought other products that have a higher x&#x27;s and they do not work. I will be sticking with this one!</li>
            <li> Great!! But feels like a bad sun burn so if u can&#x27;t Handled that then you can handle this!!!! So go get your tan on great for outside and inside!!!</li>
            <li> I just recently ordered this product because i read the great reveiws so i tried it  and it had a extremly Intense burning sensation it did not feel good... my skin was extremly red and sensitive afterwards i did get a darker tan but i dont think its worth that burning sensation. needless to say bottle says on back (Not for the faint of heart) my advice is to try something else because this embodies extremly intense burning sensation.</li>
            <li> this lotion is exactly what it says it is........i have been told not to use the same lotions all the time, rotate them like you would your shampoo......so i have many lotions with and without tingle, this lotion is by far the hottest (tingle) and would drive someone nuts if they never used it before, but with all my lotions, i have found that i always seem to migrate back to this one because i know that it works...the aroma lacks alot to be desired, but, it works....i use other lotiions to keep a rotation, but if i have a special day or plans that require a nice color to my legs and arms, this is the lotion i use..........be sure to give your lotion time to work, it continues to work even after you get out of the tanning bed, wait to shower at least 3 hours, some people cannot handle the prickly feeling that long, but showering immediately after a session stops the process of lotions that keep tanning after you leave the tanning bed....be sure to check if your lotion keeps working after you tan, and shower accordingly, give yourself plenty of time to tan and shower before your get ready to go out!!!</li>
            <li> This lotion definitely makes you tingle. Be cautious where you put it on... Like on your face is not recomended. this lotion does  make you look a shade darker when you tan.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is the smell. It does have a strange scent. But the tan is worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> i love this tanning lotion you see immediate results and it is kind of hot so if you dont like hot then its not for you but i personally love the tingle lotions for the great results and i will purchase this product again!also VERY fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> I love this tingle lotion! It was cheap and had some mixed reviews but I figured I would try it and if needed I would add some bronze and tingle shots. Well let me tell you this stuff is amazing!! It didn&#x27;t feel bad on my body, but I was putting on my lotion for the first time before I left for the tanning beds, and I felt fine, Until I put it on my face, which for me I love a tingle on my face which people say is bad but I&#x27;ve never had an issue until now. My face was on fire instantly! I ran outside and dunked my face in the pool, didn&#x27;t work, got a wet towel, didn&#x27;t help. Put ice packs on my face. still burning so bad I started to cry.  Thankfully I have this cooling tanning lotion I never use I put it all over my face, but the tears still were coming, went away after about 15 minutes. Lesson learned, I suggest you do not put this on your face, but on your body it will give you an amazing tan!!</li>
            <li> It burns really bad, but gets you SO tan SO fast!</li>
            <li> This is the the best lotion i have used yet. It has a Great tingle and i have to say after using this i cant even tell any of my other lotions have tingle in them. It gives you a great color and doesnt make you look orange. Beware though i am use to tingle so if you arent or dont have a base tan i wouldnt use it at first if you cant stand the heat.  ;)</li>
            <li> I wanted to start my tan and thought this product would help. NOPE! Not for me! It did burn so I sat infront of a fan to cool off. I got no darker :(  I will stick with instant tan spray.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this lotion because of all the great reviews that I had read.  I have to say that it&#x27;s the worst lotion that I think that I have EVER used!  The smell of the lotion itself was disgusting, not to mention the smell after tanning!!  I did not feel any tingle effect whatsoever during the tanning session; however, 4 hours later, I started having some type of reaction.  I felt like I was being stung by a thousand bees!  At first I didn&#x27;t relate it at all with the lotion... until I used it one more time.  Oh....my...goodness!!!!!  It was the exact same symptoms 4 hours later.  I had to take so much allergy medicine to try to stop the intense itching.  I WILL NEVER USE THIS LOTION AGAIN!  I usually have no problems with the Swedish Beauty Green Tease tingle and the Swedish Beauty Stunning tingle lotions.  Obviously, there is something else in this lotions formulation that really doesn&#x27;t work too well for my skin.  Other than the intense allergic reaction, the only &amp;#34;tan/orange&amp;#34; thing on my body was my hands.  Hopefully, other people will not have the same reaction that I did.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to stay with Swedish Beauty products from now on.  Oh well... I guess you really do get what you pay for these days!  May God Bless!!!</li>
            <li> Great tanning product. Nice and tingly. Just a little too strong smelling for me that&#x27;s all. Otherwise it is great.</li>
            <li> Wow, I was scared to try this lotion after what everyone wrote!  but.... it is great!  Spot-test it on yourself first before you tan if you are like me and are not used to tingly lotions.  I&#x27;d never tried one but decided to go nuts and to try this one because I am a fool for tanning.  :)&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is awesome!  It feels like nothing for about 4 minutes... and then it begins... a feeling all over your body like you just ate a jalepeno pepper.  A big one!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the face is the most sensitive area.  I put this lotion all over my body after I&#x27;d done the spot-test, so I knew what I was getting into (I was nervous!)... and did my face.  Granted, I did go a little lighter on my face than I did on the rest of my body.&lt;br /&gt;Once in the tanner (with the fan on), I had a great time.  Yes, my face felt like it was going to blow up,  but my body felt just fine. I DEF felt the tingles.  I didn&#x27;t get UBER hot, though; I felt very good.&lt;br /&gt;I live in MN, so we are cold here; I liked the warming factor of this lotion.  It DOES subside, but it feels great and sorta peppery when it is tanning you.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t love the fragrance of this lotion. I have to say that. I felt like I smelled like I&#x27;d just eaten at Taco Bell.  Haha!&lt;br /&gt;I got out of the tanner and had a really red face even though I had a good base tan prior to my going in and using this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;But I felt like a BEAST after using it! I look fab and am PSYCHED to use it again!&lt;br /&gt;The editorial is right: this lotion is not for the faint of heart.  It&#x27;s for us tanning die-hards who can TAKE IT!  Are you game?</li>
            <li> This lotion is only for those who are not only serious tanners, but also like lotions that have a strong tingle factor in them. It has become one of my favorites. Will continue to reorder.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.would recommend.I am very please. Recieved it very quicly after my order was placed . Thank you so much. Have a great day.</li>
            <li> This lotion is Great!!!  I use this rotation with Blonde Bombshell and it gives me a lasting beautifly bronzed tan!!!  Does not have the nasty &amp;#34;after tan&amp;#34; smell!</li>
            <li> came in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Love it. Not tingly but don&#x27;t shower for a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used most every brand of combination high tingle and high bronzer for over 15 years and this one&#x27;s the hottest and darkest, with no orange color, at the cheapest price on the market at Amazon.com. I have been using it for a few years now and it still works like a charm every time! Not recommended for beginners!</li>
            <li> The tanning lotion is great. I am getting really dark. Does stain your hands if u don&#x27;t wipe off. Love the hot tingle factor. I would strongly recommend this product. Shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> Well, I got this lotion because I like tingle and in some other reviews people said it was very hot. So I gave it a shot, however won&#x27;t be buying again. In other reviews it states that it was very hot and don&#x27;t use it on your face. Well I did and it was hot at first, but not unbearable. The tingle went away within 3 minutes. Was not hot at all on the body to me. I probably would get the same color in a tanning bed if I didn&#x27;t use any lotion at all. Turns your hands orange. I will be buying my lotion directly from the tanning salon from now on. I&#x27;d rather pay more for something that actually does work!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great for changing you from just semi tan to a golden color in one use but it is really hot so I recommend using it right when you are gonna tan otherwise you are gonna be lobster red when you walk in.</li>
            <li> no I didn&#x27;t like it ,,, it was bad my skin was so red and sting my skin that cant be good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard to tan and this stuff gives you a tingle in your skin so be careful around the eyes.  This stuff worked great for me.</li>
            <li> This has done really well. After you get use to the tingle factor of this lotion. I love a tingle lotion but this one made me feel like I was in a fire ant bed until the next morning when I showered. But you can see very good results after only 4 uses</li>
            <li> IT WORK&#x27;S WELL FOR ME, IT&#x27;S JUSK INSANELY GOOD...</li>
            <li> It burned extremely bad n my body turned so red I looked like I had chemical burns all over my body I had 3 other people try a test spot on their arm n they all had the same result where it was applied</li>
            <li> Fast service, great product, fantastic price! This product takes my tan to the next level, But do a patch test if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fast Tanning!! I love this product! And everyone brags on my beautiful tanned skin when I&#x27;m out! I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I am new to this tanning thing and this is the first product I used. It sends a burning sensation through out my body. It tingles and shows great results. One week of not tanning and using the lotion, my color become noticeably paler quickly. I&#x27;m sure that is normal but it is just saying that the lotion has a lot of bronzer in it that gets washed of more and more after every shower you take. It smells good too!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing great reviews from other customers but was very dissatisfied with it... I didnt feel any tingle or notice any difference in my tab... I will now only buy my tanning lotions at my salon I would rather pay full price for the product and actually have it work</li>
            <li> I  Have never had a bad reaction to any tanning lotion and I have been tanning for several years.  This made my legs swell up and turn lobster red.  It was awful it burned (not tingle BURN) and I had white blisters afterwards.  I use another product from this line and I have had great success with it, but if you have sensitive skin like I do then I would stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion. I always get a great tan.  I would recommend this to everyone - especially if you like a bit of tingle.</li>
            <li> Best tingle I have ever used!! I love it! I have trouble tanning my il upper body and this lotion definitely helped! :)</li>
            <li> I have never used a tingle lotion before. The drawbacks...the smell, resembles some type of spice or pepper. If you have extremely sensitive skin, this is not for you. I washed my hands a couple times and picked up my daughter....her skin turned red like a welt where I touched her. I did get really dark the first time I used it. I felt like I really got a strong feeling of sun while in the bed. I was using the strongest bed. The second time I used it I did not get as dark but was still using an upgraded bed. I feel like it makes you get a stronger color but it is nothing amazing. For the price, it is good though.</li>
            <li> This lotion works good for me!! Insanely black does say it has a tingle factor but I have a tolerance for the tingle so I don&#x27;t feel anything. I mix it with another high tingle lotion and it works great. Overall good lotion, fast shipping,  and I will order again!!</li>
            <li> It was the best lotion I have ever used. I got the tingle and darkness I desired. Within a week I noticed my baseline tan</li>
            <li> First bought this lotion from a salon, and loved it but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price again when I ran out, so turned to amazon and so glad I did! Got a great product for an even better price!!   The tingle is really intense, and the bronzer is a great color too, I get so dark with this lotion! I love it !!!!</li>
            <li> Works very well dark after 1st tan it does turn you bright red but the best tanning lotin I have used</li>
            <li> The tingle factor leaves your skin bright red for 5-6 hours when tested in a patch area without entering the tanning bed. I can only imagine the effects after being in the tanning bed. Does not work on mine or my husband&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Enjoy product, I don&#x27;t get as dark as I thought I would but love the tone that it provides, does not look fake or make you look orange as some do.</li>
            <li> Really love. Helps get that deep tan you are looking for.</li>
            <li> This stuff is HOTTTT !!!  Will tan you but make you sweat too and turn sooooo red !!! I used it quite A few times the last time used it I almost blacked out and got super dizzy !!  Be careful with this for it is not for the faint hearted !!!</li>
            <li> I use this to go beyond a normal tan.  It stimulates with a hot sensation and the bronzer is immediate so you can see a difference within an hour.  This helps push past a plateau.</li>
            <li> Recieved faster than expected. Would not recommend if you have sensitive skin. Does give me a nice color after two sessions.</li>
            <li> One of the best tanning products. Out rite now . But u better like the tingle factor. Cause its. Up there. I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used tanning accelerators before (even ones from Millenium Tanning), which were all mildly uncomforatble, but worth it for the desired effect.  However, this particular tanning lotion was not pleasant at all!  After about two minutes in the tanning bed, I felt physically ill and actually had to stop tanning.  I felt dizzy and nauseous and my skin was extremely red from the lotion.  I knew from past experiences, that these types of lotions tingled and gave me a &amp;#34;flushed&amp;#34; appearance, but this this one was extreme.  My skin kept burning afterwards so I rinsed off the lotion as best as I could.  My skin was still tingling even after five hours.  If you can take the pain, this is probably a great lotion, but I will not be ordering this product again because it&#x27;s way too intense.</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and I get an amazing tan afterwords but I have to shower after using it because the lotion burns so bad.</li>
            <li> I did not like it but my son loves it and would definitely buy again.  He has tougher skin.</li>
            <li> OH, my gosh. This is the worst tanning lotion ever. If you have SENSITIVE skin, at all what so ever DO NOT USE IT. It feels like a incredibly bad sunburn for up to two hours, for me atleast. The pain was almost unbearable, and I didn&#x27;t know how bad it would hurt, and my friend made me try it, knowingly that I&#x27;d hurt. DON&#x27;T GET IT!....&lt;br /&gt;Although it bronzes your skin... But other than that, OUCH!</li>
            <li> I have edited this product after a month of using it... Changed it from 3 to 5 stars..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have olive skin and tan fairly well, and I have used tingle products before. I put this on my face and within 5 minutes my face felt like it was on FIRE, seriously, I thought I was going to need to go to the emergency room thats how bad it was. I didn&#x27;t even go in the tanning bed and it was already super hot. I waited until my face didn&#x27;t feel like it was on fire and I went tanning. About an hour later, I could definitely feel the rest of my body burning from the lotion. Maybe that is a plus?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 6 times of tanning, my face doesn&#x27;t burn prior to tanning and my body doesn&#x27;t insanely itch afterwards. I was using a lower level tanning bed and when I went back to the salon I normally go to - really great bulbs and higher levels - I INSTANTLY noticed a difference after tanning. Bronze to my skin and instantly a shade darker. If you do not rub in the lotion all the way you will notice streak lines, so it is worth it to blend in smoothly and take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are up for the *burning* challenge, this is a great tanning lotion. Also keep in mind the tanning beds you use, depending on their quality they can help enhance your tan results.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money...if I had gotten on sooner I would have returned and asked for my money back..trashing it</li>
            <li> I have used numerous tingle lotions as I have been tanning regularly for 6+ years. Most recently I was using Snooki Hot Bronzer. After using this just twice I notice a huge difference. The tingle is perfect for experienced tanners and people who use tingle lotions.</li>
            <li> The tingle starts off kind of hot but then it fades soon after and it turns me bright red. I do tan very well with it just wish the tingle was more intense. It smells good too tho. Overall I will try another kind of tanning lotion until I am 100% happy.</li>
            <li> love this product &amp; price, I have used this product  for the last three years 5 star all the way</li>
            <li> I read the label but never imagined the heat or burning tanning lotion could give!!  My hole body burned for about three hours and stayed red for about three more. So I won&#x27;t be using the rest of my lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Im an avid tanner, I&#x27;ve used several tingles, and this is by far the best!! It got me to a level in tan after one use I never got with any other lotion before. I love the red tints tingles give, but some brands, such as cherry bomb, the red fades away after a few hours. I tanned this morning, and now, getting ready for bed I.still have a beautiful warm tint to my tan. I tan warm naturally, and brown in beds. So this helps my sunbed tan look more like it came from laying by the pool instead of laying in a bed. Love that factor. I had tons of compliments on my tan today. It did get HOT but it didnt splotch me one bit. It was an even ,all over warmness as opposed to some tingles make me look splotchy. And I dont know if its all in my head or not, but my skintone looks much more even now. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> this lotion does working very well.the skin color after tanning is nice and golden. but the lotion gives you a little burning feelings from the begining,even before you start tanning. and my skin is not sensitive. i m tanning for 2 years now,got use to it. still this lotion to strong for me.  i read the reviews and people were saying its ok. i was feeling its like paprika inside the lotion.i dont think i will use this again.</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  I am a year round tanner, so I am always looking for diff tanning lotions to use.  This does give me a more noticeable coloring.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotion. it took me three days tanning to get color. very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Should have read details has a serious tingle/burning sensation. Would not recommend using it anywhere beside your legs or you will be in for a surprise!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely a hotter tingle lotion. The first time I used it, it stained my hands orange for a solid three days but then I sort of learned how to apply it properly. It got my legs super dark and didn&#x27;t stain my knees when I applied it lightly. I like mixing it with the Paint it Black lotion so the tingle isn&#x27;t so intense. The only down side that it does dry my skin out if I use it more than 3 times in a row. I switch between this and Paint it Black regularly and my tan is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Just opened and used for the first time, they talk about the tingle in the write-up, you might aswell rub a ghost pepper on yourself, can&#x27;t even wash it off very well.</li>
            <li> Experienced tanner but have never used any of these high quality tanners. Bought this on a whim and tried it for the first time today. Holy S***!  I was doing an 8 minute stand up and about 45 seconds in I thought I was on fire. About 3 minutes in my heart was racing so fast that I thought I was going to pass out.  I ended up stopping my bed with two min left - I just couldn&#x27;t take it anymore.  Sweat was pouring off my head and I felt like I would spontaneously combust at any moment. Took about 30 min for my heart to slow down.  4 1/2 hours later I am a nice red burned color but I am starting to turn dark. I know it&#x27;s a good lotion but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it again!</li>
            <li> Worked great. I liked it.</li>
            <li> This lotion packs a serious punch!  The tingle was more intense than I had anticipated,  but I got great color results after my first use!</li>
            <li> Best tanning stuff for the best price. Makes your body tingle and you&#x27;ll feel super hot after a good tan!</li>
            <li> Great color @ an awesome price. I love trying different tanning lotions...this lotion will give you color and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad.  I love mixing lotions together when you feel you just can&#x27;t reach that next level...I would not try this lotion on or near the face/eyes.</li>
            <li> Would not but this product again! Don&#x27;t know if this lotion was watered down or just old...but there was a Tingle for the first 2days and no none at all...rotated this lotion with Solid Black Tanning lotion and now my skin has turned orange..I would not recommend purchasing these 2 lotions at all...Poor Product!!!</li>
            <li> While I have been impressed with other products from this line, this one is OK.  The tingle doesn&#x27;t hold up after the initial application.  And it certainly doesn&#x27;t turn you insanely black very quick, other than your hands due to the high bronzer content</li>
            <li> Greatest indoor tanning lotion I have ever used....have purchased this particular one 6 times and will continue to buy it...GREAT</li>
            <li> I have used lotions that tingle many times before , and I have been tanning for years. This paticular lotion was very extreme, It felt like it was literally burning my skin off, could not use on my face at all had to wipe it off as soon as I put it on it started burning my eyes and was not tolerable, my arms were better but not much. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was inexpensive. With the bad reviews in mind, I still purchased it because I tan easily and never have issues with burning or issues with lotions in general. With that said, this product was HORRIBLE for me. Just putting it on my skin and not doing indoor tanning resulted in a rash. Where ever I put the lotion on my skin, it turned beat red and started itching. After about an hour it would go away. When tanning with this product I HAD TO CUT MY TANNING IN HALF (remember this if you choose to use it). I would not feel hot but again, would turn red. After a few hours it would go away and then a tan would appear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, who tans easily and has no issues--I would not recommend this product. Spend the extra $10 at your local salon for a better product.</li>
            <li> It makes you skin feel Great! And it a good moisturizer. I&#x27;m hard to tan but this worked out perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I use this product over my bronzer and get GREAT color!! Its does get hot but the color is WELL worth a little bit of heat in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Loved this tanning lotion it was intense to the max and delivered an amazing tan not a lotion I would use for everyday use though</li>
            <li> It burns so bad and gets on everything and anything you touch. Avoid if you have children.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!!! For the price the results are amazing! Yes if you&#x27;re not an &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; tingler it will burn but after using them I crave the tingle feeling. And yes it turns you red for a few hours which it&#x27;s supposed to do, but WOW does it make you dark! I switched to this after using ed hardy body shots and I get the most perfect color with it! I use it 2x a week to stay a golden bronze that everyone compliments. I&#x27;ve bought it 3 times now and can&#x27;t stay away :)</li>
            <li> I have used three other Millennium tanning products (Black Storm, Solid Black, Paint It Black) and this one (Insanely Black) is BY FAR the worst.  Unlike other reviewers, my issue is not the tingle (which is moderate IMO), but the smell! It smells like nasty self-tanner.  Also, it was orange and left stains between my fingers.  I did not have these issues with the other 3 Millennium tanning lotions I mentioned.  They&#x27;re all comparably priced so scoop those up and AVOID this one at all costs.</li>
            <li> This a great tanning lotion and I used it everyday when I go tanning and the smell is so great and I would buy this product .</li>
            <li> makes your skin feel like it is on fire and turns you scolding red right after you put it on before you even catch any sun rays. did not even catch a tan outside with it on</li>
            <li> It burns! Well, me at least, but people seem to like that. I don&#x27;t like it in the bedroom, I don&#x27;t like it in the tanning bed.... room.  Not for the sensitive. I gave mine to my Mexican friend. She digs it.</li>
            <li> I do not blame the seller, but both myself and my spouse have been tanning for 10+ years. I purchased this but didnt read the &amp;#34;tingling&amp;#34; factor.  When we used it last night in the tanning bed - I felt more than a tingle  - I got burnt and tingled for most of the night -- very uncomfortable. BUT my spouse used it and had a horrible allergic reaction. WE almost ended up going to emergency room. After about 4 hours of non stop pinpricking itching - we googled this product. Turns out this product mixed with certain products tanning bed cleaning products cause this reaction.  He took benedryl, took 2 showers, lotion, alcohol rub, and powder. He could not even rest / fall asleep until 2 am. I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion does get very hot so have a base tan before using it. I have been tanning for awhile now so my skin is tough enough for this kind of lotion. You should be dark already before using it. Iam very dark but this lotion still gets me very red after tanning with it. I look like I have a brownish reddish sunburn after tanning. I like the lotion since it gets so hot. I use it at least once a week alternating with bronzers. I would not want to use this each time I go tan once a week for me is enough. Thank you, Brandy</li>
            <li> works very well just the smell as wasn&#x27;t pleasant as I had thought. Also you must apply perfectly even or else some spots will be much darker than others</li>
            <li> Be careful if you have light/pale skin because the heavy sunless tanner in this can turn your skin pretty orange. The tingle was indeed warm, but not unbearable. Definitely do a test patch on a more sensitive area before you commit to putting it in your whole body. Places like the backs of your arms or inner thighs can sting more than less sensitive areas. Don&#x27;t use this lotion unless you are having trouble getting darker after you&#x27;ve already got a good base tan, it&#x27;s not really necessary otherwise.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for about a year and absolutely love it!  I have tanned for almost 20 years and prefer lotions that have both tingle and bronzer in them.  It has one of the strongest tingles I have ever used.  I always keep a bottle on hand.</li>
            <li> This was ridiculously tingly and without any bronzing or darkening power. I tan easily, and I like tingle, this left me red and burning for hrs after but once it was gone there was nothing to show for it just the redness from tingling was gone, but doesn&#x27;t leave you anymore tan! So disappointed, after 3 uses, hoping I was wrong and would get a result, I gave it away to a friend. I felt like the only purpose of the product was to make you tingle for some hours and thats it! Nothing else! And dont touch your face or eyes especially after using it, wash hands thoroughly because it will burn and itch like the devils inside you!</li>
            <li> Makes you &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34;.  Trying to find someone to trick with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. Good results. The delivery time is very fast.</li>
            <li> This tingle tanning lotion is the best, I haven&#x27;t bought anything else in the past 4 years. Definitely the best bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I love the shoe. I&#x27;m very big in Crossfit &amp; love to run 3-10 miles an this shoe is awesome. I wear 11 size I did have to go with 11E because shoe was little mor narrow than I&#x27;m used to. This is my second pair of the minimus style I really like them.</li>
            <li> Hurts badly. But if you like tingle would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, even the smell which is usually not good on some tanning products. I am a repeat customer</li>
            <li> a lot of tingle , too much for me.</li>
            <li> Make sure u read further down.....in the detail of the product it says nothing about a mega tingle factor.......let me just say...its really hot!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pale and the bronzers really help me. I can go out for a little bit and build up my tan without looking ridiculous in the process. It does sting, but I think that is helping me tan too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that this lotion is getting me very tan...I&#x27;ve used ROAR previously and it works great. This lotion has some heat, but I don&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even gotten into the tanning bed yet and holy crap!!!  I decided to do a skin test and only put it on my thigh just to see how I would react to the tingle. I haven&#x27;t ever used one before so I wanted to test the water before jumping in... Well Hotdang!  My skin turned BRIGHT red, burned, itched, and raised up where the lotion had been put. I&#x27;m a tad scared to put this all over my body and lay in a hot tanning bed. Lol. Its still currently on my leg, and its been about 45 minutes. Its no longer a burning sensation, now it is truly tingling. I&#x27;m getting in the tanning bed tonight to hopefully  not be disappointed with the tan it should give me. I payed for an intense tingle, and that is definitely what I got!!  This lotion is not for a cry baby!</li>
            <li> Just got this today and after reading the horrible reviews I was a little skeptical. So I tried it on a small spot on my arm then waited then my legs...and I must say I liked the heat. No rash. No redness.  No issues at all can&#x27;t wait to try it out full spectrum.</li>
            <li> i bought this item last summer and it has lasted me into the spring. this spreads pretty far for a lotion. i do like the instant color that i get from this however, for me i just dont feel like it last as long as i would like it to. i do get very red after use and it fades into a great bronzed glow but, if i take a day or two off i find that my color fades very fast. maybe its just me not sure cuz i do live in a tiny town in upstate n.y and my selection of tanning beds is very small so maybe its just junkie beds but other then then that i do like the color and the tingle from this but the first time i use it in a while i can litteraly hear my heart beating and feel my skin pulsing lol idk if that makes scence but its true. and u must eat befor or u can get lightheaded and feel sick. but i give this lotion a 4 outta 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> I tried the Insanely Black and personally I thought it was okay....nothing special..It made my skin red but didnt really tan me all that well.</li>
            <li> First ! When it came I could smell this rotton egg sent, as I started to open the damaged box I felt wetness on my hands the bottle had opened and it was all over. From just the smell of it I would not tell any one to buy this product,it stained my hands orange just in a few sec.so I would say rotton is a good name for thief lotion.</li>
            <li> It works wonderful. After 4-5 uses I had a really good tan. Most tingle tanning lotions makes spots on me but this one didn&#x27;t.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love this item! It gets tingly but not to the point where you don&#x27;t want to use it anymore! Also, smells amazing and leaves your skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Hated it. It caused my legs to blister. I have been tanning for yrs and this was very painful and msy scar don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> MAKE SURE YOU RUB IT IN EVENLY</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing I have not purchased this. It&#x27;s my understanding that it say was supposed to be a dark bronzer; however, I read all 172 comments and it&#x27;s a Tingler????? WTF.  NO THANK YOU I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TOO, LET ME ADD I DID PURCHASE THE MILLENNIUM TANNING 100Xs  SOLID BLACK BRONZER TANNING LOTION.  It was my impression, that a 100Xs dark tanning bronzer is supposed to give you more darkness than a 50 Xs bronzer?  Why is this not the case with this particular 100 times dark bronzer?  Does anyone know of any REAL 100Xs dark tanning?  Oh, I read many of the comments stating that the millennium 100 times darker bronzer smells so good and doesn&#x27;t leave the afterburn smell?  What the heck? Where are these people&#x27;s sense of smell or did I get one of those scammed, old solid black bottles or perhaps somebody poured a different type of lotion in the damn bottle and calls it 100Xs dark tanning bronzer. Anyhow, if I  did get the real deal Millenium 100Xs DARKTANNING BRONZER then I completely disagree with those people that state that it has a great smell before &amp; after, after one tanning bed session your skin is two times darker, and again maybe I am disillusioned but I had thought  that 100 times would be more potent than 50Xs? What a great disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;The only positive I will say about the solid black 100 times dark tanning bronzer is it has not left orange streaks nor orange tint on my hands or body!</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion! If you like tingle you&#x27;ll love this. Skin is a little red right after but turns into great color a few hours later. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> the product did not really work for me. I am not sure what is in it but it made my skin feel like it was burning off and the skin did not react really good to it</li>
            <li> I love a silicone based tanning lotions.  They  feel better to the skin.  Has a good smell for a man&#x27;s tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this lotion, causes severe redness and streaks terribly.  I don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I continue to buy this lotion again and again because it is by far the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used! If you can handle the tingle I definitely suggest using Insanely Black! The price is also amazing :-) You would definitely pay a pretty penny for this in a salon! I&#x27;ve tanned for about 10 years &amp; I&#x27;ve used this lotion 8 months but it doesn&#x27;t take long to get results. I get so many compliments on how pretty &amp; deep my tan is.  I was even asked to take a picture for a tanning salon billboard :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work.  Causes the skin to get a rash for about two hours so extremely unnatural sensation.  Don&#x27;t think it made my skin darker so very disappointed because it was expensive too.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll probably just throw it away.  What a RIP OFF</li>
            <li> This burns your skin like crazy and leaves you red as a tomato when you leave the tanning bed, if you like a tingle lotion this is for you!  I however, do not and will not be buying this produt again!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it , made me feel like i was getting burnt in the tanning bed and when i got out I was all red.  maybe it was something that I did and I have used many</li>
            <li> i usually do not buy the tingles as i dont like the burning feeling.  this product is great. 1st time i used itwas HOT. after that my body was use to it and now after 4 times using i am Dark.  i would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Immediate results if you can stand the the tingle factor! The initial use is like riding a motorcycle naked in a hail storm!  But it is less and less with each use!</li>
            <li> I like the instant color is apparent, and the tingle is intense and fades into a dark lasting tan great</li>
            <li> Turns ur fingers orange!</li>
            <li> It work great the first 2 bottles and I gave 5 stars the first time. But no so much now I guess I got use to it. I moved up to a higher tingle</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.. Best yet!!</li>
            <li> Horrrrrible made my skin turn bright red and burn. Highly discourage purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying i always order from here I order one day and the next day my order is here. I wanted to try a tingle because the bronzers i was using made  me feel like I&#x27;m couldn&#x27;t get any darker. I&#x27;ve used paint it black from the line before and I loved it. Then I used solid black  y u k hated it. After that I used j wow it was ok. Than I ordered smoke I loved that got dark in one tan than sn o o k i and now insanely black. Let me say this i used insanely black from the neck down got into the booth i was really hot, after  about eight minutes I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle any more it was making me uncomfortable because of my skin on  the lamps but I can say I was so dark it was crazy people thought I got sprayed tanned That&#x27;s how dark I was I like the results but not the pain involved lol but they say you have to pay the price if you want to look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update*****&lt;br /&gt;I been using this for the past week and it&#x27;s nOt tingly at all I feel like I&#x27;m putting on a regular bronzer. I don&#x27;t know what happened its like I only got the tingle the first few sessions ? It does get me dark but I could of got a bronzer for all that.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely insane! I thought for sure I was having an allergic reaction and was going to need to go to the ER. I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin what so ever; however, after 5 min of applying the lotion it felt as if my skin was on fire. It felt like I had rubbed acid all over my body. I do not recommend this product. I will stick to Black Storm!</li>
            <li> This product is ok. My fault not reading that it is tingle. Don&#x27;t care for tingle much</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is soooo good and it&#x27;s a heat lotion and my goodness does it heat up. Works amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say that I am an intermediate tanner, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tingle and bronzing products to see what kind of results they produce. This product is by far the most INTENSE tingle I have ever experienced. The tingle kicks in right away, is super intense and last for a long time. It&#x27;s been about an hour after my tanning session and I can already see the darker color show through. I haven&#x27;t been tanning in three months and this was my first session back. I used a high pressure level 4 bed with a max time of 20 minutes. I&#x27;m excited to see the results of this product over a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion is the bomb, a hot bomb.  It does the trick, makes you tingle, and brings on the tan of the summer.  My daughter loved it and we used up two bottles this summer.  A real deal. Google Amazon and get a few bottles now.  Save them for next summer when you may not be able to find it.</li>
            <li> Favorite lotion!!! Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> WARNING: if you cannot handle stinging &amp; tingling (like Caspian in hot peppers) on your skin,&lt;br /&gt;Then DO NOT purchase this item.  The very first exp I had with this product, was extremely&lt;br /&gt;overwhelming.  I saw the warning, but wasn&#x27;t sure what it would do when applied.  Getting&lt;br /&gt;beyond the weird, but pungent smell was the first obstacle. then...  I began to apply. This stuff was&lt;br /&gt;absolutely crazy!  I applied it everywhere that you tan... neck, arms, backside, legs, chest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE GOD, make it stop stinging!!!  the areas that were irritated were my neck, underarms, around the breast,&lt;br /&gt;and close to the crotch area.  I run to get water to wash it off... DONT WORK!! lol  I was a mess for about 15 min&lt;br /&gt;then it somewhat tapered off. I layed outdoors the first time.. worked well, hot though(sweated a lot)&lt;br /&gt;skin was red but that went away and then deep dark tan replaced it the next day.  went to the bed, and was VERY&lt;br /&gt;careful on application...  session went well, but again... was very hot.  I liked the results TOTALLY, and if I&lt;br /&gt;hadn&#x27;t of found another product that was made by the same co. Millinium.  I would probably torture myself with&lt;br /&gt;the tingling sting to obtain the results so quickly and very efficiently.  I did get splotched with some orange spots&lt;br /&gt;a couple of times on the ankle and between the fingers but I made sure that I rubbed it in after that and had no more&lt;br /&gt;problems  I may buy it again</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this tanning lotion. It left streaks on my hands and arms and also rubbed off on my clothes even though it was dry. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I expected when I received in in the mail and matched the description on the website</li>
            <li> a little too much tingle but good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced tanner and I do like this lotion and would repurchase. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dried out and the smell isn&#x27;t bad...&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s rare first of all (in response to other reviews) that you won&#x27;t smell somewhat like a tanning bed after using a tanning bed. Secondly, I like serious tingle and I didn&#x27;t feel the tingle after a week of using it. I do like the bronzers ... and key word BRONZER... as expected it does wash off but I still get great color. The price is unbeatable and the shipping was very fast! :) I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I got this product and I was unaware it was a tingle lotion. after I had received my order I noticed it was a tingle lotion. other than this it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I made this purchase not knowing that this product contains a tingle factor.  The lotion broke out mine and my daughter&#x27;s skin.  I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> The tingle may take your breath away until you get used to it but the color and tan I get from this lotion is beyond many others. This is my second bottle I pair it with paint it black alternating every other day.</li>
            <li> This is serious tingle. This was my very first tingle lotion and I thought I was going to puke I was in so much tingly pain all over. It did make me darker tho so if tingle doesn&#x27;t bother you or you really wanna get dark then I&#x27;d recommend it. Just make sure to do a spot test first on alot of parts on your body. :)</li>
            <li> must have been damaged because it didn&#x27;t tingle at all. iv used this product before, but this didn&#x27;t work like the last time.</li>
            <li> Was a terrible lotion  it made me feel like I was burning/on fire the whole 12 min in tanning bed.  Then whole body was shaking and got sick to my stomach for about hour and half after</li>
            <li> If you are new to tanning DO NOT use this lotion!!!!! I have been tanning for years and have used several different lotions with a tingle.  Nothing compares to this. I felt the tingle as soon as the bed turned on. If you are an experienced tanner this lotion is AWESOME!! I totally recommend this lotion but only to those of yall who tan on a regular basis and are fully aware of what a tingle lotion does because this is by far the best!!!!!!!!!!</li>
