            <li>Oh, one more thing....not good at painting your own nails?  </li>
            <li>This particular color is awesome.  </li>
            <li>It is the most popular brand used where my daughter works.  </li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear this color.  </li>
            <li>Love the versatility of it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t connect that to the polish until I just took the latest polish off of my nails</li>
            <li>Okay when i got this it looks just like the picture</li>

            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more of a gold tone.</li>
            <li>I also used top coat as recommended.</li>
            <li>An experiment, for sure.</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>love the color</li>
            <li>I love love love this product and have told all of my friends to RUN and purchase.</li>
            <li>This polish is a great product so far.</li>
            <li>It holds up about a week, but you must use their top coat and no base.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This is a great polish for a regular manicure.  </li>
            <li>I really loved having polish that lasts for a week, but it clearly does not work for me.</li>
            <li>Easy application, dries VERY quickly, almost too quickly with the ceiling fan running.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fun to wear and versatile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very interesting, fun and unusual color.  </li>
            <li>The texture of the paint itself is unique.  </li>
            <li>Like Sally Hanson complete better !</li>
            <li>Color is very cool, very much like a beetle.</li>
            <li>I bought it to go with Midnight Swim (which is blue) and while they still look good together</li>
            <li>Funky cool color.</li>
            <li>Probably a good color for younger ladies!</li>
            <li>and how it only looks good for 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I expected it to be more like the iced coral that I loved so much, (Which I can&#x27;t find in  vinylux..)  </li>
            <li>Dries super fast!!  </li>
            <li>and I noticed that my nails started to peel, chip, and break more frequently.  </li>
            <li>So fun.</li>
            <li>Great for stamping, especially over red or brown.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I love this polish line for the fact that it actually stays on for 7 days.  </li>
            <li>Its a nice color just didnt come out the color i expected.</li>
            <li>PLUS, for the first time in my life, I&#x27;ve come across a color that doesn&#x27;t chip 4 hours after I put it on.</li>
            <li>It still looks as fab as the first day</li>
            <li>no light just top and bottom coat important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly gold, but in lower light the green comes out.  </li>
            <li>but when you paint it on your nails its pretty much just gold.</li>
            <li>With a second coat it turns more green and is a pretty awesome color as it changes between green and gold</li>
            <li>I used with sticky basecoat and the vinylux top coat, so that may contribute to why it lasted so long.</li>
            <li>I like how it dries so fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on day 6 and so far so good - only minor signs of wear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on this color than on any other and it wears forever!</li>
            <li>I have fast growing nails that do not usually chip or peel.  </li>
            <li>She is a stylist at  a high end salon.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear gloves and this week I did dishes by hand, gardening, moving boxes, and washed my hair more than a few times</li>
            <li>Actually the product is amazing, but this color is just a little too insect green for me as it dries more.</li>
            <li>A bit dark, but it goes on easily and covers well.  </li>
            <li>This nail polis along with the top coat does what is expected and lasts an entire week.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and easy prep</li>
            <li>I have had better luck with other brands that give the same gel look without the lamps.</li>
            <li>so I tend to go through only half a bottle before I need to buy a new one, but those who are wearing it love it</li>
            <li>This nail polish shows different colors with different outfits its really cool.  </li>
            <li>(I use conditioning acetone remover for natural</li>
            <li>While this polish goes on gold on the first coat, the green and blue hues show up easily within the second coat.</li>
            <li>This color is a little different but very cool.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice change from the ho-hum pink, green, red, ya ya ya colors.  </li>
            <li>As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li>This stuff holds up like no other polish.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This didn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I felt that is didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> This nail coat really does last a week or longer without chipping or wearing thin.</li>
            <li> Kind of a weird night of the walking dead green...</li>
            <li> It started off looking like iridescent turquoise and gold, but when it dried it turned a yucky green and got worse the more days passed.  </li>
            <li> only one finger has a slight chip.</li>
            <li> While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different colors from this line</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  not what I expected.</li>
            <li> It shifts from gold to green to blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails, and this polish lasted for at least a week with no chipping.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other colors.</li>
            <li> Its as runny as other polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either gold - green - or it will match the clothes i have on.  </li>
            <li> And green.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe this color as &amp;#34;Beetle&amp;#34; if that wasn&#x27;t such a creepy word to use for a nail color.  </li>
            <li> gold with subtle green.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled.</li>
            <li> Not good for any skin tone.</li>
            <li> This color makes chips very hard to see as well which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated with nail polish</li>
            <li> Hate this color..</li>
            <li> This color is outrageous!</li>

            <li> beautiful for party&#x27;s or Christmas time or whenever</li>
            <li> Interesting color!  Speedy shipping!  A+++++++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails, and this polish lasted for at least a week with no chipping.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear this color.  It is almost like a &amp;#34;mood-color&amp;#34;.  It&#x27;s either gold - green - or it will match the clothes i have on.  Love the versatility of it.</li>
            <li> This nail polish shows different colors with different outfits its really cool.  Long lasting and easy prep no light just top and bottom coat important.</li>
            <li> Great color!!!  Last longer than a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why CND is trying to recreate nail polish.  The original nail polish they had was the best on the market.</li>
            <li> VINYLUX is a great product. This polish stays on for about 7 days. This color is a little different but very cool.  Very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have use CND shellacs for years and they are the best product on the market. However, Vinilux series are not at all living up to the same standards in it&#x27;s class. While it is not gel, clearly, it does not hold up very well, some colors do not correspond to the same colors in shellac, and the worst thing of all - the product does not go on the nail smoothly - it stays streaky and does not give you that thick glossy finish that shellac does. Frankly, I think it is even inferior to a regular OPI  nail polish. Dissappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more compliments on this color than on any other and it wears forever!</li>
            <li> I love this polish line for the fact that it actually stays on for 7 days.  However, it caused layers of my nails to peel off with use.  I have fast growing nails that do not usually chip or peel.  I&#x27;ve used a few different colors from this line and I noticed that my nails started to peel, chip, and break more frequently.  I didn&#x27;t connect that to the polish until I just took the latest polish off of my nails and I literally watched layers of my nail come off when I removed it. (I use conditioning acetone remover for natural nails.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not happen to you, and it may be a great product for your nails.  I really loved having polish that lasts for a week, but it clearly does not work for me.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t last as long as others I&#x27;ve tried. It had good coverage but started chipping after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Okay when i got this it looks just like the picture but when you paint it on your nails its pretty much just gold. With a second coat it turns more green and is a pretty awesome color as it changes between green and gold i just wish there was some blue. Maybe it settled to the bottom? idk i will try again and see if there is a change. Its a nice color just didnt come out the color i expected. This nail polis along with the top coat does what is expected and lasts an entire week. Will def. be buying more colors.</li>
            <li> I do like this polish-- but there isn&#x27;t any blue in it.  I bought it to go with Midnight Swim (which is blue) and while they still look good together it&#x27;s  not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled. Like Sally Hanson complete better !</li>
            <li> This is a nice change from the ho-hum pink, green, red, ya ya ya colors.  This goes with anything.  This nail coat really does last a week or longer without chipping or wearing thin.</li>
            <li> Great for stamping, especially over red or brown.</li>
            <li> This color is GORGEOUS! I am a profession nail tech and received numerous compliments when I had this on my nails. It shifts from gold to green to blue. It makes me think of a dragon&#x27;s scale. Dries in 8 minutes!</li>
            <li> A bit dark, but it goes on easily and covers well.  I expected it to be more like the iced coral that I loved so much, (Which I can&#x27;t find in  vinylux..)  I do recommend it the Gilded Pleasure though.</li>
            <li> This polish is a great product so far. NO CHIPPING!! Dries super fast!!  Funky cool color. gold n blue hues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe this color as &amp;#34;Beetle&amp;#34; if that wasn&#x27;t such a creepy word to use for a nail color.  It&#x27;s a very interesting, fun and unusual color.  I&#x27;ve received lots of compliments on the color.  PLUS, for the first time in my life, I&#x27;ve come across a color that doesn&#x27;t chip 4 hours after I put it on. Recommend!</li>
            <li> While this polish goes on gold on the first coat, the green and blue hues show up easily within the second coat. It&#x27;s very fun to wear and versatile. I will likely wear this a lot this coming fall/winter.</li>
            <li> A trendy color that can work spring or fall.  CND performs great.</li>
            <li> I like the color.  It has alot of different tones to it.</li>
            <li> This polish stays on longer then most.  It is the most popular brand used where my daughter works.  She is a stylist at  a high end salon.</li>
            <li> So fun. It becomes whatever color your wearing.</li>
            <li> This is a great polish for a regular manicure.  It holds up about a week, but you must use their top coat and no base.</li>
            <li> So many compliments on the color. Easy application, dries VERY quickly, almost too quickly with the ceiling fan running. I&#x27;m on day 6 and so far so good - only minor signs of wear.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Nail polish lasts about 5-7 days. Don&#x27;t like shellac so this is a better alternative for me! Will be buying more</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery. .. item came as described</li>
            <li> Kind of a weird night of the walking dead green... I was hoping for more of a gold tone. Probably a good color for younger ladies!</li>
            <li> This color is outrageous! It&#x27;s so awesome!! Have had it on my toenails now for two weeks and still looks great</li>
            <li> Manicure lasts a week or more! I can&#x27;t wait to try other colors. Great product. I also used top coat as recommended.</li>
            <li> Looove the color!  It&#x27;s mostly gold, but in lower light the green comes out.  The texture of the paint itself is unique.  I like how it dries so fast.  The durability is definitely two steps above OPI.</li>
            <li> This product works SO well. As long as you use the Scrub Fresh and the top coat, per the directions, this polish will last at least a week with NO chipping!</li>
            <li> I am on day 10 since I put this polish on and no chips!  It still looks as fab as the first day I applied it.  I&#x27;ll admit, I didn&#x27;t believe it when I decided to buy it but I&#x27;m a believer now.  Great stuff!  This particular color is awesome.  Its a green/gold.  Eye catching. You will get compliments wherever you go.  This stuff has made me nix my decision of having to go back to the salon to get my nails done.  I was so frustrated with nail polish and how it only looks good for 2 days.  With vinlylux, no worries.  Wash your hands a million times a day?  Got your hands in dishwater every night?  Dont worry.  This stuff holds up like no other polish.  Not one chip. Great product.  Oh, one more thing....not good at painting your own nails?  This is almost fool proof.  It has a different texture than regular polish so it goes on a lot easier.  Its as runny as other polishes.</li>
            <li> Actually the product is amazing, but this color is just a little too insect green for me as it dries more. It started off looking like iridescent turquoise and gold, but when it dried it turned a yucky green and got worse the more days passed.  An experiment, for sure.</li>
            <li> I like the quality of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying this product to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I bought this product!</li>
            <li> Color is very cool, very much like a beetle. gold with subtle green. I used with sticky basecoat and the vinylux top coat, so that may contribute to why it lasted so long. At day 7, there is some wear at the edge of my nails and only one finger has a slight chip. This color makes chips very hard to see as well which is a plus. I don&#x27;t wear gloves and this week I did dishes by hand, gardening, moving boxes, and washed my hair more than a few times so I am impressed at how it lasted.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t super impressed with the brands quality of nail polish. I felt that is didn&#x27;t last that long. I have had better luck with other brands that give the same gel look without the lamps.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Love the color.  Lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> Gilded Pleasure is a prettier name than what I call it, &amp;#34;Bug-shell green&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s a ringer for a long-discontinued, much more expensive color. Its formulation causes it to clump after awhile so I tend to go through only half a bottle before I need to buy a new one, but those who are wearing it love it and it&#x27;s still a great color.</li>
            <li> love the color it is a great accent color</li>
            <li> I love love love this product and have told all of my friends to RUN and purchase. Hate this color.. It&#x27;s gold... And green. Not good for any skin tone.</li>
