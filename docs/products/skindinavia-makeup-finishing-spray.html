            <li>It is the best finishing spray I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>I spritz my face in the morning and my makeup still looks great in the evening.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the bridal one because I don&#x27;t want a super matte look so this one is GREAT for me!</li>
            <li>love!</li>
            <li>every one of them came in their own packaging box from the brand, were wrapped in plastic &amp; had the lid to the spray part shrink wrapped &amp; then was wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li>This works pretty good!</li>
            <li>&amp; if it is in fact authentic.  </li>
            <li>I have heard such wonderful things about this brand</li>
            <li>refreshing, helps my makeup stay, gets rid of that powdery look, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li>And the price for the size of the bottle is fantastic!</li>
            <li>it overall great!!!</li>
            <li>This one did not come in its own box (which is fine if it doesn&#x27;t originally come in a box from the brand), it did not have a lid &amp; was just wrapped in bubble wrap.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply and a bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li>The spray pump doesn&#x27;t spray/dispense the product in fine droplets.</li>
            <li>Having a lid to the squirt part is important to me &amp; the fact that it was packaged the way it was makes me question the authenticity of the product itself.  </li>
            <li>but I have to be honest that the whole experience of the way it was packaged made me question where it came from</li>
            <li>Great comp to Urban Decay&amp; cheaper!</li>
            <li>The product would be great if it would actually come out of the container.</li>
            <li>I have super oily skin after years of trial and error</li>
            <li>A nice finishing spray that sets makeup and gives a barely perceptible luminous glow.  </li>
            <li>I just hope that what I purchased was authentic &amp; not tampered with in any way &amp; that I am giving a review of the actual product &amp; not an immitation.  </li>
            <li>Makeup stays fresh looking all day and night til I&#x27;m ready to take it off .</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>and it holds up very well!</li>
            <li>but this one really does!</li>
            <li>I still find my foundation (higher end) rubbing off on everything, even after I&#x27;ve applied this.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it works wonderful as a refresher spray if my skin is feeling a little dry.</li>
            <li>As good as more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>another plus is that I have SUPER sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash!</li>
            <li>If you live in hot humid climates this is a must!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for emailing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was not expecting to like this product as much as I do.</li>
            <li>This product has noticeably made my makeup stay &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; for so much longer.</li>
            <li>and I live in hot, humid Florida.</li>
            <li>I have been using Urban Decay&#x27;s version of this (also by Scandinavia) for a couple of years and found the original product by an internet search.</li>
            <li>The weather has gotten much warmer &amp; humid where I live</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin &amp; this was extremely drying on my skin &amp; did not do as good of a job at holding my makeup in place as other makeup setting sprays that are way cheeper like the NYX dewy &amp; matte finishing sprays.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>So by buying the Skindinavia version you get twice as much for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s exactly the same (smell, function) as Urban Decay</li>
            <li>Keeps my makeup fresh and long lasting.</li>
            <li>but the only email I received back from them was the same email they sent me in the first place asking me to alert them of any issues before writing my review.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s the same price as the Urban Decay setting sprays for DOUBLE the product.</li>
            <li>so I have really gotten to test it in cold, dry weather &amp; now in warm, himid weather.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it work just as well, it is considerably cheaper than Urban Decay&#x27;s version -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried transferring some of the product to an old smaller container (of the same product) and it still doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>

            <li> It does help a for a little bit, but after an hour or so, it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got this based on the hype, but it did not do what it said it would :-(</li>

            <li> Long story short the company that sells this emailed me asking that if I had any problems that I let them know so they could fix them before I wrote my review.  I did email them about some issues I had but the only email I received back from them was the same email they sent me in the first place asking me to alert them of any issues before writing my review.  This was the email I sent them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have an issue with the way it was packaged.  I ordered multiple finishing sprays from other places at the same time &amp; every one of them came in their own packaging box from the brand, were wrapped in plastic &amp; had the lid to the spray part shrink wrapped &amp; then was wrapped in bubble wrap.  This one did not come in its own box (which is fine if it doesn&#x27;t originally come in a box from the brand), it did not have a lid &amp; was just wrapped in bubble wrap.  Having a lid to the squirt part is important to me &amp; the fact that it was packaged the way it was makes me question the authenticity of the product itself.  I have been using the spray &amp; it seems to work well but I have to be honest that the whole experience of the way it was packaged made me question where it came from &amp; if it is in fact authentic.  Thank you so much for emailing me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a over a month since I wrote the email &amp; I have to say that I am not that impressed with this product.  The weather has gotten much warmer &amp; humid where I live so I have really gotten to test it in cold, dry weather &amp; now in warm, himid weather.  I have very oily skin &amp; this was extremely drying on my skin &amp; did not do as good of a job at holding my makeup in place as other makeup setting sprays that are way cheeper like the NYX dewy &amp; matte finishing sprays.  I have heard such wonderful things about this brand but I think I need to try another type from them.  I just hope that what I purchased was authentic &amp; not tampered with in any way &amp; that I am giving a review of the actual product &amp; not an immitation.  I wish the company would have just emailed me back so that I could be reassured.</li>
            <li> refreshing, helps my makeup stay, gets rid of that powdery look, and doesn&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li> Best setting spray I&#x27;ve used! Works well as advertised and will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> I have been using Urban Decay&#x27;s version of this (also by Scandinavia) for a couple of years and found the original product by an internet search. Not only does it work just as well, it is considerably cheaper than Urban Decay&#x27;s version - a 4 ounce UD bottle costs about $32. So by buying the Skindinavia version you get twice as much for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the effectiveness - this setting spray makes my makeup last all day after spraying. My face does not look oily unless I touch it with my hands. Additionally, it works wonderful as a refresher spray if my skin is feeling a little dry. I have not used other setting sprays because I have found that I do not need to look further than this one. It works and feels wonderful on the skin. Try it - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> As good as more expensive ones I&#x27;ve used. Makeup stays fresh looking all day and night til I&#x27;m ready to take it off .</li>
            <li> I wear very little make-up but this keeps it on all day-blush and mascara.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good! I really like it! I wear it if I&#x27;m going out dancing and it holds up very well!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting to like this product as much as I do. First of all, it&#x27;s the same price as the Urban Decay setting sprays for DOUBLE the product. Also, the bottle just says &amp;#34;Makeup Finishing Spray&amp;#34; and that always worries me because not all &amp;#34;Finishing Sprays&amp;#34; are created equal. The words &amp;#34;Finishing Spray&amp;#34; don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s going to set my makeup and make it last all day but this one really does! I didn&#x27;t get the bridal one because I don&#x27;t want a super matte look so this one is GREAT for me! It makes my makeup look great and stay on all day! And the price for the size of the bottle is fantastic!</li>
            <li> A nice finishing spray that sets makeup and gives a barely perceptible luminous glow.  Easy to apply and a bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff. If you live in hot humid climates this is a must! Finally my makeup doesn&#x27;t wear off I have super oily skin after years of trial and error this is a staple for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I spritz my face in the morning and my makeup still looks great in the evening. As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s exactly the same (smell, function) as Urban Decay All-Nighter, but it costs way less.</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years after getting a small sample bottle.  I have a small spray bottle and I fill it from the larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Keeps my makeup fresh and long lasting. I typically do the T and X pattern twice. There is no odor and doesn&#x27;t make me breakout.</li>
            <li> Best setting spray ever !!!!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday after I put on my make up and it stays!  This product smells good and it overall great!!!</li>
            <li> love! works great and doesn&#x27;t make me break out or anything!</li>
            <li> This product has noticeably made my makeup stay &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; for so much longer. There no sticky feeling, and another plus is that I have SUPER sensitive skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out in a rash! Great comp to Urban Decay&amp; cheaper!</li>
            <li> I got this based on the hype, but it did not do what it said it would :-( I have dryer skin, so I have to use cream foundation... I still find my foundation (higher end) rubbing off on everything, even after I&#x27;ve applied this. It does help a for a little bit, but after an hour or so, it&#x27;s useless. Plus, it&#x27;s too dewy of a finish for me</li>
            <li> The product would be great if it would actually come out of the container. The spray pump doesn&#x27;t spray/dispense the product in fine droplets. I&#x27;ve tried transferring some of the product to an old smaller container (of the same product) and it still doesn&#x27;t come out. Defective.</li>
            <li> My makeup lasts all day with this spray (usually about 12 to 16 hours) and I live in hot, humid Florida. I used to have a lot of trouble with my makeup melting off mid-afternoon, but not anymore! It is the best finishing spray I&#x27;ve used. A little goes a long way!</li>
